JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.372 --> 00:06.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.373 --> 00:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.174 --> 00:11.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I was going to fire Comey, my
decision.

00:11.144 --> 00:15.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Conflicting
statements from
the White House add to confusion
following

00:15.615 --> 00:19.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the abrupt firing of the
director of the FBI,
James Comey.

00:19.753 --> 00:25.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: a closer look at the man
behind the
memo arguing for Comey's removal
-- what we

00:25.425 --> 00:31.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know about the deputy attorney
general, Rod
Rosenstein, and how he could
steer the Russia

00:31.097 --> 00:34.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
investigation going forward.

00:34.267 --> 00:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Making Sense of gender roles
on the job
-- why many men still avoid
work, like nursing

00:40.874 --> 00:43.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or teaching, traditionally
dominated by women.

00:43.843 --> 00:46.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETSEY STEVENSON, Former Council
of Economic
Advisers Member: There are a lot
of guys who

00:46.746 --> 00:50.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feel, either because their
friends or their
community or because of
themselves, like,

00:50.884 --> 00:55.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when they take one of these jobs
that they
are doing something girly.

00:55.455 --> 00:58.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:58.625 --> 01:01.895 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:01.928 --> 01:15.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was another
day in Washington
that generated more questions
than answers,

01:15.975 --> 01:21.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with apparently conflicting
statements coming
from the White House, fueling
the firestorm

01:21.147 --> 01:23.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
surrounding the dismissal of the
former FBI
director.

01:23.416 --> 01:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And our William Brangham begins.

01:26.886 --> 01:29.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President
Trump came out
swinging today.

01:29.856 --> 01:35.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an interview with NBC's
Lester Holt, the
president laid into James Comey,
the man he

01:35.128 --> 01:36.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fired just two days ago.

01:36.896 --> 01:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Look, he's a showboat.

01:39.899 --> 01:41.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's a grandstander.

01:41.034 --> 01:42.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The FBI has been in turmoil.

01:42.735 --> 01:43.970 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You know that.

01:44.003 --> 01:45.038 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I know that.

01:45.071 --> 01:46.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everybody knows that.

01:46.840 --> 01:47.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You take a look at the FBI a
year ago, it
was in virtual turmoil, less
than a year ago.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It hasn't recovered from that.

01:49.342 --> 01:51.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Those remarks
came as the
man who's now filling in for
Comey, acting

01:51.111 --> 01:54.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FBI Director Andrew McCabe,
painted a starkly
different picture of his former
boss.

01:54.581 --> 01:57.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Â®MD-BO /ANDREW MCCABE, Acting FBI
Director:
I hold Director Comey in the
absolute highest

01:57.450 --> 01:58.952 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
regard.

01:58.985 --> 02:03.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have the highest respect for
his considerable
abilities and his integrity.

02:03.690 --> 02:08.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it has been the greatest
privilege and
honor of my professional life to
work with

02:08.294 --> 02:10.063 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

02:10.096 --> 02:18.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I can tell you also that
Director Comey enjoyed
broad support within the FBI and
still does

02:18.872 --> 02:20.673 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to this day.

02:20.707 --> 02:24.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: McCabe spoke
at a Senate
hearing today to discuss various
global threats,

02:24.077 --> 02:28.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but Democrats spared little time
blasting
the president for his dismissal
of Comey,

02:28.381 --> 02:30.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who had been scheduled for this
same hearing.

02:30.283 --> 02:32.085 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:32.118 --> 02:35.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK WARNER (D), Virginia:
President Trump's
actions this week cost us an
opportunity to

02:35.588 --> 02:37.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get at truth, at least for
today.

02:37.924 --> 02:42.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For his part,
McCabe pledged
that the ongoing FBI
investigation into Russian

02:42.829 --> 02:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meddling in the election, and
whether Trump's
team colluded in that meddling,
will continue

02:47.700 --> 02:49.669 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no matter what.

02:49.702 --> 02:56.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW MCCABE: The work of the
men and women
of FBI continues, despite any
changes in circumstance,

02:56.309 --> 02:58.378 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
any decisions.

02:58.411 --> 03:03.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there has been no effort to
impede our
investigation to date.

03:03.082 --> 03:09.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Simply put, sir, you cannot stop
the men and
women of FBI from doing right
thing, protecting

03:09.889 --> 03:11.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the American people and
upholding the Constitution.

03:11.858 --> 03:17.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: McCabe added
he won't be
updating the president on that
Russia investigation.

03:17.830 --> 03:22.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senators pressed him about Mr.
Trump's claim
that Comey had told the
president he wasn't

03:22.936 --> 03:24.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
personally under investigation.

03:24.737 --> 03:29.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McCabe said he couldn't comment
on the specific
conversations between the two.

03:29.409 --> 03:31.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican Susan Collins of
Maine followed
up.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.246 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:33.279 --> 03:38.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS (R), Maine: Is it
standard practice
for the FBI to inform someone
that they are

03:38.685 --> 03:41.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not a target of an
investigation?

03:41.287 --> 03:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDREW MCCABE: It is not.

03:43.022 --> 03:47.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Meanwhile, in
that same
NBC interview, the president
doubled down

03:47.060 --> 03:51.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on that claim, saying Comey told
him three
times that he wasn't a target.

03:51.431 --> 03:55.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He said it once at
dinner, and
then he said it twice during
phone calls.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LESTER HOLT, NBC News: Did you
call him?

03:56.869 --> 03:58.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: In one case, I
called him.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In one case, he called me.

04:00.039 --> 04:01.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LESTER HOLT: And did you ask, am
I under investigation?

04:01.574 --> 04:03.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I actually asked
him, yes.

04:03.076 --> 04:08.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I said, if it's possible, will
you let me
know, am I under investigation?

04:08.681 --> 04:10.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said, you are not under
investigation.

04:10.850 --> 04:14.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mr. Trump also
said he had
decided to fire Comey long
before meeting

04:14.921 --> 04:19.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Attorney General Jeff
Sessions and Deputy
Attorney General Rod Rosenstein
on Monday.

04:19.859 --> 04:23.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I was going to
fire Comey, my
decision.

04:23.496 --> 04:24.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was not...

04:24.764 --> 04:25.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LESTER HOLT: You had made the
decision before
they came...

04:25.498 --> 04:26.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

04:26.499 --> 04:28.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I was going to
fire Comey.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no good time to do it,
by the way.

04:30.003 --> 04:30.970 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
They...

04:31.004 --> 04:32.672 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

04:32.705 --> 04:34.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESTER HOLT: Because, in your
letter, you
said, "I accepted their
recommendation."

04:34.540 --> 04:35.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Yes, well, they...

04:35.642 --> 04:36.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LESTER HOLT: So, you had already
made the
decision?

04:36.643 --> 04:38.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, I was going to
fire regardless.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But that
seemed to contradict
what senior White House
officials had been

04:40.580 --> 04:42.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
saying all week.

04:42.382 --> 04:47.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Press Secretary Sean Spicer,
Vice President
Mike Pence, and Deputy Press
Secretary Sarah

04:47.453 --> 04:52.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Huckabee Sanders had all
indicated that the
firing was driven largely by
concerns from

04:52.425 --> 04:53.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Justice Department.

04:53.926 --> 04:56.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But news reports had suggested
otherwise.

04:56.429 --> 05:01.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And The Washington Post reported
last night
Rosenstein threatened to resign
after the

05:01.067 --> 05:05.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House cast him as the
prime mover of
the decision to fire Comey.

05:05.538 --> 05:09.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At today's press briefing,
Sanders offered
a justification for the seeming
inconsistencies.

05:09.509 --> 05:11.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, Deputy
White House
Press Secretary: I think it's
pretty simple.

05:11.844 --> 05:15.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I haven't had a chance to have
the conversation
directly the president.

05:15.348 --> 05:19.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I have since had the
conversation with him
right before I walked on today.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he laid it out very clearly.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He had already made that
decision.

05:23.156 --> 05:27.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the recommendation that he
got from the
deputy attorney general just
further solidified

05:27.760 --> 05:29.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his decision.

05:29.529 --> 05:33.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Meanwhile,
outrage over
Comey's ouster stretched beyond
Washington.

05:33.232 --> 05:38.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Lawmakers, including New
Jersey's Tom MacArthur,
have seen vocal opposition at
town hall meetings

05:38.438 --> 05:39.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the president's action.

05:39.806 --> 05:42.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: We need an independent
prosecutor.

05:42.342 --> 05:48.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need a bipartisan select
committee to investigate
this.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When are you going to open your
eyes?

05:49.716 --> 05:50.683 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We all see this.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.452 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM MACARTHUR (R), NEW JERSEY:
And I hear
you, but there are loads of
other people who

05:54.320 --> 05:56.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
don't see it that way.

05:56.122 --> 06:01.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Despite those
calls, there
have been few signs so far that
a special

06:01.060 --> 06:02.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
counsel will be named.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

06:04.497 --> 06:08.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we get more
now from the
White House and from Capitol
Hill from our

06:08.868 --> 06:11.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
own John Yang and Lisa
Desjardins.

06:11.437 --> 06:13.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa, I'm going to start with
you.

06:13.272 --> 06:18.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You were at the hearing today
where James
Comey's successor, at least for
the time being,

06:18.745 --> 06:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Andrew McCabe -- we just heard a
little bit
from him, his first public
appearance, I guess,

06:23.216 --> 06:27.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what, in less than 48 hours
after this whole
thing came down.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What stood out to you from this
hearing?

06:29.322 --> 06:31.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Quite a day,
huh?

06:31.157 --> 06:35.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On his third day on the job,
Andrew McCabe
was in front of Senate
Intelligence Committee

06:35.962 --> 06:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members, and for the most part,
Judy, he was
noncontroversial.

06:39.799 --> 06:44.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when asked about his former
boss, FBI
-- James Comey, McCabe said
this.

06:44.437 --> 06:51.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He defended him as man of
integrity who McCabe
said enjoys broad support in the
FBI to this

06:51.444 --> 06:53.012 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's important because it
directly counters
what the White House has said.

06:55.715 --> 06:59.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They said that Comey was
undermining morale
at the agency.

06:59.619 --> 07:04.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Minutes after McCabe said that,
the Senate
intelligence chairman,
Republican Richard

07:04.123 --> 07:06.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Burr, came out, also defended
Comey.

07:06.726 --> 07:08.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That became a theme, Judy.

07:08.628 --> 07:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke to several Republican
senators who
today felt they had to defend
Comey's reputation

07:12.365 --> 07:15.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against attacks from the White
House.

07:15.234 --> 07:19.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, as Republicans were
doing that,
one Democratic senator on the
Intelligence

07:19.372 --> 07:24.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee, Kamala Harris of
California, came
out and said she thinks Jeff
Sessions should

07:24.310 --> 07:27.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
resign over his role in the
Comey firing.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, all of this, what does it
mean?

07:29.916 --> 07:35.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Basically, Judy, I saw the dial
move away
from the president's position
for both Republicans

07:35.321 --> 07:37.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Democrats today.

07:37.123 --> 07:42.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, meantime,
John, from the
White House, the timeline on
exactly what

07:42.628 --> 07:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened seemed to be shifting,
and the explanation
seemed to be shifting a little
bit.

07:46.966 --> 07:47.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us about that.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It didn't just seem
to shift, Judy.

07:49.702 --> 07:51.437 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It shifted.

07:51.471 --> 07:55.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They first said that this all
happened on
Tuesday, that the attorney
general and the

07:55.408 --> 07:59.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deputy attorney general came to
the president
with this recommendation, which
he accepted

07:59.645 --> 08:01.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the spot.

08:01.481 --> 08:05.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then we learned that actually
there was a
meeting on Monday at which this
was discussed.

08:06.018 --> 08:11.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then it turns out, as the
president said
in the interview and as Sarah
Huckabee Sanders

08:11.090 --> 08:15.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said in the briefing today, this
was actually
something on the president's
mind from since

08:15.228 --> 08:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last week, when he watched the
-- James Comey's
testimony on the Hill.

08:20.399 --> 08:22.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Also shifting where it came
from.

08:22.201 --> 08:26.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They originally said this was
all Rod Rosenstein
-- Rosenstein's idea.

08:26.639 --> 08:32.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the president and his
advisers acknowledge
he had made this decision before
that meeting

08:32.111 --> 08:34.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Monday.

08:34.113 --> 08:38.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa, just
quickly, interesting,
there was a Republican at the
Capitol today

08:38.150 --> 08:41.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying the president himself may
not be under
investigation.

08:41.988 --> 08:45.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes, not just
any Republican,
Republican chairman of the
Judiciary Committee,

08:45.691 --> 08:47.493 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Chuck Grassley.

08:47.527 --> 08:51.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says he met -- he wrote a
letter saying
he met with FBI Director Comey
and that Comey

08:51.831 --> 08:57.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shared with him who the targets
were of the
investigation, as per his
ranking on Judiciary

08:57.403 --> 08:59.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee.

08:59.305 --> 09:03.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Grassley said he can't
divulge who the
targets are, but, in a carefully
worded statement,

09:03.376 --> 09:09.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, Grassley said, nothing
that Comey told
him contradicts President
Trump's statement

09:09.081 --> 09:11.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that he is not under
investigation.

09:11.284 --> 09:16.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a double or triple
negative, but, essentially,
Grassley is indicating here
that, to his knowledge,

09:16.122 --> 09:18.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president is not under
investigation.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just finally,
John, what
are you hearing from the White
House about

09:21.727 --> 09:25.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether what has happened is
going to affect
the pace of this Russia
investigation?

09:25.831 --> 09:30.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, that's another
thing that's
evolved over the last couple of
days, Judy.

09:30.303 --> 09:36.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Tuesday night, Sarah Huckabee
Sanders said
there is no there there of the
Russian investigation.

09:36.275 --> 09:41.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said, it's time to move on,
clearly indicating
that the White House wanted it
closed.

09:41.747 --> 09:46.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But since then and again today,
she said any
investigation that was going on,
on Monday

09:46.819 --> 09:50.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before Comey was fired is still
going on today.

09:50.590 --> 09:55.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want the FBI to do what
they think is
proper and fit, and they say
they want this

09:55.494 --> 09:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigation to continue, but
to end as quickly
as possible.

09:59.932 --> 10:05.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I guess it
doesn't get
any more active at either place,
at the Capitol

10:05.438 --> 10:06.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or the White House.

10:06.439 --> 10:19.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you both, John Yang, Lisa
Desjardins.

10:19.752 --> 10:23.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now to what all this means
for the functioning
and the stability of the Trump
presidency.

10:23.990 --> 10:27.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We turn to man who has had a
front-row in
the White House.

10:27.860 --> 10:30.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Leon Panetta was chief of staff
for President
Bill Clinton.

10:31.030 --> 10:36.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He then went on to serve as
director of the
CIA and secretary of defense in
the Obama

10:36.068 --> 10:38.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Panetta, thank you for
talking with
us.

10:40.539 --> 10:46.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as somebody who has had a
top job, the
top job at the White House as
chief of staff,

10:46.779 --> 10:52.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as we said, at the Pentagon and
the CIA, how
do you read how this Comey
episode has unfolded?

10:52.551 --> 10:59.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEON PANETTA, Former U.S.
Secretary of Defense:
Well, it's a very confusing
picture, obviously,

10:59.058 --> 11:04.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because a number of reasons have
been presented
as to why it's happened.

11:04.964 --> 11:11.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, deep down,
there's no question
that, however it happened, and
for whatever

11:11.270 --> 11:18.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reasons it happened, that this
has undermined
the credibility of a very vital
national security

11:18.511 --> 11:22.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigation, and somehow that
credibility
has to be restored.

11:22.915 --> 11:25.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How has it
undermined that
credibility?

11:25.985 --> 11:34.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEON PANETTA: It's undermined
the credibility
because, obviously, the FBI was
investigating

11:34.260 --> 11:39.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the whole issue of Russian
interference in
our election.

11:39.398 --> 11:44.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And despite the various reasons
that have
been presented, there's no
question that the

11:44.470 --> 11:49.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president remains concerned
about that Russian
investigation.

11:49.742 --> 11:56.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And tying that concern with the
fact that
he fired the FBI director, and
in the way

11:56.682 --> 12:03.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he fired the FBI director,
clearly undermines
the credibility of the
investigation.

12:03.656 --> 12:10.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is the White House going to
continue to try
to influence the direction of
that investigation?

12:10.196 --> 12:15.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The key right now is for the
Congress, for
the Justice Department, for the
president

12:15.634 --> 12:21.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make sure they take steps to
restore the
credibility of that
investigation by appointing

12:21.707 --> 12:27.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a new director of the FBI who is
fair and
objective and credible.

12:27.079 --> 12:31.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think they should also,
frankly, give
consideration to the appointment
of a special

12:31.984 --> 12:38.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prosecutor, because the very
fact that this
president continued to ask the
FBI director

12:38.991 --> 12:43.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as to whether or not he was the
subject of
an investigation, when a
president does that,

12:43.829 --> 12:49.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it clearly is sending a signal
that the White
House is concerned about that
investigation.

12:49.869 --> 12:57.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Frankly, it has to be an
independent investigation,
and it cannot have or be
influenced by the

12:57.143 --> 12:58.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

12:59.011 --> 13:02.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you saying,
Secretary Panetta,
that there's no way the American
people can

13:02.481 --> 13:08.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have confidence in this
investigation unless
there is an outside, independent
special counsel?

13:08.220 --> 13:16.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEON PANETTA: Well, my concern
is that, when
the president himself has asked
the question

13:16.729 --> 13:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about whether or not he's the
target of an
investigation, something,
frankly, that, at

13:21.467 --> 13:28.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
least in my time, is unheard of,
that a president
would, in fact, ask if he is the
target of

13:28.574 --> 13:35.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an investigation, when the
president does
that, he clearly is sending a
signal to what

13:35.114 --> 13:41.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should be a very independent,
fair, and objective
investigation by the FBI.

13:41.187 --> 13:45.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that he's raised
that question
tells me that whoever is going
to be the next

13:45.691 --> 13:50.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FBI director, whoever that is,
will probably
get the same question from the
president at

13:50.996 --> 13:52.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some point in time.

13:52.832 --> 13:59.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just because of that fact
alone, I just
think some kind of independent
prosecutor,

13:59.038 --> 14:04.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
committee, commission, whatever
it would be,
but something that is
independent of the White

14:04.543 --> 14:09.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
House and independent of
political influence,
needs to take place in this
matter.

14:09.915 --> 14:13.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much does it
matter that
the president, that the White
House is giving

14:13.786 --> 14:16.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a different explanation for why
this happened?

14:16.155 --> 14:21.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're saying it has to do with
a fact that
they say Director Comey wasn't
running the

14:21.894 --> 14:28.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FBI well, he was -- and the way
they say he
mishandled Hillary Clinton
e-mail situation.

14:28.868 --> 14:36.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEON PANETTA: Well, again -- and
I look back
on my days as chief of staff to
the president.

14:36.809 --> 14:43.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, when a major step
like that
is going to be taken -- and,
clearly, somebody

14:43.382 --> 14:49.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
should have informed the
president that, once
you fire the FBI director, that
there's going

14:49.255 --> 14:55.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be a huge backlash because of
the investigation
that's going on -- that, in the
very least,

14:55.895 --> 15:02.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the reasons for why he's firing
him should
have been set down, so that
everybody had

15:02.201 --> 15:03.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the same talking points.

15:03.869 --> 15:06.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, clearly, that didn't happen
here.

15:06.038 --> 15:12.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the president again today
said he had
been thinking about firing
Director Comey

15:12.177 --> 15:14.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for a long period of time.

15:14.113 --> 15:19.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, whatever reasons have been
given in these
last few days has only created
greater confusion

15:19.251 --> 15:21.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about just exactly why this
happened.

15:21.854 --> 15:25.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary
Panetta, finally,
in just a few seconds,
obviously, you're a

15:25.691 --> 15:28.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrat, but I know you talk to
a lot of
Republicans.

15:28.761 --> 15:32.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much difficulty do you think
this president
is facing in his own party?

15:32.631 --> 15:40.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEON PANETTA: Well, you know, I
think, whether
you're a Republican or Democrat,
there is

15:40.372 --> 15:45.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an interest in conducting an
investigation
into this national security
issue.

15:45.978 --> 15:51.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had a foreign adversary
try to interfere
in our election.

15:51.116 --> 15:54.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a serious matter, and it
needs to be
investigated.

15:54.353 --> 15:58.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think the Republicans, as
well as the
Democrats, are interested in
putting this

15:58.691 --> 16:04.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back on a track where you have a
fair and
independent and objective
investigation that

16:04.730 --> 16:09.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
determines what happened here,
whether there
was any collusion or not with
the campaign,

16:09.335 --> 16:13.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Trump campaign, and what
should be done
to make sure it never happens
again.

16:13.839 --> 16:18.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former Secretary
of Defense,
former CIA Director, former
White House Chief

16:18.277 --> 16:20.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Staff Leon Panetta, thank you
very much.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LEON PANETTA: Thank you.

16:22.948 --> 16:28.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will get
the perspective
of two conservatives on how Mr.
Trump's recent

16:28.287 --> 16:38.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
moves have divided the
Republican Party a
little later in the program.

16:38.330 --> 16:44.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
moves have divided the
Republican Party a
little later in the program.

16:44.536 --> 16:50.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president's decision to fire
FBI Director
Comey, the various rationales
that are being

16:50.109 --> 16:55.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given, and the interview the
president gave
today to NBC are again prompting
many questions

16:56.015 --> 17:01.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the way Mr. Trump makes
decisions and
carries out his job as chief
executive.

17:01.520 --> 17:06.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A "TIME" magazine team had a
chance earlier
this week to get a look at what
life is like

17:06.658 --> 17:09.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
inside the Trump White House.

17:09.094 --> 17:13.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michael Scherer, "TIME"'s
Washington bureau
chief, was part of the group
that met with

17:13.165 --> 17:16.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president, as it turned out,
before the
Comey firing.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he joins me now.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael Scherer, welcome back to
the "NewsHour."

17:20.439 --> 17:25.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You and the "TIME" magazine
folks had an unusual
access at the White House.

17:25.811 --> 17:27.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tell us about what it was like.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHERER, "TIME": We got
there about
6:30.

17:29.481 --> 17:32.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we were invited into the
Oval Office,
where he was meeting with a
number of senior

17:32.818 --> 17:39.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
staff, signing the final orders
of the day,
and from there began an almost
three-hour,

17:39.158 --> 17:42.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two-and-a-half-hour evening, in
which he took
us to many parts of the White
House that most

17:42.761 --> 17:44.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
presidents never take the press.

17:44.630 --> 17:48.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That includes starting in his
private dining
room, which is just down the
hallway from

17:48.100 --> 17:54.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Oval Office in the West
Wing, where he
played us some DVRed clips of
that day's Senate

17:54.073 --> 17:56.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hearings with color commentary
attached.

17:56.675 --> 17:58.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then we walked down the
Colonnade.

17:58.677 --> 18:03.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he took us in his elevator
up to the residence
on the second floor of the
executive mansion

18:03.148 --> 18:05.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and toured us through the rooms
there.

18:05.050 --> 18:09.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was followed by dinner in
the Blue Room,
which is the big oval room on
the first floor

18:09.955 --> 18:11.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the residence.

18:11.056 --> 18:11.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did you take
away from
this?

18:11.957 --> 18:13.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I read the piece today.

18:13.492 --> 18:18.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you had, as you said, an
extraordinary
two-and-a-half-hours with him.

18:18.297 --> 18:22.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From the outside, this is a
presidency that's
almost bathed in controversy.

18:22.167 --> 18:25.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did you sense that kind of
tension inside?

18:25.437 --> 18:30.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHERER: There's an
enormous amount
of grievance he feels to the way
he's been

18:30.442 --> 18:31.643 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
treated.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was evident almost from
the moment
we got there.

18:33.212 --> 18:35.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was talking about how the
press has mistreated
him.

18:35.948 --> 18:39.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, he included us in
that, although
he was also very gracious and
hospitable,

18:39.485 --> 18:43.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and talking about how his
message had not
gotten out, how the good things
he had been

18:43.589 --> 18:46.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doing were not being recognized.

18:46.091 --> 18:47.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he returned to that time and
again.

18:47.326 --> 18:48.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, there was a clear
frustration.

18:48.327 --> 18:50.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, at times, he was very
emotional.

18:50.129 --> 18:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even when he was watching the
day's hearing,
he was sort of mocking the
witnesses -- and

18:55.134 --> 18:58.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
these are former federal
officials testifying
before the Senate -- because I
think he's

18:58.971 --> 19:03.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
angry at the way the American
people have
been presented the story of his
presidency.

19:03.408 --> 19:07.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you think
he wanted
to get across most to you?

19:07.179 --> 19:09.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHERER: I think he
wanted to get
that across.

19:09.314 --> 19:14.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wanted to make the case that
his presidency
is far more successful than has
been recognized.

19:14.419 --> 19:18.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was an interesting moment
where I asked
him, do you think there has been
too much

19:18.257 --> 19:20.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conflict at the White House at
some points?

19:20.592 --> 19:25.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he actually answered by
saying, I think
that may be true, and then he
said, but you

19:25.764 --> 19:28.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to understand there's so
much meanness
out there.

19:28.667 --> 19:34.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he reverted back to
name-calling
of various other television
correspondents

19:34.473 --> 19:36.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and things like that.

19:36.341 --> 19:40.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I feel like he is someone
who is trying
to adjust his own personality,
his own history,

19:40.712 --> 19:45.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his own instincts to an office
that is a very
different structure around him.

19:45.083 --> 19:50.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think he's waffling back
and forth between
the desire to lash out, to come
back over

19:50.923 --> 19:56.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the top, to confront, which has
been actually
very successful for him through
his career,

19:57.029 --> 20:00.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the realities of the White
House, which
are that the president has
enormous power,

20:00.098 --> 20:04.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but he also is enormously
limited in his power,
that there are lots of
institutions, the press,

20:04.937 --> 20:07.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the courts, the Congress, that
can constrain
him.

20:07.639 --> 20:09.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's interesting.

20:09.575 --> 20:12.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you were telling us
earlier today
that it was almost like there
were two operations

20:12.544 --> 20:14.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going on at the same time.

20:14.346 --> 20:18.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has one operation around him
to sort of
protect him, make sure he's all
right, protect

20:18.784 --> 20:23.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his brand, you said, and then,
on the other
hand, the operation to keep the
business of

20:23.088 --> 20:24.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the presidency going.

20:24.923 --> 20:30.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHERER: Yes, he is
enormously focused
on his personal reputation and
experience

20:30.329 --> 20:32.264 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in office.

20:32.297 --> 20:36.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think he spends a lot of
time watching
TV at night, seeing how things
are being digested.

20:36.068 --> 20:43.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's an incredibly erudite media
critic, which
we saw during the campaign.

20:43.208 --> 20:48.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is really separate, I
think, from
what the business of the
presidency is, which

20:48.313 --> 20:50.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is running a very large and
complicated government.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, he's involved in those
issues, too.

20:52.784 --> 20:57.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not as if he's not engaged
in the details
of, you know, getting Obamacare
repeal through

20:57.556 --> 20:59.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Congress or something like that.

20:59.491 --> 21:03.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just that I think, more
than other presidents,
he's spending a lot of time
focused on this

21:03.428 --> 21:04.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other thing.

21:04.930 --> 21:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he does have staff around
him who are
essentially personal staff.

21:08.267 --> 21:12.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not staff that are
plugged into the
hierarchy of a traditional White
House.

21:12.638 --> 21:16.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not reporting directly
to the chief
of staff, and they help him with
that.

21:16.174 --> 21:19.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And any inkling
-- of course,
this was Monday, before we knew
about the

21:19.511 --> 21:23.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
firing of FBI director -- any
inkling something
like that was coming down?

21:23.982 --> 21:27.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHERER: There was no
discussion of
the FBI director, Comey.

21:27.953 --> 21:34.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The only inkling was, he
returned several
times to his frustration about
the press not

21:34.960 --> 21:40.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reporting that his wiretapping
tweet of a
few weeks ago saying that Barack
Obama wiretapped

21:40.299 --> 21:45.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me in Trump Tower, he still
believes, he still
argues, was true, even though
Director Comey

21:45.737 --> 21:48.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
testified that there was no
evidence...

21:48.040 --> 21:49.007 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:49.041 --> 21:50.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That he was
wiretapped.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He argues that that...

21:51.043 --> 21:52.244 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:52.277 --> 21:53.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MICHAEL SCHERER: And his
argument is a little
complicated.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is saying wiretapping is in
quotes.

21:55.013 --> 21:58.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It includes any unmasking by any
officials
of anyone in my campaign, which
may have happened.

21:58.984 --> 22:04.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said he believes that, if
an official
was unmasked in a foreign
intelligence tap,

22:04.156 --> 22:06.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that would count as wiretapping.

22:06.124 --> 22:12.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a stretch, but his anger at
-- his feeling
of being wronged by the way
that's been discussed,

22:12.097 --> 22:16.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I think that includes what
the FBI director
said before Congress, was very
apparent.

22:17.002 --> 22:23.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Scherer,
"TIME" magazine,
fascinating.

22:23.108 --> 22:28.080 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHERER: Thank you.

22:28.113 --> 22:33.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

22:33.151 --> 22:37.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Until this week, much of the
country had never
heard of Rod Rosenstein.

22:37.255 --> 22:41.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's been thrust into the
spotlight following
the firing of James Comey.

22:41.493 --> 22:46.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late today, leaders of the
Senate issued an
unusual invitation to invite him
to meet with

22:46.665 --> 22:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all 100 senators.

22:49.034 --> 22:53.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Margaret Warner brings us up to
speed on the
man charged with overseeing the
investigation

22:53.372 --> 22:57.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into Russia's interference in
last year's
presidential election.

22:57.342 --> 23:02.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The author of
the fateful
James Comey memo appeared on
Capitol Hill

23:02.447 --> 23:04.216 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

23:04.249 --> 23:08.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Deputy Attorney General Rod
Rosenstein met
with the top Republican and
Democrat on the

23:08.754 --> 23:10.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Senate Intelligence Committee.

23:10.188 --> 23:14.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Afterwards, they said Comey's
firing wasn't
discussed.

23:14.359 --> 23:17.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Democratic Vice Chair Mark
Warner remained
skeptical.

23:17.763 --> 23:19.598 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

23:19.631 --> 23:22.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK WARNER (D), Virginia: I
think it was
a productive session, but I
still have concerns

23:22.634 --> 23:30.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about Mr. Rosenstein in terms of
his role
in the Comey departure.

23:30.876 --> 23:35.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Rosenstein has
said privately
he didn't initiate Comey's
firing.

23:35.614 --> 23:40.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, there are now nearly as
many questions
for the Justice Department's
number two as

23:40.619 --> 23:45.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there are for the ousted FBI
director himself.

23:45.056 --> 23:48.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rosenstein graduated Harvard Law
School in
1989.

23:48.160 --> 23:52.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 1997, he became an assistant
U.S. attorney
in Maryland.

23:52.864 --> 23:58.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In 2005, President Bush
appointed him the
state's top federal prosecutor,
a post he

23:58.270 --> 24:00.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
held until this year.

24:00.505 --> 24:04.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In January, President Trump
nominated him
for deputy attorney general.

24:04.543 --> 24:08.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At his hearing, senators of both
parties praised
him.

24:08.413 --> 24:10.315 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

24:10.348 --> 24:13.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY (R), Iowa: I
know of no reason
to question his judgment, his
integrity, or

24:13.251 --> 24:14.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his impartiality.

24:14.252 --> 24:16.021 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

24:16.054 --> 24:19.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARDIN (D), Maryland: Rod
Rosenstein has
demonstrated throughout his long
career the

24:19.157 --> 24:21.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
highest standards of
professionalism.

24:21.393 --> 24:26.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The Judiciary
Committee also
received dozens of letters
supporting his

24:26.231 --> 24:28.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nomination.

24:28.166 --> 24:34.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One signed by more than 120
former U.S. attorneys
said Rosenstein -- quote --
"epitomizes the

24:34.506 --> 24:36.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ideal Department of Justice
lawyer."

24:36.608 --> 24:39.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was confirmed 94-6.

24:39.778 --> 24:44.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One no vote, Connecticut
Democrat Richard
Blumenthal, who said he'd use
every possible

24:45.016 --> 24:50.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tool to block any nominee for
the position,
unless there was a special
counsel assigned

24:50.088 --> 24:53.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the Russia investigation.

24:53.058 --> 24:58.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Attorney General Jeff Sessions
recused himself
from the Russia probe in March,
so when Rosenstein

24:58.363 --> 25:02.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was sworn in two weeks ago, that
authority
fell to him.

25:02.934 --> 25:05.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

25:05.437 --> 25:10.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now let's
take a closer
look at what lies ahead for that
Russia investigation.

25:10.141 --> 25:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham is back with
that.

25:11.943 --> 25:15.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Comey's firing
has sparked
accusations that the president
is trying to

25:15.347 --> 25:20.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
derail the Russia investigation,
or at least
exert more control over its
direction.

25:20.318 --> 25:23.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, where does that
investigation go from
here?

25:23.522 --> 25:26.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Frank Montoya Jr. spent 26 years
in the FBI.

25:26.725 --> 25:30.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He oversaw national security and
counterintelligence
probes.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he joins us from Salt Lake
City.

25:32.297 --> 25:36.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Amy Jeffress worked on
national security
investigations as counselor to
former Attorney

25:36.902 --> 25:41.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
General Eric Holder and at the
U.S. Attorney's
Office in Washington, D.C.

25:41.740 --> 25:43.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

25:43.241 --> 25:44.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Frank Montoya, I would like to
start with
you.

25:44.543 --> 25:48.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have been talking with a lot
of FBI agents.

25:48.780 --> 25:51.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Give us a sense of how they are
responding
to Comey's firing.

25:51.716 --> 25:55.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANK MONTOYA JR., Former FBI
Official: You
have heard a lot of descriptions
already in

25:55.387 --> 25:58.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terms of being stunned or
gut-punched.

25:58.924 --> 26:03.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are, I think, are apropos
of the sense
of -- or the feeling that's in
the organization

26:03.929 --> 26:06.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right now, that it really did
come out of
the blue.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're struggling with it.

26:08.266 --> 26:11.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at the same time, they're
all professionals
at what they do.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They know how to put the mission
first.

26:13.872 --> 26:15.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they will continue to move
forward.

26:15.674 --> 26:19.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do any of the
agents that
you have spoken with believe
that the firing

26:19.277 --> 26:20.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was justified?

26:20.278 --> 26:21.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRANK MONTOYA: Absolutely not.

26:21.846 --> 26:23.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was, again, out of the
blue.

26:23.715 --> 26:28.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was one of those things
where, even amongst
those few critics in the
organization, the

26:28.219 --> 26:34.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
independence of the FBI -- and
Jim Comey represented
that well -- the independence of
the FBI is

26:34.759 --> 26:36.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
utmost in their minds.

26:36.561 --> 26:39.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the only way that they feel
like they
can go forward and do the work
that they do.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Amy Jeffress,
I will turn
to you.

26:41.866 --> 26:43.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What was your reaction to
Comey's firing?

26:43.768 --> 26:47.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY JEFFRESS, Former Justice
Department Official:
I absolutely agree with what
Frank just said

26:47.238 --> 26:53.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what Andy McCabe testified
to in Congress
today, which is that my
perception is that

26:53.745 --> 26:57.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Director Comey did have the
confidence of
the agency.

26:57.682 --> 27:02.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And certainly the actions he
took last summer
and in the fall were
controversial, and many

27:02.787 --> 27:07.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people can criticize certain
aspects of what
he did, but I don't think anyone
can say that

27:07.525 --> 27:11.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he wasn't independent or that he
wasn't trying
to do what he perceived as the
right thing

27:11.763 --> 27:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the -- at every step of the
investigation.

27:15.567 --> 27:21.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my sense is that the agents
really felt
like he was supportive of them
and that he

27:21.039 --> 27:25.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would have their back and that
he wanted to
let them do their jobs
professionally and

27:25.944 --> 27:26.911 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
independently.

27:26.945 --> 27:30.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I think morale is not good.

27:31.016 --> 27:33.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Agents are disappointed at his
firing.

27:33.318 --> 27:36.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I also agree with Frank that
the agents
will continue to do their jobs
as best they

27:36.788 --> 27:38.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can, because that's their
tradition.

27:38.690 --> 27:44.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Amy, what did
you make of
Deputy Attorney General Rod
Rosenstein's letter

27:44.129 --> 27:49.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that catalogued a whole slew of
criticisms
of Comey's handling of the
Hillary Clinton

27:49.734 --> 27:51.503 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation?

27:51.536 --> 27:56.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY JEFFRESS: Well, the letter
contained some
criticisms that I think many
people would

27:56.775 --> 27:58.476 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agree with.

27:58.510 --> 28:05.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, on the other hand, I didn't
see it as
any real justification for
Director Comey's

28:05.583 --> 28:07.452 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
firing.

28:07.485 --> 28:11.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think that that
firing was handled
in a way that any career
Department of Justice

28:11.723 --> 28:15.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prosecutor, which Rod Rosenstein
is, would
have liked to see it handled.

28:15.794 --> 28:18.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It just -- it didn't go
according to the process
that should have been followed.

28:18.863 --> 28:19.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I'm going to
ask you...

28:19.864 --> 28:20.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

28:20.965 --> 28:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANK MONTOYA: I agree on that
one, by the
way.

28:21.833 --> 28:22.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would like to interject there.

28:22.834 --> 28:25.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, this was really about
independence.

28:25.303 --> 28:29.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's where the rubber
meets the road
on this and what is causing us a
lot of concern

28:29.708 --> 28:31.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right now within the FBI.

28:31.476 --> 28:36.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Frank,
sticking with you
then, what does this mean for
the ongoing

28:36.181 --> 28:37.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Russia investigation?

28:37.582 --> 28:41.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, there has got to be a
new head of
the FBI put into place.

28:41.219 --> 28:44.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does this firing and the
subsequent events
mean for that probe?

28:44.923 --> 28:47.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANK MONTOYA: Well, Andy McCabe
put it very
succinctly today.

28:48.026 --> 28:49.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It will move forward.

28:49.260 --> 28:52.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The men and the women of the FBI
will do the
right thing.

28:52.197 --> 28:54.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They will continue in their
mission.

28:54.432 --> 28:59.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that includes investigating
the interference,
Russian interference, into our
democracy and

28:59.571 --> 29:01.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all things associated with that.

29:01.906 --> 29:05.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a lot of determination
to get to
the bottom of this.

29:05.410 --> 29:10.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was unfortunate that Jim is
not going to
be at the head of this
investigation anymore,

29:10.115 --> 29:14.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they will continue to do
what it is they
have sworn an oath to do, and
that is to pursue

29:14.853 --> 29:17.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this and other investigations to
the full
extent.

29:17.455 --> 29:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Amy Jeffress,
I don't know
if you heard this, but Leon
Panetta was just

29:20.592 --> 29:25.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
telling Judy Woodruff that he
thinks that
this firing and the way that it
was handled

29:25.930 --> 29:30.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
just has undermined the
credibility of the
probe and that any subsequent
FBI head is

29:31.002 --> 29:33.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to face similar pressures
from the White
House.

29:33.805 --> 29:38.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's arguing, in essence,
that a special
counsel, a special prosecutor is
what's needed

29:38.676 --> 29:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to really get this thing done.

29:40.378 --> 29:45.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMY JEFFRESS: They have
certainly strengthened
the arguments for a special
counsel.

29:45.416 --> 29:47.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I absolutely agree with that.

29:47.285 --> 29:52.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wouldn't have said that that
was necessary
before the events of the last
two days, but

29:52.924 --> 29:57.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that firing Director
Comey made that
argument much stronger.

29:57.896 --> 30:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And Frank
Montoya, would
you agree with that as well,
that this -- I

30:01.299 --> 30:07.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean, yes, the attorney general,
the deputy
in the FBI said today he thinks,
internally,

30:07.372 --> 30:08.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it can go forward.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But many other people argue
someone from the
outside has to do this.

30:11.910 --> 30:14.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRANK MONTOYA: Well, it will go
forward internally.

30:14.179 --> 30:18.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the question now is,
there's so much
of this that is public, and so
we're talking

30:18.750 --> 30:23.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about not public trust in the
FBI, but in
the integrity of the
investigation.

30:23.955 --> 30:27.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think that that is
where the argument
is going now.

30:27.458 --> 30:34.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would also add that, if there
is a special
counselor -- prosecutor picked
or selected,

30:34.399 --> 30:38.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it would be FBI special
agents who would
be conducting the investigation
for him.

30:38.603 --> 30:43.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Amy, what do
you make of
the idea that, if there is a new
FBI director

30:43.575 --> 30:48.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who is put into place, but that
the political
entanglements just can't really
be undone,

30:48.980 --> 30:50.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the pressures are going to
be too great?

30:50.915 --> 30:55.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY JEFFRESS: Well, it's going
to be very
difficult for whoever takes that
position.

30:55.486 --> 31:02.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I also worry that we are
focusing perhaps
too much and perhaps we have
overly high hopes

31:02.794 --> 31:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the FBI investigation and
the Department
of Justice investigation,
because what they're

31:08.700 --> 31:12.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing is a counterintelligence
investigation.

31:12.237 --> 31:17.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The purpose of it is to really
advise the
intelligence community about
what happens

31:17.141 --> 31:23.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what can we do to prevent
this from happening
again, what did the Russians do,
what techniques

31:23.181 --> 31:28.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did they use, how do we block
them from attacking
our democracy in this way in the
future?

31:29.020 --> 31:33.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so a lot of what they do is
going to remain
classified.

31:33.258 --> 31:37.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not going to be issuing
a public report
at the end of the day telling
the American

31:37.328 --> 31:38.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people, here's what happened.

31:38.696 --> 31:39.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We want to explain it to you.

31:39.998 --> 31:43.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's really not what the
Department of Justice
does.

31:43.401 --> 31:48.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why I think there is a
very good reason
for Congress to continue with
its investigation,

31:48.339 --> 31:52.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because I think they will have a
greater role
in doing that, in reporting to
the public

31:52.543 --> 31:53.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about what happened.

31:53.711 --> 31:55.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the public needs
that at this
point.

31:55.647 --> 31:58.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Amy
Jeffress,
Frank Montoya Jr., thank you
both very much

31:58.983 --> 32:00.652 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for being here.

32:00.685 --> 32:05.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRANK MONTOYA: Appreciate it.

32:05.690 --> 32:10.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY JEFFRESS: Thank you.

32:10.595 --> 32:18.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we try to
explore how President
Trump's firing of Comey has
divided Republicans

32:18.536 --> 32:20.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with Steve Deace.

32:20.138 --> 32:24.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a popular conservative
radio talk show
host in Iowa.

32:24.409 --> 32:27.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And David Avella, he's chairman
of GOPAC.

32:27.111 --> 32:32.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a Republican political
action committee
devoted to both national and
state races for

32:32.517 --> 32:33.484 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
office.

32:33.518 --> 32:35.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And welcome to both of you to
the program.

32:35.119 --> 32:36.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID AVELLA, Chairman, GOPAC:
Thank you.

32:36.287 --> 32:38.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Avella, I'm
going to
start with you.

32:38.122 --> 32:41.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's your assessment of the
president's
decision to fire James Comey and
how he handled

32:41.759 --> 32:42.860 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

32:42.894 --> 32:44.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID AVELLA: The president
didn't have a
choice.

32:44.162 --> 32:47.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a term in the military
called combat
ineffective.

32:47.532 --> 32:53.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And James Comey had become
combat ineffective,
that the -- he had become a
political punching

32:53.671 --> 32:54.872 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bag.

32:54.906 --> 32:57.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, gosh, for most Americans,
it was causing
whiplash.

32:57.575 --> 33:00.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One day, Republicans were for
him, and one
day, they were against him.

33:00.178 --> 33:04.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One day, Democrats were for him,
one day,
Democrats were against him based
off what

33:04.983 --> 33:08.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was saying in any given press
account that
he did.

33:08.319 --> 33:11.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secondly -- and there were
plenty of media
stories about this last fall --
about how

33:11.889 --> 33:17.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FBI agents and the bureaucracy
at the FBI
didn't trust him any longer
about the way

33:17.161 --> 33:19.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he was handling the
investigations.

33:19.263 --> 33:23.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he had become ineffective
inside the
building, and he was a political
punching

33:23.634 --> 33:25.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bag outside the building.

33:25.203 --> 33:26.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president didn't have a
choice.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He had to get rid of him.

33:28.473 --> 33:32.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let's keep in mind the FBI
director serves
at the will and pleasure of the
president.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
When you don't have the
president's confidence
anymore, you're gone.

33:35.113 --> 33:38.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steve Deace, how
do you see
-- what's your assessment of the
president's

33:38.750 --> 33:40.518 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
move?

33:40.551 --> 33:42.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE DEACE, Radio Talk Show
Host: Well, I
agree with David's analysis of
why this had

33:42.720 --> 33:44.422 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be done.

33:44.455 --> 33:48.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was hilarious watching John
Podesta at
5:00 on Tuesday talk about what
a terrible

33:48.726 --> 33:53.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person -- I'm sorry -- at 11:00
on Tuesday
talk about what a terrible
person Comey was,

33:53.131 --> 33:57.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then, at 5:00, suddenly,
this was Watergate
and Comey shouldn't be fired.

33:57.201 --> 34:02.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I agree with David's
analysis of the hypocrisy
here, but the execution and how
this was done

34:02.707 --> 34:05.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
undermines the White House's own
cause, Judy.

34:05.143 --> 34:10.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even if you buy into what --
to wild conspiracy
theories, and even if you agree
that most

34:10.381 --> 34:14.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the media is liberal -- and I
do -- and
would like the see Trump fail,
he can't play

34:14.485 --> 34:15.453 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into that.

34:15.486 --> 34:17.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he does this systematically.

34:17.355 --> 34:21.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't have Sarah Huckabee on
day two of
her tryout essentially to
replace Sean Spicer

34:21.959 --> 34:24.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
contradicting everything she
said on day one.

34:24.462 --> 34:29.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You can't have the vice
president seven times
yesterday say that they got rid
of Comey on

34:29.033 --> 34:32.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a recommendation from the deputy
A.G., and
then have the president go off
and do his

34:32.904 --> 34:35.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own interview with Lester Holt
where he said,
I was going to get rid of him
irregardless.

34:35.673 --> 34:39.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, they have to understand,
even if they
believe everyone is against
them, that you

34:39.911 --> 34:43.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have to understand the
environment you are
in, and you have to plan
accordingly.

34:43.714 --> 34:45.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They often don't.

34:45.116 --> 34:48.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they often help to feed
these narratives
that work against them.

34:48.086 --> 34:51.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Avella,
what about Steve
Deace's point that the way the
White House

34:51.289 --> 34:53.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has handled this is what is
hurting them?

34:53.491 --> 34:58.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID AVELLA: It may not be the
way human
resource manuals 101 suggest
handling things.

34:58.763 --> 35:04.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the best way a president can
see how he's
doing is based off midterm
election.

35:04.836 --> 35:10.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And next year, voters are not
going to the
polls to cast their votes based
on James Comey

35:10.208 --> 35:12.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
getting fired or not fired.

35:12.043 --> 35:16.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to base their vote
on, are there
more jobs, have we been kept
safe, the two

35:16.514 --> 35:18.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reasons why President Trump was
elected in
the first place?

35:18.783 --> 35:20.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about this
Russia investigation,
though, David Avella?

35:21.018 --> 35:27.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID AVELLA: Judy, I defy any
member of the
media or any Democrat to find 10
voters who

35:27.225 --> 35:32.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were influenced and impacted by
the alleged
information about -- from Russia
that they

35:32.430 --> 35:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
received last year during the
election, and
the first nine can be liars and
say they did.

35:36.501 --> 35:40.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're not going to find 10
people who were
influenced by what they heard
last year about

35:40.471 --> 35:41.906 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hillary Clinton.

35:41.939 --> 35:46.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was mid-40s in her approval
rating in
January before the election.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's where she was on Election
Day.

35:48.746 --> 35:51.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Voters' opinions of Hillary
Clinton didn't
change through the election.

35:51.048 --> 35:55.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Be that as it
may, Steve Deace,
what about the credibility of
that investigation?

35:55.253 --> 35:57.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much does that matter to
this president?

35:57.421 --> 36:03.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE DEACE: Well, I think the
last election
proved really that I don't know
how much Trump's

36:03.294 --> 36:07.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
credibility really matters to
most voters
that would even consider voting
for him, especially

36:07.765 --> 36:12.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last year, Judy, when the proxy
for the other
side was maybe the most
dishonest politician

36:12.470 --> 36:13.437 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of her era.

36:13.471 --> 36:16.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And for Trump, I think it comes
down to this.

36:16.474 --> 36:18.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everything David said there is
right.

36:18.342 --> 36:23.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you get to a point where the
lack of execution
gets in the way of you actually
delivering

36:23.114 --> 36:24.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on your promises.

36:25.016 --> 36:28.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And right now, they're trying to
ram through
a health care fix that doesn't
repeal Obamacare,

36:28.786 --> 36:31.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that 26 percent of Americans
like.

36:31.155 --> 36:34.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not sure what the tax
reform proposal
is going to look like.

36:34.825 --> 36:38.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have got to actually get to
doing the
things they promised the
American people they

36:38.663 --> 36:40.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would do.

36:40.498 --> 36:43.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they do those things, then,
as the people
showed in the 1990s, when we
went after Bill

36:43.501 --> 36:47.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton, if the economy is
great, I have got
jobs, and my wages are doing
well, then I

36:47.838 --> 36:49.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really don't care what your
character is.

36:49.941 --> 36:53.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if things aren't going well,
then suddenly
I care, and I care a lot.

36:53.978 --> 36:56.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this White House needs to
actually start
governing.

36:56.280 --> 36:59.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Judy, I will just give you
one quick
example before we went on the
air, Trump trolling

36:59.450 --> 37:02.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rudy -- or trolling Rosie on
Twitter.

37:02.220 --> 37:06.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's funny when the economy is
growing at
4 and 5 percent.

37:06.157 --> 37:08.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's petulant and immature when
it's not.

37:08.226 --> 37:13.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have got to govern, and
just stop the
consistent trolling and reality
show and actually

37:13.798 --> 37:14.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
govern the country, Judy.

37:14.932 --> 37:16.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Talking about
Rosie O'Donnell.

37:16.767 --> 37:19.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Avella, respond to what he
said.

37:19.637 --> 37:24.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, I want to ask both of
you, as we
wrap this up, what's going to
determine whether

37:24.141 --> 37:30.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the White House gets back on an
even keel
in the short-term or whether
things just continue

37:30.248 --> 37:32.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to -- seem to be in turmoil?

37:32.283 --> 37:36.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID AVELLA: In this
environment, it's hard
to define what even keel will
mean.

37:36.921 --> 37:41.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there will always be --
there's very strong
feelings about this president on
both sides.

37:41.892 --> 37:46.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what are they going to judge
his legacy
on or his presidency on?

37:46.330 --> 37:47.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are we getting results?

37:47.832 --> 37:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are there going to be more jobs?

37:49.634 --> 37:53.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, look, there is much
discussion even amongst
-- and Steve mentioned it --
even amongst

37:53.504 --> 37:55.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conservatives, oh, we're not
doing enough.

37:55.473 --> 37:58.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're a few months into this
administration.

37:58.042 --> 38:02.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there are plenty of
examples, particularly
at the state level, where GOPAC
focuses, where

38:03.014 --> 38:07.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe a Republican governor and
a legislature,
when they first enact something,
it starts

38:07.652 --> 38:12.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out unpopular, but then when
people start
seeing the actual positive
results, those

38:12.456 --> 38:15.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
governors, those legislatures
are reelected
overwhelmingly.

38:15.126 --> 38:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if President Trump delivers
on the positive
things that he talked about,
more jobs saved

38:21.999 --> 38:23.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for Americans, he's going to be
reelected.

38:23.801 --> 38:26.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're saying
it doesn't
matter about the Comey -- the
Comey incident

38:26.037 --> 38:27.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
won't matter in the end.

38:27.038 --> 38:28.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID AVELLA: It doesn't.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steve Deace,
what's going to
determine whether things
stabilize, seem to

38:31.275 --> 38:35.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get back on track, or remain --
I would use
the same word -- in turmoil?

38:35.446 --> 38:39.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE DEACE: Judy, when I used
to do sports
talk radio, what I would find is
that if the

38:40.017 --> 38:44.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
team's quarterback ran afoul of
the law, but
he had played well in his last
game, most

38:44.655 --> 38:48.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fans didn't care, but if he had
played poorly
in his last game, suddenly, they
wanted him

38:48.592 --> 38:51.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disciplined and the program
needs to stand
for something bigger.

38:51.629 --> 38:53.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think that also applies here.

38:53.564 --> 38:57.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he governs well, if they get
results, then
I think most people will say,
that's just

38:57.635 --> 39:00.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump being Trump, and, frankly,
he -- a lot
of the same that people don't
like him, I

39:00.871 --> 39:02.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
don't like either.

39:02.673 --> 39:06.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if this is the substitute
for governing,
if this is what they do instead
of getting

39:06.310 --> 39:10.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
results, if they have nothing
else other than
this reality show, then I think,
in November

39:10.681 --> 39:16.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 2018, you will see that
rubber band snap
back, and it will do so with
extreme prejudice.

39:16.053 --> 39:22.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steve Deace, talk
show host
joining us from Iowa, David
Avella from GOPAC

39:22.526 --> 39:25.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here in Washington, gentlemen,
thank you very
much.

39:25.730 --> 39:30.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID AVELLA: Thank you.

39:30.201 --> 39:35.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVE DEACE: Thank you, Judy.

39:35.840 --> 39:41.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: President
Trump signed a pair of executive
orders addressing

39:41.979 --> 39:44.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
two of his key priorities.

39:44.348 --> 39:47.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One aims to strengthen the
federal government's
cuber-security.

39:47.752 --> 39:52.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House Homeland Security
Adviser Tom
Bossert said that will help
protect the nation's

39:52.256 --> 39:54.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
critical infrastructure from
attacks.

39:54.492 --> 39:57.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TOM BOSSERT, White House
Homeland Security
Adviser: The trend is going in
the wrong direction

39:57.461 --> 40:01.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in cyberspace, and it's time to
stop that
trend and reverse it on behalf
of the American

40:01.265 --> 40:03.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

40:03.033 --> 40:07.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen increasing attacks
from allies,
adversaries, primarily
nation-states, but

40:07.438 --> 40:11.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also non-nation-state actors,
and sitting
by and doing nothing is no
longer an option.

40:11.542 --> 40:15.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump's
second executive
order established a bipartisan
commission

40:15.780 --> 40:21.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to review claims of voter fraud
in the U.S.
Mr. Trump has alleged, without
evidence, that

40:21.452 --> 40:27.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three to five million people
voted illegally
in the 2016 presidential
election.

40:27.658 --> 40:33.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city of New Orleans today
removed a statue
of the president of the
Confederacy, Jefferson

40:33.164 --> 40:34.532 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Davis.

40:34.565 --> 40:37.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's the second of four
Confederate monuments
slated to come down.

40:37.468 --> 40:43.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the dark, wee hours of the
morning, workers
wearing bulletproof vests and
helmets removed

40:43.307 --> 40:48.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the statue from where it stood
since 1911,
as protesters cheered.

40:48.779 --> 40:53.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was no advance public
notice of the
operation, due to threats of
violence against

40:53.651 --> 40:55.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the removal crews.

40:55.486 --> 41:01.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's word that the Trump
administration
is considering an expansion to a
ban on laptops

41:01.392 --> 41:05.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the cabins of all U.S.-bound
air flights
from Europe.

41:05.196 --> 41:10.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ban was initially imposed in
March to
cover 10 airports in the Middle
East, North

41:10.668 --> 41:12.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Africa and Turkey.

41:12.536 --> 41:17.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It was put in place over
concerns that a concealed
bomb could be installed in
laptops and in

41:17.842 --> 41:20.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
other large electronic devices.

41:20.911 --> 41:25.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In India, 24 people died
overnight when a
wall collapsed during a wedding
celebration;

41:25.683 --> 41:27.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
28 others were injured.

41:27.852 --> 41:30.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It happened in a town south of
New Delhi.

41:30.287 --> 41:36.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 80-foot wall gave out during
a powerful
dust storm, trapping guests
inside the wedding

41:36.227 --> 41:38.128 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hall.

41:38.162 --> 41:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the latest in a string of
building collapses
in India, largely due to shoddy
construction.

41:42.967 --> 41:50.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Young people with the HIV virus
now have a
near normal life expectancy,
thanks to improvements

41:50.140 --> 41:52.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in antiretroviral therapy.

41:52.076 --> 41:58.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's according to a new study
published
in "The Lancet HIV" medical
journal.

41:58.115 --> 42:05.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It found young HIV-positive
adults are living
a decade longer than they did 20
years ago.

42:05.122 --> 42:10.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Researchers attribute that
progress to new
and less toxic drugs and better
screening

42:10.427 --> 42:12.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and prevention.

42:12.196 --> 42:16.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The U.S. Senate has
overwhelmingly confirmed
Robert Lighthizer to be the next
U.S. trade

42:16.600 --> 42:18.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
representative.

42:18.469 --> 42:22.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will play a critical role in
renegotiating
the North American Free Trade
Agreement, among

42:22.540 --> 42:24.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other things.

42:24.208 --> 42:29.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lighthizer served as deputy U.S.
trade representative
in the Reagan administration.

42:29.146 --> 42:33.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And stocks fell on Wall Street
today, dragged
down by losses in the retail
sector.

42:34.018 --> 42:39.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 23 points
to close at 20919.

42:39.423 --> 42:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 13, and the S&amp;P
500 slipped
five.

42:49.466 --> 42:55.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 13, and the S&amp;P
500 slipped
five.

42:55.806 --> 43:02.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We turn now to an overlooked
story: why some
men are not pursuing certain
types of jobs

43:02.112 --> 43:04.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that are mainly held by women.

43:04.381 --> 43:07.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
has the story.

43:07.251 --> 43:13.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of our weekly series
Making Sense,
which airs every Thursday on the
"NewsHour."

43:13.324 --> 43:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Out back of their
classroom in
Columbia, South Carolina, 4- and
5-year-olds

43:22.366 --> 43:30.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are building a fortress with
their teacher,
Mr. Jamie Browder.

43:30.808 --> 43:36.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Browder is that rare bird: a man
in a woman's
world of work, an early
childhood teacher

43:36.080 --> 43:42.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a profession that's been a
measly 2 to
5 percent male for years, is
desperately looking

43:42.152 --> 43:44.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to up the percentage.

43:44.421 --> 43:52.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, so many male jobs in
industry have
gone poof, 5.7 million since
2000 in manufacturing

43:52.396 --> 43:59.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
alone, that de-industrialization
has become
a stock explanation for Rust
Belt resentment,

43:59.036 --> 44:00.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even the election of President
Trump.

44:00.771 --> 44:04.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I agree with the fact
that Americans
should be America first.

44:04.441 --> 44:07.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: And I think Americans
should have first
opportunity on jobs.

44:07.778 --> 44:13.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And, in fact, the
share of working
men ages 25 to 54 has fallen
dramatically

44:13.584 --> 44:19.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since 1957, fully 12 percent
having dropped
out of the work force entirely.

44:19.323 --> 44:22.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, why aren't there more Jamie
Browders?

44:22.693 --> 44:28.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Betsey Stevenson has a wry
answer: Manly men
don't want to do girly jobs.

44:28.866 --> 44:30.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETSEY STEVENSON, Former Council
of Economic
Advisers Member: So, if you look
over the

44:30.668 --> 44:35.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last 20 years, we have lost five
million jobs
in manufacturing and gained nine
million jobs

44:35.506 --> 44:38.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in education and health
services.

44:38.042 --> 44:41.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're more than making up for
the jobs
we're losing, but the
characteristics of those

44:41.912 --> 44:47.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jobs, the identity associated
with a worker
who holds one of those jobs, the
pay associated

44:47.651 --> 44:49.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with those jobs are different.

44:49.420 --> 44:52.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Different by
cultural stigma.

44:52.256 --> 44:57.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's true of jobs in home
health care,
nursing, and early childhood
education, like

44:57.394 --> 45:01.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the job Jamie Browder has had
and loved for
13 years.

45:01.165 --> 45:06.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I asked him, why don't more
men go into
this profession?

45:06.904 --> 45:12.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE BROWDER, Teacher: I think
it's a lack
of information, a lack of
understanding how

45:12.776 --> 45:20.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can contribute to the
children's lives,
a lack of understanding what you
mean to a

45:20.150 --> 45:22.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
community.

45:22.052 --> 45:26.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, men see jobs
like grade school
teaching as low status, low
upward mobility.

45:26.223 --> 45:30.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE BROWDER: It's almost like,
if you enter
the classroom, this is where you
will be,

45:30.994 --> 45:32.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and this is where you will spend
the rest
of your life.

45:32.830 --> 45:34.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: You're stuck.

45:34.198 --> 45:38.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE BROWDER: You're stuck, and
this is the
set, scheduled pay.

45:38.268 --> 45:44.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you will only be able to move
yourself
up through additional education,
which requires

45:44.742 --> 45:49.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money, and then also by just
each additional
year.

45:49.713 --> 45:53.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, you can't have
a fantasy
about striking it rich, you
mean?

45:53.617 --> 45:55.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMIE BROWDER: No, no, no.

45:55.052 --> 45:58.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that's almost
somewhat anti-American.

45:58.522 --> 46:03.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Professor
Stevenson's answer
is more gender-specific.

46:03.093 --> 46:12.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETSEY STEVENSON: I think they
feel stigmatized,
like they're going in to do
girls' work.

46:12.269 --> 46:13.270 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
These are jobs.

46:13.303 --> 46:15.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're good jobs.

46:15.072 --> 46:20.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at the same time, we need to
recognize
that there are a lot of guys who
feel, either

46:20.377 --> 46:23.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because their friends or their
community or
because of themselves, like,
when they take

46:23.480 --> 46:27.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of these jobs that they are
doing something
girly.

46:27.718 --> 46:30.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that feeling is a barrier
for them.

46:31.021 --> 46:34.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: S.O., you know what
that says?

46:34.124 --> 46:35.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHILD: So.

46:35.626 --> 46:37.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Excellent.

46:37.861 --> 46:39.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Terrific reading there.

46:39.429 --> 46:41.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, not all men feel this way.

46:41.799 --> 46:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I once taught kindergarten.

46:43.467 --> 46:47.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Jamie Browder obviously
wasn't hindered
by the girly work stigma.

46:47.738 --> 46:52.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in fact, says Browder,
being a man is
a key asset for fellow teachers.

46:52.543 --> 46:56.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE BROWDER: Because I think
you offer a
different perspective.

46:56.079 --> 47:01.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want to see what a man
would say, because
there's a lack of men in that
particular school,

47:01.718 --> 47:03.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
say, our school right here.

47:03.053 --> 47:04.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, how do you see this?

47:04.788 --> 47:06.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What should I do in these
situations?

47:06.456 --> 47:11.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: A different
perspective, what
diversity so often brings to the
table.

47:11.094 --> 47:16.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also, as a male in the
classroom, Browder
gets to be a gender role model
for boys at

47:17.000 --> 47:18.802 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a formative age.

47:18.836 --> 47:21.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE BROWDER: Very few times I
can remember
when there was actually a female
student brought

47:21.905 --> 47:24.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to me and said, they need a role
model.

47:24.208 --> 47:27.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But, with Browder,
it's a regular
occurrence.

47:27.377 --> 47:32.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, shouldn't more men do as
Browder does
and buck the stereotype?

47:32.950 --> 47:34.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Economist Nancy Folbre isn't so
sure.

47:34.818 --> 47:37.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY FOLBRE, University of
Massachusetts:
That question makes it sound too
simple, as

47:37.454 --> 47:42.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
though, if guys could just get
over their
social norm obsession, they
could really go

47:43.026 --> 47:46.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out there and get a good job and
make the
economy better.

47:46.196 --> 47:48.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that's a kind of
silly proposition.

47:48.465 --> 47:53.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Look, says labor
economist Teresa
Ghilarducci, the stigma of
women's work has

47:53.937 --> 47:56.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a basis in reality.

47:56.039 --> 48:00.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERESA GHILARDUCCI, Labor
Economist: Female-dominated
jobs are stigmatized because
they're lower-paid.

48:00.344 --> 48:07.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If we're going to attack
patriarchy and stigma
of women vs. men, then we should
attack it

48:07.985 --> 48:15.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on an economic basis, and use
that old fashioned
idea of comparable worth, bring
up jobs that

48:15.192 --> 48:21.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women have to the same level of
the equivalent
jobs or comparable jobs that men
have.

48:21.164 --> 48:25.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, like the rest
of us, Browder
wouldn't turn down a raise, but
he says:

48:25.502 --> 48:29.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE BROWDER: I think there's
an underestimation
of the pay.

48:29.072 --> 48:31.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: How much do you
make?

48:31.441 --> 48:32.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMIE BROWDER: Over $50,000.

48:32.442 --> 48:34.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And you have
summers off.

48:34.344 --> 48:38.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE BROWDER: And summers off,
and also take
home additional work to gain
additional income.

48:38.649 --> 48:43.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And Browder's wife
also works,
lifting them well into the top
half of American

48:43.287 --> 48:47.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
household incomes, and very
comfortably middle-class
in South Carolina.

48:47.858 --> 48:50.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, again, what's keeping men
away?

48:50.494 --> 48:54.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE BROWDER: I think it's also
helped that
I have had professional
development, done

48:54.231 --> 48:59.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tons of reading about, how do
you approach
children when they are
exhibiting challenging

48:59.603 --> 49:01.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
behavior, they are needing your
help?

49:01.905 --> 49:06.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what comes through in all of
those readings
and professional development is
to inner spaces

49:06.877 --> 49:08.412 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being calm.

49:08.445 --> 49:10.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have to be calm.

49:10.080 --> 49:12.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You will de-escalate a situation
if you remain
calm.

49:13.016 --> 49:17.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Browder's point is
that he has
loads of education compared to
most American

49:17.921 --> 49:22.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
men, barely one in three of whom
gets even
a four-year bachelor's degree.

49:22.326 --> 49:28.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE BROWDER: Are they willing
to go through
the training, you know, pay for
the education,

49:28.131 --> 49:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the continuous recertification?

49:30.167 --> 49:36.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are they ready to undertake all
of these steps
to get to this space?

49:36.506 --> 49:41.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But to Betsey
Stevenson, our
cultural definitions of gender
roles play

49:41.211 --> 49:45.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a bigger part in keeping men
away, and not
just from pre-K classrooms.

49:45.882 --> 49:49.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETSEY STEVENSON: When we think
about things
like home health care aides,
people tend to

49:50.020 --> 49:51.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think of that as a very female
job.

49:51.955 --> 50:01.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in truth, that's a job
that's about physically
lifting, moving, restraining
people.

50:01.932 --> 50:08.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those jobs require great
physical strength
that you could imagine a
different culture

50:08.705 --> 50:12.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where we said, oh, those are
jobs for men.

50:12.309 --> 50:17.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Stevenson isn't
blaming manly
men for not doing girly jobs.

50:17.614 --> 50:22.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She just wants to change the
connotations
of manly and girly, or ditch the
adjectives

50:22.452 --> 50:24.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
entirely.

50:24.721 --> 50:29.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that will take time, says
Jamie Browder,
which means we should focus on
the next generation.

50:29.659 --> 50:34.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE BROWDER: Let's look at our
young boys
and say, instead of trying to
enforce this

50:34.564 --> 50:39.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
masculinity onto them, let's
start to look
at different ways of being.

50:39.202 --> 50:43.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's look at being able to show
them and
give them opportunities to have
-- to be the

50:43.740 --> 50:45.108 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nurturers.

50:45.142 --> 50:51.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's put them in places where
they can really
take care of others.

50:51.314 --> 50:54.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's where the
work, in my opinion,
should come.

50:54.718 --> 50:58.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because the men
right now aren't
going to be going into this
profession?

50:58.922 --> 51:01.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMIE BROWDER: I don't think so.

51:01.191 --> 51:05.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because it's too
much work, too
predictable, too much
preparation?

51:05.328 --> 51:07.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMIE BROWDER: Right, not enough
mobility.

51:07.230 --> 51:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And it's not manly,
yes?

51:10.133 --> 51:15.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMIE BROWDER: I look at this as
very manly.

51:15.505 --> 51:18.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the work that men should
do.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But the stereotype
is that it
isn't.

51:20.077 --> 51:21.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMIE BROWDER: The stereotype,
yes.

51:21.645 --> 51:24.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In Columbia, South
Carolina...

51:24.648 --> 51:25.615 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sorry.

51:25.649 --> 51:26.616 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sorry.

51:26.650 --> 51:27.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm busy.

51:27.651 --> 51:28.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm working on building a castle
with bricks.

51:28.652 --> 51:30.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Talk to you later.

51:30.620 --> 51:33.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman reporting
for the "PBS NewsHour."

51:33.990 --> 51:38.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Great story.

51:38.195 --> 51:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in an upcoming Making Sense,
Paul profiles
a star second grade teacher
who's fighting

51:43.467 --> 51:53.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the manly man stereotype both
inside the classroom
and out.

51:53.510 --> 51:58.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the manly man stereotype both
inside the classroom
and out.

51:58.582 --> 52:03.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now another in our Brief But
Spectacular episodes,
where we ask interesting people
about their

52:03.186 --> 52:04.988 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
passions.

52:05.021 --> 52:09.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from artist and
poet Jess
X. Snow, who uses her art to
help her overcome

52:09.826 --> 52:11.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a speech impairment.

52:11.561 --> 52:16.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JESS X. SNOW, Artist: My
parents, they grew
up in a government in China that
had a lot

52:16.733 --> 52:18.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of censorship.

52:18.602 --> 52:25.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I was discovering art
for the first
time, I felt like there was a
door that opened

52:25.108 --> 52:31.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in my family's ancestry, and I
could be -- I
could be the first person to
tell our story

52:31.648 --> 52:33.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
without the fear of censorship.

52:33.617 --> 52:40.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I felt like me reclaiming my
voice in
the U.S. and overcoming my
stutter created

52:40.724 --> 52:52.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a doorway into being able to
share my family's
story to the public.

52:52.869 --> 52:58.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would get bullied a lot in the
classroom,
and people would finish my
sentences for me.

52:58.542 --> 53:04.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Through my art, I was able to
see myself overcoming
my stutter.

53:04.047 --> 53:09.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I found a community of poets of
color when
I was in college.

53:09.719 --> 53:17.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was the first time I
was able to
share my poetry on a stage.

53:17.460 --> 53:21.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When that happened, I just
stopped.

53:21.131 --> 53:24.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I stopped stuttering.

53:24.434 --> 53:27.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Imagination is daring to love
what is not
in front us.

53:27.404 --> 53:33.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what then is immigration, if
not imagination
given a destination?

53:33.810 --> 53:35.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Migration is magic.

53:35.245 --> 53:38.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course they're afraid of all
who possess
it.

53:38.782 --> 53:43.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of my work is inspired by
the idea that
migration is natural.

53:43.920 --> 53:49.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just think a border drawn
upon the earth's
skin is extremely unnatural.

53:49.326 --> 53:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when people's families and
lives are policed
by borders, the result is that
young immigrants

53:56.099 --> 54:00.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grow up feeling like their
identities are
divided and they have to give
up, like, their

54:00.971 --> 54:04.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
homelands, they have to give up
their connections
to their families.

54:04.975 --> 54:12.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe I will have a stutter for
my whole life,
but, regardless, I'm able to
accept it because

54:12.682 --> 54:18.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be an artist is to create a
home for yourself
in your work, regardless of how
many times

54:18.288 --> 54:23.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your identity has been split,
whether it's
by immigration or a speech
impediment.

54:24.027 --> 54:30.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Jess X. Snow, and
this is my Brief
But Spectacular take on why
migration is natural.

54:30.600 --> 54:34.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Jess, we're
cheering you
on.

54:34.304 --> 54:39.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:48.451 --> 54:50.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:50.320 --> 54:54.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening with Mark Shields and
Ramesh Ponnuru.

54:54.257 --> 55:04.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.
