THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:50.017 --> 00:51.652
WESTERN EUROPE REMAINS ON HIGH

00:51.652 --> 00:53.053
ALERT FOLLOWING THE TWIN TERROR

00:53.053 --> 00:54.588
ATTACKS IN FRANCE AND THE FOILED

00:54.588 --> 00:56.523
TERROR PLOT IN BELGIUM.

00:56.523 --> 00:57.925
IN ATHENS TODAY, AUTHORITIES

00:59.493 --> 01:01.194

01:01.194 --> 01:02.763
ON BELGIAN POLICE.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.331
IN YEMEN, WHERE THE TERROR

01:04.331 --> 01:05.666
ATTACKS AGAINST FRANCE WERE

01:05.666 --> 01:07.200
HATCHED, THE PRESIDENT'S CHIEF

01:07.200 --> 01:08.969
OF STAFF WAS KIDNAPPED BY

01:08.969 --> 01:09.836
GUNMEN.

01:09.836 --> 01:10.904
AND PROTESTS CONTINUED TODAY

01:10.904 --> 01:12.239
AROUND THE WORLD OVER CARTOON

01:12.239 --> 01:13.473
DEPICTIONS OF THE PROPHET

01:13.473 --> 01:14.074
MUHAMMED.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.809
THIS WAS THE SCENE IN NIGER IN

01:15.809 --> 01:17.177
WEST AFRICA, A FORMER FRENCH

01:17.177 --> 01:18.512
COLONY AND MAJORITY MUSLIM

01:18.512 --> 01:20.113
COUNTRY, WHERE DEMONSTRATORS SET

01:20.113 --> 01:21.648
FIRE TO CHURCHES AND LOOTED

01:21.648 --> 01:22.482
SHOPS.

01:22.482 --> 01:23.583
AT LEAST EIGHT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

01:23.583 --> 01:25.085
KILLED THERE DURING PROTESTS

01:25.085 --> 01:26.620
OVER THE PAST TWO DAYS.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.422
THOUSANDS ALSO TOOK PART IN

01:28.422 --> 01:29.823
PROTESTS TODAY IN PAKISTAN,

01:29.823 --> 01:30.991
WHERE SOME DEMONSTRATORS BURNED

01:30.991 --> 01:32.960
THE FRENCH, ISRAELI AND AMERICAN

01:32.960 --> 01:34.995
FLAGS AND HELD SIGNS DENOUNCING

01:34.995 --> 01:38.298
THE DEPICTIONS AS BLASPHEMY.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.599
>> (translated): LOOK AT THE

01:39.599 --> 01:41.368
DOUBLE STANDARDS OF THE WEST,

01:41.368 --> 01:42.636
WHERE SAYING CERTAIN THINGS

01:42.636 --> 01:44.137
ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST OR AGAINST

01:44.137 --> 01:46.206
THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND IS A CRIME.

01:46.206 --> 01:47.674
BUT WHEN BLASPHEMY IS COMMITTED

01:47.674 --> 01:49.176
AGAINST THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD,

01:49.176 --> 01:50.978
THEY SAY IT IS FREEDOM OF

01:50.978 --> 01:51.845
SPEECH.

01:51.845 --> 01:52.913
>> Sreenivasan: IN FRANCE TODAY,

01:52.913 --> 01:54.114
PRESIDENT FRANCOIS HOLLANDE

01:54.114 --> 01:55.916
SAID, QUOTING NOW, "FRANCE HAS

01:55.916 --> 01:57.317
PRINCIPLES AND VALUES, IN

01:57.317 --> 01:58.618
PARTICULAR FREEDOM OF

01:58.618 --> 01:59.519
EXPRESSION."

01:59.519 --> 02:00.454
ALL THROUGHOUT EUROPE,

02:00.454 --> 02:01.488
GOVERNMENTS ARE TIGHTENING

02:01.488 --> 02:02.389
SECURITY MEASURES.

02:02.389 --> 02:03.824
I.T.N.'S RICHARD PALLOT HAS MORE

02:03.824 --> 02:05.392
ON THE SITUATION IN BELGIUM AND

02:05.392 --> 02:07.060
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

02:07.060 --> 02:07.861
>> Reporter: AS INVESTIGATIONS

02:07.861 --> 02:08.996
CONTINUE AT THE SCENE OF

02:08.996 --> 02:10.397
THURSDAY'S SHOOTOUT, THE

02:10.397 --> 02:11.732
BELGIUM GOVERNMENT ADMIT THEY

02:11.732 --> 02:13.467
DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS PART OF A

02:13.467 --> 02:15.535
WIDER PLOT BUT THAT THE POLICE

02:15.535 --> 02:18.472
DO NEED HELP.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.040
THE BELGIUM DEFENSE MINISTER

02:20.040 --> 02:21.742
SAYING THIS WASN'T A SIMPLE

02:21.742 --> 02:23.477
DECISION, BUT IT WAS NECESSARY

02:23.477 --> 02:25.045
AT A TIME WHEN THE POLICE ARE

02:25.045 --> 02:26.646
OVERRUN FOR THE ARMY TO GET

02:26.646 --> 02:28.515
INVOLVED.

02:28.515 --> 02:30.617
IN THE U.K., PATROLS HAVE ALSO

02:30.617 --> 02:32.352
BEEN INCREASED TODAY IN MANY

02:32.352 --> 02:33.653
JEWISH AREAS.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.155
THERE REMAINS NO SPECIFIC

02:35.155 --> 02:36.656
INTELLIGENCE ABOUT ANY

02:36.656 --> 02:37.891
PARTICULAR PLOTS ON BRITISH

02:37.891 --> 02:39.559
SOIL, BUT ONE JEWISH CHARITY

02:39.559 --> 02:40.727
SAYS THEY'VE HAD AN

02:40.727 --> 02:42.462
UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF CALLS

02:42.462 --> 02:45.265
FROM THOSE WORRIED OF A REPEAT.

02:45.265 --> 02:46.199
AT THIS SYNAGOGUE IN NORTH

02:46.199 --> 02:47.234
LONDON, THERE WERE PLENTY

02:47.234 --> 02:48.835
CELEBRATING THE SABBATH, THE

02:48.835 --> 02:50.737
RELIGION'S MOST HOLY DAY, AS

02:50.737 --> 02:52.706
USUAL, BUT NOT EVERYONE IS QUITE

02:52.706 --> 02:54.474
AS CONFIDENT.

02:54.474 --> 02:56.209
>> PARENTS ARE VERY ANXIOUS.

02:56.209 --> 02:57.244
THEY'VE BEEN CALLING, AND

02:57.244 --> 02:58.412
THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:58.412 --> 03:00.414
SENDING THEIR CHILDREN ON SUNDAY

03:00.414 --> 03:01.481
MORNING TO LEARN.

03:01.481 --> 03:03.150
BUT WE'VE BEEN... WE'VE ASSURED

03:03.150 --> 03:04.384
THEM THAT WE HAVE DONE

03:04.384 --> 03:06.253
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ASSURE

03:06.253 --> 03:07.421
THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THEIR

03:07.421 --> 03:08.422
CHILDREN.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.956
>> Reporter: THE FIRST SABBATH

03:09.956 --> 03:11.725
SINCE SECURITY WAS STEPPED UP IN

03:11.725 --> 03:14.194
THE U.K. IS PASSING WITHOUT

03:14.194 --> 03:15.328
INCIDENT.

03:15.328 --> 03:16.696
BUT WITH WARNINGS AN ATTACK

03:16.696 --> 03:19.066
CANNOT BE RULED OUT, THE JEWISH

03:19.066 --> 03:21.334
COMMUNITY HERE REMAIN ON THE

03:21.334 --> 03:22.502
HIGHEST OF ALERT.

03:22.502 --> 03:25.005
RICHARD PALLOT, I.T.V. NEWS.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.039
>> Sreenivasan: FOR THE LATEST

03:26.039 --> 03:27.207
ABOUT STEPPED-UP SECURITY IN

03:27.207 --> 03:28.542
BELGIUM, WE ARE JOINED NOW VIA

03:28.542 --> 03:29.843
SKYPE FROM BRUSSELS BY MATTHEW

03:29.843 --> 03:30.277
DALTON.

03:30.277 --> 03:31.311
HE IS A REPORTER WITH THE "WALL

03:31.311 --> 03:32.112
STREET JOURNAL."

03:32.112 --> 03:33.413
SO, MATTHEW, IT'S BEEN DECADES

03:33.413 --> 03:35.115
SINCE WE SAW MILITARY ON THE

03:35.115 --> 03:36.650
STREETS OF BELGIUM.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.718
WHERE ARE THESE TROOPS AND WHY?

03:38.718 --> 03:40.220
>> WELL, THEY'RE POSITIONED

03:40.220 --> 03:41.955
THROUGHOUT THE CITY IN CERTAIN

03:41.955 --> 03:45.358
STRATEGIC PLACES-- AROUND

03:45.358 --> 03:46.526
GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS,

03:46.526 --> 03:48.195
MINISTRIES-- AND THE REASON IS

03:48.195 --> 03:49.262
BECAUSE OF THIS PLOT THAT WAS

03:49.262 --> 03:51.498
DISRUPTED ON THURSDAY EVENING.

03:51.498 --> 03:56.303
THE PLOTTERS WANTED TO KILL

03:56.303 --> 03:57.070
POLICEMEN.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.372
THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THEIR

03:59.372 --> 04:00.040
PLOT.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.908
THEY HAD POLICE UNIFORMS.

04:01.908 --> 04:02.943
THEY HAD EXPLOSIVES.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.245
THEY HAD KALISHNIKOVS.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.314
IT WAS MORE THAN 13 PEOPLE

04:07.314 --> 04:09.282
INVOLVED IN THE PLOT.

04:09.282 --> 04:11.718
IT WAS A FAIRLY SOPHISTICATED,

04:11.718 --> 04:13.353
AMBITIOUS EFFORT TO TRY AND KILL

04:13.353 --> 04:15.288
PEOPLE, KILL POLICEMEN ON THE

04:15.288 --> 04:18.291
STREET AND IN POLICE STATIONS.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.494
SO, THEY'RE NOT... THEY BELIEVE

04:20.494 --> 04:21.661
THAT THEY'VE ROUNDED UP THE

04:21.661 --> 04:23.330
PLOT... THEY'VE ROUNDED UP ALL

04:23.330 --> 04:24.698
THE PLOTTERS, BUT THIS IS MORE

04:24.698 --> 04:27.334
OF A PRECAUTIONARY EFFORT TO

04:27.334 --> 04:29.169
MAKE SURE THAT IF THEY'VE MISSED

04:29.169 --> 04:30.737
ANYBODY, THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH

04:30.737 --> 04:33.473
FIREPOWER IN PLACE TO FIGHT

04:33.473 --> 04:34.708
THEM.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.742
>> Sreenivasan: HOW IS IT

04:35.742 --> 04:36.676
AFFECTING THE MOOD ON THE

04:36.676 --> 04:38.178
STREETS TO SEE THIS MILITARY

04:38.178 --> 04:39.579
PRESENCE, TO HEAR ABOUT THESE

04:39.579 --> 04:40.814
RAIDS HAPPENING?

04:40.814 --> 04:41.748
WHAT ARE PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT,

04:41.748 --> 04:42.782
TALKING ABOUT?

04:42.782 --> 04:43.717
>> WELL, I THINK THEY'RE PRETTY

04:43.717 --> 04:45.585
SHOCKED.

04:45.585 --> 04:49.389
BELGIUM HAS A LARGE MOROCCAN

04:49.389 --> 04:51.024
MINORITY, A LARGE MUSLIM

04:51.024 --> 04:52.092
MINORITY.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.194
BRUSSELS ITSELF IS PROBABLY

04:54.194 --> 04:57.697
AROUND 25% MUSLIM.

04:57.697 --> 05:00.600
BUT THE BELGIANS HAVE LIVED WITH

05:00.600 --> 05:02.335
THIS MINORITY IN PEACE FOR A

05:02.335 --> 05:05.338
LONG TIME AND THERE HAVEN'T

05:05.338 --> 05:08.241
BEEN MAJOR PROBLEMS UNTIL

05:08.241 --> 05:10.877
RECENTLY, UNTIL THE EVENTS IN

05:10.877 --> 05:13.847
THE MIDDLE EAST HAVE REALLY

05:13.847 --> 05:16.750
INFLAMED SENTIMENT AMONG PARTS

05:16.750 --> 05:18.552
OF A MINORITY OF THE MUSLIM

05:18.552 --> 05:19.553
POPULATION.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.154
BUT NEVERTHELESS, YOU'RE STILL

05:21.154 --> 05:23.156
TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, A FEW

05:23.156 --> 05:24.291
HUNDRED PEOPLE, MAYBE MORE THAN

05:24.291 --> 05:25.292
THAT.

05:25.292 --> 05:26.393
SO, I THINK PEOPLE, GENERALLY

05:26.393 --> 05:30.197
SPEAKING, ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE

05:30.197 --> 05:33.433
IDEA OF A MULTICULTURAL STATE

05:33.433 --> 05:35.235
IN BELGIUM.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.336
THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

05:36.336 --> 05:37.070
TALKING ABOUT.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.739
THE SECURITY PRESENCE ITSELF IS

05:39.739 --> 05:41.174
NOT PERVASIVE, I WOULD SAY.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.175
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.243
NOW, BELGIUM OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO

05:43.243 --> 05:46.146
SAID THAT ABOUT 350 PEOPLE HAVE

05:46.146 --> 05:48.548
GONE FROM THERE TO FIGHT IN WARS

05:48.548 --> 05:50.450
IN IRAQ AND SYRIA, AND ABOUT 100

05:50.450 --> 05:52.586
OF THEM HAVE COME BACK.

05:52.586 --> 05:53.753
THAT'S AN ENORMOUS NUMBER.

05:53.753 --> 05:54.988
THAT'S THE HIGHEST PER-CAPITA

05:54.988 --> 05:56.022
POPULATION IN EUROPE.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.692
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.493
THERE WAS A GROUP... STARTING IN

06:00.493 --> 06:01.895
2010, THERE WAS A GROUP CALLED

06:01.895 --> 06:03.630
SHARIA FOR BELGIUM THAT WAS

06:03.630 --> 06:05.832
FORMED IN RESPONSE TO BELGIAN

06:05.832 --> 06:08.468
EFFORTS TO BAN THE FACE VAIL

06:08.468 --> 06:10.637
THAT MUSLIM WOMEN WEAR.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.772
THEN, STARTING IN ABOUT 2011,

06:12.772 --> 06:15.775
THIS GROUP OF MUSLIM

06:15.775 --> 06:17.043
FUNDAMENTALISTS YOU COULD

06:17.043 --> 06:19.246
CALL THEM, STARTED PLOTTING TO

06:19.246 --> 06:23.383
SEND THEIR MEMBERS TO SYRIA.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.385
SO, THERE ARE MORE THAN 50

06:25.385 --> 06:26.519
PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS

06:26.519 --> 06:30.924
GROUP WHO HAVE BEEN SENT TO

06:30.924 --> 06:33.059
SYRIA TO FIGHT.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.995
AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER... THAT

06:34.995 --> 06:36.296
WAS KIND OF THE BEGINNING, THE

06:36.296 --> 06:39.099
FIRST WAVE OF PEOPLE THAT LEFT

06:39.099 --> 06:40.634
FROM BELGIUM.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.169
BUT THE RECRUITMENT HAPPENED

06:43.169 --> 06:44.404
VIA THESE PEOPLE AND VIA OTHERS

06:44.404 --> 06:45.705
THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, LARGELY

06:45.705 --> 06:49.142
FACEBOOK, TWITTER, HAS DRAWN

06:49.142 --> 06:50.910
FRIENDS, SOMETIMES FAMILY

06:50.910 --> 06:53.346
MEMBERS, WIVES, CHILDREN, TO

06:53.346 --> 06:54.781
FOLLOW A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE.

06:54.781 --> 06:55.582
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

06:55.582 --> 06:56.516
MATTHEW DALTON, REPORTER FROM

06:56.516 --> 06:57.450
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL,"

06:57.450 --> 06:58.485
JOINING US LIVE ON SKYPE TODAY

06:58.485 --> 06:59.686
FROM BRUSSELS, THANKS SO MUCH.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.421
>> THANK YOU.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.489

07:02.489 --> 07:03.857
OVERSEAS, IN TACLOBAN, IN THE

07:03.857 --> 07:05.492
PHILIPPINES, POPE FRANCIS DEFIED

07:05.492 --> 07:07.127
HIGH WINDS AND A DOWNPOUR TO

07:07.127 --> 07:09.162
CELEBRATE AN OUTDOOR MASS FOR A

07:09.162 --> 07:10.397
THRONG OF WORSHIPPERS WHO

07:10.397 --> 07:13.066
SURVIVED THE 2013 TYPHOON THERE.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.934
THE STORM KILLED MORE THAN 7,000

07:14.934 --> 07:16.303
PEOPLE AND DISPLACED MILLIONS

07:16.303 --> 07:17.804
MORE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

07:17.804 --> 07:19.306
BUT A PLANNED MEETING WITH SOME

07:19.306 --> 07:20.507
OF THE SURVIVORS HAD TO BE

07:20.507 --> 07:22.108
CANCELLED BECAUSE OF ANOTHER

07:22.108 --> 07:23.877
APPROACHING TYPHOON.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.111
FIVE MEN AFFILIATED WITH THE

07:25.111 --> 07:26.413

07:26.413 --> 07:27.547

07:27.547 --> 07:29.082
LAST MONTH AT A MILITARY SCHOOL

07:29.082 --> 07:30.150
IN PAKISTAN.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.452
THE ATTACK LEFT 150 PEOPLE DEAD,

07:32.452 --> 07:33.820
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM

07:33.820 --> 07:34.454
CHILDREN.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.588
THE FIVE WERE CAPTURED BY

07:35.588 --> 07:36.956
SECURITY FORCES IN NEIGHBORING

07:36.956 --> 07:38.625
AFGHANISTAN, NEAR THE BORDER

07:38.625 --> 07:40.260
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.294
IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE

07:41.294 --> 07:42.329
SHOOTINGS, LEADERS OF THE TWO

07:42.329 --> 07:43.697
COUNTRIES PLEDGED GREATER

07:43.697 --> 07:45.432
COOPERATION IN THE FIGHT AGAINST

07:45.432 --> 07:46.666
THE INSURGENTS.

07:46.666 --> 07:47.934
AN ARREST IN CONNECTION WITH THE

07:47.934 --> 07:49.502
ABDUCTION AND APPARENT MURDER OF

07:49.502 --> 07:52.439
43 COLLEGE STUDENTS IN MEXICO.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.040
AUTHORITIES THERE SAY THEY

07:54.040 --> 07:55.208
APPREHENDED THE LEADER OF A

07:55.208 --> 07:57.243
MEXICAN ORGANIZED CRIME RING

07:57.243 --> 07:58.645
BELIEVED RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

07:58.645 --> 08:00.580
INCIDENT NEARLY FOUR MONTHS AGO.

08:00.580 --> 08:01.815
FEDERAL MEXICAN AUTHORITIES SAY

08:01.815 --> 08:03.450
LOCAL OFFICIALS WERE COOPERATING

08:03.450 --> 08:04.984
WITH THE CRIME GROUP.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.586
BURNED REMAINS OF ONLY ONE OF

08:06.586 --> 08:07.387
THE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN

08:07.387 --> 08:08.655
IDENTIFIED THUS FAR.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.589
PARENTS OF SOME OF THE MISSING

08:09.589 --> 08:10.924
STUDENTS REMAIN CONVINCED THAT

08:10.924 --> 08:12.792
THEY ARE STILL ALIVE.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.461
POLICE IN NORTH MIAMI HAVE

08:14.461 --> 08:15.995
SUSPENDED A SNIPER TRAINING

08:15.995 --> 08:17.597
PROGRAM AFTER IT WAS REVEALED

08:17.597 --> 08:19.699
THAT THEY USED OLD MUGSHOTS OF

08:19.699 --> 08:21.501
BLACK SUSPECTS DURING TARGET

08:21.501 --> 08:22.302
PRACTICE.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.570
NORTH MIAMI BEACH'S POLICE CHIEF

08:23.570 --> 08:24.804
SAYS THAT NONE OF THE

08:24.804 --> 08:26.039
DEPARTMENT'S POLICIES WERE

08:26.039 --> 08:27.407
VIOLATED AND THAT NO

08:27.407 --> 08:28.908
DISCIPLINARY ACTION WILL BE

08:28.908 --> 08:29.509
TAKEN.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.311
THE CITY SAYS PHOTOS OF WHITES,

08:31.311 --> 08:32.712
HISPANICS AND EVEN OSAMA BIN

08:32.712 --> 08:34.247
LADEN WERE ALSO USED.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.749
THE STORY CAME TO LIGHT AFTER A

08:35.749 --> 08:37.851
MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL GUARD SAW

08:37.851 --> 08:39.586
A BULLET-RIDDLED PICTURE OF HER

08:39.586 --> 08:41.554
BROTHER AT THE GUN RANGE.

08:41.554 --> 08:42.822
THERE WERE MIXED ATTITUDES

08:42.822 --> 08:43.890
TOWARD POLICE IN A NEW

08:43.890 --> 08:44.724
NATIONWIDE SURVEY.

08:44.724 --> 08:46.726
NEARLY 75% OF THOSE POLLED SAY

08:46.726 --> 08:48.528
THEY APPROVE OF THE JOB LOCAL

08:48.528 --> 08:50.196
POLICE ARE DOING, BUT NEARLY A

08:50.196 --> 08:51.231
THIRD OF AMERICANS BELIEVE

08:51.231 --> 08:53.700
POLICE "ROUTINELY LIE TO SERVE

08:53.700 --> 08:55.268
THEIR OWN INTERESTS."

08:55.268 --> 08:56.903
SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF OF

08:56.903 --> 08:58.405
AFRICAN-AMERICANS APPROVE OF THE

08:58.405 --> 08:59.806
JOB POLICE ARE DOING AND NEARLY

08:59.806 --> 09:02.308
HALF OF THEM THINK POLICE LIE.

09:02.308 --> 09:03.576
THE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED JOINTLY

09:03.576 --> 09:05.578
BY REUTERS AND THE IPSOS POLLING

09:05.578 --> 09:06.646
ORGANIZATION.

09:06.646 --> 09:08.114
IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL TODAY,

09:08.114 --> 09:09.416
HUNDREDS TURNED OUT FOR A RALLY

09:09.416 --> 09:10.950
IN SUPPORT OF POLICE.

09:10.950 --> 09:12.085
THE EVENT WAS ORGANIZED BY THE

09:12.085 --> 09:14.053
WIVES OF THREE POLICE OFFICERS.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.021
SOME OF THE DEMONSTRATORS HELD

09:15.021 --> 09:16.890
UP SIGNS SAYING "BLUE LIVES

09:16.890 --> 09:17.657
MATTER."

09:17.657 --> 09:18.691
SIMILAR EVENTS WERE HELD IN

09:18.691 --> 09:20.794
OTHER CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.295
ANOTHER NEW NATIONWIDE POLL

09:22.295 --> 09:23.530
FINDS AMERICANS INCREASINGLY

09:23.530 --> 09:24.631
CONCERNED ABOUT TERRORISM.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.666
ACCORDING TO PEW, 76% OF THE

09:26.666 --> 09:28.301
PEOPLE IT SURVEYED CALL

09:28.301 --> 09:30.737
TERRORISM "A POLICY PRIORITY"

09:30.737 --> 09:31.838
FOR THE PRESIDENT AND THE NEW

09:31.838 --> 09:32.739
CONGRESS.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.407
THAT WAS JUST BARELY AHEAD OF

09:34.407 --> 09:36.376
THE ECONOMY AS THE TOP PRIORITY.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.844
DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS, THERE

09:37.844 --> 09:39.679
HAS ALSO BEEN A BIG INCREASE IN

09:39.679 --> 09:40.547
THE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS

09:40.547 --> 09:42.015
NAMING "STRENGTHENING THE

09:42.015 --> 09:44.551
MILITARY" AS A PRIORITY.

BRITTANY MAYNARD'S DEATH LAST

10:05.205 --> 10:07.073
NOVEMBER REIGNITED THE DEBATE IN

10:07.073 --> 10:08.908
THIS COUNTRY ABOUT THE PRACTICE.

10:08.908 --> 10:10.477
ADVOCATES REFER TO IT AS DEATH

10:10.477 --> 10:12.212
WITH DIGNITY, BUT IT IS ALLOWED

10:12.212 --> 10:14.180
IN ONLY A FEW STATES AND IS

10:14.180 --> 10:15.682
OPPOSED BY MANY RELIGIOUS

10:15.682 --> 10:17.217
GROUPS, INCLUDING THE U.S.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.152
CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.887
BUT ASSISTED SUICIDE IS MUCH

10:20.887 --> 10:22.155
MORE WIDESPREAD IN THE

10:22.155 --> 10:23.923
PREDOMINANTLY CATHOLIC NATION OF

MORE THAN ONCE SHE'S TRIED TO

11:16.075 --> 11:17.911
SHOCKING, BUT IN BELGIUM

11:17.911 --> 11:19.579
EUTHANASIA IS QUITE ACCEPTED,

11:19.579 --> 11:21.014
AND IT'S NOT JUST FOR THE

CHRONICALLY DEPRESSED PATIENTS

11:23.616 --> 11:27.620

11:29.289 --> 11:32.058
CHOSEN, EVA SAYS GOODBYE TO HER

13:03.816 --> 13:05.718
END HER LIFE.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.220

WANT TO GO, BECAUSE THERE'S NO

13:42.789 --> 13:43.823
WAY BACK.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.625

14:05.244 --> 14:07.080
EUTHANASIA LAW IN THE WORLD.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.581

14:17.223 --> 14:19.025
OF BELGIANS CHOOSING EUTHANASIA

14:19.025 --> 14:21.027
HAS STEADILY RISEN EACH YEAR,

14:22.962 --> 14:25.064
WAY IN 2013.

14:25.064 --> 14:26.632
THAT'S AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT FIVE

14:26.632 --> 14:27.967
PEOPLE A DAY.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.903
IN 2014, BELGIUM MADE HEADLINES

14:30.903 --> 14:32.572
WHEN IT BECAME THE FIRST COUNTRY

14:32.572 --> 14:33.773
IN THE WORLD TO EXTEND

14:33.773 --> 14:35.575
EUTHANASIA TO TERMINALLY ILL

14:38.311 --> 14:40.413

14:42.181 --> 14:43.382
THE TERMINALLY ILL WHO CAN

14:43.382 --> 14:45.685
REQUEST EUTHANASIA.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.453
PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS, NOW

14:47.453 --> 14:48.654
CHILDREN.

14:48.654 --> 14:49.856

14:49.856 --> 14:50.990
BOUNDARIES WHEN IT COMES TO

14:50.990 --> 14:52.058
EUTHANASIA?

14:52.058 --> 14:53.259

I DON'T THINK SO.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.612
TERMINALLY ILL BUT WHO ARE

15:12.612 --> 15:14.547
COMPLETELY HOPELESS, THERE IS A

AUTONOMY.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.952

THE WAY SOCIETY, LAW AND

15:23.422 --> 15:25.491

15:33.199 --> 15:34.934
BY LAW, AFTER PERFORMING

15:34.934 --> 15:37.203
EUTHANASIA, DOCTORS MUST FILE A

15:37.203 --> 15:38.371
REPORT WITH THE COMMISSION

15:38.371 --> 15:40.606
DETAILING WHAT THEY DID AND WHY.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.841
THE COMMISSION REVIEWS THE

15:41.841 --> 15:43.509
REPORTS TO BE SURE CONDITIONS

15:43.509 --> 15:45.344
SET BY THE LAW WERE MET.

15:45.344 --> 15:47.380
IF NOT, GENICOT SAYS, IN THE

15:47.380 --> 15:49.348
WORST CASE, A DOCTOR COULD FACE

15:49.348 --> 15:51.284
HOMICIDE CHARGES.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.085
THE REPORTS MUST ALSO AFFIRM THE

15:54.887 --> 15:56.923
WAS VOLUNTARY AND THAT TWO

16:16.876 --> 16:18.578
DIE PEACEFULLY.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.479
GENICOT SAYS SOME DOCTORS CHOOSE

16:20.479 --> 16:22.048
TO DESCRIBE THAT IN AN OPTIONAL

16:22.048 --> 16:23.783
SECTION OF THE REPORT.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.284
>> VERY, VERY OFTEN, IT'S TO

16:25.284 --> 16:29.188
EXPRESS HOW SERENE, PEACEFUL AND

16:29.188 --> 16:31.290
QUICK THE PROCEDURE WAS; THAT

16:31.290 --> 16:34.126
THE PATIENT WAS GRATEFUL, SAID

16:34.126 --> 16:36.128
THANK YOU TO THE DOCTOR AND WAS

16:36.128 --> 16:37.263
SURROUNDED BY FAMILY AND

16:42.969 --> 16:44.737
PASSION FOR TRAVELING THE WORLD

16:44.737 --> 16:46.372
BUT SUFFERED FROM A LIFETIME OF

16:46.372 --> 16:48.140
SEVERE DEPRESSION.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.309
DESPITE 40 YEARS OF THERAPY WITH

16:50.309 --> 16:52.511
SEVERAL PSYCHIATRISTS AND

16:52.511 --> 16:54.380
TREATMENT WITH ANTI-DEPRESSANTS,

16:54.380 --> 16:55.815
SHE CONTINUED TO STRUGGLE WITH

16:55.815 --> 16:57.049
SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND

16:57.049 --> 16:58.351
HOPELESSNESS.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.586
DEEMED "INCURABLE," SHE WAS

17:00.586 --> 17:02.121
EUTHANIZED IN A HOSPITAL IN

BRUSSELS ON APRIL 19, 2012, THE

17:04.891 --> 17:06.225
DATE MARKED IN HER OWN

17:06.225 --> 17:07.460
CALENDAR.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.028
MOTHER AND SON WERE ESTRANGED AT

17:09.028 --> 17:10.630
THE TIME, AND MORTIER DIDN'T

17:10.630 --> 17:12.098
FIND OUT ABOUT IT UNTIL THE NEXT

17:12.098 --> 17:14.033
DAY WHEN THE HOSPITAL CALLED HIS

17:14.033 --> 17:15.868
HOME WITH THE NEWS.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.470
>> YEAH, IT WAS COMPLETE SHOCK.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.671
OF COURSE, I KNEW THAT MY MOTHER

17:18.671 --> 17:23.276
WAS SUFFERING MENTALLY, BUT SHE

17:23.276 --> 17:24.410
WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT

17:24.410 --> 17:25.278
HERSELF.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.412
SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE COMMITTED

17:26.412 --> 17:27.513
SUICIDE.

17:27.513 --> 17:28.414
I WENT TO TALK WITH THE

17:28.414 --> 17:30.283
PHYSICIAN WHO KILLED MY MOTHER,

17:30.283 --> 17:32.585
AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS

17:32.585 --> 17:35.021
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT MY

17:35.021 --> 17:36.088
MOTHER DIDN'T WANT TO LIVE

17:36.088 --> 17:37.290
ANYMORE.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.858
AND I TOLD HIM, "HOW CAN YOU BE

17:38.858 --> 17:39.892
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN?"

17:39.892 --> 17:41.594
>> Reporter: WHEN YOU SAID, "WHY

17:41.594 --> 17:43.496
WASN'T I CONSULTED, WHY WASN'T I

17:43.496 --> 17:44.630
INVOLVED?," WHAT WAS HIS

17:44.630 --> 17:46.132
RESPONSE TO THAT?

17:46.132 --> 17:48.100
>> HE SAID THAT MY MOTHER DIDN'T

17:48.100 --> 17:50.603
WANT THE CHILDREN TO BE

17:50.603 --> 17:53.806
CONTACTED, AND HE HAD TO FULFILL

17:53.806 --> 17:56.275
THE WISH OF THE PATIENT.

17:56.275 --> 17:59.812
"THE PSYCHIC SUFFERING HAS BEEN

17:59.812 --> 18:02.448
TOO MUCH, AND I CAN'T GO ON."

18:03.616 --> 18:05.017

HELP HIM MAKE SENSE OF HOW SHE

18:06.419 --> 18:07.486
DIED.

18:07.486 --> 18:08.888
BUT WASN'T IT HIS MOTHER'S

18:08.888 --> 18:11.524
CHOICE, AND HERS ALONE, TO MAKE?

18:11.524 --> 18:12.758
MORTIER SAYS HIS MOTHER'S

18:12.758 --> 18:14.160
DEPRESSION CAME PARTLY FROM

18:14.160 --> 18:15.127
BEING ESTRANGED FROM HER

18:15.127 --> 18:17.063
CHILDREN, SO HER DOCTORS SHOULD

18:17.063 --> 18:18.431
HAVE REACHED OUT TO HIM.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.599
AND, HE'S CONVINCED HIS MOTHER,

18:20.599 --> 18:21.701
SEVERELY DEPRESSED AND ON

18:21.701 --> 18:23.769

STATE OF MIND TO MAKE SUCH A

18:24.971 --> 18:26.305
DECISION.

18:26.305 --> 18:27.940

18:27.940 --> 18:29.275
OFFERED TO HER RATHER THAN

CLARKE SAYS, BUT INSTEAD IT

19:24.563 --> 19:26.265

19:26.265 --> 19:27.533
COMMISSION'S RELIANCE ON

19:27.533 --> 19:29.802
DOCTORS' REPORTING ALONE IS NOT

19:29.802 --> 19:32.171

CO-CHAIR GILLES GENICOT ABOUT

19:35.441 --> 19:36.542
THAT NUMBER.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.310

19:38.310 --> 19:40.413
SOUND SURPRISING, BUT THE WAY

19:40.413 --> 19:43.916
OUR LAW WORKS IS BASED ON TRUST

19:43.916 --> 19:45.985
WE GIVE TO DOCTORS BECAUSE THEY

19:52.291 --> 19:53.926
APPROPRIATELY IN THE CASE OF TOM

19:55.428 --> 19:56.695
MORTIER'S COMPLAINT TO THE

EUROPEAN COURT HAS NO LEGAL

20:40.172 --> 20:41.707
AWAY FROM DISCUSSING THEM.

20:41.707 --> 20:44.210
AS HE SEES IT, EUTHANASIA CAN BE

20:44.210 --> 20:45.644
