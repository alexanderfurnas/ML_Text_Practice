BARACK OBAMA: The U.S has the
most durable economy in the
world.

00:09.109 --> 00:12.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY CLINTON: I don't think
President Obama gets the credit
he deserves for digging us

00:12.813 --> 00:18.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of the ditch that the
republicans dropped us into.

00:18.418 --> 00:22.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We have other
countries basically sucking away
our money, sucking away our
jobs.

00:22.356 --> 00:26.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Anyone in this
country who works 40 hours a
week should not live in poverty.

00:26.126 --> 00:30.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IF you want a job in Elkhart
County, you can find a job.

00:30.030 --> 00:34.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its a good place to live for
people who need a job who are
not college-educated.

00:34.334 --> 00:37.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People tend to live paycheck to
paycheck. The foodstamps that we
get are not enough

00:37.271 --> 00:39.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to feed a family.

00:39.873 --> 00:45.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of our society thinks they
deserve something. The
Government tends to give too
much to people

00:45.646 --> 00:48.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who don't want to work. I think
we're more divided than we've
ever been and the people

00:48.982 --> 00:59.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running for office now--who in
the world are you going to vote
for?

ANNOUNCER: This is a PBS
NEWSHOUR special -- Questions
for President Obama.

01:08.101 --> 01:13.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, from the Lerner Theatre in
Elkhart, Indiana, PBS NewsHour
co-anchor, Gwen Ifill.

01:13.273 --> 01:16.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Good evening.

01:16.510 --> 01:21.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And welcome to Elkhart, Indiana,
as we sit down with President
Obama and the residents

01:21.581 --> 01:26.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this community to discuss
their concerns, look back on his
time in office and assess

01:26.386 --> 01:30.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the feverish campaign
to succeed him.

01:30.424 --> 01:36.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This marks the president's fifth
visit to the once and again RV
capital of the world

01:36.029 --> 01:41.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- a small city where the
unemployment rate hit 19.6
percent his first year in office

01:41.435 --> 01:45.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and now has dropped
to about 4 percent.

01:45.138 --> 01:49.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this White House isn't
getting any credit for that
turnaround. Residents here voted

01:49.743 --> 01:56.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Ted Cruz in this year's
primaries and Mitt Romney by two
to one in 2012. Even when

01:56.183 --> 02:00.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama won Indiana in
2008, just as the economy was
crashing, Elkhart went

02:00.854 --> 02:02.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with John McCain.

02:02.689 --> 02:05.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So what gives?

02:05.559 --> 02:09.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We've asked some of the people
who live here to join us on the
stage of the beautiful Lerner

02:09.196 --> 02:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Theatre here downtown for
an intimate conversation.

02:12.733 --> 02:25.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But first, the president of the
United States, Barack Obama.

02:25.512 --> 02:34.755 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA: Hi, Gwen.

02:34.755 --> 02:35.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

02:35.222 --> 02:34.888 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA: Thank you.

02:34.888 --> 02:35.355 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

02:35.355 --> 02:34.988 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA: Thank you.

02:34.988 --> 02:35.522 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

02:35.522 --> 02:35.489 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA: How are you?

02:35.489 --> 02:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Hi, Mr. President.

02:35.922 --> 02:35.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:
It's good to see you.

02:35.889 --> 02:36.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you.

02:36.123 --> 02:35.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Hello.

02:35.856 --> 02:36.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

02:36.356 --> 02:35.989 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA: Thank you.

02:35.989 --> 02:36.523 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

02:36.523 --> 02:37.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:
Thank you, guys.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Our residents have
been waiting faithfully,
patiently and eagerly to see you

02:39.292 --> 02:40.227 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

02:40.227 --> 02:42.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well,
I'm eager to see them.

02:42.195 --> 02:43.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is a beautiful theatre.

02:43.263 --> 02:45.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It is beautiful.

02:45.098 --> 02:49.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Which
got converted. Congratulations
on a wonderful venue.

02:49.302 --> 02:51.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IFILL: Some of them voted for
you, some of them didn't. We'll
be talking about that...

02:51.772 --> 02:52.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well,
that's what we d expect.

02:52.139 --> 02:54.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: -- in a moment.

02:54.641 --> 02:59.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I first want to ask by
talking to you a little bit
about this campaign.

02:59.312 --> 03:03.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think it means when
you hear the words let's make
America great again ?

03:03.583 --> 03:10.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I think
America is pretty great. And,
you know, it's interesting,

03:10.190 --> 03:15.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do a lot of commencement
speeches this time of year. In
fact, tomorrow, I'm going to be

03:15.429 --> 03:21.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to the Air Force Academy
to deliver a commencement for
the second time there.

03:21.268 --> 03:28.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I always remind young people
that despite all the challenges
that we face right now,

03:28.508 --> 03:34.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if you had the choice to be born
in -- in any one period of time
in -- in our history,

03:34.314 --> 03:38.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you didn't know ahead of
time whether you were going to
be rich or poor, black or

03:38.151 --> 03:44.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
white, male or female, you know,
you just had to guess on what
moment do you have a

03:44.925 --> 03:49.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
best chance of succeeding,
it actually would be now.

03:49.796 --> 03:59.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That America is the strongest
country on Earth. Its economy is
the most durable on Earth.

03:59.072 --> 04:09.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we are a -- a country
that has incredible diversity,
people are striving, working
hard,

04:09.015 --> 04:14.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
creating businesses. We've got
the best universities in the
world, the best scientists.

04:14.788 --> 04:20.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, so we've got -- we've
got some challenges and we've
just come through a very rough
stretch

04:20.260 --> 04:29.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as a consequence of the
financial crisis, but overall,
not only are we recovered from

04:29.269 --> 04:34.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the crisis that we had, but
we're well positioned to do
extraordinarily well going
forward as

04:34.841 --> 04:37.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
long as we make some
good decisions.

04:37.210 --> 04:40.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And yet, many
people, including probably some
folks in this room...

04:40.147 --> 04:41.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Yes.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: -- think the
deficits have gone up and the
jobless rate has gone up. And,

04:44.918 --> 04:48.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in fact, that their lives
have not improved.

04:48.855 --> 04:53.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How -- in fact, we have your
nominee for the -- the
presumptive nominee for the
Republican

04:53.493 --> 04:58.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party saying, Donald Trump,
saying this -- America is a
third world nation.

04:58.732 --> 05:04.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you persuade -- or I
suppose, how does your likely
Democratic successor, possible,

05:04.237 --> 05:07.107 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
persuade anybody
that's not true?

05:07.107 --> 05:10.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well,
it's important you said my
successor, because Michelle
would

05:10.744 --> 05:15.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be very upset if she thought
I was running again.

05:15.649 --> 05:21.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, you just look at the
evidence here in Elkhart. As you
mentioned in the introduction,

05:21.955 --> 05:28.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when I took office, this was the
first city I came to. And
unemployment about a month

05:28.895 --> 05:36.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after I took office, a month and
a half after I took office, was
almost 20 percent. One

05:36.436 --> 05:41.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of 10 people were behind on
their mortgage or in
foreclosure.

05:41.775 --> 05:49.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the unemployment rate is
around 4 percent. It's only
about one in 30 people who are
behind

05:49.549 --> 05:56.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on their mortgage. The RV
industry, which is, uh, central
to Elkhart, is on track to

05:56.923 --> 06:03.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
break records in terms of sales.
And so that doesn't mean that
folks aren't struggling

06:03.830 --> 06:09.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in some circumstances. And one
of the things that I've
emphasized is that there are
some

06:09.836 --> 06:14.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
long-term trends in the economy
that we have to tackle in terms
of wages not going up as

06:14.474 --> 06:20.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fast as they used to, some big
costs, like college costs or
health care costs that are

06:20.146 --> 06:24.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still a challenge, people still
worrying about retirement.

06:24.951 --> 06:32.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we're going to have to
make sure that we make some good
decisions going forward.

06:32.459 --> 06:39.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the notion that somehow
America is in decline is just
not borne out by the facts.

06:39.499 --> 06:41.001 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
That...

06:41.001 --> 06:42.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But it resonates.
It resonates among a lot of...

06:42.502 --> 06:43.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well...

06:43.970 --> 06:47.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: -- aggrieved people
who are voting in big numbers
for Donald Trump.

06:47.707 --> 06:52.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well,
look, -- I think that what it is
also -- always been true in

06:52.545 --> 07:00.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American politics is that when
we've gone through a tough time
-- and we went through

07:00.754 --> 07:04.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the worst financial crisis of
our lifetimes. I'm looking
around and I -- I think it's
safe

07:04.991 --> 07:11.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to say that it's been the worst
in -- in the lifetimes or
memories of most people here.

07:11.097 --> 07:19.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then you feel nervous. People
lost homes. People lost savings.
People were worried about

07:19.806 --> 07:25.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whether or not they
could make ends meet.

07:25.045 --> 07:32.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we're -- even though
we've recovered, people feel
like the ground under their feet

07:32.686 --> 07:38.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
isn't quite as solid. And in
those circumstances, a lot of
times it's easy for somebody to
come

07:38.491 --> 07:45.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up and say you know what, if we
deport all the immigrants and
build a wall or if we cut

07:45.932 --> 07:54.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
off trade with China, or if we
do X or Y or Z, that there's
some simple answer and suddenly

07:54.908 --> 07:57.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
everything is going to
feel secure. And...

07:57.077 --> 07:59.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Why don't -- why
don't you mention Donald Trump
by name?

07:59.612 --> 08:01.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: You
know, he seems to do a good job
mentioning his own name,

08:01.648 --> 08:02.015 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so...

08:02.015 --> 08:02.849 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

08:02.849 --> 08:04.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: --
I figure -- you know...

08:04.451 --> 08:05.752 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

08:05.752 --> 08:08.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: -- I'll
let him do his advertising for
him.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Do you consider at
all that any of the support for
him is backlash against

08:10.590 --> 08:13.093 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you personally?

08:13.093 --> 08:18.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well,
here's one thing I would say --
and I just spoke about this

08:18.598 --> 08:26.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the local high school. I
think Trump is a more colorful
character than some of the

08:26.206 --> 08:34.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
other Republican elected
officials, but a lot of the
story that he's telling is
entirely

08:34.080 --> 08:39.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
consistent with what folks have
been saying about me or the
general story they've been

08:39.552 --> 08:43.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
telling about the economy for
the last seven and a half, the
last 10, the last 20, the

08:43.723 --> 08:50.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last 30 years. And you can --
you can actually describe the
story fairly concisely, right?

08:50.697 --> 08:58.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The -- the basic story they tell
is that the problems that the
middle class working families

08:58.104 --> 09:05.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are experiencing has to do with
a big bloated government that
taxes the heck out of people

09:05.912 --> 09:13.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then gives that money to
undeserving folks, welfare
cheats or, you know, the 47
percent

09:13.953 --> 09:21.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are takers or, you know,
whatever phrase they use, that
businesses are being strangled

09:21.194 --> 09:29.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by over-regulation, that, you
know, Obamacare has killed jobs.

09:29.736 --> 09:37.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the fact of the matter is
when you look at it, the
government, as a proportion of

09:37.544 --> 09:41.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our overall economy, is actually
smaller now under my presidency
than it was under Ronald

09:41.247 --> 09:41.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Reagan...

09:41.981 --> 09:42.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Let me
read you something...

09:42.782 --> 09:43.750 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA: : -- I have...

09:43.750 --> 09:44.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: -- that Bill
Clinton said, though.

09:44.651 --> 09:45.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: But --
but let me -- let me finish,
Gwen.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We have
fewer federal employees today.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Um-hmm.

09:51.724 --> 09:58.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The --
the health care costs since I
signed Obamacare have actually

09:58.898 --> 10:02.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gone up slower than they were
before I signed it. Twenty
million more people have health

10:02.101 --> 10:04.904 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
insurance.

10:04.904 --> 10:13.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the arguments they're making
just are not borne out by the
facts. But what is true is

10:13.246 --> 10:20.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that if people are feeling
secure -- feeling insecure and
they're offered a simple reason

10:20.119 --> 10:24.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for how they can feel more
secure, people are going to be
tempted by it, particularly

10:24.591 --> 10:27.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if they're hearing that same
story over and over again.

10:27.227 --> 10:31.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Perception. So Bill
Clinton said, "Millions and
millions and millions of people

10:31.264 --> 10:34.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look at that pretty picture of
America you painted," which you
just described, "and they

10:34.334 --> 10:37.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cannot find themselves in
it to save their lives."

10:37.370 --> 10:40.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The
pretty picture that...

10:40.640 --> 10:43.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The pretty picture
of all the things that have gone
well. Why is there a

10:43.343 --> 10:47.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disconnect between -- that
he's describing here?

10:47.213 --> 10:53.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well,
look, here's what has changed in
the economy over the last

10:53.219 --> 11:03.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20 to 30 years. Right after
World War II, America was
ascendant. It was dominant
around

11:03.029 --> 11:10.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world because Europe was
blown up. Japan was digging
itself out of the rubble. China

11:10.236 --> 11:17.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was still a backwater. Eastern
Europe was behind the Iron
Curtain.

11:17.176 --> 11:20.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There wasn't much competition.
We were the only folks who were
seriously making cars

11:20.280 --> 11:26.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and trucks and appliances
and you name it.

11:26.185 --> 11:31.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had strong unionization,
which meant that workers had
leverage so that they could get

11:31.357 --> 11:42.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a good share of a growing pie.
And people saw each year and
each generation their standards

11:42.201 --> 11:46.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of living going up
pretty rapidly.

11:46.239 --> 11:52.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what started happening is
you started seeing foreign
competition. Unions started

11:52.345 --> 11:57.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting busted, so workers had
less leverage, which meant their
wages didn't go up quite

11:57.150 --> 12:04.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as fast. You started seeing the
end of defined benefit pension
plans. In terms of health

12:04.357 --> 12:06.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care programs, if you had health
care on your job, suddenly you
were paying a lot of deductibles

12:06.759 --> 12:09.996 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and premiums.

12:09.996 --> 12:14.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
College costs started going up
because the public university
system, which used to be

12:14.167 --> 12:20.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
generously funded by state
governments so that tuition was
low, suddenly state governments

12:20.039 --> 12:23.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were spending more money on
prisons than they were on
universities, which meant
tuition

12:23.743 --> 12:25.945 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
went up.

12:25.945 --> 12:31.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You add all those things
together, and people then start
feeling more stressed.

12:31.384 --> 12:38.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the answer to that is how
do we get wages up; how do we
make sure that you can save

12:38.324 --> 12:43.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for retirement; how can you make
sure that your kid can afford to
get a higher education

12:43.262 --> 12:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to compete for the jobs of the
future. And the question then is
what is actually going

12:47.367 --> 12:49.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get that done?

12:49.969 --> 12:56.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To me, if we raise the minimum
wage; if we make it easier not
harder for people to unionize;

12:56.809 --> 13:01.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if we negotiate trade deals that
raise labor standards and
environmental standards in other

13:01.247 --> 13:06.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries, instead of letting
them sell here and we can't sell
there; if we make sure that

13:06.352 --> 13:09.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're rebuilding our roads and
our bridges and our
infrastructure to put a bunch of
folks

13:09.989 --> 13:16.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in hard-hats back to work; if we
make Social Security stronger
rather than cutting it.

13:16.863 --> 13:24.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we do those things, then we
are going to see wages go up,
labor markets tighten, and

13:24.871 --> 13:31.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we will relieve a lot of the
stress that people feel. But if
you look at the arguments that

13:31.778 --> 13:36.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
are being made by the
Republicans and the actions that
have been taken by those members

13:36.015 --> 13:42.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Congress, it's hard to see
how cutting taxes for the
wealthiest Americans,
deregulating

13:42.188 --> 13:47.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wall Street again, is somehow
going to benefit middle class
families.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But let's turn to
the audience and see what they
think. We're going to open

13:50.430 --> 13:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this conversation up. I have a
lot more questions, but they do,
too. And we're going to be right

13:53.866 --> 14:10.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
back in just a moment with that.

14:10.817 --> 15:11.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(BREAK) GWEN IFILL: So Mr.
President, we are back

15:11.577 --> 15:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a few questions for you
from our invited audience here.
They are anxious to get started

15:14.447 --> 15:16.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and so am I.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're a small businessman
here in Elkhart.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILL KERCHER, Farmer: Yes, I am.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What's your name?

15:20.286 --> 15:21.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILL KERCHER: Bill Kercher.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: What's your
question for the president?

15:22.488 --> 15:27.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL KERCHER: Mr. President, I
am a fifth-generation fruit and
vegetable grower here in Elkhart

15:27.994 --> 15:31.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
County. And over the last six
years, we've seen a dramatic
increase in the number of

15:31.631 --> 15:35.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regulations that touch all
aspects of our business, from
the Food Safety Modernization

15:35.134 --> 15:38.571 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Act to Obamacare
and many others.

15:38.571 --> 15:45.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, large farms are able to
comply with these regulations
more easily, and small family

15:45.645 --> 15:51.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
farms we've seen actually
exiting the industry. At what
point are we overregulated, if
not

15:51.751 --> 15:57.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now? And how can we encourage
younger growers to either stay
or enter an industry when the

15:57.490 --> 15:59.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
barriers to entry are
higher than ever?

15:59.192 --> 16:01.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

16:01.060 --> 16:08.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well,
it's a great question. And first
of all, my administration's

16:08.367 --> 16:16.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policy has been to encourage
family farming, rather than big
agribusiness, because not

16:16.108 --> 16:24.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only is that sort of a model of
farming that built this country,
but as Michelle will tell

16:24.617 --> 16:29.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you, it actually produces food
that's better for you, as she
reminds me constantly.

16:29.522 --> 16:37.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you know, we want you to
succeed. Now, if you look at the
trend lines in terms of

16:37.029 --> 16:44.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
small family farms, the problem
generally has been actually
farms getting bought up

16:44.170 --> 16:52.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by larger agricultural
operations. It's been you guys
not always getting good prices
for

16:52.678 --> 16:55.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the products that
you put together.

16:55.748 --> 17:03.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't doubt that some elements
of the regulations I put in
place have probably put a burden

17:03.723 --> 17:10.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on you. So let's take health
care for example. It may be that
previously you weren't -- you

17:10.696 --> 17:15.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't think you were able to
provide health insurance for
your employees. The problem

17:15.534 --> 17:19.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that if they're not getting
health insurance through you,
then that means that they're

17:19.839 --> 17:27.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relying on the emergency room.
And they're relying on, you
know, taxpayers like everybody

17:27.380 --> 17:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
else to cover those costs if
they get in an accident or if
they get sick.

17:32.318 --> 17:38.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it has always been our
view that if we can put
something together where people

17:38.024 --> 17:43.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can buy health insurance through
a pool, it's subsidized if
they're not making enough money

17:43.095 --> 17:48.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to pay for their own health
insurance, that that overall is
going to be a more efficient

17:48.534 --> 17:52.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way to do it and in fact health
care inflation, the rate at
which healthcare costs have gone

17:52.672 --> 17:56.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up, for small businesses as well
as large businesses, has been
significantly slower

17:56.976 --> 18:01.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
since I passed the law
than it was beforehand.

18:01.213 --> 18:06.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, what I would say is that
there are a bunch of regulations
that have been put in

18:06.385 --> 18:12.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
place in the past that may have
been well intentioned, but
didn't work, sometimes they're

18:12.525 --> 18:17.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outdated. And so what I've told
my administration to do is to go
back and look at all the
regulations

18:17.663 --> 18:23.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are there. If there's not a
good reason for them or if
they're outdated or if we can

18:23.436 --> 18:27.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
redesign them to put less of a
burden on businesses, we should
do so.

18:27.440 --> 18:33.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not interested in regulating
just for the sake of regulating,
but there are some

18:33.312 --> 18:36.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things like making sure we've
got clean air and clean water,
making sure that folks have

18:36.749 --> 18:44.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health insurance, making sure
that worker safety is a
priority. That, I do think, is

18:44.724 --> 18:50.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of our overall obligation
as a -- as not a third world
country, but as a advanced

18:50.596 --> 18:58.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
nation to make sure that
we're doing the right thing.

18:58.304 --> 19:03.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would hope that as a
consequence of the overall
economy doing better, you've
also

19:03.376 --> 19:10.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been doing better as well. And
you know, anybody who's running
a business would rather not

19:10.616 --> 19:16.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have any regulations, just as a
general rule, and certainly, you
don't want a situation

19:16.055 --> 19:20.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where you feel like you're being
regulated and your competitor is
not. But what we try

19:20.059 --> 19:26.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do is to be very fair in
terms of looking at what
regulations make a difference.

19:26.332 --> 19:31.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If you're a really small
business of like 25 people or
less, typically you are exempted

19:31.470 --> 19:36.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from those -- a lot of the
federal regulations. If you get
to a certain size, then it's
part

19:36.909 --> 19:43.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the cost of doing business,
but what it also does is it
makes sure that we, as a
society,

19:43.315 --> 19:49.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are looking out for workers,
we're protecting our families
and people are getting decent

19:49.688 --> 19:52.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wages and they've got health
care so they're not going to the
emergency room when they

19:52.224 --> 19:53.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get sick.

19:53.959 --> 19:57.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you, Mr.
President. Thank you, Mr.
Kercher.

19:57.496 --> 20:01.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you may have been -- may have
noticed, while in this election,
Donald Trump came

20:01.901 --> 20:07.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Indiana and talked a lot
about what happened with the
Carrier Corporation and shipping

20:07.273 --> 20:09.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the jobs out of state. Here's
someone who worked for Carrier
and he has a question for

20:09.075 --> 20:10.309 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

20:10.309 --> 20:10.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ERIC COTTONHAM, Carrier
Employee: How are you doing, Mr.
President?

20:10.576 --> 20:12.244 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA: How are you?

20:12.244 --> 20:16.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC COTTONHAM: My name is Eric
Cottonham and I'm representing
the Steelworkers Union,

20:16.515 --> 20:21.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Local 1999. And I'm trying to
find out, what do we have left
far us -- all of our jobs

20:21.187 --> 20:25.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are leaving Indianapolis. I see
here you're doing a lot of
things, but in Indianapolis,

20:25.858 --> 20:30.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's nothing there for us. I
mean, what's next? I mean, what
can we look forward to

20:30.596 --> 20:33.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the future as far as jobs,
employment, whatever? Because
all of our jobs has left

20:33.732 --> 20:37.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or in the process
of leaving, sir.

20:37.136 --> 20:43.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, in
fact, we've seen more
manufacturing jobs created since

20:43.175 --> 20:50.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I've been president than anytime
since the 1990s. That's a fact.
And you know, if you

20:50.716 --> 20:56.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look at just the auto industry
as an example, they've had
record sales and they've hired

20:56.522 --> 21:04.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back more people over the last
five years than they have for a
very long, long time.

21:04.430 --> 21:13.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We actually make more stuff,
have a bigger manufacturing base
today than we've had in

21:13.205 --> 21:20.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
most of our history. The
problems have been -- part of
the problems have had to do with

21:20.880 --> 21:27.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jobs going overseas and this is
one of the reasons why I've been
trying to negotiate

21:27.720 --> 21:31.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trade deals to raise wages and
environmental standards in other
countries, so that they're

21:31.323 --> 21:35.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not undercutting us.

21:35.661 --> 21:43.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But frankly, part of it has had
to do with automation. You go
into an auto factory today

21:43.569 --> 21:49.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that used to have 10,000 people
and now they've got 1,000 people
making the same number of

21:49.608 --> 21:54.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cars or more. And -- so what
that means is even though we're
making the same amount of

21:54.413 --> 21:59.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stuff in our manufacturing
sector, we're employing fewer
people.

21:59.451 --> 22:07.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the good news is that there
are entire new industries that
are starting to pop up

22:07.927 --> 22:13.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you're actually seeing some
manufacturers coming back to the
United States because they're

22:13.532 --> 22:18.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
starting to realize, "You know
what? Energy prices are lower
here, workers are better

22:18.671 --> 22:23.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, this is our biggest
market. And so even though we
off-shored and went someplace
else

22:23.876 --> 22:30.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before, now it turns out we're
better off going ahead and
manufacturing here."

22:30.583 --> 22:38.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for those folks who have
lost their job right now because
a plant went down the Mexico,

22:38.524 --> 22:45.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that isn't going to make you
feel better. And so what we have
to do is to make sure

22:45.030 --> 22:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that folks are trained for the
jobs that are coming in now
because some of those jobs of

22:51.537 --> 22:59.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the past are just not going to
come back, and when somebody
says, like the person you

22:59.612 --> 23:04.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just mentioned who I'm not going
to advertise for, that he's
going to bring all these jobs

23:04.383 --> 23:09.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back, well how exactly are you
going to do that? What are you
going to do?

23:09.455 --> 23:14.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's -- there's no answer to
it. He just says, "Well, I'm
going to negotiate a better

23:14.260 --> 23:19.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deal." Well, how -- what -- how
exactly are you going to
negotiate that? What magic wand

23:19.999 --> 23:26.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do you have? And usually, the
answer is he doesn't have an
answer.

23:26.939 --> 23:33.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what I've tried to do, what
my administration's tried to do
is let's grow those
manufacturing

23:33.045 --> 23:41.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sectors, like clean energy, like
some of these new technologies
that are coming up, let's

23:41.620 --> 23:48.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
focus on those. We've set up,
for example, manufacturing hubs
where we work with universities,

23:48.227 --> 23:55.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
local businesses, local
governments, to create research
labs that can take something
like

23:55.467 --> 24:01.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
3-D printing or, you know,
nanotechnology -- all kinds of
stuff that I can't really

24:01.407 --> 24:05.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
explain because, you know,
scientists and really smart
people know all about it -- and

24:05.944 --> 24:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said let's invest in this so
that when the new jobs come,
they're coming here.

24:12.618 --> 24:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I've got to tell you that
the days when you just being
able to -- you just being
willing

24:18.657 --> 24:24.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to work hard and you can now
walk into a plant and suddenly
there's going to be a job for

24:24.763 --> 24:30.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you for 30 years or 40 years,
that's just not going to be
there for our kids because

24:30.135 --> 24:34.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more and more, that stuff's
going to be automated. And if
you go into a factory, that
kid's going

24:34.740 --> 24:41.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to need to know computers or is
going to need to know some
science and some math because

24:41.180 --> 24:43.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're not even going to be
picking anything up, they're
just going to be working on a

24:43.449 --> 24:45.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
keyboard.

24:45.684 --> 24:51.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why we put so much
emphasis on job training,
community colleges, that's why

24:51.156 --> 24:56.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I've proposed making the first
two years of community college
free so that we know that

24:56.895 --> 25:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every young person, they're
going to be able to -- if
they're not going for a full
four-year

25:01.200 --> 25:03.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
degree, at least they're going
to be getting the technical
training they need for those

25:03.335 --> 25:05.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
jobs in the future.

25:05.771 --> 25:10.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you cannot look backwards,
and that doesn't make folks feel
good sometimes, especially

25:10.142 --> 25:16.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if it's a town that was reliant
on a couple of big
manufacturers. But they're going
to

25:16.849 --> 25:20.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to retrain for the jobs of
the future, not the jobs of the
past.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Now, you've
mentioned education, you've
touched on education and we have
a

25:22.855 --> 25:24.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
question here about
that. What's your name?

25:24.890 --> 25:25.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VANESSA CORREDERA, English
Professor: Vanessa Corredera.

25:25.290 --> 25:26.325 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

25:26.325 --> 25:27.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
VANESSA CORREDERA:
Hi, Mr. President.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:
How are you, Vanessa?

25:30.229 --> 25:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VANESSA CORREDERA: Fine, thank
you. You've addressed the
crushing student debt,
especially

25:34.767 --> 25:40.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for higher education and you've
cited initiatives with community
colleges, the STEM disciplines

25:40.005 --> 25:44.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and technology as potential
responses. Many of my friends
and especially my students are

25:44.543 --> 25:47.579 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
still struggling
with this issue.

25:47.579 --> 25:52.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So my question for you is how do
you continue to address this
issue your final months in

25:52.518 --> 25:57.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
office? And how can you do so in
a way that perhaps includes the
humanities and liberal

25:57.923 --> 26:00.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
arts education as whole when
frankly, those are often very
much under attack?

26:00.926 --> 26:02.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:
What do you teach?

26:02.995 --> 26:05.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VANESSA CORREDERA: I teach
English at Andrews University
over in Michigan.

26:05.531 --> 26:07.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I
thought you were a student.

26:07.299 --> 26:09.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:09.268 --> 26:12.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I'm
getting old. I'm telling you.
All the teachers look like
students

26:12.070 --> 26:12.638 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

26:12.638 --> 26:14.873 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:14.873 --> 26:23.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well,
first of all, let me just say
that I have been emphasizing

26:23.615 --> 26:28.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STEM education -- that's
science, technology, engineering
and math -- not because I think

26:28.887 --> 26:36.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the humanities are unimportant,
but because we generally have
not been producing as many

26:36.595 --> 26:45.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
engineers and as many scientists
and people with those kinds of
technological skills as

26:45.103 --> 26:49.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
compared to China, for example.

26:49.241 --> 26:55.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we send a lot of people into
banking and folks like me, who
become lawyers. But the

26:55.747 --> 27:01.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
truth of the matter is that we
have to make sure that we
continue to have a strong base

27:01.286 --> 27:05.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the sciences and engineering
if we're going to remain the
most innovative economy in the

27:05.591 --> 27:09.228 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

27:09.228 --> 27:13.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as somebody who's studied
humanities himself, you know, I
think it's extremely important,

27:13.131 --> 27:16.902 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

27:16.902 --> 27:22.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The broader issue of financing
education, as I mentioned, the
reason that college is

27:22.708 --> 27:27.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so much more expensive for this
generation as it was for my
generation and even better

27:27.913 --> 27:34.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the previous generation
really had to do with government
spending. It used to be

27:34.720 --> 27:41.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that most state universities
were heavily subsidized by the
state, so they kept tuition

27:41.827 --> 27:46.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really, really low.

27:46.265 --> 27:54.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What happened, around the '80s
and '90s was state legislators
started saying we've got

27:54.473 --> 28:00.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to build more prisons. In
fairness to them, they also
started feeling more pressure
because

28:00.279 --> 28:05.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Medicaid spending, because
health care costs were going up.
And so they started cutting

28:05.317 --> 28:11.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
higher education budgets. And
they made up for it with higher
tuition.

28:11.256 --> 28:13.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why at least at
public colleges and
universities, the costs have
gone up a

28:13.625 --> 28:15.794 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lot.

28:15.794 --> 28:23.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, here's what we've done. The
first thing I did when I came
into office was we reformed

28:23.235 --> 28:28.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the student loan program because
what was happening was on
federally subsidized student

28:28.974 --> 28:34.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
loans, it was all run through
the banks. And the banks were
getting billions of dollars

28:34.079 --> 28:40.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of profits for managing these
loans to students, even though
the loans were guaranteed by the

28:40.152 --> 28:44.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
federal government so they
weren't taking any risk.

28:44.156 --> 28:49.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we said let's cut the
middleman out, let's loan
directly to students. So that
saved us

28:49.328 --> 28:53.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tends of billions of dollars.
That allowed us to expand the
Pell grant program and to

28:53.231 --> 28:59.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lower, or cap interest
on student loans.

28:59.871 --> 29:05.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But just because we did more
loans or more grants, that
doesn't always help with the

29:05.377 --> 29:12.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rising costs. And that's why
I've proposed this two-year free
college -- community college,

29:12.584 --> 29:20.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because what that does is that
allows a young person who's
strapped for cash and whose
parents,

29:20.192 --> 29:25.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, are doing everything
they can, but can only do so
much, to say I'll get my first

29:25.964 --> 29:31.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
two years for free, I'll
transfer those credits to a four
year public college or
university

29:31.269 --> 29:36.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I've now just potentially
cut the amount of loans that
I've got in half.

29:36.208 --> 29:39.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for some people who decide
they don't need a four-year
college education, they want

29:39.845 --> 29:43.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be a graphic designer, they
want to go into a trade, now
they can get the training

29:43.215 --> 29:47.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they need without
incurring any debt.

29:47.052 --> 29:52.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you know, these are all
proposals that are -- we know
work. There's some states and

29:52.658 --> 29:57.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cities that already are doing
this to -- free community
college proposal and it's
working

29:57.162 --> 30:00.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and it's really helping
to reduce costs.

30:00.432 --> 30:04.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the last thing, we're also
trying to work with the
universities just to figure out
ways

30:04.703 --> 30:10.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they can reduce costs,
using, for example, online
learning, you know, making,
putting

30:10.942 --> 30:16.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out reports so that parents and
students are better consumers,
so that they know well,

30:16.448 --> 30:19.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let me not sign up for that
four-year college where the
graduation rates are low and
it's

30:19.785 --> 30:26.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got great dorms and great gyms
and nice food, but I'm going to
be $50,000 worth of debt

30:26.491 --> 30:28.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and I may not get a job.

30:28.026 --> 30:30.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Thank
you, Mr. President.

30:30.429 --> 30:31.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Sir, your name?

30:31.596 --> 30:32.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ARVIS DAWSON, Community
Leader: Arvis Dawson.

30:32.130 --> 30:34.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And your question?

30:34.132 --> 30:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARVIS DAWSON: First of all, I
want to thank you, President,
for your service to our country.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.201 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA: Thank you, sir.

30:36.201 --> 30:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARVIS DAWSON: And, uh, despite
the polls, there's a lot of love
for you here in Elkhart.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:
Oh, I appreciate that.

30:39.304 --> 30:41.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know, I -- I actually...

30:41.039 --> 30:43.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

30:43.842 --> 30:47.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: -- one
thing is after seven and a half
years, you don't worry about

30:47.546 --> 30:48.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the polls no more.

30:48.046 --> 30:49.081 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:49.081 --> 30:49.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:
You really don't.

30:49.948 --> 30:50.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

30:50.615 --> 30:52.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:
So, it's alright.

30:52.484 --> 30:54.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARVIS DAWSON: My question to
you, Mr. President, I am a
strong believer in equal rights
for

30:54.753 --> 30:55.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everyone...

30:55.787 --> 30:57.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Yes.

30:57.222 --> 31:01.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARVIS DAWSON: A very strong
believer in that. I was
wondering, though, with all the
pressing

31:01.526 --> 31:02.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
issues that you have
before you right now...

31:02.961 --> 31:04.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Right.

31:04.396 --> 31:08.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARVIS DAWSON: -- why is the
issue of which bathroom a person
uses such an issue?

31:08.867 --> 31:12.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, I
-- you know what, it's -- it's a
great question. Uh, somehow

31:12.838 --> 31:16.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people think I made it an issue.
I didn't make it an issue. There
-- there are a lot

31:16.708 --> 31:20.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of things that are more
pressing, you're absolutely
right.

31:20.979 --> 31:30.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What happened and what continues
to happen is you have
transgender kids in schools. And

31:30.288 --> 31:37.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they get bullied. And they get
ostracized. And it's tough for
them.

31:37.462 --> 31:45.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, we're of the
generation where that stuff was
all out of sight and out of

31:45.771 --> 31:57.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mind and so people -- people
suffered silently. But now
they're out in the open. And the
question

31:57.949 --> 32:02.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then is, schools are asking us,
the Department of Education, for
guidance, how should we

32:02.053 --> 32:06.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deal with this?

32:06.525 --> 32:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my answer is that we should
deal with this issue the same
way we'd want it dealt

32:15.066 --> 32:22.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with if it was our child. And
that is to try to create an
environment of some dignity and

32:22.674 --> 32:27.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kindness for these kids.

32:27.979 --> 32:38.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's sort of the bottom
line. I have to just say what's
in my heart but I also

32:38.456 --> 32:45.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have to look at, you
know, what's the law?

32:45.096 --> 32:52.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my best interpretation of
what our laws and our
obligations are is that we
should

32:52.904 --> 32:57.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
try to accommodate these kids so
that they are not in a
vulnerable situation.

32:57.709 --> 33:03.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I understand that people,
you know, for religious beliefs
or just general discomfort

33:03.281 --> 33:07.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might disagree. And I'm not the
one who's making a big issue of
it.

33:07.452 --> 33:12.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if it -- if the school
districts around the country ask
me what do you think we should

33:12.491 --> 33:18.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do? Then what we're going to do
is tell them let's find a way to
accommodate them in a

33:18.463 --> 33:24.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way that makes sure that these
kids are not, you know, excluded
and ostracized.

33:24.736 --> 33:28.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask Mr.
Dawson whether he's satisfied
with the answer to that question

33:28.440 --> 33:31.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and what -- what is it about
this that bothers you?

33:31.309 --> 33:34.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARVIS DAWSON: Mainly, it's my
religious belief. Yes, I'm
satisfied with the answer to the

33:34.246 --> 33:35.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
question.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.681 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA: All right.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARVIS DAWSON: -- coming from the
church background that I come
from, I believe in equal rights

33:38.617 --> 33:39.284 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for all.

33:39.284 --> 33:40.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I know.

33:40.685 --> 33:43.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARVIS DAWSON: But I think, too,
wherever you were going to the
bathroom before, continue

33:43.955 --> 33:46.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go to the bathroom there. I
don't -- I don't have a problem
with that.

33:46.591 --> 33:49.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well,
but, right. And -- and the
problem is just for a lot of

33:49.694 --> 33:56.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these kids, they might not even
feel comfortable going to the
bathroom, which is a tough
situation

33:56.368 --> 34:03.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you're a kid. And -- and
look, I -- I have profound
respect for everybody's
religious

34:03.008 --> 34:09.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beliefs on this. But if you're
at a public school, the question
is, how do we just make

34:09.881 --> 34:21.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure that, uh, children are
treated with kindness. That's
all. And you know, my reading of
scripture

34:21.927 --> 34:31.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tells me that that golden rule
is pretty high up there in terms
of my Christian belief.

34:31.503 --> 34:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That doesn't mean somebody else
has to interpret it the same
way. It does mean as president

34:35.273 --> 34:40.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the United States, those are
the values that I think are
important. Now, this is going

34:40.378 --> 34:44.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be settled by the courts,
ultimately. There have been
lawsuits everywhere. I just
wanted

34:44.582 --> 34:49.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to emphasize to you, though,
this -- it's not like I woke up
one day and I said, man,

34:49.354 --> 34:52.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know what we really need to
do is let's start working on
high school bathrooms.

34:52.023 --> 34:53.658 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:53.658 --> 34:56.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: You
know, that -- I was thinking
about ISIL. And I was...

34:56.995 --> 34:59.130 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:59.130 --> 35:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: --
thinking about, you know, the
economy and I'm thinking about

35:01.700 --> 35:08.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jobs. But one of the things
that, as president, you learn is
that you don't choose the issues

35:08.974 --> 35:13.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the time. The issues come to
you. And then you have to make
your best judgment about

35:13.011 --> 35:13.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what you think is right. And...

35:13.378 --> 35:15.313 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: I...

35:15.313 --> 35:18.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: -- and
I've expressed what I think is
the best judgment that is

35:18.683 --> 35:21.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
consistent with our
traditions and our laws.

35:21.252 --> 35:23.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I have another issue
to come to you here, Mr.
President.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's your name?

35:24.556 --> 35:25.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NANCI WIRT, Interior
Decorator: Nanci Wirt

35:25.857 --> 35:28.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And what do you have
-- your question for the
president?

35:28.660 --> 35:32.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCI WIRT: Uh, Mr. President,
I, like many Americans,
politically, I'm in the center.

35:32.330 --> 35:33.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm not too right,
I'm not too left.

35:33.698 --> 35:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Right.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NANCI WIRT: So I spend a lot
of time watching the debates.

35:36.034 --> 35:37.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Right.

35:37.268 --> 35:39.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCI WIRT: Both parties, trying
to get a sense of who is my
candidate.

35:39.404 --> 35:41.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Right.

35:41.172 --> 35:44.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCI WIRT: So I watched a lot
this year. And what I came back
with at the end was I

35:44.943 --> 35:47.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
found that there was a
lot of lack of civility.

35:47.078 --> 35:49.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Yes.

35:49.047 --> 35:53.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCI WIRT: That people were
speaking -- candidates were
speaking over one another,
shouting,

35:53.551 --> 35:57.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
calling each other names. There
was a lot of inappropriate
comments. I was pretty saddened

35:57.522 --> 35:59.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by the whole situation.

35:59.924 --> 36:03.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm curious what your thoughts
are on the tone of the debates
overall.

36:03.128 --> 36:05.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Were you watching
the debates, Mr. President?

36:05.530 --> 36:07.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: You
know, I confess, I didn't.

36:07.365 --> 36:09.334 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:09.334 --> 36:15.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Um, but
-- but I -- but I'm really glad
you did. I don't watch them

36:15.240 --> 36:22.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because I'm just steeped in this
stuff, so I could probably make
all the arguments for

36:22.781 --> 36:27.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the candidates, including,
uh, the Republican side, just
because I've heard them a lot in

36:27.185 --> 36:30.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
my day-to-day work.

36:30.121 --> 36:32.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But I think it's really
important that you took the time
to do what every citizen should

36:32.490 --> 36:35.827 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
do, which is try
to get informed.

36:35.827 --> 36:45.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, this whole issue of
civility is -- you're right to
be distressed by it. Now,

36:45.336 --> 36:49.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's important not to
romanticize what politics used
to be like. You know, if

36:49.974 --> 36:57.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you read accounts of what like
Tom Jefferson said about john
Adams or what folks said about

36:57.649 --> 36:59.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lincoln, I mean they called them
monkeys, they said they were
illegitimate children,

36:59.818 --> 37:00.051 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
they...

37:00.051 --> 37:01.619 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:01.619 --> 37:04.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: -- they
said, you know, I mean they're
-- there's some rough

37:04.222 --> 37:10.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stuff. It wasn't on TV, because
they didn't have TVs. But it was
rough.

37:10.795 --> 37:19.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do think what has happened
is that some of the boundaries
that used to be there for

37:19.704 --> 37:27.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how you debated ideas have
broken down. And no offense
against Gwen, because she works

37:27.078 --> 37:28.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for PBS, which is
all about civility.

37:28.446 --> 37:29.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Absolutely.

37:29.147 --> 37:29.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: But...

37:29.280 --> 37:30.915 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:30.915 --> 37:36.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: -- but I
do think that the TV culture,
the reality culture contributes

37:36.654 --> 37:44.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to this, because what happens --
and talk radio culture. What
happens is that politicians

37:44.129 --> 37:51.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get the most attention the
more outrageous they sound.

37:51.336 --> 37:58.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so if you're civil and quiet
and polite, nobody covers you.
But if you say something

37:58.610 --> 38:12.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crazy or rude, you're all over
the news. And that has fed, I
think, this kind of -- of

38:12.757 --> 38:19.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
arms race of insult and
controversy that doesn't shine a
lot of light, even though it
generates

38:19.164 --> 38:23.668 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a lot of heat.

38:23.668 --> 38:29.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other thing that contributes
to this is, and a lot of times
we blame politicians, but

38:29.240 --> 38:36.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of it is what's happened in
terms of our voting patterns.
And there are a couple

38:36.781 --> 38:44.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of reasons for this. One is
political gerrymandering, which
is that the way district lines
are drawn

38:44.656 --> 38:51.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are -- now they use computers.
They're so precise that whoever
is in power, whether

38:51.429 --> 38:57.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's Democrats in a state or
Republicans in a state, and both
parties do this.

38:57.735 --> 39:02.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will draw these lines so
precisely that every district
they know this is going to

39:02.440 --> 39:07.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be a Republican district; this
is going to be a Democratic
district. And so out of the

39:07.345 --> 39:15.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
435 seats in the House of
Representatives, maybe 10
percent of them are actually
competitive.

39:15.987 --> 39:20.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the rest of them, no matter
what happens, are going to be
either Republican or Democrat.

39:20.625 --> 39:27.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, what happens when that
exists? It means you don't -- if
you're a Republican, you don't

39:27.599 --> 39:30.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to worry about what the
Democrats are saying. You don't
have to go to the center.

39:30.735 --> 39:39.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You just have to make sure that
the tea party Republican to your
right doesn't say something

39:39.010 --> 39:44.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more outlandish than you do.
Same thing on the left. The
Democrat is only worried about

39:44.082 --> 39:47.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what the person on the
farthest left is going to say.

39:47.885 --> 39:55.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that drives people into
opposite directions. So, the one
thing I would say is, first of

39:55.960 --> 40:05.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all, don't get discouraged. Get
out there and vote. But what I
would say is that every

40:05.570 --> 40:13.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
voter here, Democrat or
Republican, if you want more
civility, then you vote for
folks

40:13.645 --> 40:20.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are civil and who are making
arguments and using logic and
presenting evidence.

40:20.885 --> 40:25.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And not just somebody who's
popping off. And that's true
whether it's on the left or the

40:25.390 --> 40:32.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right. And if you are voting for
somebody who's just being
controversial for the sake

40:32.463 --> 40:38.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of it or helping you vent, then
you only have yourself to blame
if it turns out that the

40:38.736 --> 40:42.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
political debate starts
getting more and more crass.

40:42.707 --> 40:46.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Since we're talking
politics, Mr. President, I do
want to ask you this.

40:46.878 --> 40:51.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The primary season is almost
over. We've talked a lot about
what Republicans are and are not

40:51.516 --> 40:55.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing in this campaign. I wonder
when we can expect you to get
involved with the Democratic

40:55.286 --> 40:57.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
race? Are we going to see an
endorsement soon? Bernie
Sanders, perhaps?

40:57.422 --> 40:59.390 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:59.390 --> 41:04.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, I
-- the -- I think that there's
been a healthy debate in

41:04.829 --> 41:14.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Democratic Party. And it's
almost over. Yeah, we've got on
Tuesday you'll have some

41:14.872 --> 41:20.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big states -- California and New
Jersey, where the votes will
take place. What I've tried

41:20.678 --> 41:26.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do is to make sure that
voters, rather than me,
big-footing the situation or
deciding

41:26.250 --> 41:29.487 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the outcome.

41:29.487 --> 41:33.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we'll probably have a
pretty good sense next week of
who the nominee will end

41:33.591 --> 41:40.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up being. I think both Bernie
Sanders and Hillary Clinton are
good people. I think that

41:40.598 --> 41:48.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they broadly share the goals
that I have. There are some
tactical differences within

41:48.005 --> 41:52.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Democratic Party about
how do you get stuff done.

41:52.810 --> 41:56.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's going to be plenty
of time for me to step in and
campaign.

41:56.981 --> 42:01.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I notice you don't
mind using their names.

42:01.452 --> 42:04.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, as
I said, they're not as good at
marketing.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:05.456 --> 42:08.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We have another
question for you here.

42:08.626 --> 42:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEAN RINK, Farmer: Mr. Obama, in
regards to Obamacare, I've been
receiving my health insurance

42:14.866 --> 42:19.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through the marketplace. And the
first year, the subsidy was very
high and my premium was

42:19.437 --> 42:22.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very low and I was very happy.

42:22.607 --> 42:30.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, beginning in January of
'16, the subsidy was lower and
my premium went up dramatically.

42:30.047 --> 42:35.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my income was nearly the
same. In fact, for this year I'm
paying 22 percent of my

42:35.753 --> 42:40.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
income for health care. So
that's my concern and my
complaint.

42:40.992 --> 42:46.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second part of my question
is: What's going to happen to
Obamacare in 2017 and beyond?

42:46.998 --> 42:53.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Yeah.
Well, I don't know the
particular circumstance. Your
subsidy

42:53.237 --> 42:58.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should not have gone down if
your income is more or less the
same, unless there was some

42:58.409 --> 43:07.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
significant difference in your
tax status. So I'll try to find
out about that.

43:07.785 --> 43:14.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is true is that some of the
premiums went up because
essentially in the first year

43:14.325 --> 43:18.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a startup program, a lot of
insurance companies didn't quite
know how to price things. And

43:18.396 --> 43:25.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so they priced substantially
lower than people expected.

43:25.002 --> 43:32.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now things are kind of
evening out, which means that
some folks who overpriced,
they've

43:32.076 --> 43:41.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dropped their prices. Some have
gone up. But on average, what
we're seeing is that the

43:41.152 --> 43:51.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
average increase is about four
bucks per month for somebody who
is signed up.

43:51.496 --> 43:55.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some markets are different. One
of the big problems that we've
had is making sure that

43:55.967 --> 44:02.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's enough competition,
enough insurers who are bidding
for your business in rural

44:02.073 --> 44:08.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
communities, because some areas
just don't have as many
providers and as many insurance

44:08.279 --> 44:14.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
companies. And so you only get
one or two, and they start
thinking, well, maybe we can

44:14.285 --> 44:18.422 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
jack up prices a
little bit higher.

44:18.422 --> 44:24.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, technically, your state
insurance commissioner is able
to -- has to approve any hikes
and

44:24.395 --> 44:30.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those that are not justified
economically, those should be
stopped.

44:30.201 --> 44:36.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what I would say generally
is that, and we're monitoring
this very carefully, I promise.

44:36.908 --> 44:41.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously everybody's been
predicting disaster and
apocalypse on this thing for a
long time

44:41.779 --> 44:49.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
-- is generally speaking
premiums have been lower than
people expected originally. In

44:49.554 --> 44:54.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some markets, they've gone up
faster; some markets slower.

44:54.725 --> 45:01.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're still cheaper than you
would be able to get outside of
the marketplace. But there

45:01.232 --> 45:06.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are some things that we've got
to do to lower health care costs
generally, particularly

45:06.037 --> 45:13.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
drug prices. And part of
Obamacare that's not talked
about a lot is us trying to
improve

45:13.878 --> 45:18.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the health care delivery system
so that there's not as much
waste.

45:18.883 --> 45:26.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that you're not taking
multiple tests; so that you're
not readmitted into a hospital

45:26.023 --> 45:30.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because they didn't take care of
business the first time. And
that's part of the reason

45:30.828 --> 45:36.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
why overall health care
inflation has actually gone done
-- has gone up at about half the

45:36.767 --> 45:40.972 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
rate that it did
before the law passed.

45:40.972 --> 45:48.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the average person here,
your premiums are about $2,600
lower than they would have

45:48.779 --> 45:53.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been if health care inflation
had kept on going up at the same
pace as it did before

45:53.451 --> 46:01.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obamacare was passed. Now, the
fact that they're still going up
makes you feel bad. You'd feel

46:01.559 --> 46:05.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
worse if they'd gone up faster.

46:05.162 --> 46:14.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So this is still an issue of
challenge to policymakers and to
families. I'm happy, after

46:14.005 --> 46:18.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- after this town hall, to get
some details about your
situation because if you're
income

46:18.876 --> 46:22.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't go up much, at least the
subsidies should not change that
much.

46:22.279 --> 46:23.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Another question for
you over here, Mr. President.

46:23.648 --> 46:25.349 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Your name?

46:25.349 --> 46:27.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GERALD SPARKS, Union Member: My
name is Gerald Sparks. I'm a
member of the Local Level 18

46:27.718 --> 46:29.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Painters and Allied Trade Union.

46:29.186 --> 46:31.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:
Good to see you.

46:31.155 --> 46:34.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GERALD SPARKS: Two-part question
for you. First, with over 79,000
Syrian refugees already

46:34.792 --> 46:39.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coming into the states and tens
of thousands more coming in, how
can you guarantee that

46:39.363 --> 46:43.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's none that have been
radicalized? And two, don't you
feel that that money would

46:43.601 --> 46:47.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be better spent taking care of
the tens of thousands of
homeless veterans we have
sleeping

46:47.304 --> 46:50.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the streets every night, some
with children and the ones
committing suicide daily? Thank

46:50.207 --> 46:52.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you, Mr. President.

46:52.443 --> 46:57.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well,
first, let me say, sir, that we
don't have tens of thousands

46:57.381 --> 47:08.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Syrian refugees coming in.
We're trying to get -- trying to
admit several thousand.

47:08.859 --> 47:13.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So far, I think, we've been able
to admit about 2,500. In
contrast, Canada's taken in

47:13.197 --> 47:23.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
25,000. We're a much bigger
country. Germany's taken in half
a million.

47:23.040 --> 47:30.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a tragedy going on
there. People are homeless and
dying and we're the biggest,

47:30.114 --> 47:34.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wealthiest country on Earth and
we have some obligation to help,
just like we'd expect

47:34.618 --> 47:41.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people to help if Americans
were in trouble.

47:41.726 --> 47:48.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think it's really
important to understand we're
not spending a lot of money on
bringing

47:48.899 --> 47:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in and housing refugees, and
this is -- this is what I mean
about making sure when we're

47:58.109 --> 48:08.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deciding about elections and
voting that we look at the
facts. I'm trying to get more

48:08.252 --> 48:14.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
refugees admitted. It's not
close to the kinds of numbers
you're talking about.

48:14.492 --> 48:21.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just can't, and the reason is
because refugees are actually
admitted on a much stricter
standard

48:21.499 --> 48:26.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than the average tourist who's
coming in on a visa. They have
to go through a full background

48:26.537 --> 48:34.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
check, FBI, our intelligence
agencies, check through every
single person who comes in.

48:34.411 --> 48:43.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's like a month-long process.
But if you are somebody from
France, you don't even need

48:43.354 --> 48:46.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a visa, you just hop on a plane
and you're here in the United
States. And if you're a

48:46.357 --> 48:54.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
member of ISIL that happens to
be a citizen of France or
Germany, you come on in.

48:54.131 --> 49:01.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Much more risk is involved in
terms of just ordinary tourists
or, for that matter, American

49:01.772 --> 49:08.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
citizens who've gotten
brainwashed by ISIL on the
computer like they did in San
Bernardino,

49:08.379 --> 49:14.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and suddenly, they just go to
the local gun store where, by
the way, because the Republicans

49:14.652 --> 49:21.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have blocked it, we can't even
put them on a list to prevent
them from buying weapons.

49:21.859 --> 49:26.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a much bigger danger
than the Syrian refugees.

49:26.130 --> 49:31.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the second point you made
about veterans homelessness, one
of the things that I did

49:31.101 --> 49:34.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when I came in office is I said
if somebody's put on a uniform
of this country and fought

49:34.505 --> 49:39.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for our freedom, they cannot be
homeless, and our goal should be
zero homelessness,

49:39.176 --> 49:45.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
zero tolerance for homelessness.
And we have cut veterans
homelessness since I've been

49:45.416 --> 49:52.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in office by about a third. Tens
of thousands of veterans who
used to be homeless are now

49:52.456 --> 49:54.725 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
housed.

49:54.725 --> 50:01.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one is too many, so we've
got some cities where they've
set a goal of zero homeless

50:01.131 --> 50:05.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
veterans and they've actually
achieved it. We're going to keep
on working as long as

50:05.436 --> 50:10.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have to to get this done and
we have budgeted the dollars to
make sure that every veteran

50:10.341 --> 50:14.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is -- is put in place.

50:14.478 --> 50:23.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I just want to say that the
reason that we've got veterans
homelessness is not

50:23.988 --> 50:30.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because of Syrian refugees, it's
not because of undeserved folks
on welfare, it's because

50:30.461 --> 50:37.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we've had a Congress that for
too long talks tough about
patriotism and looking out for

50:37.601 --> 50:47.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our troops and orders folks --
are fine with us sending 180,000
people into war, but then

50:47.211 --> 50:52.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when it came down to the actual
veterans budget, it wasn't
there.

50:52.283 --> 50:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I increased the veterans
budget more -- the V.A. budget
more than any president

50:58.289 --> 51:05.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in history. I increased it 11
percent my first year. But we've
still got work to do on it.

51:05.829 --> 51:08.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Mr. President, I'm
going to squeeze in another...

51:08.432 --> 51:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Thank
you for the question, though.
Are you a veteran yourself?

51:08.766 --> 51:10.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GERALD SPARKS: No, but
I support our troops.

51:10.534 --> 51:12.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: All
right. I appreciate you, sir.

51:12.903 --> 51:14.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Yes. Hi.
What's your name?

51:14.138 --> 51:15.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARIANNE NEUFELDT, Homemaker:
Hi. Marianne Neufeldt.

51:15.205 --> 51:18.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: OK. What's your
question for the president?

51:18.142 --> 51:25.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARIANNE NEUFELDT: Mr.
President, what is the one thing
you would go back and change

51:25.716 --> 51:30.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
during your presidency? And
how would you change it?

51:30.654 --> 51:36.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:
Other than dying my hair?

51:36.260 --> 51:41.799 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:41.799 --> 51:53.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have to tell you, every day,
you know, I make some mistake.
Fortunately, most of them

51:53.444 --> 52:00.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aren't that big. Sometimes, you
just make -- use your best
judgment because you're working

52:00.784 --> 52:05.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with probabilities. You don't
know the perfect answer. If
something's easy, it does not
reach

52:05.756 --> 52:11.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my desk. By definition, somebody
else has solved it. If
something's easy to solve, I

52:11.962 --> 52:17.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't even see it. Somebody else
has solved it a long time ago.

52:17.468 --> 52:22.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So most of the time, I'm dealing
with probabilities. If I'm
making a decision about are we
going

52:22.106 --> 52:29.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take a strike against bin
Laden, I don't even know if bin
Laden's there and I've got

52:29.146 --> 52:33.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
young men and women -- young men
who are at risk when I send them
there. I'm operating

52:33.851 --> 52:36.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on probabilities.

52:36.587 --> 52:42.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we decided to bail out the
auto industry -- you were
talking about polls earlier.
That

52:42.026 --> 52:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
polled at about 10 percent even
in Michigan because people were,
you know, so mad about

52:49.166 --> 52:54.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the bank bailouts, they thought
no more bail outs. And we
weren't positive the thing was

52:54.772 --> 52:58.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to work, but we knew that
if we didn't do it, you'd lose a
million jobs all across

52:58.942 --> 53:07.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Midwest, including here in
Indiana. So we made that bet and
it worked.

53:07.584 --> 53:17.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I were to talk about domestic
policy, I think the thing I
would've probably done
differently

53:17.694 --> 53:29.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is I would've tried to describe
earlier to the American people
how serious the recession

53:29.740 --> 53:35.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was going to be, which is --
which would've hopefully allowed
us to have an even bigger

53:35.079 --> 53:39.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
response than we did.

53:39.516 --> 53:46.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our -- the Recovery Act, our
response to the recession was
actually bigger than the New

53:46.190 --> 53:53.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Deal. We -- that's how a lot of
teachers kept their jobs, that's
how a lot of construction

53:53.831 --> 53:58.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
workers stayed on the job and
projects kept on going. That's
how a lot of states met their

53:58.368 --> 54:02.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
budget. That's why we didn't end
up having 30 percent
unemployment.

54:02.606 --> 54:16.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in the balance of trying to
reassure people, I maybe didn't
indicate to them that look,

54:16.587 --> 54:20.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is probably going to be a
two-, three-, four-year process
of us digging out of this

54:20.891 --> 54:26.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hole, so that we could have
staged some of that recovery
money over a longer period of

54:26.463 --> 54:36.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time and possibly
accelerated the recovery.

54:36.273 --> 54:43.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In terms of foreign policy, I've
said this before, we decided to
go in as part of a broader

54:43.147 --> 54:53.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coalition into Libya to make
sure that this guy Gadhafi, who
had been a state sponsor

54:53.657 --> 54:59.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of terrorism, didn't go in and
start slaughtering his own
people. We succeeded and
probably

54:59.997 --> 55:02.900 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
saved tens of
thousands of lives.

55:02.900 --> 55:11.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I was -- I did a little too
much of counting on other
countries to then stabilize and
help

55:11.808 --> 55:18.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support government formation.
And now it's kind of a mess. I
could give you a long list.

55:18.982 --> 55:21.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

55:21.185 --> 55:30.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I -- I tell you, I mean, the
one thing I can say is every day
when I wake up, I'm

55:30.928 --> 55:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
focused on how can I make your
lives better; how can I protect
the American people; how

55:36.733 --> 55:45.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can I increase their prosperity.
At the end of the day, I can
always say honestly that

55:45.209 --> 55:51.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I did my best. And hopefully,
what I'm also usually trying to
do is to admit that if
something's

55:51.315 --> 55:55.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not working as well as it should
be, let's see if we can improve
it.

55:55.986 --> 55:59.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's where we need, though, a
Congress that is not about
yelling and is more about
solving

55:59.890 --> 56:01.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
problems.

56:01.425 --> 56:03.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Mr. President, we
will prevail on you to come back
and give us the rest of

56:03.126 --> 56:04.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that list at another time.

56:04.595 --> 56:05.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: OK.

56:05.062 --> 56:06.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: We're out
of time for now.

56:06.997 --> 56:10.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Thank you very much
for joining us.

56:10.033 --> 56:12.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thank you very much, the good
people of Elkhart, Indiana, for
joining us. We really appreciate

56:12.469 --> 56:14.571 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

56:14.571 --> 56:19.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We hope you will keep tuning
into the PBS NewsHour and at our
website at PBS.org/newshour

56:19.743 --> 56:24.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for more on all of the issues
and more raised tonight.

56:24.081 --> 56:41.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From all of us here in the
Hoosier State today, thank you
to the president and to the
people

56:41.398 --> 56:45.068 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Elkhart.

56:45.068 --> 57:09.126 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Good night.
