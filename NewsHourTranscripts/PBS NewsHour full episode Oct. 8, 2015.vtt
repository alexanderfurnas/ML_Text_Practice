WEBVTT

00:06.340 --> 00:08.942
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff. Gwen Ifill is on
assignment.

00:08.942 --> 00:11.011
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:11.011 --> 00:14.381
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA),
House Majority Leader: If we're
going to unite and be strong,

00:14.381 --> 00:17.451
we need a new face
to help do that.

00:17.451 --> 00:24.191
JUDY WOODRUFF: A House divided.
Republicans scramble to find a
new leader after Kevin

00:24.191 --> 00:29.763
McCarthy drops out of the race
to replace John Boehner as
speaker of the House of
Representatives.

00:29.763 --> 00:33.867
Also ahead this Thursday:
Attorney General Loretta Lynch
tells Gwen the Department of

00:33.867 --> 00:37.704
Justice needs to start keeping
records on police shootings.

00:37.704 --> 00:42.376
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: We find it unacceptable
that we don't have national,

00:42.376 --> 00:46.213
consistent data about not just
excessive force, but
officer-involved deaths,
officer-involved

00:46.213 --> 00:48.115
shootings.

00:48.115 --> 00:53.353
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the former
Chairman of the Federal Reserve
Bank Ben Bernanke opens

00:53.353 --> 00:57.658
up about his new book, the
global financial meltdown seven
years ago, and who should have

00:57.658 --> 00:59.826
taken the fall.

00:59.826 --> 01:03.130
BEN BERNANKE, Former Federal
Reserve Chairman: Corporations
are legal fictions. They don't

01:03.130 --> 01:08.235
themselves take legal or illegal
actions. It's individuals who
make those decisions.

01:08.235 --> 01:12.439
And I would have preferred to
have seen the strategy been to
go and determine who -- what

01:12.439 --> 01:14.608
individuals were responsible.

01:14.608 --> 01:21.581
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:21.581 --> 01:25.786
(BREAK)

01:25.786 --> 01:36.330
JUDY WOODRUFF: The political
bombshell burst at the U.S.
Capitol just after midday. House

01:36.330 --> 01:40.600
Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy
abruptly withdrew from the race
for speaker, a contest he had

01:40.600 --> 01:44.237
once been favored to win.

01:44.237 --> 01:47.207
Political director Lisa
Desjardins has spent the day at
the Capitol, and she begins our

01:47.207 --> 01:48.809
reporting.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.445
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA),
House Majority Leader: I think I
shocked some of you, huh?

01:51.445 --> 01:55.482
LISA DESJARDINS: With that
understatement, Kevin McCarthy
shook the corridors of Congress

01:55.482 --> 01:59.453
today. House Republicans had
gathered to choose their nominee
for speaker when the majority

01:59.453 --> 02:03.490
leader stunned them. He said
later the party is simply too
divided.

02:03.490 --> 02:06.393
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: I think
there's something to be said,
for us to unite, we probably
need

02:06.393 --> 02:12.165
a fresh face. I'll stay on as
majority leader, but the one
thing I have found talking with

02:12.165 --> 02:18.171
everybody, if we're going to
unite and be strong, we need a
new face to help do that.

02:18.171 --> 02:23.143
LISA DESJARDINS: The news set
off a scramble in the hallways.
The five-term California

02:23.143 --> 02:27.381
congressman was the front-runner
for speaker, but seemed short
the 218 votes needed in a

02:27.381 --> 02:29.816
full House vote.

02:29.816 --> 02:33.720
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: If we're
going to be strong, we have got
to be 100 percent united.

02:33.720 --> 02:37.624
LISA DESJARDINS: McCarthy ran
afoul of the same conservatives,
the House Freedom Caucus,

02:37.624 --> 02:41.194
who helped push out Speaker John
Boehner. Yesterday, the group's
roughly 40 members

02:41.194 --> 02:44.431
endorsed Daniel
Webster of Florida.

02:44.431 --> 02:47.868
Congressman Tim Huelskamp of
Kansas is a Freedom Caucus
member.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.904
REP. TIM HUELSKAMP (R), Kansas:
Clearly, the establishment lost
today; 80 percent of -- 80

02:50.904 --> 02:56.309
percent of Americans --
Republicans wanted to get a new
speaker. And I think that's
obviously

02:56.309 --> 02:58.912
going to happen. But K Street's
got to be shaking now. They have
lost two speakers in

02:58.912 --> 03:01.081
two weeks.

03:01.081 --> 03:03.917
LISA DESJARDINS: The decision
leaves an already fractious
House Republican Party even
deeper

03:03.917 --> 03:06.153
in disarray.

03:06.153 --> 03:09.423
Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz
is also in the speaker's race.

03:09.423 --> 03:13.827
REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), Utah: I
really do believe it's time for
a fresh start. That

03:13.827 --> 03:20.267
was the whole genesis of my
campaign. But we need to have a
lot more family discussion,

03:20.267 --> 03:25.105
because we need to find somebody
that our whole body can unite
behind and do what we

03:25.105 --> 03:27.474
were elected to do.

03:27.474 --> 03:31.311
LISA DESJARDINS: Some centrist
Republicans who had backed
Boehner and then McCarthy now

03:31.311 --> 03:35.382
say finding the next speaker may
even require reaching across the
aisle to secure votes

03:35.382 --> 03:37.784
from Democrats.

03:37.784 --> 03:41.922
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa is on
Capitol Hill now with the
latest.

03:41.922 --> 03:47.027
Lisa, what a day. What are you
hearing about how this all gets
resolved?

03:47.027 --> 03:49.496
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, the next
thing -- everyone, set your
watches -- 9:00 a.m., House
Republicans

03:49.496 --> 03:52.265
are set to meet again tomorrow.

03:52.265 --> 03:58.738
But, Judy, a new name is
emerging tonight, a familiar
name, Paul Ryan, Republican of

03:58.738 --> 04:02.375
Wisconsin, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee. There
is tremendous pressure

04:02.375 --> 04:06.146
on him tonight, including
perhaps from Speaker Boehner's
office itself, for Paul Ryan to

04:06.146 --> 04:08.415
get into the race.

04:08.415 --> 04:13.820
So far, he has not done that.
But in talking to sources both
conservative and moderate

04:13.820 --> 04:16.823
in the Republican Party, there
is thought tonight, Judy, that
he might be the only current

04:16.823 --> 04:20.660
House Republican who could get
the votes needed to be speaker.

04:20.660 --> 04:24.965
Other than that, I think a
couple other things to notice
about a possible plan B, Judy,
if

04:24.965 --> 04:30.871
Ryan doesn't do it, perhaps
Speaker Boehner stays on the
job. And then a plan C, Judy,

04:30.871 --> 04:35.242
that's where we are, there is
also talk of perhaps nominating
a caretaker speaker, someone

04:35.242 --> 04:39.813
who does the job short-term,
until the next president is
elected.

04:39.813 --> 04:45.485
And with that scenario, almost
Aaron Sorkin on steroids, there
is truck of perhaps getting

04:45.485 --> 04:49.789
someone outside of Congress to
come in as a caretaker speaker.
Some were musing about

04:49.789 --> 04:53.693
Mitt Romney. I don't know if
that's feasible. But it really
seems it's Romney's running

04:53.693 --> 04:56.096
mate, Paul Ryan, who's getting
the attention tonight.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.198
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sounds like
something from a Hollywood
movie.

04:58.198 --> 05:02.736
Lisa Desjardins, we thank you.

05:02.736 --> 05:06.039
And we will explore the
political dynamics of what
happened today, and what comes
next,

05:06.039 --> 05:09.609
after the news summary.

05:09.609 --> 05:14.414
On another front, members of
Congress went after Volkswagen
today over the way it rigged

05:14.414 --> 05:18.084
diesel models to cheat on
emissions tests. Statements at a
House hearing ranged from

05:18.084 --> 05:20.587
fury to apology.

05:20.587 --> 05:23.723
William Brangham has the story.

05:23.723 --> 05:27.093
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The opening
statements were full of
indignation from both sides of
the

05:27.093 --> 05:28.895
aisle.

05:28.895 --> 05:33.066
REP. FRED UPTON (R), Michigan:
V.W. has betrayed a nation, a
nation of regulators, loyalists,

05:33.066 --> 05:35.802
suppliers and
innocent customers.

05:35.802 --> 05:39.172
REP. JAN SCHAKOWSKY (D),
Illinois: The American people,
the EPA and their counterparts
around

05:39.172 --> 05:43.210
the world have been
defrauded by Volkswagen.

05:43.210 --> 05:46.413
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Michael Horn,
the automaker's top U.S.
executive, answered with a
corporate

05:46.413 --> 05:48.014
measles culpa.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.084
MICHAEL HORN, CEO, Volkswagen of
America: On behalf of our
company, my colleagues in

05:51.084 --> 05:58.325
Germany and me personally, I
would like to offer a sincere
apology for Volkswagen's use

05:58.325 --> 06:02.662
of a software program that
served to defeat the regular
emissions testing regime.

06:02.662 --> 06:06.633
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Horn also said
he believes there was never a
corporate decision to cheat.

06:06.633 --> 06:10.904
MICHAEL HORN: To my best
knowledge today, the corporation
in no board meeting or no

06:10.904 --> 06:15.508
supervisory board meeting has
authorized this, that this was a
couple of software engineers

06:15.508 --> 06:18.311
who put this in for
whatever reasons.

06:18.311 --> 06:21.982
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But Republican
Chris Collins of New York was
having none of that.

06:21.982 --> 06:26.086
REP. CHRIS COLLINS (R), New
York: V.W.'s trying to get the
United States of America to
believe

06:26.086 --> 06:32.292
these are a couple of rogue
engineers? I categorically
reject that. Either your entire
organization

06:32.292 --> 06:36.830
is incompetent when it comes to
trying to come up with
intellectual property -- and

06:36.830 --> 06:41.568
I don't believe that for a
second -- or they are complicit
at the highest levels in a
massive

06:41.568 --> 06:44.838
cover-up that continues today.

06:44.838 --> 06:50.010
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Horn was also
challenged over V.W.'s plans to
fix the estimated 500,000

06:50.010 --> 06:54.514
affected vehicles in the U.S. He
suggested it could take one to
two years, and said the

06:54.514 --> 06:59.185
fixes might affect engine
performance, but not fuel
efficiency.

06:59.185 --> 07:02.889
New York Democrat Paul Tonko
complained, that's cold comfort
to V.W. owners.

07:02.889 --> 07:06.393
REP. PAUL TONKO (D), New York:
Consumers, including people in
my district, purchased

07:06.393 --> 07:11.965
a car believing it would be a
clean, environmentally friendly
choice. Worse still, the resale
value

07:11.965 --> 07:16.603
on these vehicles, which I'm
sure was a selling point, has
certainly been destroyed.

07:16.603 --> 07:20.173
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For now,
Volkswagen has stopped selling
the affected models and has

07:20.173 --> 07:25.345
withdrawn applications to
certify that the company's 2016
versions meet U.S. standards.

07:25.345 --> 07:28.548
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm William Brangham.

07:28.548 --> 07:32.686
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Volkswagen
CEO also said the automaker will
compensate U.S. dealers

07:32.686 --> 07:36.890
for any losses they incur.

07:36.890 --> 07:42.028
Russia fired more cruise
missiles into Syria today, and
said they hit Islamic State
targets.

07:42.028 --> 07:46.433
The Russian military released
new video of the strikes, and it
denied U.S. reports that

07:46.433 --> 07:49.903
several missiles
crashed in Iran.

07:49.903 --> 07:54.874
Meanwhile, in Brussels, at a
NATO meeting, U.S. Defense
Secretary Ashton Carter
complained

07:54.874 --> 07:59.212
Moscow is acting recklessly,
in a variety of ways.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.581
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: They have shot cruise
missiles from a ship in the

08:01.581 --> 08:06.419
Caspian Sea without warning.
They have come within just a few
miles of one of our unmanned

08:06.419 --> 08:12.292
aerial vehicles. They have
initiated a joint ground
offensive with the Syrian
regime, shattering

08:12.292 --> 08:16.096
the facade that they are
there to fight ISIL.

08:16.096 --> 08:21.234
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the NATO
meeting, Turkey called Russia's
buildup in Syria unacceptable,

08:21.234 --> 08:26.072
and NATO agreed to send troops
to defend Turkey if asked.

08:26.072 --> 08:31.678
The European Union moved today
toward a tougher approach to its
migrant crisis. E.U. interior

08:31.678 --> 08:38.651
ministers agreed on stepped-up
deportations of those who don't
quality for asylum. They

08:38.651 --> 08:43.089
also discussed creating a new
force to police Europe's
external borders. We will hear
how

08:43.089 --> 08:48.027
Sweden is coping with the
influx later in the program.

08:48.027 --> 08:52.198
The American commander in
Afghanistan has told Congress
that most Taliban militants

08:52.198 --> 08:56.836
are open to making peace
with the Afghan government.

08:56.836 --> 09:02.142
Army General John Campbell
offered that assessment today at
a hearing of the House Armed
Services

09:02.142 --> 09:10.417
Committee. Current plans call
for withdrawing all but about
1,000 U.S. troops from
Afghanistan

09:10.417 --> 09:17.357
by year's end. Campbell warned
that that would limit any
capability to train Afghan
forces,

09:17.357 --> 09:22.095
but he declined to say that he
-- what he's recommending to the
president.

09:22.095 --> 09:28.535
The stampede at last month's
Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca may
have killed far more people than

09:28.535 --> 09:34.474
Saudi Arabia has acknowledged.
The Associated Press reported
today that data from 18
countries

09:34.474 --> 09:43.383
shows more than 1,360 dead. The
Saudis have maintained the
official toll is 769.

09:43.383 --> 09:49.088
The head of soccer's
international governing body
will face a 90-day suspension.
FIFA imposed

09:49.088 --> 09:54.527
that penalty today on longtime
president Sepp Blatter. He is at
the center of a corruption

09:54.527 --> 09:59.699
probe and had already planned to
step down next February. Michel
Platini, who is the

09:59.699 --> 10:04.671
head of European soccer's
governing group, was also
suspended.

10:04.671 --> 10:10.009
An investigative journalist and
author from Belarus has won this
year's Nobel Prize for

10:10.009 --> 10:15.982
Literature. Svetlana Alexievich
was honored for her portrayal of
life in the former Soviet

10:15.982 --> 10:21.888
Union, including World War II,
the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan, and the Chernobyl

10:21.888 --> 10:28.228
nuclear disaster. Alexievich
learned of her selection today
in Minsk, the capital of
Belarus.

10:28.228 --> 10:33.666
SVETLANA ALEXIEVICH, Nobel Prize
Winner (through translator):
This is not only a prize for

10:33.666 --> 10:38.471
me, but a prize I think as a
whole for our culture, for our
small country, which, all

10:38.471 --> 10:42.742
the time, throughout its history
and now as well has been between
some millstones. It

10:42.742 --> 10:46.112
always has been pressed
from all sides.

10:46.112 --> 10:54.187
JUDY WOODRUFF: Alexievich is
only the 14th woman to win the
literature award since 1901.

10:54.187 --> 10:59.726
Wall Street kept up its weeklong
advance today, as oil prices
rose again. The Dow Jones
industrial

10:59.726 --> 11:06.900
average gained 138 points to
close at 17050. The Nasdaq rose
19 points, and the S&P 500

11:06.900 --> 11:10.537
added 17.

11:10.537 --> 11:16.476
And renowned Cajun chef Paul
Prudhomme has died. He achieved
national and then global

11:16.476 --> 11:24.784
fame in the 1980s and
popularized spicy Louisiana
cuisine, including gumbo and
jambalaya. At

11:24.784 --> 11:29.455
one point, his K-Paul's
Louisiana Kitchen was the most
popular restaurant in New
Orleans.

11:29.455 --> 11:32.859
Paul Prudhomme was 75 years old.

11:32.859 --> 11:39.098
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
more on Kevin McCarthy's
decision to bow out of the race

11:39.098 --> 11:46.005
for speaker of the U.S. House;
Gwen's conversation with
Attorney General Loretta Lynch;
Ben Bernanke

11:46.005 --> 12:01.254
on who should have taken the
fall for the financial crisis,
and much more.

12:01.254 --> 12:06.893
We take a deeper look now at
today's surprise shakeup on
Capitol Hill with former
Republican

12:06.893 --> 12:11.097
House member Vin Weber of
Minnesota and Washington Post
reporter Mike DeBonis.

12:11.097 --> 12:13.032
Gentlemen, welcome.

12:13.032 --> 12:14.767
Mike DeBonis, to you first.

12:14.767 --> 12:19.505
Anything to add about why
Kevin McCarthy pulled out?

12:19.505 --> 12:23.209
MIKE DEBONIS, The Washington
Post: Really, right now, you
know, it was a matter of pure

12:23.209 --> 12:28.448
politics within the House
Republican Conference.

12:28.448 --> 12:36.255
It became clear that his path to
the speakership was going to be
very narrow, and that his

12:36.255 --> 12:41.427
ascending to that post would do
little, if anything, to solve
the internal problems and

12:41.427 --> 12:46.099
the divides within the
conference. He said it himself
at his press conference earlier

12:46.099 --> 12:49.836
today, when he stood before the
microphones and said, we need a
fresh face.

12:49.836 --> 12:53.940
The question is -- he was the
fresh face of the Republican
Party for so many years, for

12:53.940 --> 12:54.941
at least the last five years.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.409
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

12:56.409 --> 13:00.947
MIKE DEBONIS: He was one of the
young guns in a class with
people like Eric Cantor and

13:00.947 --> 13:03.616
Paul Ryan.

13:03.616 --> 13:08.521
Eric Cantor, of course, was
kicked unceremoniously out of
Congress last year by a Tea
Party challenger.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.123
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

13:10.123 --> 13:14.093
MIKE DEBONIS: And now people are
looking to Paul Ryan. So, who is
going to step up in

13:14.093 --> 13:17.830
this next generation? That's
really what we're looking at
now.

13:17.830 --> 13:20.333
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean, it is the
case, Vin Weber, he was the
fresh face. Something changed,

13:20.333 --> 13:22.568
though, just in the
last 12, 24 hours.

13:22.568 --> 13:25.004
VIN WEBER, Former U.S.
Congressman: Well, something
changed.

13:25.004 --> 13:30.043
I think the main thing, as we
just talked about, is the fact
that they didn't -- Kevin

13:30.043 --> 13:34.380
would have won the nomination of
our caucus. And it's important
for our viewers to understand.

13:34.380 --> 13:35.882
That's what we were doing. We
were nominating a candidate. We
were not choosing a speaker.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.583
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

13:37.583 --> 13:42.388
VIN WEBER: The question was,
when he then proceeded to the
full House of Representatives,

13:42.388 --> 13:45.658
would he get the majority that
was necessary to be elected
speaker? He wasn't sure he could

13:45.658 --> 13:48.928
get to the majority to
be elected speaker.

13:48.928 --> 13:53.599
And, most important, there was
no plan B. If he failed to get
the majority, who would

13:53.599 --> 13:58.538
happen on the next ballot? Would
they go outside the Congress?
Would they try to form a
coalition

13:58.538 --> 14:01.407
with the Democrats? There was no
plan B, and so it would have
resulted in chaos, so they

14:01.407 --> 14:03.443
decided to put everything off.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.846
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it was an
issue with the most conservative
members, is that right,

14:06.846 --> 14:10.416
the so-called Freedom Caucus.
Those were the votes that he
needed that were not sure.

14:10.416 --> 14:15.588
VIN WEBER: Yes, that's true. And
the only addition I would put on
that is, we really

14:15.588 --> 14:19.225
have redefined what it
means to be conservative.

14:19.225 --> 14:25.765
There are not big ideological,
issue-oriented differences
between those folks and the --
quote,

14:25.765 --> 14:30.470
unquote -- "establishment." We
have defined conservative to be
a non-ideological term.

14:30.470 --> 14:34.006
It's about strategy, it's about
tactics. Are we willing to shut
down the government, are

14:34.006 --> 14:37.944
we going to confront the
president more directly? That's
very different.

14:37.944 --> 14:42.215
You think about battles in the
past that divided parties, the
Democrats over civil war and

14:42.215 --> 14:48.287
the Vietnam War in the '70s, the
Republicans fighting about tax
cuts and supply-side economics.

14:48.287 --> 14:51.524
Those were big philosophical
issues. There is no big
philosophical divide in the
Republican

14:51.524 --> 14:53.893
Party right now.

14:53.893 --> 14:58.297
It's frustration at their
inability to change things with
Barack Obama in the White House.

14:58.297 --> 15:01.234
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mike DeBonis,
how do they get around that?

15:01.234 --> 15:06.239
You mentioned the speaker,
Speaker John Boehner, is trying
to get Paul Ryan to run. How do

15:06.239 --> 15:09.909
they get around it, if it's now
about strategy and not about
philosophy?

15:09.909 --> 15:14.514
MIKE DEBONIS: Well, right now,
they're really looking at this
Hail Mary pass and hoping

15:14.514 --> 15:21.420
that Paul Ryan does agree, under
immense pressure from all sides
of his party, to be the guy

15:21.420 --> 15:26.526
to come in and bring everybody
together and move forward.

15:26.526 --> 15:32.598
If Paul Ryan sticks by his
previous refusal, citing his
young family, citing his desire

15:32.598 --> 15:39.438
to stay as Ways and Means
chairman, it's really hard to
see what happens next. You know,
one

15:39.438 --> 15:43.176
of the possibilities is that,
you know, John Boehner is
basically forced to stay in the

15:43.176 --> 15:47.046
post because there is nobody
willing to replace him.

15:47.046 --> 15:53.452
There has been talk of some sort
of caretaker speaker, a member
who perhaps is retiring

15:53.452 --> 15:58.057
or is in his twilight -- his or
her twilight years of there
service in Congress who can

15:58.057 --> 16:03.162
come in and do that. But I think
that the same people who were
not excited about Kevin

16:03.162 --> 16:08.534
McCarthy aren't going to be
excited someone like a John
Kline or a Tom Cole or somebody

16:08.534 --> 16:12.405
like that coming in and
playing that role.

16:12.405 --> 16:16.442
So, it's really hard
to see how this ends.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.211
JUDY WOODRUFF: Vin Weber, can
you imagine something like that,
somebody from the outside

16:18.211 --> 16:19.812
coming in?

16:19.812 --> 16:22.882
VIN WEBER: It's highly unlikely.
This has really never happened.

16:22.882 --> 16:27.353
The notion of my good friend and
fellow Minnesotan John Kline is
a little different. He's a
sitting

16:27.353 --> 16:31.324
member of Congress. He's
announced he's not going to run
again, and so it would allow

16:31.324 --> 16:35.828
us to have a respected man in
the speaker's chair for the next
year or so, while they

16:35.828 --> 16:39.065
sorted all of this out.

16:39.065 --> 16:43.202
I still think it's unlikely. I
think that they are going to
find somebody to be elected

16:43.202 --> 16:48.441
speaker, but it's an unusual
time. Paul Ryan seems to be the
one person that could unite

16:48.441 --> 16:52.178
the conference. I know him very
well. He's been a close friend
for over 20 years. He

16:52.178 --> 16:55.882
doesn't want to do it, and he
doesn't want to do it for all of
the best reasons, Judy.

16:55.882 --> 16:59.585
He wants to be chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee and do
tax reform and trade and

16:59.585 --> 17:04.323
health care reform and all sorts
of other issues that he cares
about. And in his mind,

17:04.323 --> 17:08.961
it's giving up something very,
very important. And the people
that appeal to him based on

17:08.961 --> 17:11.797
his own self-interest and
ambitions are singing the wrong
tune for Paul Ryan. That's not
why

17:11.797 --> 17:13.099
he would do this.

17:13.099 --> 17:15.501
JUDY WOODRUFF: He
would do it why?

17:15.501 --> 17:19.872
VIN WEBER: He would do it if he
is convinced that the
institution of the House of
Representatives,

17:19.872 --> 17:23.643
the Republican Party and
ultimately the country are
hurting by this chaos in the
House and

17:23.643 --> 17:26.412
he's the only person that
can mend the fences.

17:26.412 --> 17:29.649
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just for a
moment, Vin Weber, broaden this
out. What does this say about

17:29.649 --> 17:33.319
the health and the future of
your party, the Republican
Party?

17:33.319 --> 17:38.758
VIN WEBER: Well, the party is in
a certain degree of chaos right
now and there is a similarly,

17:38.758 --> 17:42.662
in my view anyway, between what
we see in the presidential
nominating process and what

17:42.662 --> 17:45.998
we see going on in the House
of Representatives today.

17:45.998 --> 17:49.702
And I do think it extends even
beyond the Republican Party to
the broader electorate.

17:49.702 --> 17:53.706
People are angry. They're not
happy with the status quo. They
want a change, but they're

17:53.706 --> 17:58.444
not sure what that change should
be. That's what I see in the
House of Representatives.

17:58.444 --> 18:02.348
It's what I see in the Donald
Trump candidacy, who has all
sorts of people that are angry

18:02.348 --> 18:05.151
and want to move in a
different direction.

18:05.151 --> 18:08.387
But Trump does not identify --
this is no disrespect to him,
but he doesn't identify

18:08.387 --> 18:12.992
any clear direction for the
country. He's just got a series
of attitudes. That reflects

18:12.992 --> 18:16.829
where the country is right now.
And let me make one more point.
At the moment, that's

18:16.829 --> 18:19.932
not good for Republicans. It's
chaos in the House and
unpredictability in our
presidential

18:19.932 --> 18:22.201
race.

18:22.201 --> 18:25.838
But the notion that the country
is mad about the status quo and
the direction we're headed

18:25.838 --> 18:28.741
ultimately isn't good for the
Democrats either. They have the
White House. They are the status

18:28.741 --> 18:30.576
quo.

18:30.576 --> 18:35.181
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it
certainly is a day that's left
everybody stunned.

18:35.181 --> 18:37.984
VIN WEBER: Yes. There's not many
days that really are
unprecedented, but, at least in

18:37.984 --> 18:40.186
our lifetimes, this is
pretty unprecedented.

18:40.186 --> 18:43.789
JUDY WOODRUFF: Vin Weber, former
member of Congress, thank you
for joining us.

18:43.789 --> 18:47.827
Mike DeBonis from The Washington
Post, we thank you both.

18:47.827 --> 18:57.636
MIKE DEBONIS: Thank you.

18:57.636 --> 19:05.878
JUDY WOODRUFF: Loretta Lynch is
the country's top law
enforcement official. She faces
a

19:05.878 --> 19:11.751
spike in violent crime in
several major U.S. cities and
police-involved shootings,
sparking

19:11.751 --> 19:16.822
a national outcry for more
accountability and transparency.

19:16.822 --> 19:20.860
Gwen sat down with the attorney
general at the Justice
Department earlier today to
discuss

19:20.860 --> 19:24.263
the federal government's
role in addressing all this.

19:24.263 --> 19:27.266
GWEN IFILL: Madam Attorney
General, thank you so much for
talking with us.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.135
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: Thank you for having
me.

19:29.135 --> 19:32.638
GWEN IFILL: I want to start by
talking about the subject which
has consumed so much of

19:32.638 --> 19:37.543
your time since you have been
attorney general, this whole
question of violent crimes.

19:37.543 --> 19:41.847
You have been meeting with
communities around the country,
here in Washington as well, and

19:41.847 --> 19:46.752
talking about the degree to
which a lot of cities say that
violent homicides, crimes

19:46.752 --> 19:51.724
have spiked in their
communities, yet your own FBI
statistics show a slight
decline.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.859
How do you square
these two things?

19:53.859 --> 19:56.595
LORETTA LYNCH: Well, I think the
issue of the day really is, how
do we protect the American

19:56.595 --> 19:58.831
people?

19:58.831 --> 20:03.335
Certainly, crime overall is
down, and in many of our major
cities, crime is down. But in

20:03.335 --> 20:08.140
some neighborhoods, crime is not
only entrenched. We have seen a
rise in certain types of violent

20:08.140 --> 20:12.511
crime. It's a matter of great
concern for those of us here at
the department.

20:12.511 --> 20:17.249
What I initially did in this
regard was direct my U.S.
attorneys to meet with their
local

20:17.249 --> 20:21.520
counterparts, people on the
ground, to talk about the causes
of the crime, the nature

20:21.520 --> 20:24.223
of the crime, what
were they seeing.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.626
GWEN IFILL: I feel like we have
had a lot of conversations about
this, and, in the end,

20:27.626 --> 20:30.930
I'm not sure I know which is
true, is it getting worse or is
it getting better?

20:30.930 --> 20:34.433
LORETTA LYNCH: I think it
depends upon how you're impacted
by crime, but certainly the

20:34.433 --> 20:37.503
loss of every life
diminishes all of us.

20:37.503 --> 20:41.874
So, whether you're in the
neighborhood that has these
rising numbers or whether you're

20:41.874 --> 20:47.613
not, if someone in your city, if
one of your neighbors, if your
fellow Americans are feeling

20:47.613 --> 20:51.450
this, then it really is
impacting all of us and it is a
matter of concern for the
department.

20:51.450 --> 20:54.153
GWEN IFILL: I know you have
spent a lot of time in the
communities affected, in
particular

20:54.153 --> 20:57.756
by police-involved shootings.

20:57.756 --> 21:02.661
Yesterday, your FBI director,
James Comey, said he found it
ridiculous that the Department

21:02.661 --> 21:07.099
of Justice had not been keeping
its own records on the number of
police-involved shootings,

21:07.099 --> 21:10.169
that this has been left to
news media organizations.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.938
Why is it that the Justice
Department hasn't been on top of
that?

21:12.938 --> 21:16.909
LORETTA LYNCH: Well, certainly,
I think it's a serious issue. We
find it unacceptable that

21:16.909 --> 21:21.780
we don't have national,
consistent data about not just
excessive force, but
officer-involved

21:21.780 --> 21:25.551
deaths, officer-involved
shootings.

21:25.551 --> 21:30.589
This information is important
because, with it, we can
pinpoint trends, we can look at

21:30.589 --> 21:36.695
how situations devolve from a
standard interaction into one
that's less positive or perhaps
fatal.

21:36.695 --> 21:41.033
And we can provide assistance
and guidance to police and to
communities.

21:41.033 --> 21:44.937
We actually do mandate a lot of
this. When the Department of
Justice enters into a consent

21:44.937 --> 21:50.176
decree with the police
department, or in many instances
when we work with departments as

21:50.176 --> 21:53.279
part of our collaborative reform
process, we do require that type
of data, but it's

21:53.279 --> 21:55.781
not consistent.

21:55.781 --> 22:00.786
Every department handles data in
different ways, records data in
different ways. So,

22:00.786 --> 22:03.956
we have said that this is
important, it's vital. It's
actually unacceptable that we

22:03.956 --> 22:06.125
don't have it. And what we're
right now is going further.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.460
GWEN IFILL: OK.

22:08.460 --> 22:13.432
I want to talk to you more
broadly about whether you think
we're coming as a society or as

22:13.432 --> 22:20.239
a government to some sort of
agreement on the concerns about
criminal justice reform

22:20.239 --> 22:24.643
and mass incarceration. I'm sure
you read the long, long story
Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote

22:24.643 --> 22:27.746
in "The Atlantic" about the
spread of mass incarceration.
And it seems to be an increasing

22:27.746 --> 22:30.482
topic as Capitol Hill as well.

22:30.482 --> 22:33.819
Are we reaching a point where we
can agree on what the solutions
are?

22:33.819 --> 22:38.557
LORETTA LYNCH: I think we're at
a unique time in American
history and American dialogue,

22:38.557 --> 22:43.429
where we had this bipartisan
moment, a recognition that the
way in which we have been trying

22:43.429 --> 22:48.701
to keep people safe has, in
fact, had, in some situations,
the opposite impact.

22:48.701 --> 22:53.806
And certainly it's had
collateral consequences in
removing young men, particularly
young

22:53.806 --> 22:56.742
men of color, from their
communities at a time when they
need to be there and their

22:56.742 --> 22:59.578
communities need them the most.

22:59.578 --> 23:05.718
I was a young prosecutor in the
'90s, and I remember the days of
violence in the gun

23:05.718 --> 23:10.256
trade and the concern that
people had when they were
passing these strict mandatory
minimum

23:10.256 --> 23:14.526
laws. At the time, that was the
thinking, that this is the way
in which we can protect

23:14.526 --> 23:17.796
people. And we have seen
the results of that.

23:17.796 --> 23:22.735
We have seen that when we lock
up nonviolent drug offenders,
particularly those who are

23:22.735 --> 23:27.473
struggling with addiction, that
it doesn't really affect the
safety of the community,

23:27.473 --> 23:30.943
but it has a devastating impact
on the lives of those young
people.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.879
GWEN IFILL: And so this week,
one of the things you suggested
was release -- the beginning

23:33.879 --> 23:37.650
of a series of releases,
starting with 6,000 prisoners
who have been held, you believe,

23:37.650 --> 23:40.886
too long.

23:40.886 --> 23:44.089
That's a drop in the bucket
against the 2.2 million people
who are held in federal and

23:44.089 --> 23:48.761
local jails and prisons.
How do you expand on that?

23:48.761 --> 23:50.529
LORETTA LYNCH: Well, the
sentencing reform efforts that
are on the Hill, I think, are

23:50.529 --> 23:52.865
very encouraging.

23:52.865 --> 23:57.069
The Senate came out with a bill
just last week. I believe the
House is announcing their

23:57.069 --> 24:02.975
bill today. We look forward to
reviewing those and working with
both houses to make them

24:02.975 --> 24:08.280
not only effective, but
productive in a way that keeps
our communities safe and also
gives

24:08.280 --> 24:11.884
people a chance at rebuilding
their lives, because that can be
done.

24:11.884 --> 24:17.723
And I think this debate and this
discussion is important. When we
talk about not just

24:17.723 --> 24:21.727
people coming out on early
release -- and those individuals
coming out soon are being

24:21.727 --> 24:27.099
released because the sentencing
commission has tried to
essentially ameliorate the harsh

24:27.099 --> 24:32.471
impact of the stricter crack
laws relative to the cocaine
laws.

24:32.471 --> 24:36.408
And that change was accepted,
and after judicial review, a
number of inmates will have
their

24:36.408 --> 24:38.744
sentences reduced.

24:38.744 --> 24:40.879
GWEN IFILL: How does that take
into account the fact that
two-thirds of the people who

24:40.879 --> 24:44.016
are released end up back
in jail three years later?

24:44.016 --> 24:47.052
LORETTA LYNCH: That is the next
part in this conversation.

24:47.052 --> 24:52.758
And, frankly, it is just as
vital and important a part as
how we deal with the sentences
at

24:52.758 --> 24:58.464
the front end. Providing the
support and providing a way for
people to reintegrate back into

24:58.464 --> 25:04.403
their communities is key. We
also work with the Federal
Reentry Council, which is a
multiagency

25:04.403 --> 25:09.074
task force across government to
look at a whole host of barriers
to reintegration.

25:09.074 --> 25:14.780
Housing, for example, is a major
concern for those coming out of
our criminal justice system,

25:14.780 --> 25:19.952
the ability simply to go home.
What so many of us take for
granted at the end of the day

25:19.952 --> 25:22.721
is a challenge when
you are incarcerated.

25:22.721 --> 25:27.092
So, we're looking at making sure
that the rules are consistent,
that people who are

25:27.092 --> 25:31.163
eligible to return particularly
to public housing are able to do
so, so that families

25:31.163 --> 25:33.932
can come together again.

25:33.932 --> 25:39.204
GWEN IFILL: Since you have been
attorney general, and probably
predated your service, we have

25:39.204 --> 25:45.244
been in a series of
conversations about these
issues, about criminal justice
and about incarceration,

25:45.244 --> 25:50.115
and it all ties in with race and
about police-involved shootings.

25:50.115 --> 25:53.619
Are we turning the corner on
those conversations or are we
stuck in a corner, especially
when

25:53.619 --> 25:56.655
race becomes the common thread?

25:56.655 --> 26:00.025
LORETTA LYNCH: Well, I think
we're in the middle of a
conversation, but it's a
conversation

26:00.025 --> 26:03.662
that I think we should
look at as an opportunity.

26:03.662 --> 26:08.133
This is an opportunity for many
people in this country to have a
discussion about race,

26:08.133 --> 26:12.070
about criminal justice, about
the world of government in
general. And I think we have

26:12.070 --> 26:16.742
to broaden the discussion, not
just around issues of race and
policing, but race and

26:16.742 --> 26:22.915
society and communities that
don't have the educational
support, the economic support,

26:22.915 --> 26:27.853
the health care support to give
residents, particularly young
people, opportunity to

26:27.853 --> 26:30.222
break that cycle.

26:30.222 --> 26:34.893
I will tell you, one of the most
exciting things that happens is
when you go to an institution

26:34.893 --> 26:39.765
and you're talking about reentry
programs with young men who are
incarcerated there,

26:39.765 --> 26:44.536
and they talk about how the fact
that if they are able to get an
education while they are

26:44.536 --> 26:50.275
incarcerated, they feel they can
break a cycle and release their
children from a path that

26:50.275 --> 26:54.246
they were on, that maybe they
followed their own parents down
as well.

26:54.246 --> 26:58.417
So, we're looking at this at a
larger sense, and I think -- my
hope is that this conversation

26:58.417 --> 27:04.623
can be larger and that it can
really just inspire all of us.

27:04.623 --> 27:12.931
GWEN IFILL: Attorney General
Loretta Lynch, thank you very
much for joining us.

27:12.931 --> 27:16.935
LORETTA LYNCH: Thank you.

27:16.935 --> 27:21.273
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:21.273 --> 27:26.078
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke
on who is to blame for the
financial

27:26.078 --> 27:32.217
crisis seven years ago; plus,
new online tools to understand
inequality.

27:32.217 --> 27:39.157
But, first, Sweden has received
more refugees per capita than
any other European country,

27:39.157 --> 27:42.694
and the government is proud
of its open-door policy.

27:42.694 --> 27:48.166
But, as special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant reports from
Sweden, the country's generosity

27:48.166 --> 27:53.605
has left it struggling to cope
with an influx that's far
greater than anticipated.

27:53.605 --> 27:58.544
MALCOLM BRABANT:
Twenty-one-year-old student Abed
Allmugharbel has found sanctuary
in the

27:58.544 --> 28:02.681
historic town of Ystad, a
continent away from Homs in
Syria, where his home and much
of

28:02.681 --> 28:05.984
the city has been destroyed.

28:05.984 --> 28:09.755
Sweden's offer of granting
asylum to all Syrian refugees
was irresistible.

28:09.755 --> 28:13.892
ABED ALLMUGHARBEL, Refugee: I
never imagined myself outside of
Homs city. Now I'm from

28:13.892 --> 28:18.664
Sweden -- I'm in Sweden. It's
very happy to be in a very
peaceful country, where I'm
being

28:18.664 --> 28:22.834
treated like a human, respect to
human life. Very friendly people
here. It's very happy

28:22.834 --> 28:25.404
to be here.

28:25.404 --> 28:30.876
MALCOLM BRABANT: We first
encountered Abed last month in
the Turkish coastal city of

28:30.876 --> 28:35.347
Izmir, where smugglers arranged
passage to Europe. On that day,
Abed had just met a trafficker

28:35.347 --> 28:38.083
who had promised to
get him to Greece.

28:38.083 --> 28:42.254
ABED ALLMUGHARBEL: It might be
my best day or might be my
salvation day.

28:42.254 --> 28:45.991
MALCOLM BRABANT: Thankfully for
Abed, it was his salvation day,
but for hundreds of others,

28:45.991 --> 28:50.162
such deals are death sentences.

28:50.162 --> 28:57.269
Abed's odyssey to Sweden from
Lebanon took 17 days and cost
$2,500. He sailed from Tripoli

28:57.269 --> 29:01.807
in Lebanon to Mersin in Turkey
and then traveled to the
people-smuggling center of Izmir
next

29:01.807 --> 29:04.743
to the Aegean Sea.

29:04.743 --> 29:10.782
An overcrowded inflatable
carried him and other migrants
to the Greek island of Lesbos.

29:10.782 --> 29:15.854
From there, he took a ferry to
Athens, and then a bus to the
Macedonian border. All the

29:15.854 --> 29:20.826
way, his path and that of tens
of thousands of others was
facilitated by the U.N. Refugee

29:20.826 --> 29:26.798
Agency through border crossings
in Serbia, Croatia, Hungary and
Austria.

29:26.798 --> 29:31.837
Eventually, he reached Bavaria,
where he was told by the Germans
that he could apply for

29:31.837 --> 29:38.477
asylum or carry on. Abed
continued his journey north to
Hamburg and onto the Baltic port

29:38.477 --> 29:44.082
of Sassnitz, where he took a
ship that enabled him to bypass
Denmark and landed in Trelleborg

29:44.082 --> 29:53.392
in Southern Sweden. And there he
began the process of claiming
asylum.

29:53.392 --> 29:58.096
The most perilous part of Abed's
odyssey was the crossing to
Lesbos. The legal ferry takes

29:58.096 --> 30:04.736
just under an hour and costs
about $30. Abed paid $1,200 for
a place in a crowded inflatable

30:04.736 --> 30:09.074
whose engine broke down halfway
across and started to leak.

30:09.074 --> 30:13.578
ABED ALLMUGHARBEL: After like 25
minutes, under the engine, there
was a hole. The hole

30:13.578 --> 30:18.016
was getting the water in the
boat. You can imagine how a
woman can scream of --
frightening,

30:18.016 --> 30:22.587
of how children can
scream of being afraid.

30:22.587 --> 30:29.728
Yes, at that point, we thought
we are going to die. Happily,
the boat made it to the shore.

30:29.728 --> 30:36.268
I don't want to go through this
suffering all again. I don't
wish it for anyone, even

30:36.268 --> 30:41.406
my enemy. But there was no other
way. I had to take this way to
get to here.

30:41.406 --> 30:45.877
MALCOLM BRABANT: He promises to
give something back to a country
which has taken the moral

30:45.877 --> 30:50.348
high ground over Europe's
migration crisis, but is
struggling to cope.

30:50.348 --> 30:59.758
WOMAN (through translator): And
398, 399, very big family, many
people. Can I see? Oh,

30:59.758 --> 31:02.027
that's perfect.

31:02.027 --> 31:07.332
MALCOLM BRABANT: This is a
registration center in
Gothenburg, Sweden's second
city. The system

31:07.332 --> 31:11.503
is straining at the seams, as
genuine refugees and economic
migrants alike seize the
opportunity

31:11.503 --> 31:15.340
for a new life.

31:15.340 --> 31:20.378
The numbers coming into Sweden
far exceed those anticipated by
the government. The latest

31:20.378 --> 31:26.451
figures today show that, in the
past seven days, there have been
8,300 people who have

31:26.451 --> 31:31.123
applied for asylum. Now, during
the course of a whole month,
that amounts to more than

31:31.123 --> 31:37.162
30,000 people. Over three
months, it equates to 1 percent
of the whole Swedish population.

31:37.162 --> 31:43.068
The head of the migration board
says, we're coming to the end of
the road. Sweden regards

31:43.068 --> 31:47.172
itself as the humanitarian
conscience of the world and
there is genuine pride that the

31:47.172 --> 31:50.809
country is trying to provide the
newcomers with a soft landing.
But the sheer volume

31:50.809 --> 31:54.412
of asylum seekers has taken
the authorities by surprise.

31:54.412 --> 31:58.316
WOMAN: We are working from 8:00
in the morning to 7:30 p.m. in
the evening seven days a week

31:58.316 --> 32:00.018
now.

32:00.018 --> 32:03.955
MALCOLM BRABANT: Do you see an
increase in the numbers coming
or is it dying down?

32:03.955 --> 32:10.462
WOMAN: It's an increase. It's
getting more and more every day.
Last week, we had 250

32:10.462 --> 32:15.634
altogether. Now we have 310 with
them. So, it's getting more,
more and more people.

32:15.634 --> 32:19.704
MALCOLM BRABANT: And how do
you anticipate it will grow?

32:19.704 --> 32:27.078
WOMAN: I think it will get
higher for a couple of weeks,
and then maybe slowly getting
fewer

32:27.078 --> 32:32.217
seeking protection because of
the weather situation in
Southern Europe.

32:32.217 --> 32:37.756
MALCOLM BRABANT: Haidar, a
22-year-old videographer from
Iraq, is one of the newest
arrivals.

32:37.756 --> 32:41.193
He spent time in Mosul occupied
by the so-called Islamic State
and recently escaped from
kidnappers.

32:41.193 --> 32:44.596
He asked not to be identified.

32:44.596 --> 32:50.569
HAIDAR, Refugee: I am grateful
for the Sweden -- for Sweden
people and for the government,

32:50.569 --> 32:58.410
because they are opening their
doors for us, because we had no
home, no nothing. We don't

32:58.410 --> 33:02.848
have money. We don't have a
home. We don't have a place to
go. So, we are so grateful

33:02.848 --> 33:05.150
for them.

33:05.150 --> 33:09.788
MALCOLM BRABANT: In Trelleborg,
a small port town with direct
ferry links to Germany, the

33:09.788 --> 33:13.458
local council is struggling to
accommodate a surge in
unaccompanied minors, mainly
boys

33:13.458 --> 33:15.560
aged under 18 from Afghanistan.

33:15.560 --> 33:21.299
MAN: In my country (INAUDIBLE)

33:21.299 --> 33:26.771
MALCOLM BRABANT: In the past
week, Trelleborg has taken in
almost 1,000 children, which

33:26.771 --> 33:30.575
represents a 2 percent increase
in the town's population.

33:30.575 --> 33:39.584
CECILIA LEJON, Trelleborg: Oh,
it was another world before.
Before, we had, like, two new

33:39.584 --> 33:47.993
kids every week, and we thought
that that was really a lot. We
thought that was a pressure

33:47.993 --> 33:55.267
on Trelleborg. And now there are
100 a day. So, we have got some
new perspective on this.

33:55.267 --> 33:58.570
MALCOLM BRABANT: Her deputy,
Patrik Mullerstrom, is having to
be inventive to try to find
enough

33:58.570 --> 34:01.873
places to accommodate the
unaccompanied minors.

34:01.873 --> 34:06.411
PATRIK MULLERSTROM, Trelleborg:
We have people working on
getting properties for new
housings.

34:06.411 --> 34:14.486
And they're looking at every
single housing in the city, old
abandoned offices, like this,

34:14.486 --> 34:21.159
the museum. We're staying away
from school gymnasiums, because
we don't want to disrupt

34:21.159 --> 34:25.563
the regular city activities. But
we're really looking around.

34:25.563 --> 34:35.206
MALCOLM BRABANT: Malmo, Sweden's
third city, is seeing the
biggest influx. This is a magnet

34:35.206 --> 34:39.144
for newcomers because the city
already has a large migrant
population.

34:39.144 --> 34:44.149
And again here, the council is
trying to find shelter for 1,000
unaccompanied minors and

34:44.149 --> 34:49.988
is competing with the migration
board to find accommodation.

34:49.988 --> 34:54.659
Center-right economist Tino
Sanandaji, originally from
Iranian Kurdistan, is highly
critical

34:54.659 --> 34:57.762
of the Social Democrat
government's open-door policy.

34:57.762 --> 35:01.533
TINO SANANDAJI, Economist: I
think it's quite disastrous, and
especially if it continues.

35:01.533 --> 35:09.140
If it continues, this is an
irreversible social experiment
that no wealthy state has ever

35:09.140 --> 35:15.347
attempted. And there is a
palpable sense of crisis, but
there is really almost no ideas

35:15.347 --> 35:19.684
or visions and so on about
how this can be solved.

35:19.684 --> 35:23.621
They're just sort of postponing
it to the future. And,
temporarily, they are using,

35:23.621 --> 35:30.428
I would argue, politically
correct spin to calm the public.

35:30.428 --> 35:33.465
MALCOLM BRABANT: Sweden's
immigration minister, Morgan
Johansson, wasn't available for
interview

35:33.465 --> 35:36.768
this week, but I spoke to
him just over a month ago.

35:36.768 --> 35:39.738
What do you say to those people
who think that your immigration
policy, your open-door

35:39.738 --> 35:41.773
policy, is naive?

35:41.773 --> 35:46.411
MORGAN JOHANSSON, Swedish
Immigration Minister: I say that
this is -- we are now suffering

35:46.411 --> 35:53.451
from one of the worst
humanitarian crises in our time,
seeing the people running,
fleeing

35:53.451 --> 35:57.222
from Syria, over 12 million
people, from the war.

35:57.222 --> 36:02.127
And I would say, if you say like
that, if you put it like that,
just turn on your television

36:02.127 --> 36:08.133
set and see for yourself what
these people are fleeing from.
We, as a country, has an

36:08.133 --> 36:11.970
obligation to help.

36:11.970 --> 36:16.608
MALCOLM BRABANT: The government
has acknowledged that Sweden
will have to implement
extraordinary

36:16.608 --> 36:21.646
measures. It forecasts a
difficult autumn, although it
insists the country can cope.

36:21.646 --> 36:26.384
In Ystad, Abed has a message
for worried Swedes.

36:26.384 --> 36:29.788
ABED ALLMUGHARBEL: I hope one
day to go back to Syria when the
war is over. Everyone here

36:29.788 --> 36:34.426
will hope -- hoping -- is hoping
to go back to Syria when the war
is over.

36:34.426 --> 36:38.596
MALCOLM BRABANT: Abed hopes to
be an asset to Sweden. But
amongst the growing number

36:38.596 --> 36:43.001
of skeptics, there is a fear
that many of his fellow
newcomers will be a drain on
society.

36:43.001 --> 36:50.942
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant in Sweden.

36:50.942 --> 37:02.620
JUDY WOODRUFF: He took on
perhaps the most important job
in the financial world a year

37:02.620 --> 37:06.524
before a global
economic collapse.

37:06.524 --> 37:11.196
Former Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke reflects on that
turbulent time in a new book,

37:11.196 --> 37:15.767
"The Courage to Act: A Memoir
of a Crisis and Its Aftermath."

37:15.767 --> 37:18.036
Ben Bernanke, welcome
to the program.

37:18.036 --> 37:19.270
BEN BERNANKE, Former Federal
Reserve Chairman: Thank you for
inviting me.

37:19.270 --> 37:24.309
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you write in
this remarkable book that takes
us inside not only your life,

37:24.309 --> 37:30.849
inside the Fed, a place we don't
hear about very often, that if
you and your colleagues

37:30.849 --> 37:37.789
had not acted as you did in
2008, that we could have seen
something like 1929 again.

37:37.789 --> 37:40.325
Do you really believe
that might have happened?

37:40.325 --> 37:45.630
BEN BERNANKE: Well, nobody can
know for sure, but, as an
academic, I studied the Great
Depression.

37:45.630 --> 37:50.301
I studied how financial panics
affect the economy. And I was
very concerned about that,

37:50.301 --> 37:56.608
you know, even before Lehman
Brothers, even before the
financial panic hit its peak.

37:56.608 --> 38:01.179
But after Lehman Brothers, and
when the financial panic
accelerated, we saw just a
tremendous

38:01.179 --> 38:06.351
drop-off in the economy, as
sharp as the beginning of the
Great Depression. So, I really
do believe

38:06.351 --> 38:10.355
that it would have been a very,
very serious and protracted
downturn if the financial crisis

38:10.355 --> 38:12.123
had not been arrested.

38:12.123 --> 38:15.927
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the title --
in the title is "The Courage to
Act."

38:15.927 --> 38:20.098
But I guess one question is, did
you and your colleagues really
have a choice? If things

38:20.098 --> 38:23.368
were about to fall apart, what
else could you have done?

38:23.368 --> 38:27.505
BEN BERNANKE: Well, the title
refers to policy-makers around
the world.

38:27.505 --> 38:33.211
It was a very chaotic situation,
a very scary situation, big,
high-stakes decisions and

38:33.211 --> 38:39.083
in a very uncertain and
politically difficult
environment. And people --
policy-makers could

38:39.083 --> 38:43.555
have been passive. That was what
some commentators were urging,
for example, that we should just

38:43.555 --> 38:47.926
step back and let the
market take care of it.

38:47.926 --> 38:51.162
So it was very difficult to do
that. And I'm glad to have been
part of a Fed and Treasury

38:51.162 --> 38:54.866
team that took the
action that was needed.

38:54.866 --> 38:58.136
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the goals
of what happened was to make
sure there would no longer be

38:58.136 --> 39:02.006
this concept of too big to fail.

39:02.006 --> 39:06.978
But a lot of people look at this
today and they say the banks
have just gotten big, big,

39:06.978 --> 39:13.418
bigger in the ensuing seven
years. And the sort of cynical
view is, look, if one of these

39:13.418 --> 39:15.587
big banks went under, the
government would have to bail
them out again. Is that really

39:15.587 --> 39:17.956
where we are again?

39:17.956 --> 39:22.827
BEN BERNANKE: Well, too big to
fail remains an issue, but we're
making progress, I think.

39:22.827 --> 39:29.334
First of all, with the
post-crisis reforms, banks have
to hold a lot more capital, that

39:29.334 --> 39:34.405
is to say, be less levered, hold
more equity than they did before
the crisis. And so it

39:34.405 --> 39:39.410
would take a lot more to put a
big bank on the verge of
failure. That's the first thing.

39:39.410 --> 39:43.381
Second thing, the big banks are
under much tighter supervision
now and being watched

39:43.381 --> 39:48.987
more carefully than they were.
And, finally, Dodd-Frank gave
the regulators the power,

39:48.987 --> 39:53.691
the tools to disassemble a big
bank or a big financial
institution in a way that didn't

39:53.691 --> 39:56.427
bring down the rest of
the financial system.

39:56.427 --> 40:03.868
And we're already seeing that
some of the big banks are --
their credit ratings are

40:03.868 --> 40:09.741
being reduced, because the
credit rating agencies say they
can no longer count on
government

40:09.741 --> 40:13.878
help. So, I wouldn't say the
problem is solved, by any means,
but it's very much in the --
under

40:13.878 --> 40:18.950
the radar, and it's being paid
attention to and progress is
being made there.

40:18.950 --> 40:22.787
JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot of
conversation this week, Ben
Bernanke, about whether
financial

40:22.787 --> 40:26.457
executives should have gone to
jail. You have been asked about
it. What do you think?

40:26.457 --> 40:30.762
BEN BERNANKE: Well, what I was
saying there was, I was making a
comment on the Department

40:30.762 --> 40:33.765
of Justice strategy.

40:33.765 --> 40:37.535
So, the Fed is not an
enforcement agency. That wasn't
our call. So, the Department of

40:37.535 --> 40:42.440
Justice, the strategy they
followed, at least initially,
was to go after institutions and

40:42.440 --> 40:47.045
to penalize the big banks
billions of dollars for their
misbehavior.

40:47.045 --> 40:51.049
And my reaction to that was
that, you know, corporations are
legal fictions. They don't

40:51.049 --> 40:56.487
themselves take legal or illegal
actions. It's individuals who
make those decisions.

40:56.487 --> 41:01.693
And I would have preferred to
have seen the strategy been to
go and determine who -- what

41:01.693 --> 41:04.862
individuals were responsible.
And then we would have found out
more, I think, and maybe

41:04.862 --> 41:07.231
been more accountable that way.

41:07.231 --> 41:09.701
JUDY WOODRUFF: But that wasn't
done. Do you believe you know
who should have been held

41:09.701 --> 41:10.635
responsible, the individuals?

41:10.635 --> 41:13.204
BEN BERNANKE: No, I don't.

41:13.204 --> 41:17.842
I mean, at least be
investigated. We saw some cases
where people have gone to jail
for market

41:17.842 --> 41:22.780
rigging and other kinds of
blatant things. But it's a fine
line in finance between being

41:22.780 --> 41:25.583
reckless and irresponsible and
breaking the law. And I think
those situations needed to

41:25.583 --> 41:28.119
be investigated.

41:28.119 --> 41:34.459
JUDY WOODRUFF: Aside from the
executives at the big banks,
just in terms of ordinary
Americans,

41:34.459 --> 41:39.197
people who go about their daily
lives, you hear so much
conversation today about how,

41:39.197 --> 41:46.070
yes, the economy is growing
again, yes, it's come back in
many ways we measure, but still

41:46.070 --> 41:50.742
people express a feeling of
anxiety, of worry that the
economy hasn't taken off, it
hasn't

41:50.742 --> 41:54.879
soared the way it did before.

41:54.879 --> 41:58.683
How do you -- what do you say to
people who are out there and
still feeling very insecure?

41:58.683 --> 42:02.920
BEN BERNANKE: Well, one of the
issues is that the economy isn't
serving the whole public,

42:02.920 --> 42:05.790
the whole population equally.

42:05.790 --> 42:10.061
I mean, obviously, a lot of the
benefit of the growth and
recovery has gone to the upper

42:10.061 --> 42:16.634
-- more upper-income class. And
that was, in some sense,
predictable, because we have

42:16.634 --> 42:21.606
been seeing greater inequality
across the population for now
30, 35 years, at least.

42:21.606 --> 42:24.442
It's a very long-term trend.

42:24.442 --> 42:28.880
It's a very difficult trend to
correct. I don't think it has
much to do with the Fed

42:28.880 --> 42:33.684
or the financial crisis. It's
just a very long-term trend that
arises from globalization,

42:33.684 --> 42:38.156
from technical change, from
insufficient skills. So, it's
understandable.

42:38.156 --> 42:42.593
I mean, I understand exactly
what the concern is, but it's
not something that the Fed
really

42:42.593 --> 42:44.896
had much control over.

42:44.896 --> 42:48.833
JUDY WOODRUFF: The last thing I
want to ask you about is
Congress. You do refer in the

42:48.833 --> 42:53.371
book to dealing with members of
Congress, being frustrated, in
many cases, because they

42:53.371 --> 42:56.841
were telling you behind the
scenes that they were
supportive, but in public they
weren't

42:56.841 --> 43:01.012
able to do that, frustration
about ideology.

43:01.012 --> 43:05.216
Today, we, of course, see the
big development among House
Republicans not able to agree

43:05.216 --> 43:11.756
on their new leadership. How do
you see the Congress? Is it --
and this sense of ideology,

43:11.756 --> 43:14.258
in your view, going to stand in
the way of what's in the best
interest for the country,

43:14.258 --> 43:15.927
whether it's far
left or far right?

43:15.927 --> 43:18.663
BEN BERNANKE: Yes,
I think it could.

43:18.663 --> 43:26.838
Ideology leads to talking points
and allegiances, and that, in
turn, kind of blocks out subtle

43:26.838 --> 43:31.042
discussions of complicated
issues. It blocks out
cooperation across the aisle,
working

43:31.042 --> 43:33.845
together to solve problems.

43:33.845 --> 43:39.250
I'm hopeful that, you know, as
we move forward, that more
politicians will look to the
center

43:39.250 --> 43:42.753
and look to try to work across
the aisle to address some of the
real serious issues, including

43:42.753 --> 43:45.122
the one of inequality
that you raised.

43:45.122 --> 43:48.226
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you
think the cost of this is?

43:48.226 --> 43:52.730
BEN BERNANKE: Well, it means
that our political system is
paralyzed, and some important
steps

43:52.730 --> 43:56.133
that could be -- make our
economy stronger, and more
efficient and more equitable
will

43:56.133 --> 43:57.802
not get taken, or at least
not get taken a while.

43:57.802 --> 44:03.241
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the
consequence of that is, things
don't get done.

44:03.241 --> 44:08.779
BEN BERNANKE: It's a little bit
self-reinforcing, because, if
these things don't get done,
then

44:08.779 --> 44:13.384
the public becomes even more
disillusioned, and that feeds
back into extreme and partisan

44:13.384 --> 44:15.119
politics.

44:15.119 --> 44:20.191
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Ben
Bernanke, there is much more to
talk to you about. The book is

44:20.191 --> 44:25.162
really a remarkable one, looking
at your life and your
experiences at the Fed. It's
"The

44:25.162 --> 44:27.565
Courage to Act: A Memoir of a
Crisis and Its Aftermath."

44:27.565 --> 44:30.635
Ben Bernanke, we thank you.

44:30.635 --> 44:39.377
BEN BERNANKE: Well, thank you.

44:39.377 --> 44:46.284
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we just heard
from Ben Bernanke, one of the
central concerns people bring up

44:46.284 --> 44:51.322
about the economy is inequality
and the lack of social mobility.

44:51.322 --> 44:56.193
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman, has long been
reporting on those issues. And,

44:56.193 --> 45:00.498
tonight, he explores the role
of behavior in all of this.

45:00.498 --> 45:04.368
It's part of our weekly series
Making Sense, which airs every
Thursday on the "NewsHour."

45:04.368 --> 45:07.471
PAUL SOLMAN: So how
does this game work?

45:07.471 --> 45:09.473
AKIHIRO NISHI, Yale University:
So in front of you now, you have
a tablet.

45:09.473 --> 45:12.310
PAUL SOLMAN: Right.

45:12.310 --> 45:18.182
Akihiro Nishi is prepping me to
play an economic inequality game
at Yale University's Human

45:18.182 --> 45:23.721
Nature Lab. In the game, each
player is at the center of a
small group within the larger

45:23.721 --> 45:28.292
community. And in each round of
the game, without knowing what
the others are doing,

45:28.292 --> 45:33.864
we choose either to cooperate,
that is donate 50 units, which
automatically double, to each

45:33.864 --> 45:38.636
of the others in our group, or
to defect and not donate to
anyone, just take from those

45:38.636 --> 45:41.405
who cooperate.

45:41.405 --> 45:48.312
The game is designed to explore
the human behaviors that fuel
economic inequality, a

45:48.312 --> 45:52.216
hot political issue for several
years now, which Senator Bernie
Sanders has made the

45:52.216 --> 45:54.919
centerpiece of his
presidential campaign.

45:54.919 --> 45:57.655
As he told Judy Woodruff in May:

45:57.655 --> 46:00.291
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Ninety-nine percent of all new
income is going

46:00.291 --> 46:05.363
to the top 1 percent. The top
one-10th of 1 percent owns
almost as much wealth as the

46:05.363 --> 46:09.000
bottom 90 percent. That is
immoral and unsustainable.

46:09.000 --> 46:13.037
PAUL SOLMAN: Back in the Human
Nature Lab, it was time to
recruit players online.

46:13.037 --> 46:17.041
AKIHIRO NISHI: If you will look
behind you for a moment, you
will see now the job is

46:17.041 --> 46:21.312
actually posted, and all these
people are joining from all over
the world.

46:21.312 --> 46:22.913
PAUL SOLMAN: And so
here I have 200.

46:22.913 --> 46:24.015
AKIHIRO NISHI: Right.

46:24.015 --> 46:27.218
PAUL SOLMAN: In the game.

46:27.218 --> 46:30.755
We'd each been assigned a
certain amount of wealth. The
distribution mimicked the degree

46:30.755 --> 46:34.525
of inequality in the U.S.

46:34.525 --> 46:40.765
And I have four other players
with 200, and I have one player
with 1,150. Where did this

46:40.765 --> 46:41.966
guy come from, Silicon Valley?

46:41.966 --> 46:44.735
AKIHIRO NISHI: Maybe.

46:44.735 --> 46:51.042
PAUL SOLMAN: So, round one,
first decision, give each fellow
player 50 of my units, so

46:51.042 --> 46:56.747
they get 100, and hope that they
do the same for me, or defect,
keep my cash and rake it

46:56.747 --> 46:58.783
in from any who chose to share.

46:58.783 --> 47:00.885
So, I just go like that, right?

47:00.885 --> 47:01.786
I cooperated.

47:01.786 --> 47:04.555
There we go.

47:04.555 --> 47:08.926
Risky, since, with five fellow
players, 50 units apiece put me
50 in the hole.

47:08.926 --> 47:10.828
So, did my neighbors cooperate?

47:10.828 --> 47:12.196
Come on, guys.

47:12.196 --> 47:14.699
AKIHIRO NISHI: Let's see.

47:14.699 --> 47:20.071
PAUL SOLMAN: Oh, look, so three
of them came back, so I'm up to
250.

47:20.071 --> 47:25.342
Somewhat subverting my faith in
human kindness, however, two
players had defected, including

47:25.342 --> 47:33.150
the fat cat who'd started out at
1,150 and now had 1,550. Thus,
the gap between fat cat

47:33.150 --> 47:36.387
and the rest had grown,
reflecting the trend outside
this room that we have been
covering

47:36.387 --> 47:39.090
for years now.

47:39.090 --> 47:42.960
Laid-off middle manager Denise
Barrant was losing her home in
foreclosure, a case study

47:42.960 --> 47:45.296
in downward mobility.

47:45.296 --> 47:49.900
DENISE BARRANT, Homeowner: The
top 1 percent is living well,
and they don't get it. They

47:49.900 --> 47:53.604
don't get what is happening to
this country. And I feel like
we're creating a Third World

47:53.604 --> 47:56.307
country subculture
within this country.

47:56.307 --> 47:59.910
PAUL SOLMAN: At the Human Nature
Lab, Nick Christakis studies
inequality and the key

47:59.910 --> 48:02.446
questions it raises.

48:02.446 --> 48:04.348
NICHOLAS CHRISTAKIS, Yale
University: Does inequality
retard economic growth? Does it

48:04.348 --> 48:05.916
affect whether we connect
to other people?

48:05.916 --> 48:07.585
PAUL SOLMAN: How happy we are.

48:07.585 --> 48:10.020
NICHOLAS CHRISTAKIS: Or how
happy we are or how healthy we
are?

48:10.020 --> 48:13.491
PAUL SOLMAN: And there's plenty
of evidence that extreme
inequality affects all these

48:13.491 --> 48:16.427
things negatively.

48:16.427 --> 48:19.764
As Berkeley psychologist
Dacher Keltner told us:

48:19.764 --> 48:21.499
DACHER KELTNER, University of
California, Berkeley: No matter
how you look at it, the

48:21.499 --> 48:26.470
effects of inequality are
pernicious upon things like
bullying on school playgrounds,

48:26.470 --> 48:28.506
the quality of your physical
health, how you handle disease.

48:28.506 --> 48:31.876
PAUL SOLMAN: That's
for those below.

48:31.876 --> 48:37.047
Under Keltner's aegis, post-doc
fellow Paul Piff ran a rafter of
peer-reviewed studies

48:37.047 --> 48:42.820
on those atop the economy. Turns
out people with fancier cars
were more likely to run

48:42.820 --> 48:48.192
crosswalks where pedestrians
waited. The more money they had,
the more people helped
themselves

48:48.192 --> 48:52.830
to candy meant for children,
cheated in a game of chance,
even spent more time primping

48:52.830 --> 48:54.765
in a mirror.

48:54.765 --> 48:58.269
PAUL PIFF, University of
California, Berkeley: I ran a
study where I asked thousands of
people

48:58.269 --> 49:07.812
to tell me, is It moral to step
on another person to get ahead?
My wealthiest participants

49:07.812 --> 49:12.883
were way more likely to believe
that greed and self-interest is
a moral and good thing.

49:12.883 --> 49:15.986
PAUL SOLMAN: This guy, I'm
definitely cutting him.

49:15.986 --> 49:20.191
No wonder, then, that when given
the choice at the end of each
round whether to keep or

49:20.191 --> 49:27.198
cut ties with a few other
players, I was eager to banish
rich defectors. He's got 3,600.

49:27.198 --> 49:29.600
And I am resentful of people who
have a lot of money and aren't
willing to share. That's

49:29.600 --> 49:31.335
for sure.

49:31.335 --> 49:35.306
Meanwhile, I was sticking to my
default strategy, in this game,
as in life.

49:35.306 --> 49:39.076
I'm going to say, yes,
I cooperate again.

49:39.076 --> 49:43.314
Cooperation, and, ever so
encouragingly, winning converts
to the high road.

49:43.314 --> 49:49.220
Ah, look at that. I'm up to 750
now, and everybody is a
cooperator.

49:49.220 --> 49:52.256
PAUL SOLMAN: This is fantastic.
Now we're all getting wealthy.
I'm actually one of the

49:52.256 --> 49:53.624
wealth -- well no, not really.

49:53.624 --> 49:55.926
AKIHIRO NISHI: No, still
around the bottom.

49:55.926 --> 49:59.129
PAUL SOLMAN: All right, you
don't have to -- don't rub it
in, Akihiro.

49:59.129 --> 50:03.567
But rub it in, he and Professor
Christakis did, because the
first major finding after

50:03.567 --> 50:06.103
running the game
hundreds of times?

50:06.103 --> 50:09.206
NICHOLAS CHRISTAKIS: The poor
stayed poor and the rich stayed
rich.

50:09.206 --> 50:14.044
PAUL SOLMAN: But it's not as if
the game's less-well-off aren't,
like I was, trying.

50:14.044 --> 50:18.716
NICHOLAS CHRISTAKIS: The poor
people are generally trying to
cooperate and are trying to
invest

50:18.716 --> 50:21.452
in their neighbors to
acquire wealth themselves.

50:21.452 --> 50:26.223
PAUL SOLMAN: And that's as in
the real world. That is, poorer
people do give more as a
percentage

50:26.223 --> 50:28.259
of their wealth to
other people, right?

50:28.259 --> 50:30.027
NICHOLAS CHRISTAKIS:
Yes. That's correct.

50:30.027 --> 50:33.797
PAUL SOLMAN: Maybe because of a
greater need for empathy, as
documented by this Berkeley

50:33.797 --> 50:39.570
study gauging response
to a sad hospital video.

50:39.570 --> 50:43.674
CHILD: I'm 12 years old, and I
have neuroblastoma, and I have
been fighting it for seven
years.

50:43.674 --> 50:48.445
PAUL SOLMAN: Lower-income
subjects not only reported more
compassion. Their vital signs

50:48.445 --> 50:54.451
indicated they really meant it.
Compassion and its corollary,
cooperation, is a coping

50:54.451 --> 50:58.989
strategy, says psychologist Rudy
Mendoza-Denton, because, without
wealth, what can poor people

50:58.989 --> 51:00.691
count on?

51:00.691 --> 51:03.494
RUDY MENDOZA-DENTON,
Psychologist: Their friends,
their family, their community.

51:03.494 --> 51:06.864
PAUL SOLMAN: And back in the
lab, my cooperation strategy
seemed to be working wonders.

51:06.864 --> 51:07.932
Oh, look, everybody's...

51:07.932 --> 51:09.433
(LAUGHTER)

51:09.433 --> 51:12.903
PAUL SOLMAN: Everybody is
cooperating with me. I'm up to
1,650.

51:12.903 --> 51:14.972
AKIHIRO NISHI: OK.

51:14.972 --> 51:19.109
PAUL SOLMAN: But, if you always
cooperate, you're liable to be a
sitting duck.

51:19.109 --> 51:20.210
Look at that.

51:20.210 --> 51:22.479
AKIHIRO NISHI: What happened?

51:22.479 --> 51:27.985
PAUL SOLMAN: Four of them
defected. Moreover, I am
noticing something disturbing,
which

51:27.985 --> 51:32.156
is that the defectors all have
more money than the cooperators.

51:32.156 --> 51:34.258
AKIHIRO NISHI: Right,
including you.

51:34.258 --> 51:37.594
PAUL SOLMAN: And thus the
experiment's second major
finding:

51:37.594 --> 51:42.199
NICHOLAS CHRISTAKIS: It wasn't
inequality, per se, that was so
bad for society, but the

51:42.199 --> 51:47.638
visibility that was a problem.
Visibility encouraged the rich
to take advantage of their

51:47.638 --> 51:51.075
neighbors and created a kind
of exploitation scenario.

51:51.075 --> 51:53.911
PAUL SOLMAN: But in some
versions of this game, players
didn't know how much others

51:53.911 --> 51:55.846
had.

51:55.846 --> 51:59.917
NICHOLAS CHRISTAKIS: In the
societies in which we concealed
individual wealth, those
societies

51:59.917 --> 52:04.755
were wealthier in the end, more
cooperative and more friendly.

52:04.755 --> 52:10.361
PAUL SOLMAN: And so, if
visibility of wealth makes the
rich more aggressive,
exacerbating

52:10.361 --> 52:16.867
inequality, the policy
implications with regard to,
say, executive pay, seem, in the
end,

52:16.867 --> 52:18.702
pretty ironic.

52:18.702 --> 52:21.972
NICHOLAS CHRISTAKIS: What it
suggests is that in firms where
everyone makes about the same

52:21.972 --> 52:27.211
amount of money, you should open
it up and make pay very
transparent. Increase
visibility,

52:27.211 --> 52:30.781
that will increase cooperation
between people, increase
economic growth, our experiments

52:30.781 --> 52:34.451
would suggest, and increase
social connections.

52:34.451 --> 52:38.055
Conversely, if there's high
levels of inequality and the CEO
makes five hundred times what

52:38.055 --> 52:38.956
a line worker...

52:38.956 --> 52:39.223
(CROSSTALK)

52:39.223 --> 52:40.257
PAUL SOLMAN: Hide it.

52:40.257 --> 52:40.924
NICHOLAS CHRISTAKIS: Hide it.

52:40.924 --> 52:42.359
(LAUGHTER)

52:42.359 --> 52:46.363
NICHOLAS CHRISTAKIS: Because, if
you make it visible, it has the
opposite effect.

52:46.363 --> 52:50.534
PAUL SOLMAN: This is economics
correspondent Paul Solman,
reporting, somewhat dejectedly,

52:50.534 --> 52:57.741
from New Haven, Connecticut.

52:57.741 --> 53:08.218
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: A new program in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, is

53:08.218 --> 53:13.524
helping low-wage workers by
providing mentoring and tutoring
for their children. It's part

53:13.524 --> 53:18.028
of a citywide effort to improve
graduation rates, and it seems
to be working. Read about

53:18.028 --> 53:22.466
that from our partners
at The Hechinger Report.

53:22.466 --> 53:28.672
And today is National Poetry
Day, so we asked you to tweet us
a haiku. We gathered several

53:28.672 --> 53:34.144
of those, including
"NewsHour"-themed haikus, which
you can read on our home page.

53:34.144 --> 53:39.883
All that and more is on our
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:39.883 --> 53:45.055
And tune in later tonight on
"Charlie Rose": republican
presidential candidate Ben
Carson.

53:45.055 --> 53:48.592
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:48.592 --> 53:53.330
Join us online and right here
again tomorrow evening with Mark
Shields and David Brooks.

53:53.330 --> 53:54.731
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you, and good
night.
