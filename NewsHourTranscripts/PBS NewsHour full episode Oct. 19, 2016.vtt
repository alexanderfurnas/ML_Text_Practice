00:06.240 --> 00:07.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gwen Ifill is away.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton
go head to

00:11.912 --> 00:17.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
head for the last time before
Election Day
-- what to watch for in the
final debate.

00:17.417 --> 00:21.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Wednesday:
Ecuador's government cuts off
Internet access

00:21.822 --> 00:26.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Julian Assange after the
WikiLeaks founder
released another batch of
e-mails from the

00:26.360 --> 00:28.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton campaign.

00:28.161 --> 00:33.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how
experimental agriculture
methods are helping farmers keep
water and

00:33.066 --> 00:36.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fertilizer on their crops and
away from rivers
they could be polluting.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY SEIM, Farmer: I don't
think there's
any farmer that wakes up in the
morning and

00:40.007 --> 00:43.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says, I'm just going to go dump
1,000 gallons
of fertilizer down a ditch.

00:43.710 --> 00:44.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everybody's trying.

00:44.711 --> 00:45.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just that it doesn't always
work.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a lot of things that we
can't control.

00:47.681 --> 00:54.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:54.888 --> 00:57.691 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:57.724 --> 01:05.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Once more,
with hard feelings.

01:05.465 --> 01:10.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight's presidential debate is
a climactic
moment in a bitter contest
headlined by talk

01:10.103 --> 01:13.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of sexual misdeeds and e-mail
malfeasance.

01:13.273 --> 01:15.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage
from Las Vegas.

01:15.575 --> 01:22.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The final face-off
comes as Donald
Trump is facing sliding poll
numbers, allegations

01:22.182 --> 01:26.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of sexual assaults and is
pressing his own
claims about rigged elections.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.355 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:28.388 --> 01:28.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
He sort of telegraphed a little
bit it's going

01:28.956 --> 01:30.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be scorched earth.

01:30.791 --> 01:34.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Campaigning in Ohio
today, Hillary
Clinton's running mate, Tim
Kaine, predicted

01:34.828 --> 01:36.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his nominee won't be rattled.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.932 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:38.966 --> 01:42.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE: Hillary is going to
be very strong,
very strong on facts and the
details and demonstrating

01:42.402 --> 01:43.670 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
knowledge.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think she will be what she
was in the
first two debates.

01:46.440 --> 01:51.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She will be steady and calm,
whatever Donald
Trump tries to throw at her.

01:51.044 --> 01:56.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: One thing Donald
Trump could throw,
a new allegation against former
President

01:56.283 --> 01:58.085 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bill Clinton.

01:58.118 --> 02:03.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Breitbart News reported today
that Leslie
Millwee, a former Arkansas TV
reporter, claims

02:03.323 --> 02:08.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that then-Governor Clinton
sexually assaulted
her three times in 1980.

02:08.462 --> 02:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump campaign chairman Steve
Bannon is on
leave as Breitbart News
executive chairman.

02:14.101 --> 02:18.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's number two, Mike Pence,
didn't mention
the report today, but in
Durango, Colorado,

02:18.505 --> 02:22.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he argued that his man is set to
deliver a
strong performance.

02:22.175 --> 02:23.977 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
You sure saw that on the stage
in his last

02:25.679 --> 02:29.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debate a week ago Sunday, didn't
you, when
he beat Hillary Clinton hands
down.

02:29.883 --> 02:33.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I promise you, I'm going to
get on an
airplane.

02:33.253 --> 02:36.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm headed to Vegas, because
you're going
to see it happen again tonight.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:38.458 --> 02:43.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Chris Wallace of FOX
News will
moderate the 90-minute debate on
six topics

02:43.397 --> 02:50.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 15-minute segments: debt and
entitlements,
immigration, the economy, the
Supreme Court,

02:50.971 --> 02:53.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foreign hot spots, and fitness
to be president.

02:53.840 --> 02:57.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And on the sidelines,
psychological warfare.

02:57.611 --> 03:03.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump campaign has invited
Malik Obama,
President Obama's Kenyan-born
half-brother,

03:03.417 --> 03:08.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but denies it's trying to
resurrect claims
that the president was born in
Kenya.

03:08.622 --> 03:13.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another Trump guest, Patricia
Smith, the mother
of a State Department employee
killed in the

03:13.560 --> 03:16.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
attack on the diplomatic
compound in Benghazi,
Libya.

03:16.163 --> 03:22.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Clinton camp has invited two
business
figures highly critical of
Trump, former Hewlett-Packard

03:22.569 --> 03:26.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CEO Meg Whitman and billionaire
Mark Cuban.

03:27.007 --> 03:31.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Traditionally, these third and
last two debates
have featured the candidates
sitting at a

03:31.945 --> 03:37.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
table together for a sort of
more intimate
setting, but tonight a change.

03:37.117 --> 03:42.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The two candidates will be at
lecterns for
a more formal setting.

03:42.656 --> 03:46.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not clear who asked for it,
but both
campaigns agreed to the change.

03:46.660 --> 03:49.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you want to know about those
hard feelings.

03:49.329 --> 03:54.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Don't expect a handshake tonight
when the
two families are introduced into
the hall

03:54.101 --> 03:55.168 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
-- Hari.

03:55.202 --> 03:57.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: John, what
about the preparations?

03:57.771 --> 04:00.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How did the candidates prepare
today?

04:00.507 --> 04:05.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, Hillary Clinton
has been
true to form, the same way she
has prepared

04:05.779 --> 04:08.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the last two days -- last two
debates, rather.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She flew in last night.

04:10.317 --> 04:15.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's at the Four Seasons Hotel
here in Las
Vegas doing several hours of
debate prep on

04:15.856 --> 04:19.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate day, getting those
last-minute debate
preps in.

04:19.092 --> 04:23.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her entire debate team flew out
with her,
including Philippe Reines, who
has been standing

04:23.597 --> 04:25.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in for Donald Trump.

04:25.332 --> 04:27.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, on the other hand,
is a little
bit of change.

04:27.834 --> 04:33.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has acquiesced to advisers
who wanted a
little more serious and more
formal debate

04:33.640 --> 04:36.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
prep, but still no mock debates.

04:36.176 --> 04:40.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning, Kellyanne Conway,
the campaign
manager, was asked what her
advice would be

04:40.747 --> 04:41.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to her candidate.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She said one word: focus.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Nevadans are
used to fight
night.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are used to the Mayweather
battle, the
showdowns and so forth.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you have been reporting from
there.

04:51.958 --> 04:56.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are the people in the state
cognizant of how
important their state could be
in the grand

04:56.997 --> 04:57.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
scheme of things?

04:58.031 --> 05:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: I think they are.

05:00.100 --> 05:04.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They understand that this is a
state that
has voted for the winner in the
election,

05:04.571 --> 05:10.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the winner of the White House in
every campaign
except one since 1908.

05:10.410 --> 05:12.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is a great deal of
excitement.

05:12.212 --> 05:16.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You talk about the heavyweight
prize fights,
the stunts like Evel Knievel
jumping over

05:16.950 --> 05:18.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the fountain at Caesars Palace.

05:18.618 --> 05:20.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of people are going to be
watching here
tonight.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
John Yang, reporting
from Nevada, we will check in
with you later

05:23.890 --> 05:24.858 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight.

05:24.891 --> 05:26.693 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

From this place, I appeal to all
local fighters

05:53.019 --> 05:57.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Islamic State group to
lay down their
weapons in order not risk their
lives, so

05:57.390 --> 05:59.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they can return to their
families and their
city.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our forces are advancing and
have surrounded
the city.

JUDY WOODRUFF: In Syria,
relative quiet reigned
in Eastern Aleppo for a second
day, as Russian

06:33.660 --> 06:38.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Syrian forces made ready to
let rebels
and civilians leave the city
tomorrow.

06:38.698 --> 06:42.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United Nations likened the
plan to forced
displacement.

06:42.769 --> 06:47.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

deal to cut the price of a
crucial childhood
vaccine in half.

07:17.037 --> 07:24.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country, professors
from 14 Pennsylvania state
colleges went on

07:33.720 --> 07:36.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strike today, affecting more
than 100,000
students.

07:36.723 --> 07:39.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It stems from a contract dispute
over benefits
and wages.

07:39.559 --> 07:43.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the state's largest
schools, including
Penn State and the University of
Pittsburgh,

07:43.129 --> 07:44.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are not affected.

07:44.364 --> 07:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a relatively
quiet day
on Wall Street.

07:47.167 --> 07:52.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 40
points to close at 18202.

07:52.806 --> 07:56.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose two, and the S&amp;P
500 added
four.

07:56.910 --> 08:01.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
why Ecuador cut off Julian
Assange's Internet;

08:01.648 --> 08:06.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
undercover videos that claim
Democrats are
rigging the election put in
context; a look

08:06.686 --> 08:14.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ahead to tonight's final
presidential debate;
and much more.

08:14.994 --> 08:24.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the last four years, Julian
Assange, the
founder of WikiLeaks, the
anti-secrecy group,

08:24.437 --> 08:29.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been staying in self-imposed
exile in
the Ecuadorian Embassy in
London.

08:29.342 --> 08:34.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's taking refuge from a sexual
assault investigation
in Sweden that Assange claims is
an American

08:34.214 --> 08:36.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
plot to have him extradited.

08:36.616 --> 08:40.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the summer, WikiLeaks began
divulging
thousands of pages of documents
and e-mails

08:40.720 --> 08:45.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stolen from the Democratic
National Committee,
and, most recently, Hillary
Clinton's campaign

08:45.759 --> 08:51.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chairman, all in an effort, said
Assange himself,
to damage her presidential
candidacy.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now a new twist in this saga.

08:53.533 --> 08:58.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement issued yesterday,
Ecuador said
it had cut off Assange's
Internet access,

08:58.738 --> 09:03.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying in part: "The government
of Ecuador
respects the principle of
nonintervention

09:03.810 --> 09:06.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the internal affairs of other
states.

09:06.212 --> 09:11.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't interfere in external
electoral
processes, nor does it favor any
particular

09:11.584 --> 09:13.319 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidate."

09:13.353 --> 09:16.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on this, I'm joined now
from London
by Raphael Satter of the
Associated Press.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's covered WikiLeaks
extensively.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there anything more to it
than that statement
by the Ecuadorian government?

09:21.428 --> 09:25.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAPHAEL SATTER, Associated
Press: You know,
it's not much more -- not much
more official.

09:25.331 --> 09:29.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is an enormous amount of
speculation
about what's going on behind the
scenes.

09:29.869 --> 09:35.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WikiLeaks alleges that, despite
what the Ecuadorian
government has said, they are,
in fact, bound

09:35.575 --> 09:40.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pressure from the U.S. State
Department,
and, in particular, John Kerry,
the secretary

09:40.346 --> 09:41.314 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of state.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, the State Department has
denied all this.

09:43.249 --> 09:47.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The batches of
e-mails have
been trickling out for months,
Hillary Clinton's

09:47.987 --> 09:50.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
e-mails, John Podesta's e-mails
for weeks
now.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.391 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, why now?

09:51.424 --> 09:53.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why intervene now to try to cut
off his Internet
access?

09:53.960 --> 09:55.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAPHAEL SATTER: It's quite
puzzling, actually.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The timing is a bit of a
mystery.

09:58.231 --> 10:03.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the best people to speak
about this are
the parties concerned
themselves.

10:03.603 --> 10:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But neither WikiLeaks nor the
Ecuadorian -- nor
various Ecuadorian officials
that we have

10:07.807 --> 10:11.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tried have returned our calls or
even deigned
to comment.

10:11.978 --> 10:18.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have communicated via
Twitter or through
their Web sites in a series of
terse statements,

10:18.718 --> 10:20.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which leave a lot to the
imagination, frankly.

10:20.587 --> 10:25.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is this a sign
that perhaps
Julian Assange is overstaying
his welcome?

10:25.692 --> 10:31.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAPHAEL SATTER: I think that
people have speculated
about how long Julian could stay
at the Ecuadorian

10:31.698 --> 10:35.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Embassy in London ever since he
came in there.

10:35.802 --> 10:40.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Ecuadorians have themselves
said that
Assange is still welcome to stay
as long as

10:40.340 --> 10:43.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the reasons that he sought
asylum remain the
same.

10:43.743 --> 10:47.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there -- it doesn't seem
like he is going
to get thrown out any time soon.

10:47.180 --> 10:54.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, there have been
rumors of tension
between Assange and his hosts,
and conceivably

10:54.420 --> 10:56.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this could be a sign of that.

10:56.289 --> 10:59.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
Ecuadorians must recognize
that cutting off Internet access
to Julian

10:59.926 --> 11:01.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Assange doesn't mean that they
shut down WikiLeaks.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAPHAEL SATTER: I think they do
realize that.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they were at pains to point
that out in
their statement.

11:07.200 --> 11:13.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said that they don't intend
to interfere
with WikiLeaks' journalistic
activities.

11:13.573 --> 11:18.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for it's worth, WikiLeaks
has continued
to publish, in fact, public
quite aggressively.

11:18.578 --> 11:24.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it seems that, for the
moment at least,
this Internet ban has not hurt
WikiLeaks'

11:24.584 --> 11:26.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ability to publish documents.

11:26.386 --> 11:30.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And still
there's no word
on whether or not Julian Assange
could borrow

11:30.590 --> 11:36.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone's laptop to try to get
instructions
across or give instructions over
a telephone?

11:36.329 --> 11:39.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAPHAEL SATTER: There are really
a lot of
unanswered questions here.

11:39.866 --> 11:44.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Ecuadorians were rather
vague in their
statements.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They said that they were
restricting his Internet
access.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That could conceivably mean a
lot of things.

11:49.642 --> 11:53.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That could mean that he can use
the Internet
for some things and not for
others, or it

11:53.680 --> 11:57.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could mean that he's been kicked
off the Internet
altogether.

11:57.850 --> 12:02.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not clear, and no one's
answered our
questions, whether Julian
Assange can make

12:02.488 --> 12:07.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
phone calls, whether he can send
text messages,
whether he can send courier
messages back

12:07.327 --> 12:08.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and forth.

12:08.828 --> 12:11.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He has a
fairly -- or had
a fairly robust infrastructure.

12:11.464 --> 12:16.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was able to take part in
interviews around
the world, including on this
program a couple

12:16.469 --> 12:17.437 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of months ago.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RAPHAEL SATTER: Yes.

12:19.038 --> 12:22.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think there is any
reason to believe
that infrastructure has gone.

12:22.875 --> 12:27.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Ecuadorian Embassy is not a
very large
space.

12:27.914 --> 12:34.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a rather modest suite on
roughly the
ground floor of a red brick
building on Hans

12:34.854 --> 12:37.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Crescent, which is near the
Harrods department
store.

12:37.957 --> 12:41.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's not a huge amount of
space, but it's
enough to do TV interviews, to
have journalists

12:41.961 --> 12:45.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over every once in a while and
even host celebrity
guests.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Raphael Satter
from the Associated Press,
joining us from

12:48.668 --> 12:50.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
London tonight, thanks so much.

12:50.770 --> 12:58.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAPHAEL SATTER: Thanks for
having me.

12:58.544 --> 13:05.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: WikiLeaks is
not the only
online organization making
political news.

13:05.184 --> 13:09.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins takes a closer
look at a new
release that also targets
Democrats.

13:09.856 --> 13:15.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The videos are
from a conservative
group famous and infamous for
undercover work.

13:15.828 --> 13:17.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
More on them in a minute.

13:17.163 --> 13:19.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But let's start with the
content.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are two videos and two
allegations against
Democrats.

13:22.769 --> 13:28.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first, that operatives for
the left, especially
this man, Scott Foval, have sent
people to

13:28.074 --> 13:30.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump rallies to incite
violence.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To an undercover operative,
Foval says there
is a script.

13:32.979 --> 13:37.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT FOVAL, Americans United
for Change:
It's a matter of showing up, to
want to get

13:38.017 --> 13:46.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the rally in a Planned
Parenthood T-shirt
or Trump is a Nazi.

13:46.759 --> 13:50.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can message to draw them out
and draw
them to punch you.

13:50.830 --> 13:55.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Foval is a
Democratic consultant
who recently worked with a group
called Mobilize

13:55.234 --> 13:57.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hired by the Democratic Party in
June.

13:57.637 --> 14:02.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not clear when the video
was recorded,
but Foval says he works directly
with the

14:02.809 --> 14:04.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
party and the Clinton campaign.

14:04.577 --> 14:09.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT FOVAL: I answer to the
head of special
events for the DNC and the head
of special

14:09.949 --> 14:11.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
events and political for the
campaign.

14:11.884 --> 14:15.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The Democratic
National Committee
flatly says Foval was a
subcontractor and

14:15.855 --> 14:19.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
denies supporting anything like
what Foval
described.

14:19.325 --> 14:23.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what do we know from actual
events on
the campaign trail?

14:23.062 --> 14:30.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember this, the clash of
protesters, supporters
and police in March in Chicago?

14:30.703 --> 14:33.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It led to Donald Trump canceling
a rally.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the tape, another Democratic
operative
brings it up.

14:36.909 --> 14:41.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: So, the Chicago protest
when they shut
all that, that was us.

14:41.547 --> 14:46.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
None of this is supposed to come
back to us,
because we want it coming from
people.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't want it to come from
the party.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's the
first charge.

14:50.890 --> 14:55.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And before we go to the second,
a quick word
about who's behind these videos.

14:55.061 --> 15:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His name is James O'Keefe, a
conservative
whose group, Project Veritas
Action, investigates

15:00.466 --> 15:01.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
left-leaning entities.

15:02.001 --> 15:06.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's been arrested and pled
guilty for some
undercover tactics in the past.

15:06.372 --> 15:11.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
O'Keefe insists his work is
accurate, including
the second charge in these
videos about voter

15:11.944 --> 15:13.746 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fraud.

15:13.780 --> 15:18.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scott Foval seems to talk openly
about bringing
in people from one state to vote
in another.

15:18.351 --> 15:22.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He mentions creating paychecks
and finding
cars with in-state license
plates.

15:22.789 --> 15:23.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT FOVAL: You use shells, use
shell companies.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The cars come from one copy.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The paychecks come from another.

15:28.060 --> 15:33.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At one point,
he stresses
the need to avoid prosecution.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that's not what his boss
says.

Bob Creamer heads up Mobilize,
and contracted
directly for the Democratic
Party.

15:40.506 --> 15:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the video, he pushes back at
an idea to
affect voting.

15:44.210 --> 15:51.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOB CREAMER, Mobilize: I'm going
to run this
by our lawyers.

15:52.018 --> 15:55.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My fear is that someone would
decide that
this was a big voter fraud
scheme.

15:55.188 --> 15:58.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today, the head
of the Democratic
Party released a statement,
saying: "We do

15:58.191 --> 16:04.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not believe, nor do we have any
evidence to
suggest that the activities
alleged occurred."

16:04.063 --> 16:08.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Clinton campaign also gave
us a statement,
saying that those behind the
video are known

16:08.100 --> 16:13.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be misleading, but that the
campaign disavows
the ideas and tactics in the
video, calling

16:13.706 --> 16:16.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them troubling, even as a
theory.

16:16.442 --> 16:19.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One problem here is, we do not
have the raw
footage from these tapes.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We do not have the context for
many of these
words.

16:22.715 --> 16:23.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We do know this.

16:24.016 --> 16:26.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Scott Foval has been fired from
his job.

16:26.319 --> 16:31.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his boss, Bob Creamer, has
ended his work
on the election this year,
saying he doesn't

16:31.557 --> 16:33.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
want to be a distraction.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

16:35.595 --> 16:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we turn now
to preview
tonight's debate with
representatives from

16:39.999 --> 16:41.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
both campaigns.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We start with Donald Trump
supporter Dr. Ben
Carson.

16:43.903 --> 16:49.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke with him a short time
ago, and began
by asking what Donald Trump
needs to do tonight

16:49.342 --> 16:53.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in face of declining polls,
including in key
battleground states.

16:53.079 --> 16:54.714 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BEN CARSON, Conservative
Activist: I hope
he's going to spend a lot of
time talking

16:57.083 --> 17:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the issues that really
concern the American
people, the economy, jobs,
education, immigration,

17:07.226 --> 17:11.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our standing in the world and
how we relate
to the various problems that are
going on

17:11.063 --> 17:12.865 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the world.

17:12.899 --> 17:17.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I hope he will probably
also highlight
some of the things that have
come out, you

17:17.436 --> 17:22.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, in recent weeks about
Hillary Clinton
that many in the news have not
bothered to

17:22.642 --> 17:23.776 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
report on.

17:23.809 --> 17:27.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you referring
to the WikiLeaks
stories?

17:27.580 --> 17:28.547 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

17:28.581 --> 17:29.548 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
BEN CARSON: Yes.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what
specifically?

17:31.951 --> 17:33.753 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

17:33.786 --> 17:42.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARSON: Well, I don't think
there's been
a lot of emphasis on, you know,
the fact that

17:42.094 --> 17:51.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she and her staff have kind of
savaged, you
know, Bernie Sanders, have
talked about Catholics

17:51.837 --> 17:58.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and evangelicals in a way
perhaps not becoming
to the leadership of this
country, where we're

17:58.945 --> 18:04.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supposed to have freedom of
speech, freedom
of religion and freedom of
expression.

18:04.317 --> 18:09.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're told
that Donald
Trump is inviting several guests
to the debate

18:09.889 --> 18:16.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tonight, including the mother of
a State Department
contractor who died at Benghazi,
Libya, and

18:16.162 --> 18:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also a woman who for the first
time is going
public accusing former President
Bill Clinton

18:21.634 --> 18:26.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of sexually assaulting her in
Arkansas in
1980.

18:26.172 --> 18:28.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this where you think the
focus should be
tonight?

18:28.975 --> 18:30.443 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

18:30.476 --> 18:34.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARSON: I would love to see
that kind
of stuff put off to the side.

18:34.547 --> 18:39.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why we have a legal
system, so that
those kind of things could be
redressed.

18:39.185 --> 18:41.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it goes for both sides.

18:41.454 --> 18:48.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I would much prefer to see a
talk on the
issues, because the issues are
gigantic, and

18:48.127 --> 18:51.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the solutions are incredibly
divergent.

18:51.697 --> 18:55.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet I doubt that the average
person on
the street could tell you the
difference between

18:55.868 --> 18:58.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the two, because we just haven't
heard the
discussion.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We just hear about all these
other things.

19:00.773 --> 19:04.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, did you
urge Donald Trump
not to invite these individuals?

19:04.710 --> 19:10.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know he's also invited the
family members
of individuals who were killed
by undocumented

19:10.916 --> 19:12.551 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immigrants.

19:12.585 --> 19:17.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's invited the half-brother of
President
Obama, who is supporting Donald
Trump.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.225 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

19:19.258 --> 19:24.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARSON: I didn't have
anything to do with
who's invited and who's not
invited.

19:24.363 --> 19:28.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we certainly have talked
about the issues.

19:28.367 --> 19:34.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's really what
the American
people deserve to hear about,
you know, particularly

19:34.206 --> 19:35.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when we're talking about the
future.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're talking about our children
and our grandchildren.

19:38.644 --> 19:44.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to be talking about
their financial
foundation, and we need to be
talking about

19:44.183 --> 19:45.918 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
safety for them.

19:45.951 --> 19:49.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we need to be talking about
ways that
we can decrease the tension in
our society,

19:50.022 --> 19:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because a house divided against
itself cannot
stand.

19:52.458 --> 19:56.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know one
of the things
Donald Trump has been talking
about repeatedly

19:56.462 --> 20:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the campaign trail lately is
that this
election, he says, will be
rigged.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's talking about rampant voter
fraud.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you expect that to happen?

20:06.405 --> 20:08.207 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

20:08.240 --> 20:15.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARSON: Well, I do know of
many instances
where things have not been good,
and not just

20:15.648 --> 20:20.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recently, but this is going back
for quite
a period of time.

20:20.219 --> 20:24.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's always baffled me why
we don't try
to fix it.

20:24.790 --> 20:30.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, for instance, when it
comes to the
ballots, it's such an easy thing
to just photograph

20:30.096 --> 20:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a ballot as a person comes in,
so that you
have a backup system, so that if
something

20:35.101 --> 20:40.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes out, and it's variant to
what you thought
it should be, you have a way of
checking it.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are easy things to remedy
if we really
want to do it.

20:44.009 --> 20:45.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For some reason, we don't want
to do it.

20:45.911 --> 20:49.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, one of the
reasons I'm
asking is because his campaign
manager, Kellyanne

20:49.682 --> 20:54.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Conway, said this morning in an
interview
on CNN that she doesn't think
that there is

20:54.386 --> 20:56.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be widespread voter
fraud.

20:56.622 --> 20:58.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, which is right?

20:58.624 --> 20:59.959 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

20:59.992 --> 21:02.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARSON: Well, it really
doesn't matter
what anybody thinks.

21:02.661 --> 21:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does matter is that we
decide that we're
going to fix it.

21:07.166 --> 21:13.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can send a man to the moon,
but we can't
verify something as simple as an
election?

21:13.806 --> 21:16.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course we could do it, if we
had the will
to do it.

21:16.242 --> 21:21.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that, to me, makes a lot more
sense than
any of the arguments on one side
or the other

21:21.347 --> 21:22.281 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
side.

21:22.314 --> 21:24.083 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Just fix it.

21:24.116 --> 21:27.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Carson, we
heard Donald
Trump say in a speech just in
the last few

21:27.920 --> 21:33.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days that if he doesn't win this
election,
that the United States loses its
independence.

21:33.893 --> 21:38.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He talked about dire
circumstances if he doesn't
win.

21:38.697 --> 21:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that how you see what's at
stake here?

21:41.500 --> 21:42.935 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

21:42.968 --> 21:46.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARSON: Well, I have heard
both sides,
you know, make that claim.

21:46.639 --> 21:51.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, certainly they're
entitled
to their opinion.

21:51.944 --> 22:00.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm hopeful that the American
people are wise
enough to guide us through the
difficult times

22:00.286 --> 22:03.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that lay ahead for us.

22:03.322 --> 22:07.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to have difficult
times either
way because of the amount of
debt that we

22:07.293 --> 22:12.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have incurred, because of the
radical Islamic
terrorists who want to destroy
us.

22:12.932 --> 22:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of problems that
aren't going
to go away regardless of who's
elected that

22:17.236 --> 22:18.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we are going to have to deal
with.

22:19.004 --> 22:24.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Ben Carson,
joining us
from Las Vegas at the debate
site, we thank

22:24.443 --> 22:25.411 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

22:25.444 --> 22:26.412 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

22:26.445 --> 22:27.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEN CARSON: Wonderful to be with
you.

22:27.479 --> 22:28.614 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you, Judy.

22:28.647 --> 22:31.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we turn
to Robby Mook.

22:31.217 --> 22:33.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's the campaign manager for
Hillary Clinton.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to the program.

22:35.421 --> 22:41.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, Robby Mook, first of all,
we know Hillary
Clinton is doing well in the
polls, so what

22:41.260 --> 22:42.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
does she need to do tonight?

22:42.895 --> 22:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can she just sort of rest on her
laurels and
sit back and not take any
chances?

22:47.366 --> 22:50.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBBY MOOK, Hillary Clinton
Campaign Manager:
Well, not at all, Judy.

22:50.502 --> 22:53.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, our campaign
doesn't take anything
for granted.

22:53.138 --> 22:55.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We run like we're 20 points
behind no matter
what.

22:55.507 --> 23:00.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, more importantly, this
debate is a terrific
opportunity for Hillary to speak
directly

23:00.713 --> 23:05.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the American people in an
unfiltered way
about the real plans that she
has to make

23:05.684 --> 23:07.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a difference in their lives.

23:07.953 --> 23:11.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This election is supposed to be
about the
American people, supposed to be
about their

23:11.090 --> 23:12.891 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

23:12.925 --> 23:15.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the candidates are supposed
to be on that
stage proving that they can
actually make

23:15.327 --> 23:17.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a difference and actually
improve people's
lives.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that's what we hope that
this debate
is about.

23:20.532 --> 23:22.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary's come prepared to the
last two debates.

23:22.534 --> 23:26.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's going to come prepared to
this debate
to have a substantive discussion
of those

23:26.839 --> 23:28.707 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We know, Robby
Mook, that Donald
Trump has invited a number of
individuals

23:31.944 --> 23:37.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be his guests tonight,
including a woman
who is coming forward the first
time to charge

23:37.449 --> 23:41.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Bill Clinton sexually
assaulted her in
1980.

23:41.754 --> 23:48.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's invited the mother of the
man, the State
Department contractor who died
at Benghazi.

23:48.761 --> 23:52.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How will she handle this if it
comes up in
the debate?

23:52.698 --> 23:58.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBBY MOOK: Well, first of all,
Judy, as I
said, Hillary's come to these
debates consistently

23:58.604 --> 24:00.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prepared to talk about the
issues.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump has not.

24:01.807 --> 24:04.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We saw him pull a media stunt
before the last
debate.

24:04.743 --> 24:10.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's clearly trying to use the
tickets he's
given to invite special guests
to pull more

24:10.582 --> 24:12.284 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stunts.

24:12.318 --> 24:14.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're just not going to get
into that
and Hillary's not going to get
into that.

24:14.119 --> 24:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the American people
deserve to hear
substantive answers to real
questions about

24:19.391 --> 24:23.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
real policies, real solutions,
and what these
people are really going to do if
they get

24:23.395 --> 24:24.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the job as president.

24:24.496 --> 24:26.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, she's not going to get
thrown off her
game.

24:26.498 --> 24:30.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald Trump gets to run the
campaign
that he wants to run.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's his right.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary is going to focus on
what matters
to voters.

24:33.172 --> 24:37.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, in
connection with that,
the Trump campaign has been
talking a lot,

24:37.076 --> 24:42.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump himself has been
bringing up
this -- the FBI report that came
out in the

24:42.314 --> 24:46.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last few days that shows that
there was a
conversation between the State
Department

24:46.385 --> 24:51.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the FBI about whether to
lower the classification
of one of Secretary Clinton's
e-mails in exchange

24:51.857 --> 24:59.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for providing more FBI -- giving
FBI employees
the chance to hold more jobs
overseas, a potential

24:59.865 --> 25:02.034 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
quid pro quo.

25:02.067 --> 25:05.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If that comes up, is she going
to have an
answer to that?

25:05.037 --> 25:10.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBBY MOOK: Well, I think she is
going to
have an answer about what her
policies would

25:10.442 --> 25:12.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be as president on this issue.

25:12.711 --> 25:17.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, first and foremost,
this is an interagency
dispute or interagency
conversation that was

25:17.850 --> 25:19.251 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going on.

25:19.284 --> 25:22.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The State Department has denied
there was
any sort of quid pro quo.

25:22.388 --> 25:23.589 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So has the FBI.

25:23.622 --> 25:25.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So has the White House.

25:25.157 --> 25:27.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have said this is just not
true.

25:27.126 --> 25:33.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, again, it's very
commonplace for agencies
to have disagreements over
classifications.

25:33.098 --> 25:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's what was happening here.

25:34.633 --> 25:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm going to leave it to
those departments
to talk about that.

25:38.704 --> 25:43.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, obviously, as president,
Hillary would
have a role in determining how
things are

25:43.375 --> 25:44.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
classified.

25:44.910 --> 25:47.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if she's asked about that,
she will be
ready to answer that question.

25:47.146 --> 25:50.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Something else
that's come
up in the last day or so, Robby
Mook, are

25:51.016 --> 25:54.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these videotapes prepared by
James O'Keefe.

25:54.987 --> 26:00.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our reporter Lisa Desjardins
just did a report
a few minutes ago on the program
about them.

26:00.993 --> 26:04.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know some individuals have
been fired from
their jobs as a result.

26:04.830 --> 26:13.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Essentially, it had to do with
working to
rig elections, rig voter
turnout, and also

26:13.472 --> 26:17.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arrange to disrupt Donald
Trump's rallies.

26:17.910 --> 26:24.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How is your camp -- how do you
see this evidence
that clearly something was
either done or

26:24.983 --> 26:28.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was at least talked about during
this campaign
cycle?

26:28.854 --> 26:36.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBBY MOOK: Well, the person in
question is
a long discredited conservative
activist who

26:36.862 --> 26:38.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
claims to be a journalist.

26:38.697 --> 26:44.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Look, what's really
disappointing here, Judy,
is that Donald Trump is losing
this race,

26:44.136 --> 26:47.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he is trying to blame
everyone else except
himself for his loss.

26:47.873 --> 26:52.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so he's setting up a
situation in which
he can claim that the election
was rigged

26:52.444 --> 26:54.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that people didn't actually
vote against
him.

26:54.713 --> 26:59.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact is, the longer this
election goes
on, the more that people hear
from Donald

26:59.318 --> 27:03.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, the more of the racism,
the bigotry,
the disrespect towards women,
the more they

27:03.388 --> 27:08.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learn about his past, the way
he's treated
women, the more that people are
leaving him.

27:08.227 --> 27:12.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact of the matter that he's
struggling
to win the state of Utah right
now really

27:12.664 --> 27:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
says all that we need to know.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This election is not going to be
rigged.

27:17.002 --> 27:21.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican secretaries of state
are the ones
running this election, by and
large.

27:21.673 --> 27:25.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican secretaries of state
are the ones
coming out saying, this is not
rigged, asking

27:26.011 --> 27:28.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump to stop speaking
this way.

27:28.647 --> 27:35.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact of the matter is also
that we're
seeing higher voter turnout than
we saw in

27:35.320 --> 27:40.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 2012 cycle, particularly
when we look
at vote by mail in states like
Florida, North

27:40.125 --> 27:41.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Carolina.

27:41.426 --> 27:44.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We think this is going to be the
biggest election
in our history.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We think more people are going
to vote than
ever before.

27:46.331 --> 27:49.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just heard that the voter
rolls passed
200 million people in this
country.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That would be historic, if
that's the case.

27:52.170 --> 27:56.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Donald Trump should
worry more about
trying to win people's votes and
let the voters

27:56.942 --> 28:00.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go to the polls and make their
voice heard
in this historic, high-turnout
election.

28:00.946 --> 28:07.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, we are
hearing from
Trump supporters that they
expect him to bring

28:07.286 --> 28:10.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up again something he did raise
in the first
debate.

28:10.055 --> 28:16.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, Hillary Clinton has
been in the
public arena for 30 years, and
yet, his words,

28:16.161 --> 28:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taxes are up, terrorism has
spread, jobs have
vanished, and so on.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is her answer to that
question?

28:24.169 --> 28:28.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBBY MOOK: You know, I hope
that Hillary
gets a chance to talk about her
record and

28:28.974 --> 28:33.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her history on that debate
stage, because
I don't -- I would put her
record of accomplishment

28:33.879 --> 28:36.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up against anyone's, and in
particular Donald
Trump.

28:36.982 --> 28:40.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton has spent three
decades fighting
for kids and families ever since
she left

28:40.519 --> 28:43.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law school and went to work for
the Children's
Defense Fund.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She fought to get health
insurance for every
American.

28:45.791 --> 28:50.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When she lost that fight, she
kept working
with Republicans and Democrats
until she got

28:50.228 --> 28:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Children's Health Insurance
Program, which
covers eight million children in
this country.

28:55.067 --> 28:59.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She negotiated a historic
reduction in nuclear
weapons with Russia.

28:59.538 --> 29:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we look at Donald Trump's
record, this
is a man who was sued repeatedly
for racial

29:03.275 --> 29:04.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
housing discrimination.

29:04.810 --> 29:09.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has a record of not paying
his contractors,
not paying low-wage workers.

29:09.548 --> 29:14.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we just saw over the
last two weeks
women speaking out that they
were demeaned

29:14.119 --> 29:15.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and disrespected.

29:15.887 --> 29:20.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Donald Trump wants to have a
conversation
about the history of these
candidates and

29:20.459 --> 29:24.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who's been fighting for working
people, who's
been fighting for the rights of
women, we

29:24.496 --> 29:25.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
welcome that discussion.

29:25.831 --> 29:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is going to win
that hands
down.

29:27.499 --> 29:30.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will
find out in about
two-and-a-half-hours.

29:30.535 --> 29:34.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Robby Mook, who is the campaign
manager for
Hillary Clinton, thank you,
Robby.

29:34.239 --> 29:36.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBBY MOOK: Thanks, Judy.

29:36.408 --> 29:42.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And for more on
tonight's debate,
we are joined by our debate
night team, syndicated

29:42.047 --> 29:47.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
columnist Mark Shields, David
Brooks, columnist
for The New York Times, and Amy
Walter of

29:47.085 --> 29:48.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Cook Political Report.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we will show you when we say
your name.

29:50.589 --> 29:51.556 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:51.590 --> 29:53.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Looking better
already.

29:53.158 --> 29:54.292 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:54.326 --> 29:56.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All of you are
looking really
good.

29:56.461 --> 30:00.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Mark, given this atmosphere,
what do you
expect tonight?

30:00.932 --> 30:03.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It amazes me.

30:03.301 --> 30:09.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, just to review the
bidding, Donald
Trump won 41 contests.

30:09.207 --> 30:13.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He won every big state, save
that of John
Kasich's and Ted Cruz's home
states.

30:13.578 --> 30:19.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, he was -- outpolled
nearest rival
by 2-1, as the
anti-establishment candidate,

30:19.551 --> 30:23.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the candidate of change, the
candidate of
the forgotten Americans, the
overlooked Americans,

30:23.955 --> 30:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taking on the established wisdom
of the conservative
hegemony in this country.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he has dropped it.

30:31.930 --> 30:33.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He dropped it all.

30:33.865 --> 30:40.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's just been in the weeds
and just on
terrible stuff.

30:40.539 --> 30:46.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's been nothing -- he's
allowed himself
to become the issue in the
campaign, instead

30:46.378 --> 30:53.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of making change and his
opponent, who says
he's been in the arena for 30
years.

30:53.452 --> 30:56.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I don't know what to expect,
in answer
to your question.

30:56.788 --> 30:59.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To me, it's pretty -- Ben Carson
said it well.

30:59.925 --> 31:01.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The election is about the
voters.

31:01.727 --> 31:06.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, if anything, the Trump
campaign has not
made it about the voters over
the last two

31:06.498 --> 31:08.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weeks.

31:08.366 --> 31:13.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David, is
there an undecided
voter left that these folks are
going to go

31:13.271 --> 31:15.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out and make this case?

31:15.040 --> 31:17.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is their -- this is one of
the largest
stages that they have all
season, all year

31:17.743 --> 31:18.710 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
long.

31:18.744 --> 31:19.711 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

31:19.745 --> 31:21.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

31:21.580 --> 31:22.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there are any undecided,
they're not bright
enough to find the remote
control, so they

31:22.914 --> 31:24.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are not going to watch the
debate, because
they can't find it.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No, there may be some.

31:25.951 --> 31:30.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, actually, the one thing, as
Trump has
made himself the subject of this
campaign,

31:30.455 --> 31:33.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unlike the primary season, the
polls have
moved.

31:33.325 --> 31:36.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that means, whether
they're decided
or undecided, there are people
who are willing

31:36.695 --> 31:38.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be driven away by him.

31:38.764 --> 31:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's because they think, I
will vote
for the guy because he's a
change agent, but

31:41.933 --> 31:43.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think he's kind of a jerk.

31:43.468 --> 31:46.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as the jerk factor rises,
those votes
do shift.

31:46.838 --> 31:51.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sort of more concerned this
debate less
about the two candidates than
just about the

31:51.143 --> 31:52.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
whole country.

31:52.911 --> 31:57.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The campaign has been so
degrading, and so
many people around the country
are just in

31:57.315 --> 31:58.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
such poor spirits.

31:59.017 --> 32:04.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's as if we suffered a
revaluation or a
re-norming of what's acceptable.

32:04.156 --> 32:09.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I hope -- at the same time
our standards
are being degraded by this
campaign, some

32:09.294 --> 32:13.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people are reacting the other
way and saying
it's time to reestablish some
sense of decency.

32:13.532 --> 32:18.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm just hoping the debate
doesn't degrade
us any further, not as much of
who helps,

32:18.236 --> 32:19.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who goes up a point or two in
the polls.

32:19.905 --> 32:23.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Given all that,
Amy, what does
Hillary Clinton need to do
tonight?

32:23.208 --> 32:26.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well,
I completely concur with what
David said.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's exactly where
she needs
to go.

32:28.513 --> 32:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The very first debate, her goal
was to sort
of get underneath Trump's skin,
make the focus

32:34.152 --> 32:35.520 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about him.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he played the part
brilliantly.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.089 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

32:38.123 --> 32:39.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He took the bait.

32:39.124 --> 32:42.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He went into these rabbit holes.

32:42.227 --> 32:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He completely exploded, then, of
course, the
next day, continued to unravel
with the tweets

32:48.233 --> 32:49.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
against the Miss Universe.

32:50.001 --> 32:54.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second debate was really --
for her was
just holding strong in the face
of a very

32:54.506 --> 32:59.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aggressive Donald Trump, in the
face of the
press conference that came
before him featuring

32:59.811 --> 33:04.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the women who had made
allegations against
her husband.

33:04.716 --> 33:11.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the chance she has to
close this campaign
with a positive message and a
positive vision

33:11.156 --> 33:15.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the country, to give people
a reason to
vote for her, not just to vote
against Donald

33:15.527 --> 33:16.494 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

33:16.528 --> 33:19.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she's going to come under
fire.

33:19.097 --> 33:24.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no doubt that Donald
Trump is going
to once again make an aggressive
push to put

33:24.035 --> 33:25.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her on the defensive.

33:25.036 --> 33:26.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's going to have to answer
that.

33:26.905 --> 33:31.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, to close the deal
here, she needs
to make people feel comfortable
with her as

33:31.810 --> 33:36.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president and comfortable with
how she's going
to bring this country back from
what has been

33:36.314 --> 33:38.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an incredibly divisive campaign.

33:38.083 --> 33:40.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mark Shields,
is there any
incentive that either of these
candidates

33:40.852 --> 33:43.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have to take the high road?

33:43.188 --> 33:46.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because it seems that, with
social media,
with these sort of on-stage
moments, they're

33:46.725 --> 33:49.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rewarded for going lower and
lower.

33:49.628 --> 33:52.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, I think there
is.

33:52.364 --> 33:56.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it is because the
proximity closest
to Election Day.

33:56.268 --> 34:03.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I were Hillary Clinton
tonight, I would
say, if in fact I do lose, I
hope that I will

34:03.108 --> 34:08.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have the grace and decency and
the sense of
patriotism that the man said
eight years ago

34:08.980 --> 34:14.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when he lost, and he said, I had
the honor
-- this is a quote -- of calling
Senator Barack

34:14.552 --> 34:18.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama to congratulate him on
being elected
the next president of the
country we both

34:18.290 --> 34:20.091 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
love.

34:20.125 --> 34:24.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wish tonight Godspeed to the
man who was
my former opponent and will be
my president.

34:24.996 --> 34:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That sounds -- it sounds almost
biblical,
Shakespearian in its eloquence.

34:29.501 --> 34:32.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That was John McCain in 2008.

34:32.103 --> 34:36.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, if Hillary Clinton is
capable of
doing that tonight, I mean, of
sort of taking

34:37.008 --> 34:42.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, reminding us of what we have
done and
what we have been able to do,
after really

34:42.714 --> 34:43.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
heated, heated campaigns.

34:44.015 --> 34:45.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I agree with David and Amy.

34:46.017 --> 34:48.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It would be great to have better
politics.

34:48.219 --> 34:54.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we get a report like
Lisa's, that's evocative
of 1972 and dirty tricks.

34:54.459 --> 34:56.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what it is.

34:56.328 --> 35:02.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's trying to -- if in fact
it's valid, it's
to provoke a reaction and to
start a political

35:02.467 --> 35:04.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
strife-fest.

35:04.302 --> 35:07.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It should be said
Hillary taking
the high road, there are two
problems with

35:07.706 --> 35:09.240 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One is, to her, the high road
has always been
just a laundry list of programs.

35:11.543 --> 35:15.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There hasn't actually been a
vision or even
something personal and
emotional.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It hasn't been that high.

35:16.147 --> 35:17.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's been prosaic.

35:17.849 --> 35:21.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second thing is -- and we're
reminded
of that in Lisa's report -- is
that we have

35:21.920 --> 35:26.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taken Barack Obama's non-scandal
administration
for granted.

35:26.091 --> 35:30.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that has never been the
nature of Hillary
Clinton's campaign or life, at
least for the

35:30.462 --> 35:32.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
past 30 years.

35:32.263 --> 35:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's always been a wave of
scandal, and
sometimes involving her, but
often involving

35:35.033 --> 35:36.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people around her.

35:36.935 --> 35:42.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for some reason -- and,
again, we don't
know the complete substance of
these allegations,

35:42.107 --> 35:47.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but that kind of behavior is the
low-rent
sort of behavior that sometimes,
you know,

35:47.645 --> 35:51.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wouldn't be strange -- well,
it's even an
insult to Dick Morris, who she
brought back

35:51.516 --> 35:52.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into the White House.

35:52.517 --> 35:53.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But that has been...

35:53.518 --> 35:54.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: She brought him
twice.

35:54.519 --> 35:55.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Twice.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so that's just been part of
her group.

35:58.857 --> 36:03.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that's -- the moral
injury in this
campaign is not all on one side.

36:03.962 --> 36:07.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Amy, that's
something
that she's gotten accustomed to
having to

36:08.033 --> 36:09.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
talk about, isn't it?

36:09.734 --> 36:12.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, and that's
exactly what
Republicans want Donald Trump to
focus on

36:12.270 --> 36:13.938 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight.

36:13.972 --> 36:17.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, if you're a Republican not
involved
with the Donald Trump campaign,
you are just

36:17.409 --> 36:21.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hoping that what Donald Trump
does is put
the focus back on her, put her
on the defensive,

36:21.980 --> 36:25.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remind people about the years of
scandal,
what it would feel like to have
another Clinton

36:25.884 --> 36:30.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the White House, remind them
of the '90s
and the current scandals with
Hillary Clinton

36:30.555 --> 36:36.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the e-mail server, and to
help stop the
down-ballot drop.

36:36.561 --> 36:40.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The greatest fear that
Republicans have right
now is that Donald Trump, as his
numbers have

36:40.532 --> 36:43.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fallen, they're terrified they
too are going
to lose seats down-ballot.

36:43.401 --> 36:47.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're going
to reassemble
all of you at 9:00 Eastern.

36:47.705 --> 36:52.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we will be back right
here with Mark,
David and Amy for our special
live coverage

36:52.410 --> 36:53.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of this final debate.

36:53.645 --> 36:55.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Again, that starts at 9:00
Eastern.

36:55.280 --> 36:59.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, we will be providing
debate analysis
and fact-checking on our Web
site.

36:59.617 --> 37:01.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's PBS.org/NewsHour.

37:01.419 --> 37:05.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in the meantime, you can
watch every
presidential and vice
presidential debate

37:05.290 --> 37:08.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

watchthedebates.org.

37:08.827 --> 37:14.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LLOYD BENTSEN (D), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
Senator, you are no Jack
Kennedy.

37:14.799 --> 37:16.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERALDINE FERRARO (D), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
I almost resent, Vice President
Bush, your

37:16.968 --> 37:18.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
patronizing...

37:18.403 --> 37:20.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITT ROMNEY (R), Presidential
Candidate: Whole
binders full of women.

37:20.238 --> 37:20.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL DUKAKIS (D),
Presidential Candidate:
That I have opposed the death
penalty during

37:20.672 --> 37:22.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all of my life.

37:22.507 --> 37:27.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Interact with all the
general election
debates on our Web site,
watchthedebates.org.

37:27.979 --> 37:33.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We turn now to
our series
on issues shaping this election.

37:33.618 --> 37:37.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight: What will our next
president do about
this country's justice system?

37:37.989 --> 37:43.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton has pointed to
reducing racial
bias and overincarceration.

37:43.094 --> 37:46.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here she was at the first
presidential debate
more than three weeks ago.

37:46.731 --> 37:50.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
It's just a fact that if you're
a young African-American

37:50.969 --> 37:57.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man and you do the same thing as
a young white
man, you are more likely to be
arrested, charged,

37:57.575 --> 37:59.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
convicted, and incarcerated.

38:00.011 --> 38:06.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we've got to address the
systemic racism
in our criminal justice system.

38:06.784 --> 38:09.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We cannot just say law and
order.

38:09.754 --> 38:16.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to say -- we have to
come forward
with a plan that is going to
divert people

38:16.928 --> 38:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the criminal justice
system, deal with
mandatory minimum sentences
which have put

38:22.233 --> 38:25.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
too many people away for too
long for doing
too little.

38:25.236 --> 38:29.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For his part,
President
Obama has stepped up the use of
his clemency

38:29.541 --> 38:31.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
powers in the last year.

38:31.409 --> 38:37.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2016, he's shortened some 590
sentences,
almost all of them for
nonviolent drug-related

38:38.016 --> 38:39.184 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crimes.

38:39.217 --> 38:42.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's not how Donald Trump has
described
the effort.

38:42.153 --> 38:47.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told an audience last weekend
that the
White House is, in his words --
quote -- "steadily

38:47.492 --> 38:50.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dismantling the federal criminal
justice system."

38:50.295 --> 38:52.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here's more from that event in
New Hampshire.

38:52.697 --> 38:56.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
President Obama has commuted the
sentences

38:56.267 --> 38:59.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of record numbers of high-level
drug traffickers.

38:59.237 --> 39:01.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can you believe this?

39:01.239 --> 39:07.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of them kingpins and
violent armed traffickers
with extensive criminal
histories and records.

39:08.012 --> 39:13.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton promises to
continue and expand
this approach, turning our
streets back over

39:13.218 --> 39:20.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to gangs, drug cartels and armed
career criminals
that we're not going to get out
of our country.

39:20.892 --> 39:26.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want everything to be law
and order
and justice and everything
perfect, everything

39:26.698 --> 39:28.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
perfect.

39:28.233 --> 39:31.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We dig in to
the issue of
law and order in this campaign.

39:31.636 --> 39:32.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Again to Lisa Desjardins.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She recorded this conversation
yesterday.

39:34.739 --> 39:38.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: To discuss all
this, we're
joined by Leah Wright Rigueur.

39:38.643 --> 39:43.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's a professor at Harvard
focusing on American
history, race, civil rights and
the presidency.

39:43.881 --> 39:48.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And David Harris, professor of
law at the
University of Pittsburgh, he
studies police

39:48.686 --> 39:52.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behavior, law enforcement, and
the law more
broadly.

39:52.357 --> 39:53.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID HARRIS, University of
Pittsburgh: Thank
you.

39:55.426 --> 39:57.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: David, I want
to start with
criminal justice reform.

39:57.161 --> 40:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The idea generally is that
perhaps we have
too many people in prison for
too long.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where do these two candidates
stand on criminal
justice reform?

40:05.069 --> 40:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID HARRIS: Well, Mr. Trump
has not said
much about mass incarceration.

40:10.275 --> 40:15.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His platform of criminal justice
seems to
center on the idea of law and
order generally,

40:15.813 --> 40:21.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on getting tougher, in
particular using stop
and frisk and various kinds of
racial profiling.

40:21.686 --> 40:24.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mrs. Clinton has a different
take on these
things.

40:24.922 --> 40:30.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's very much putting on the
forefront of
her campaign the idea of getting
rid or cutting

40:30.895 --> 40:37.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back on mass incarceration, and
particularly
on improving the relations
between police

40:37.168 --> 40:39.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the communities they serve,
particularly
people of color.

40:39.771 --> 40:44.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You heard her in the first
debate talking
about implicit bias.

40:44.108 --> 40:47.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is one of her main planks
in her criminal
justice platform.

40:47.645 --> 40:51.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Leah Wright
Rigueur, we heard
Donald Trump over the weekend
even say he

40:51.249 --> 40:56.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thinks the idea of commuting
some of these
drug sentences might be hurting
the opioid

40:56.187 --> 40:59.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crisis, in fact, bringing more
drug traffickers
onto the street.

40:59.424 --> 41:03.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can you comment on where he is
and also the
past history of both these
candidates, Clinton

41:03.728 --> 41:06.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Trump, when it comes to
crime in America?

41:06.130 --> 41:09.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEAH WRIGHT RIGUEUR, Harvard
University: So,
I think the approach that Donald
Trump is

41:09.667 --> 41:15.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking is, in fact, breaking
with the new
direction of the Republican
Party, which has

41:15.707 --> 41:23.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been to take a gentler approach
on issues
of drugs and even on mass
incarceration.

41:23.815 --> 41:27.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He built himself as the law and
order candidate.

41:27.585 --> 41:35.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what law and order means
largely for him
is watching, is surveying,
surveillance, control.

41:35.860 --> 41:41.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's really about an
intervention of the
state on behalf of controlling
crime.

41:41.999 --> 41:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is radical in some ways.

41:44.769 --> 41:48.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's really marking himself
as a kind
of new, souped-up Richard Nixon.

41:48.606 --> 41:54.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the interesting thing here
is that Trump's
history really does play into
this.

41:54.545 --> 41:58.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The most obvious example is the
Central Park
5 case, where he called for kind
of harsh

41:58.850 --> 42:04.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
draconian law, imposure of law
and order,
on men who were later found to
be innocent.

42:04.722 --> 42:09.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what is interesting is that,
even after
they were found to be innocent
and after the

42:09.460 --> 42:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
courts ruled in their favor, he
still doubled
down, and, in fact, last week
doubled down

42:14.899 --> 42:19.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on where he was standing,
doubled down on
his approach on how these men
should have

42:19.137 --> 42:20.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been treated.

42:20.972 --> 42:24.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The interesting thing here is
that, where
we have with somebody, a
candidate like Hillary

42:24.208 --> 42:27.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton, who still is kind of
risk-averse
when it comes to law and order
things, where

42:27.812 --> 42:29.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have seen some growth with
her, right?

42:29.614 --> 42:33.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know her -- and many people
know her, are
familiar with her because of her
language

42:33.251 --> 42:38.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around super predators and the
mass incarceration
in the 1994 crime bill.

42:38.156 --> 42:42.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen a willingness on
the part of
her campaign to shift in a
direction of more

42:42.693 --> 42:44.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
progressive policies.

42:44.529 --> 42:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not so much with Donald Trump,
who seems to
have doubled down even harder
from where he

42:48.833 --> 42:50.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stood many years ago.

42:50.368 --> 42:52.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's so
interesting.

42:52.103 --> 42:54.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have two candidates that, at
different
points, have been tough on
crime, but now

42:54.405 --> 42:58.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they seem to be going in
different rhetoric
directions.

42:58.142 --> 43:01.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Harris, I want to ask you
about one
of Donald Trump's ideas.

43:01.813 --> 43:05.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says we need to increase
police power and
increase police numbers.

43:05.349 --> 43:08.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do we know about what that
does, and
does that work?

43:08.920 --> 43:13.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID HARRIS: Well, these are
two different
things, police power and police
numbers.

43:13.591 --> 43:20.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that, in a police
department, having
more officers can allow police
to serve communities

43:20.097 --> 43:21.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
better.

43:21.966 --> 43:25.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it depends very much on how
they are used,
how they are deployed and how
well they are

43:25.670 --> 43:26.704 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trained.

43:26.737 --> 43:29.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, numbers by themselves don't
make a difference.

43:29.841 --> 43:33.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Increasing police powers, that's
a whole other
thing.

43:33.077 --> 43:40.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we have been through
an era, from
the 1980s forward, where police
power, especially

43:40.751 --> 43:45.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in crime on the streets kind of
issues, police
power has been increased and
increased, and

43:45.523 --> 43:49.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discretion has been opened and
opened and
opened some more, to the point
that police

43:49.727 --> 43:51.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have very great power.

43:51.496 --> 43:56.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have very great power to
stop people,
to frisk people, to make traffic
stops and

43:56.300 --> 43:58.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
turn them into drug
investigations.

43:58.836 --> 44:02.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of these things are signs of
very great
police power.

44:02.140 --> 44:06.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have reached a point
where I think
most people acknowledge that
there need to

44:06.777 --> 44:08.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be some limits.

44:08.312 --> 44:11.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But, in some
cases, more
police on the street does help.

44:11.349 --> 44:14.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just how you deploy it; is
that what
you're saying?

44:14.185 --> 44:15.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID HARRIS: Yes, very much.

44:15.987 --> 44:22.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you can put numbers on
the street,
and it may help, but numbers
alone never make

44:22.093 --> 44:23.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for success.

44:24.028 --> 44:28.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's how you use the resources
you have, including,
most importantly, your human
resources, your

44:28.266 --> 44:30.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
police officers.

44:30.201 --> 44:34.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they are well-trained, they
have good communication
skills, they relate well to the
community,

44:34.105 --> 44:35.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you can really build something.

44:35.339 --> 44:36.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can build relationships.

44:36.974 --> 44:40.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's where all good
policing starts,
with relationships with
communities.

44:40.478 --> 44:43.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Finally, in the
short time
we have left, I want to ask you
all, this

44:43.648 --> 44:45.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a daily topic for many
Americans.

44:45.616 --> 44:49.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I have been amazed there has
been very
little headlines in terms of the
political

44:49.086 --> 44:51.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign about these ideas of
crime and justice.

44:51.822 --> 44:55.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How important are these when it
comes to the
conversation right now about
crime and justice

44:56.027 --> 44:57.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in America, Leah?

44:57.194 --> 44:59.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEAH WRIGHT RIGUEUR: So, they're
incredibly
important.

44:59.130 --> 45:02.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think this is part of --
at least for
Donald Trump, this is part of a
larger conversation

45:02.700 --> 45:05.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he is having that is
largely about control.

45:05.970 --> 45:07.872 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

45:07.905 --> 45:12.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's not just about -- he
manages to connect
this idea of law and order and
about policing

45:12.877 --> 45:17.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to other ideas like rigged
elections, right,
which is a very troubling --
very troubling

45:17.415 --> 45:19.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
area that he's moved into.

45:19.350 --> 45:24.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I also think it's worth
considering how Hillary
Clinton thinks about and how her
campaign

45:24.455 --> 45:28.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
has really thought about
policing inequality
injustice.

45:28.960 --> 45:32.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I mentioned before that
she's been
risk-averse in a number of
different ways.

45:32.096 --> 45:36.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have seen some of these
tensions between
social and movements political
movements that

45:36.367 --> 45:40.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have come off, off the ground,
but, at the
same time, I think we have seen
kind of pushing

45:40.905 --> 45:45.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a willingness or an ability
to move and
shift on these important issues.

45:45.409 --> 45:48.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All right,
David Harris of
the University of Pittsburgh and
Leah Wright

45:48.579 --> 45:50.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rigueur of Harvard, thank you
both for joining
us.

45:50.881 --> 45:52.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEAH WRIGHT RIGUEUR: Thanks for

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: a look at
trying to clean
up the water supply in the
country's heartland.

46:20.077 --> 46:26.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For decades, American farmers
have been applying
nitrogen fertilizer, in some
cases too generously,

46:26.183 --> 46:27.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to crops.

46:27.885 --> 46:32.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Much of that fertilizer has
found its way
into runoff, contaminating water
supplies

46:32.356 --> 46:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and forcing many communities to
invest heavily
in water treatment plants.

From NET in Nebraska, Ariana
Brochas of Harvest
Public Media reports on new
technologies farmers

46:44.068 --> 46:47.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
are using to reduce
contamination from their
fields.

46:47.838 --> 46:51.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our series about
the Leading
Edge of science and tech.

46:51.876 --> 46:58.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARIANA BROCHAS, Harvest Public
Media: When
University of Nebraska professor
Richard Ferguson

46:58.049 --> 47:00.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
looks at a cornfield, he has no
illusions.

47:00.518 --> 47:04.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD FERGUSON, University of
Nebraska:
To profitably produce corn in
Nebraska, we

47:04.221 --> 47:06.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have to apply nitrogen
fertilizer.

47:06.390 --> 47:10.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In many cases, in the past, we
applied more
than we really needed.

47:10.661 --> 47:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARIANA BROCHAS: Ferguson wants
to reduce the
chance that excess nitrogen will
get into

47:15.399 --> 47:17.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the groundwater.

47:17.334 --> 47:22.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His high-tech approach, called
Project SENSE,
uses sensor technology to help
farmers fertilize

47:22.573 --> 47:26.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
during the growing season as
timely and precisely
as possible.

47:26.577 --> 47:30.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD FERGUSON: If we can make
them more
money by the use of sensor
technology, we

47:30.448 --> 47:33.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think that's something they
would adopt.

47:33.117 --> 47:39.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARIANA BROCHAS: Project SENSE is
being put
to the test in areas where
groundwater nitrate

47:39.123 --> 47:40.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
levels are high.

47:40.658 --> 47:45.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, it's at the Seim family
farm in Central
Nebraska.

47:45.629 --> 47:50.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The machine's arms have sensors
that gauge
how much nitrogen the plants
need.

47:50.067 --> 47:58.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A computer fires applicators to
deliver fertilizer,
practically feeding plants one
by one.

47:58.676 --> 48:02.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For Anthony Seim, SENSE is
another tool for
his family to try.

48:02.046 --> 48:04.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY SEIM, Farmer: I don't
think there's
any farmer that wakes up in the
morning and

48:04.882 --> 48:08.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says, I'm just going to go dump
1,000 gallons
of fertilizer down a ditch.

48:08.886 --> 48:09.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everybody's trying.

48:09.854 --> 48:11.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just that it doesn't always
work.

48:11.422 --> 48:13.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a lot of things that we
can't control,
weather being the biggest one.

48:14.024 --> 48:18.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARIANA BROCHAS: Anthony and his
brothers have
adopted their father's ideology
of progressive

48:18.129 --> 48:19.897 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
farming.

48:19.930 --> 48:24.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like many farmers, Ken Seim used
to put nearly
all his fertilizer on the ground
before the

48:24.268 --> 48:26.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
crops were even planted.

48:26.070 --> 48:31.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN SEIM, Farmer: Today, we
apply everything
in we call it spoon-feeding,
which is a term

48:31.075 --> 48:33.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for just a little bit at a time.

48:33.244 --> 48:35.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARIANA BROCHAS: Noah Seim shows
off one method
of spoon-feeding.

48:35.646 --> 48:40.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's called chemigation or
fertigation.

48:40.885 --> 48:45.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It uses a center pivot hooked up
to a fertilizer
tank.

48:45.222 --> 48:50.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This lets the Seims control how
much nitrogen
gets applied each time they
water.

48:50.795 --> 48:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's less precise, but less
expensive than
Project SENSE, but still allows
farmers to

48:56.433 --> 49:04.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
vary fertilizer rates in
response to weather,
soil moisture and plant growth.

49:04.241 --> 49:07.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Across the Missouri River in
Iowa, you won't
find many center pivots.

49:07.845 --> 49:10.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here, they rely on good soil and
rain.

49:10.748 --> 49:15.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DICK SLOAN, Farmer: We got a
three-inch rain
24 hours or 48 hours ago, but
you can see

49:15.619 --> 49:19.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how the water didn't come down
and leave a
channel through my field.

49:19.623 --> 49:23.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of soy conversation is
about slowing
water down.

49:23.460 --> 49:27.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARIANA BROCHAS: Dick Sloan farms
in Eastern
Iowa, near Cedar Rapids.

49:27.331 --> 49:33.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here, systems of underground
pipe, or tiles,
drain excess water off fields.

49:33.404 --> 49:38.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But those tiles also carry
fertilizer and
pesticides and drain directly
into nearby

49:38.375 --> 49:40.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
streams and rivers.

49:40.578 --> 49:45.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This kind of field runoff isn't
regulated,
and Iowa has some of the worst
water pollution

49:45.449 --> 49:47.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the Midwest.

49:47.685 --> 49:52.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sloan uses no-till and cover
crops to help
slow and filter water before it
gets to his

49:52.857 --> 49:54.258 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tiles.

49:54.291 --> 49:56.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DICK SLOAN: You can see how
everything's kind
of knitted together.

49:56.093 --> 50:00.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARIANA BROCHAS: He also devotes
some of his
land to prairie strips, land
that could be

50:00.197 --> 50:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
used to grow corn or soybeans.

50:02.199 --> 50:07.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DICK SLOAN: As water moves down
across the
field, it encounters this
contoured strip

50:07.438 --> 50:12.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that will stop any residue from
getting through
there and have less water
getting polluted

50:12.710 --> 50:17.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as it goes down to the Cedar
River then on
down to the Mississippi and down
to the Gulf.

50:17.681 --> 50:19.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So that's the hope.

50:19.550 --> 50:24.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARIANA BROCHAS: Former Iowa
extension agent
Chad Ingels has worked with
farmers like Dick

50:24.622 --> 50:29.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sloan on field practices to
improve water
quality in Northeast Iowa.

50:29.927 --> 50:32.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One new tool is something you
can't see.

50:32.563 --> 50:34.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's called a bioreactor.

50:34.298 --> 50:37.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHAD INGELS, Former Iowa
Extension Agent:
The water from this field would
normally dump

50:37.668 --> 50:39.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right out into this ditch behind
us.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we have it go through this
structure.

50:41.906 --> 50:47.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a set of gates on
the inside that
diverts it in the bioreactor
that is underneath

50:47.278 --> 50:49.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this grassy area.

50:49.113 --> 50:54.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the bioreactor is just a
trench that is
100-feet-long and 30-feet-wide
and it is filled

50:54.118 --> 50:55.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with wood chips.

50:55.953 --> 51:00.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ARIANA BROCHAS: As the
nitrate-laden water
passes through the wood chips,
microbes turn

51:00.724 --> 51:05.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the nitrates into harmless
nitrogen gas, which
makes up most of our atmosphere.

51:05.663 --> 51:12.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHAD INGELS: I think almost
every field needs
some kind of practice, whether
it's a bioreactor,

51:12.036 --> 51:15.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no-till, just better nitrogen
and phosphorus
management.

51:15.606 --> 51:20.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARIANA BROCHAS: Craig Cox with
the Environmental
Working Group in Ames, Iowa,
agrees that every

51:20.577 --> 51:23.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
field needs some sort of
management.

51:23.447 --> 51:25.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he says voluntary measures
don't work.

51:25.950 --> 51:29.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG COX, Environmental Working
Group: Otherwise,
the water would be in a lot
better shape than

51:29.086 --> 51:30.921 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it is.

51:30.955 --> 51:34.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARIANA BROCHAS: In the last
decade, the federal
government has spent more than
$3 billion

51:34.625 --> 51:38.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to support measures that reduce
water pollution
from Iowa farms.

51:39.029 --> 51:43.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Environmental Working Group
monitored
the use of two conservation
practices over

51:43.200 --> 51:47.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a five-year period and found the
net gain
was negligible.

51:47.037 --> 51:51.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CRAIG COX: Here's the good news
story.

51:51.375 --> 51:52.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We got a new buffer.

51:52.376 --> 51:53.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But here's the bad news story,
right?

51:53.510 --> 51:55.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had a buffer, and now we
don't have one
anymore.

51:55.779 --> 52:01.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARIANA BROCHAS: Cox says some
standard conservation
practices should be required of
all farmers,

52:01.685 --> 52:05.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but Dick Sloan says his field
practices can't
be mandated on his neighbors.

52:05.856 --> 52:10.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DICK SLOAN: People have a
natural negative
reaction to regulation.

52:10.594 --> 52:11.895 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Anybody would.

52:11.929 --> 52:14.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not just -- farmers are
just so much
like everybody else.

52:14.198 --> 52:19.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to take time for them
to question
what they're doing.

52:19.470 --> 52:28.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN SEIM: Farmers are very
independent, but
the reality is, if we won't be
stewards ourselves,

52:28.545 --> 52:31.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
someone will have to help us be
a steward.

52:31.315 --> 52:34.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CRAIG COX: This is a solvable
problem.

52:34.451 --> 52:36.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just everyone has to do
their part.

52:37.021 --> 52:41.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN SEIM: One thing I always
tell people when
I work with them, if you can
make me better

52:41.592 --> 52:43.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at what I'm doing, I'm in.

52:43.861 --> 52:53.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
