08:51.367 --> 08:52.633
FOUNDATIONS AND CORPORATIONS

08:52.633 --> 08:53.700

HAPPENING THIS WEEKEND OR THIS

08:55.233 --> 08:55.467
MONTH.

08:55.467 --> 08:56.133

08:56.133 --> 08:58.400
BY FAR, THE MOST GIVING HAPPEN

08:58.400 --> 08:59.767
THE LAST MONTH OF THE YEAR AND

08:59.767 --> 09:01.667
EVEN THE LAST DAY OF THE YEAR IS

09:01.667 --> 09:03.467
BY FAR THE DAY WHERE THE MOS

09:03.467 --> 09:04.667
GIVING OCCURS AND THAT'S THE

09:04.667 --> 09:06.967
LAST DAY BEFORE THE TAXES, YOU

09:06.967 --> 09:09.533
KNOW, THE IMPACT OF THE TAXE

09:09.533 --> 09:11.200
OCCUR SO THAT INDICATES THAT

09:11.200 --> 09:12.800
TAXES ARE CERTAINLY A FACTOR

09:12.800 --> 09:14.333
SO IF PEOPLE ARE SITTING DOW

09:14.333 --> 09:16.100
AND TRYING TO MAKE A SMART

09:16.100 --> 09:17.400
DECISION ABOUT WHERE TO GIVE

09:17.400 --> 09:18.967
SOME OF THE RESOURCES.

09:18.967 --> 09:20.467
WHAT DO YOU ADVISE THEM?

09:20.467 --> 09:22.233
>> WE THINK THERE ARE THRE

09:22.233 --> 09:24.267
CRITICAL THINGS TO CONSIDER.

09:24.267 --> 09:26.567
ONE ARE THE FINANCES OF TH

09:26.567 --> 09:27.800
ORGANIZATION AND IF IT'S MANAGED

09:27.800 --> 09:30.733
WELL AND SECOND, THE GOVERNANC

09:30.733 --> 09:31.933
OF THE ORGANIZATION AND DOES H

09:31.933 --> 09:33.500
HAVE AN INDEPENDENT BOARD TO

09:33.500 --> 09:34.500
LEAD THE ORGANIZATION.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.667
IT'S NOT JUST THE CEO, YOU NEE

09:36.667 --> 09:37.867
THAT BOARD IN CHARGE

09:37.867 --> 09:40.033
THE RESULTS, IS IT TRULY MEETING

09:40.033 --> 09:41.633
ITS MISSION AND DOES IT HAVE

09:41.633 --> 09:44.167
DATA TO SHOW IN A MEASURABLE WAY

09:44.167 --> 09:45.600
THAT IT'S HELPING PEOPLE

09:45.600 --> 09:47.333
ALL OF THAT SOUNDS LIKE

09:47.333 --> 09:48.733
DIFFICULT RESEARCH PROJECT

09:48.733 --> 09:50.633
HOW CAN PEOPLE FIGURE THAT OUT

09:50.633 --> 09:53.033
>> THAT'S WHY IT WAS CREATED

09:53.033 --> 09:54.867
THROUGH A STAR RATING SYSTEM

09:54.867 --> 09:56.300
REFLECT BACK THAT KIND O

09:56.300 --> 09:57.133
INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S TRU

09:57.133 --> 09:59.133
THAT MOST AMERICANS ONLY GIV

09:59.133 --> 10:01.167
ABOUT 15, 20 MINUTES TO THEI

10:01.167 --> 10:04.233
DECISION MAKING AND SO TO TRY TO

10:04.233 --> 10:06.100
HAVE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABL

10:06.100 --> 10:08.200
FROM EXPERTS THAT CALLED THE

10:08.200 --> 10:09.733
DATA IS THE WAY THAT WE'RE

10:09.733 --> 10:10.800
TRYING TO HELP WITH THAT

10:10.800 --> 10:12.367
>> I WAS SAYING IN THE

10:12.367 --> 10:14.433
INTRODUCTION THAT AMERICANS AR

10:14.433 --> 10:16.500
AMONG THE MOST CHARITABLE.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.567
FIRST OF ALL, ARE WE THE MOST OR

10:18.567 --> 10:19.400
AREN'T WE?

10:19.400 --> 10:21.900
>> IF IT'S JUST CHARITABLE

10:21.900 --> 10:22.767
DOLLARS.

10:22.767 --> 10:24.400
ABSOLUTELY, BY FAR, TWO TO THREE

10:24.400 --> 10:25.867
TIMES MORE GENEROUS THAN ANY

10:25.867 --> 10:27.700
OTHER COUNTRY, BUT IF YO

10:27.700 --> 10:30.067
INCLUDE TAXES USED FOR SOCIA

10:30.067 --> 10:31.400
PROGRAMS LIKE FOR THE MENTALLY

10:31.400 --> 10:33.733
ILL AND THE HOMELESS, THERE AR

10:33.733 --> 10:34.800
COUNTRIES IN EUROPE THAT ARE

10:34.800 --> 10:35.933
MORE GENEROUS.

10:35.933 --> 10:38.867
SO WHEN YOU INCLUDE THAT, NO

10:38.867 --> 10:40.633
WE'RE NOT.

MODERN ART IN IRAN IS THRIVING

14:35.833 --> 14:38.633
PERIOD WHEN IRAN AND THE U.S

WERE QUITE CLOSE POLITICALLY AND

THERE WAS A LOT MORE BACK AN

14:55.000 --> 14:57.233
SO DANGEROUS TO REGIMES.

14:57.233 --> 15:03.400
>> WELL, I THINK ART IS OFTE

15:03.400 --> 15:05.167
THE VOICE OF CRITICALITY

15:05.167 --> 15:07.433
THEY CRITIQUE ISSUES OF POWER.

15:07.433 --> 15:09.233
THEY CRITIQUE THINGS THAT THEY

15:09.233 --> 15:12.967
SEE AROUND THEM, AND I THINK

15:12.967 --> 15:14.433
THAT CAN SOMETIMES MAKE IT
