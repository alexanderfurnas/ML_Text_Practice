JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: screening
for cervical cancer in places
where the disease rarely

00:04.600 --> 00:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gets priority, amid
other pressing problems.

00:07.933 --> 00:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro has a report on one
effort to prevent a disease

00:14.933 --> 00:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that afflicts about 500,000
women across the world every
year, but has the most deadly

00:19.800 --> 00:21.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
outcomes in India.

00:21.833 --> 00:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of his ongoing
series Agents for Change.

00:24.833 --> 00:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In a village
just outside Lucknow, India,
recently, there was a rare

00:31.400 --> 00:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opportunity for many women
like 35-year-old Kiran Rawat.

00:35.900 --> 00:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the first time in her
life, she saw a doctor.

00:39.800 --> 00:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Her timing couldn't be better.

00:43.300 --> 00:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
There are some white spots
that I found when I applied the

00:48.100 --> 00:49.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
medicine.

00:49.100 --> 00:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's nothing to be afraid of.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The
white spots are lesions.

00:52.400 --> 00:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If left untreated, they can
lead to cervical cancer in
women usually between 30 and 60

00:57.566 --> 00:59.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
years old.

00:59.033 --> 01:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is preventable and
treatable if detected early.

01:01.300 --> 01:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet, more than half the cases
worldwide are fatal, the vast
majority of them in developing

01:07.466 --> 01:09.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
countries.

01:09.500 --> 01:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In India, cervical cancer claims
almost 70,000 lives a year,
more than anywhere else in the

01:14.733 --> 01:17.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

01:17.833 --> 01:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's because, for millions
of women here, seeing a doctor
is the last resort, an often

01:23.566 --> 01:25.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unaffordable luxury.

01:25.600 --> 01:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a pilot program run by the
global nonprofit Population
Services International, or PSI,

01:31.233 --> 01:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
aimed to change that.

01:33.200 --> 01:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The organization set up medical
screening camps in Uttar
Pradesh, India's most populous

01:38.100 --> 01:41.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and one of its most
impoverished state.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sixty women came to this one.

01:43.366 --> 01:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Four tested positive for
the pre-cancerous lesions

01:46.400 --> 01:48.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

01:48.966 --> 01:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UMA SINGH, India: Pick
up a nice ball of cotton,
dip it in freshly made
acetic acid solution.

01:51.766 --> 01:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
In rich countries, Pap
smears and follow-up
treatment are the standard,

01:58.100 --> 02:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but that's neither affordable
nor practical here.

02:00.500 --> 02:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, obstetrics professor
Uma Singh demonstrated
to students a low-tech,
low-cost alternative

02:06.866 --> 02:10.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
being used in the pilot,
a simple swab of the
cervix with vinegar.

02:10.466 --> 02:12.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

02:12.466 --> 02:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UMA SINGH: So, after one minute,
what you do is, do -- do the
inspection with good light.

02:18.533 --> 02:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if you see a white area,
you treat it by a procedure
which is called cryotherapy.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Literally freezing it off.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UMA SINGH: Yes, that's the
right word, freezing it off.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The
lesions are a virus called HPV.

02:31.033 --> 02:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The patient can't see or
feel it, and the immune
system usually fights it off.

02:35.700 --> 02:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
However, about one in every
100 infections turns cancerous.

02:40.033 --> 02:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vaccines are available
and have proven effective
in preventing HPV.

02:44.500 --> 02:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the cost puts them out of
reach of most Indian women.

02:47.633 --> 02:49.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

02:49.166 --> 02:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SMITHA SINGH, India (through
translator): Don't be afraid.

02:50.033 --> 02:51.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will remove them.

02:51.233 --> 02:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a very simple
thing, just 10 minutes.

02:53.333 --> 02:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The
approach here is to remove
any lesions right away.

02:56.700 --> 03:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no time or resources
to monitor or biopsy, no
assurance the women will return

03:02.433 --> 03:04.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for follow-up treatment.

03:04.566 --> 03:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is likely that in many,
if not most cases, you are
over-treating the patient.

03:09.733 --> 03:11.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

03:11.866 --> 03:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UMA SINGH: Yes, it may be a
little bit of over-treating,
but it has been seen that it

03:14.766 --> 03:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't produce any substantial
harm to the woman in relation
to producing any long-term

03:21.200 --> 03:23.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
effects on the cervix.

03:23.166 --> 03:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But, often,
women who test positive are
scared off by the prospect

03:26.866 --> 03:27.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of cryotherapy.

03:27.866 --> 03:29.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

03:29.366 --> 03:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SMITHA SINGH: They feel a
big treatment will be done.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And at times, they do not
give consent for the cryo.

03:34.233 --> 03:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: PSI
canvasser Pinky Rawat says that
happens for a simple reason.

03:41.733 --> 03:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PINKY RAWAT, Population
Services International
(through translator):
They hear the word cancer

03:43.200 --> 03:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they say, if I do have
cancer, what can I do?

03:46.033 --> 03:48.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They get very scared
when they hear cancer.

03:48.433 --> 03:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But even
as there's fear of cancer,
getting women to the screening

03:54.333 --> 03:57.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was a tough sell.

03:57.666 --> 04:02.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These women complained
that they need help for
far more mundane health
care issues, which

04:02.366 --> 04:03.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no one provides.

04:03.866 --> 04:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
My legs hurt all the time.

04:07.133 --> 04:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Give me something for my gout.

04:09.166 --> 04:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Many women
labor in the field and in
households struggling to get

04:12.533 --> 04:14.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by, and they neglect
their own health.

04:14.766 --> 04:17.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SONI GUPTA, Population
Services International
(through translator):
It's affected my own

04:17.666 --> 04:18.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
family.

04:18.933 --> 04:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's been three months
since my mother died.

04:20.900 --> 04:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: PSI worker
Soni Gupta says early screening
and treatment might have

04:24.600 --> 04:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saved her mother, who
died from cervical cancer.

04:27.466 --> 04:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SONI GUPTA (through
translator): I feel terrible.

04:30.266 --> 04:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Even though I work in this field
for women, my own mother died.

04:33.100 --> 04:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Of the
four women who tested positive
for the pre-cancerous lesions,

04:37.800 --> 04:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the social workers the next
morning were able to find just
one willing to go in and get

04:43.266 --> 04:44.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
treated.

04:44.366 --> 04:45.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN (through
translator): I'm afraid.

04:45.166 --> 04:47.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have four children.

04:47.200 --> 04:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It was
Kiran Rawat who needed a lot
of coaxing and reassurance by

04:51.833 --> 04:53.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a PSI outreach worker.

04:53.300 --> 04:56.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
There's nothing to worry about.

04:56.166 --> 04:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It will just take a few minutes.

04:58.100 --> 04:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you have my phone number.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can call me for anything.

05:02.100 --> 05:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: A few
minutes later, accompanied
by her husband, they
were on the way to Dr.

05:06.233 --> 05:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Smitha Singh's clinic.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Soon, the 10-minute
procedure was done.

05:09.666 --> 05:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
I was afraid at first.

05:11.900 --> 05:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
But, today, no problems, right?

05:13.900 --> 05:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
No problem today, but I
didn't sleep all night.

05:17.133 --> 05:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The hope is
that she will help spread the
word and a culture of preventive

05:21.600 --> 05:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care, says Dr. Uma Singh.

05:23.033 --> 05:25.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

05:25.100 --> 05:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
UMA SINGH: So, it is
like motivating them to
go for the checkup for
prevention of cancer,

05:30.500 --> 05:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for hypertension, for diabetes,
for anemia and multiple things.

05:35.866 --> 05:38.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then you have to ensure
that there have to
be good facilities.

05:38.066 --> 05:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That much
larger job of building a better
public health system will

05:42.700 --> 05:47.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
take time, but PSI says
its screening program
is set to scale up.

05:49.733 --> 05:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The state government has begun
to train workers to offer it in
all public health clinics based

05:54.266 --> 05:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on results in the pilot,
which concluded in January.

05:57.200 --> 06:01.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Seven thousand cases
were positive for the
pre-cancerous lesions.

06:01.333 --> 06:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
About two-thirds of these
women had them removed.

06:04.600 --> 06:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
this is Fred de Sam Lazaro
outside Lucknow, India.

06:09.600 --> 06:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fred's
reporting is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories
Project at University

06:15.466 --> 06:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of St. Thomas in Minnesota.
