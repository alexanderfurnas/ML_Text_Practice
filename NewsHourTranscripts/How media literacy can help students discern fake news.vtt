JUDY WOODRUFF: But first:
Helping children distinguish
between false information and

00:05.166 --> 00:10.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
fact-based news, it's a
distinction increasingly
a problem for adults.

00:10.066 --> 00:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, to be clear, we're
referring to false information
disguised as a legitimate news

00:17.100 --> 00:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
story, not reporting that
people dislike for political
reasons and label fake news.

00:23.100 --> 00:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington state,
educators and media literacy
advocates have joined
together with legislators

00:27.433 --> 00:29.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to address the problem.

00:29.466 --> 00:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Kavitha
Cardoza with our partner
Education Week traveled there

00:33.800 --> 00:35.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recently.

00:35.100 --> 00:37.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's part of our weekly
series Making the Grade.

00:37.233 --> 00:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NIAMH O'CONNELL, Teacher:
This was the front page of The
Seattle Post-Intelligencer.

00:41.933 --> 00:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Niamh O'Connell
third grade history class at
Bertschi School is analyzing

00:48.366 --> 00:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
old news stories, looking
for evidence of bias.

00:51.366 --> 00:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: People, if they don't
know how to analyze it, will
just say, oh, wow, that's

00:57.100 --> 00:59.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
true.

00:59.266 --> 01:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Fred Coddon
(ph) looks at the choice of
words used in a story about

01:01.466 --> 01:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Japanese internment camps
during World War II.

01:05.233 --> 01:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: Notice how they're
wording it Japanese, instead
of Japanese-Americans?

01:09.633 --> 01:11.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NIAMH O'CONNELL: What
was the purpose of that?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why do they do that?

01:13.033 --> 01:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: The purpose was to
say, oh, we're not imprisoning
American citizens, or, as

01:16.666 --> 01:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they put it, we're not
evacuating American citizens.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're evacuating Japanese.

01:22.733 --> 01:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NIAMH O'CONNELL: And why do
they use the word evacuate?

01:25.433 --> 01:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Another student
also notices the language.

01:28.766 --> 01:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILL PARSONS, Student: I saw
some fake advertising for the
Japanese internment camps.

01:35.733 --> 01:37.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They said they were
assembly centers.

01:37.766 --> 01:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NIAMH O'CONNELL: So they kind
of made it seem really cool,
and, actually, it wasn't?

01:40.733 --> 01:42.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILL PARSONS: Yes.

01:42.766 --> 01:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: O'Connell
uses examples from the past, so
these kids can become smarter

01:46.566 --> 01:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about media messages in
the present, even though
they're only 8 years old.

01:51.400 --> 01:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: I want to learn how
to like analyze it myself
and have my own opinion.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NIAMH O'CONNELL: They soak
up everything around them.

02:00.766 --> 02:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's important for
kids to be able to control the
interpretations that they hear

02:07.700 --> 02:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and see every day, instead
of the interpretations
maybe controlling them.

02:10.333 --> 02:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Recognizing
bias in news stories is
one form of media literacy.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Spotting when the news
is entirely fabricated,
like these stories, is
something else entirely.

02:22.900 --> 02:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Often, these stories are
designed to look as if
they come from legitimate
news organizations,

02:27.966 --> 02:31.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and are meant to be
easily shared on social
media, resulting in
confusion over what's

02:31.266 --> 02:33.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
real.

02:33.300 --> 02:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
During the recent election
season, there have been reports
of a concerted effort to spread

02:36.966 --> 02:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fake news, in a bid to
influence public opinion.

02:40.733 --> 02:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A recent Stanford University
study of almost 8,000 students
showed they were easily duped

02:46.400 --> 02:48.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
online.

02:48.400 --> 02:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Researchers found, overall,
young people's ability to
reason about the information on

02:52.433 --> 02:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Internet can be summed
up in one word: bleak.

02:55.966 --> 02:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have been working on
media literacy for how long?

02:59.900 --> 03:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLAIRE BEACH, Media Literacy
Advocate: About 40 years.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Claire
Beach is a media literacy
advocate and former teacher.

03:05.400 --> 03:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says just because kids are
comfortable with social media
doesn't mean they're savvy

03:09.033 --> 03:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about the information
they're consuming.

03:11.033 --> 03:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLAIRE BEACH: When they're using
their phones, they may know
how to make something work,

03:17.733 --> 03:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but they don't have the
ethical piece, the emotional
intelligence piece.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a wilderness out
there for some kids.

03:22.500 --> 03:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: She's worked
with lawmakers like Democratic
state Senator Marko Liias

03:28.900 --> 03:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to encourage media literacy
classes in grades K through 12.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARKO LIIAS (D), Washington
State Senator: I was reading a
stunning statistic that, just

03:34.233 --> 03:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since 2003 to today, humanity
has created more information
than we created in all of

03:40.733 --> 03:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
human history up until 2003.

03:42.900 --> 03:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the pace of information, the
pace of data, the pace of what
our students are being exposed

03:47.866 --> 03:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to is rising exponentially.

03:49.900 --> 03:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: How do you
convince people that this is not
about politics, this is about

03:53.500 --> 03:55.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
critical thinking?

03:55.533 --> 03:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARKO LIIAS: Both of the
bills that I have passed
have had bipartisan support.

03:58.466 --> 04:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether you're a Democrat or
a Republican, right or left,
we want people to go into the

04:02.066 --> 04:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voting booth educated and
prepared to make the best
decision for our communities.

04:09.033 --> 04:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if people can't
discern fake information
from real information,
that really corrodes

04:13.666 --> 04:15.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the basic institutions
of our democracy.

04:15.800 --> 04:20.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: The
law in Washington state
encourages educators to
develop policies around

04:21.900 --> 04:23.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
media literacy and
to share resources.

04:23.800 --> 04:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It also allows districts access
to federal technology funding.

04:28.233 --> 04:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This new law in Washington
is being used as a model by
about a dozen other states.

04:34.833 --> 04:36.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Advocates want to see
media literacy taught
in all 50 states.

04:36.900 --> 04:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES STEYER, Founder and CEO,
Common Sense Media: There's
clearly growing momentum to

04:40.700 --> 04:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pass this kind of legislation.

04:42.700 --> 04:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Jim Steyer
founded Common Sense, one of
several organizations dedicated

04:47.633 --> 04:48.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to media literacy.

04:48.900 --> 04:51.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: Here are five
ways to spot fake news.

04:51.233 --> 04:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: They have also
worked with Harvard University
to create free lesson plans

04:55.566 --> 04:57.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and online resources.

04:57.466 --> 05:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: The essence
of media literacy is
critical thinking.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every child in America needs
those skills, particularly when
they live in this 24/7 media

05:07.800 --> 05:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and technology world,
where they're just
bombarded with information.

05:11.033 --> 05:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Oftentimes, it's inaccurate.

05:13.133 --> 05:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: These students
are in Catherine Sparks' English
class at Edmonds-Woodway High

05:18.166 --> 05:19.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
School.

05:19.766 --> 05:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STUDENT: It's crazy how
many people actually
trust these sources.

05:22.300 --> 05:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: You can't distinguish
the difference anymore.

05:25.133 --> 05:27.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUDENT: It can
get 1,000 retweets.

05:27.066 --> 05:28.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is not even true.

05:28.766 --> 05:32.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Sparks
uses the play "Hamlet"
to talk about fake news.

05:32.200 --> 05:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CATHERINE SPARKS, Teacher: It's
about spying and lying and how
that creates a ripe environment

05:38.266 --> 05:40.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the proliferation
of fake news.

05:40.333 --> 05:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Sparks
has created untrue
stories based on the play.

05:44.100 --> 05:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CATHERINE SPARKS: In act one,
scene two, when he says oh,
but this too, too solid flesh

05:48.700 --> 05:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would melt, thaw and resolve
itself into a dew, sure, it
could be a metaphor, but Hamlet

05:53.566 --> 05:55.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has a shocking
flesh-eating illness.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:57.633 --> 06:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CATHERINE SPARKS: Could you
actually support that with
evidence from the text?

06:02.200 --> 06:03.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Good luck.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Fake news is not news
you disagree with.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Fake news is fabricated news.

06:08.266 --> 06:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Sparks believes
letting her students create
their own fake news will teach

06:12.366 --> 06:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them how to critically
think through some of the
information they receive.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What words are used?

06:17.400 --> 06:18.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who benefits?

06:18.400 --> 06:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is there any truth to the story?

06:20.433 --> 06:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: It's got to be
dramatic, like, absurd things
that you're like, what?

06:24.700 --> 06:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CATHERINE SPARKS: This is
a juicy story right here.

06:28.433 --> 06:32.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUDENT: It's
entirely fabricated.

06:32.100 --> 06:37.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CATHERINE SPARKS: What
would be the outcome of
producing this story?

06:39.166 --> 06:41.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: If the public
saw this, they're like,
oh, my gosh, there's so
much drama and scandal

06:41.600 --> 06:43.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going on.

06:43.700 --> 06:47.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CATHERINE SPARKS: What's
been the most painful
about the proliferation
of fake news in the

06:49.066 --> 06:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
media is to watch my students
start to distrust everything.

06:52.300 --> 06:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: That's
exactly why state Senator Marko
Liias says media literacy is

06:57.066 --> 06:59.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so important.

06:59.566 --> 07:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARKO LIIAS: At its
bedrock, when our founding
fathers created this
country, the reason why

07:02.766 --> 07:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were so committed to public
education was to make sure that
we had an educated citizenry.

07:09.733 --> 07:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CATHERINE SPARKS: Anything that
starts with "share if you're
outraged," that's a bad sign.

07:14.766 --> 07:17.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And outrage is just the
lifeblood of fake news.

07:17.500 --> 07:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: For the "PBS
NewsHour" and Education Week,
I'm Kavitha Cardoza in Seattle,
