INTO MORE OF A PARAMILITARY
SERVICE.
>> RIGHT.

06:35.794 --> 06:38.154
SERVICE.
>> RIGHT.
SO FOR NEARLY 12 YEARS, THE

06:38.159 --> 06:40.280
>> RIGHT.
SO FOR NEARLY 12 YEARS, THE
C.I.A. HAS BEEN IN MANY WAYS

06:40.285 --> 06:43.075
SO FOR NEARLY 12 YEARS, THE

ALMOST SINGULARLY FOCUSED ON

COUNTERTERRORISM CAPTURING,
KILLING, INTERROGATING.

06:47.667 --> 06:50.958
COUNTERTERRORISM CAPTURING,
KILLING, INTERROGATING.
AND THESE ARE VERY PARAMILITARY

06:50.958 --> 06:51.920
KILLING, INTERROGATING.
AND THESE ARE VERY PARAMILITARY
FUNCTIONS THAT THE C.I.A. HAS

06:51.925 --> 06:52.983
AND THESE ARE VERY PARAMILITARY
FUNCTIONS THAT THE C.I.A. HAS
BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED IN.

06:52.988 --> 06:54.613
FUNCTIONS THAT THE C.I.A. HAS
BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED IN.
THIS IS MAYBE JUST THE BEGINNING

06:54.618 --> 06:58.203
BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED IN.
THIS IS MAYBE JUST THE BEGINNING
OF A SHIFT BACK TOWARDS MORE

06:58.208 --> 06:59.767
THIS IS MAYBE JUST THE BEGINNING
OF A SHIFT BACK TOWARDS MORE
TRADITIONAL ESPIONAGE OPERATIONS

06:59.772 --> 07:01.362
OF A SHIFT BACK TOWARDS MORE
TRADITIONAL ESPIONAGE OPERATIONS
AND ALSO THE STRATEGIC ANALYSIS

07:01.367 --> 07:03.094
TRADITIONAL ESPIONAGE OPERATIONS
AND ALSO THE STRATEGIC ANALYSIS
THAT THE C.I.A. HAS DONE IN THE

THAT THE C.I.A. HAS DONE IN THE
PAST.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.686
THAT THE C.I.A. HAS DONE IN THE
PAST.
NOW, AS I WRITE ABOUT IN THE

07:05.691 --> 07:07.382
PAST.
NOW, AS I WRITE ABOUT IN THE
PAPER TODAY, IT'S GOING TO TAKE

07:07.387 --> 07:09.245
NOW, AS I WRITE ABOUT IN THE
PAPER TODAY, IT'S GOING TO TAKE
SOME TIME, YOU CAN'T JUST SORT

07:09.245 --> 07:10.972
PAPER TODAY, IT'S GOING TO TAKE
SOME TIME, YOU CAN'T JUST SORT
OF CHANGE THE AGENCY OVERNIGHT.

07:10.977 --> 07:12.739
SOME TIME, YOU CAN'T JUST SORT
OF CHANGE THE AGENCY OVERNIGHT.
THE AGENCY, AS I SAID, HAS BEEN

07:12.739 --> 07:14.166
OF CHANGE THE AGENCY OVERNIGHT.
THE AGENCY, AS I SAID, HAS BEEN
DOING THIS FOR ABOUT A DOZEN

07:14.166 --> 07:16.693
THE AGENCY, AS I SAID, HAS BEEN
DOING THIS FOR ABOUT A DOZEN
YEARS AND A WHOLE GENERATION OF

07:16.693 --> 07:17.558
DOING THIS FOR ABOUT A DOZEN
YEARS AND A WHOLE GENERATION OF
C.I.A. OFFICERS HAVE BEEN

MANHUNTING MISSION.

07:22.145 --> 07:24.409
TRAINED IN THIS SORT OF TACTICAL
MANHUNTING MISSION.
SO GOING BACK TO THE MORE

07:24.409 --> 07:25.274
MANHUNTING MISSION.
SO GOING BACK TO THE MORE
TRADITIONAL ESPIONAGE THAT MANY

07:25.274 --> 07:26.601
SO GOING BACK TO THE MORE
TRADITIONAL ESPIONAGE THAT MANY
PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT AND KNOW FROM

07:26.606 --> 07:28.732
TRADITIONAL ESPIONAGE THAT MANY
PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT AND KNOW FROM
THE COLD WAR AND FROM SPY MOVIES

07:28.732 --> 07:30.793
PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT AND KNOW FROM
THE COLD WAR AND FROM SPY MOVIES
I MEAN, THIS DOES TAKE TIME.

07:30.793 --> 07:32.352
THE COLD WAR AND FROM SPY MOVIES
I MEAN, THIS DOES TAKE TIME.
IT COULD TAKE YEARS, IT COULD

07:32.357 --> 07:36.210

IT COULD TAKE YEARS, IT COULD
TAKE ANOTHER GENERATION.

WHAT'S THE IDEA?

07:47.718 --> 07:51.207
MORE EFFICIENT?
WHAT'S THE IDEA?
>> WELL, I MEAN, THE IDEA IS

07:51.212 --> 07:53.966
WHAT'S THE IDEA?
>> WELL, I MEAN, THE IDEA IS
THAT MISSILES FIRED FROM

>> WELL, I MEAN, THE IDEA IS
THAT MISSILES FIRED FROM
AIRPLANES SHOULD BE THE JOB OF

THAT MISSILES FIRED FROM
AIRPLANES SHOULD BE THE JOB OF
THE -- SHOULD BE DONE BY THE

AIRPLANES SHOULD BE THE JOB OF
THE -- SHOULD BE DONE BY THE
MILITARY, RIGHT?

07:58.958 --> 08:00.649
THE -- SHOULD BE DONE BY THE
MILITARY, RIGHT?
IT'S A MILITARY OPERATION.

08:00.654 --> 08:03.646
MILITARY, RIGHT?
IT'S A MILITARY OPERATION.
AND IN THEORY THE IDEA IS THAT

08:03.646 --> 08:04.578
IT'S A MILITARY OPERATION.
AND IN THEORY THE IDEA IS THAT
THIS WILL BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE

08:04.578 --> 08:05.773
AND IN THEORY THE IDEA IS THAT
THIS WILL BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE
AND MORE TRANSPARENT.

08:05.773 --> 08:07.200
THIS WILL BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE
AND MORE TRANSPARENT.
NOW, IN PRACTICE, THIS DOESN'T

08:07.206 --> 08:07.768
AND MORE TRANSPARENT.
NOW, IN PRACTICE, THIS DOESN'T
ALWAYS HAPPEN.

08:07.768 --> 08:09.661
NOW, IN PRACTICE, THIS DOESN'T
ALWAYS HAPPEN.
AS WE SAID, THE MILITARY HAS A

08:09.666 --> 08:12.122
ALWAYS HAPPEN.
AS WE SAID, THE MILITARY HAS A
DRONE PROGRAM RIGHT NOW IN YEMEN

08:12.127 --> 08:13.818
AS WE SAID, THE MILITARY HAS A
DRONE PROGRAM RIGHT NOW IN YEMEN
AND IT IS VERY HARD TO GET ANY

08:13.823 --> 08:16.445
DRONE PROGRAM RIGHT NOW IN YEMEN
AND IT IS VERY HARD TO GET ANY
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT PROGRAM

08:16.445 --> 08:18.207
AND IT IS VERY HARD TO GET ANY
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT PROGRAM
WHO IS KILLED, WHERE THE STRIKES

08:18.212 --> 08:19.473
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT PROGRAM
WHO IS KILLED, WHERE THE STRIKES
TAKE PLACE.

08:19.473 --> 08:21.665
WHO IS KILLED, WHERE THE STRIKES
TAKE PLACE.
AND SO JUST BECAUSE IT'S IN THE

08:21.670 --> 08:23.296
TAKE PLACE.
AND SO JUST BECAUSE IT'S IN THE
PENTAGON'S HAND DOESN'T MAKE IT

08:23.301 --> 08:24.992
AND SO JUST BECAUSE IT'S IN THE
PENTAGON'S HAND DOESN'T MAKE IT
NECESSARILY MORE TRANSPARENT OR

SO, AGAIN, JUST BY SAYING THAT

08:30.348 --> 08:32.439
ACCOUNTABLE.
SO, AGAIN, JUST BY SAYING THAT
THERE'S GOING TO BE A SHIFT,

08:32.439 --> 08:33.639
SO, AGAIN, JUST BY SAYING THAT
THERE'S GOING TO BE A SHIFT,
THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE MORE

08:33.639 --> 08:34.834
THERE'S GOING TO BE A SHIFT,
THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE MORE
DETAILS ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE IS

08:34.834 --> 08:36.100
THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE MORE
DETAILS ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE IS
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING

08:36.100 --> 08:37.694
DETAILS ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE IS
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING
THAT ACTUALLY IN HIS SPEECH

08:37.694 --> 08:38.459

THAT ACTUALLY IN HIS SPEECH
YESTERDAY PRESIDENT OBAMA DIDN'T

OPERATIONS, THE COUNTERTERRORISM
CENTER AS I WRITE ABOUT HAS
REALLY DRAMATICALLY EXPANDED

REALLY DRAMATICALLY EXPANDED
SINCE 9/11 AND SORT OF BECOME

IF THE DRONE STRIKES LEAVE THE
COUNTERTERRORISM CENTER AND GO
TO THE MILITARY THEN THE

09:15.904 --> 09:17.094
COUNTERTERRORISM CENTER AND GO
TO THE MILITARY THEN THE
COUNTERTERRORISM CENTER MAY FIND
