milestone you spend a lot of
time in
this industry working very hard
on

01:35.662 --> 01:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things that don't do terribly
well or
public doesn't get them or
whatever and

01:39.499 --> 01:44.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then you suddenly ring the bell

seems
right to leave it was doing the
wrong

02:05.192 --> 02:09.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing but it's been a happy time
I happy
time with roots in a book by
American

02:09.963 --> 02:15.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
historian Carol Wallace author
of two
Marion english lord sir
julianne's

02:15.869 --> 02:22.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inspiration for the series when
he had
been asked by the producers to
write a

02:22.042 --> 02:29.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
series about English aristocrats
he had
been reading to marry an English
Lord

02:30.017 --> 02:36.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he said he thought it was
all very
well for these areas to marry
but then

02:36.356 --> 02:40.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what happened to them twenty
years later
when they were I think he put it

02:40.861 --> 02:47.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
freezing in a house in Cheshire
aching
for a long island and that of

wallace's book tells the true
stories of
young American heiresses who
left the

02:57.310 --> 03:02.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
USA in the late 1800's to shop
for
husbands in England their money

03:02.582 --> 03:08.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attracted down at the heels
aristocrats
who had titles and little else
what

03:08.055 --> 03:14.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would he have seen in these
stories in
this history I think what
julianne saw

03:14.327 --> 03:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the source of the drama is
exactly the
asymmetry of expectation what
these

03:19.766 --> 03:23.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American girls thought marriage
was
going to be and what it turned
out to be

03:23.070 --> 03:30.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and how their American
expectations kind
of trailed along with them and
formed

03:30.110 --> 03:36.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their relationships and their
ideas of
marriage as they would twenty
thirty

be happy

03:46.560 --> 03:51.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to start anew to be undertaking

not so
maybe I'll let you know if
anything

03:58.238 --> 04:07.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes of it and how sad I do
feel to say
goodbye to people in houses you
know the

04:07.781 --> 04:13.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family it's it's been it's been
a
definite life-changing kind of
time for

04:13.487 --> 04:16.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all of us in what way

04:16.223 --> 04:22.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well we've all been through some
something that has felt like it
had a

04:22.996 --> 04:28.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big impact on our our personal
lives and
we've been through it together
the drama

04:28.235 --> 04:33.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
began in 1912 the day after the
sinking
of the Titanic and has proceeded

Age

find many formerly rich families
abandoning the live down

04:47.687 --> 04:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unable to afford the expense
like the
character she plays mcgovern is
married

04:53.460 --> 04:59.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to an Englishman and lives in
the UK how
is it different from other
television

04:59.166 --> 05:04.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
series well the one
extraordinary
difference is that every word is
written

05:05.005 --> 05:11.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by one man I don't know of any
other
television show that works that
way and

05:11.178 --> 05:16.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I did this day find it
absolutely
mind-boggling Julian Fellowes
did not

05:16.583 --> 05:21.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intend on being the sole writer
too I
was absolutely thrilled to get
other

05:21.321 --> 05:27.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people to do it but for some
reason
rather which I can't really
explain the

05:27.794 --> 05:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
series seemed to have quite a
distinctive voice and we did try
at the

05:33.833 --> 05:38.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beginning to see if we could get
other
people to replicate that voice
and we

05:38.071 --> 05:43.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tried to the very good people
but it
seemed that if we wanted to
sustain this

05:43.343 --> 05:51.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particular voice it had to be me
it's
coming from his heart his
experience his

05:51.351 --> 05:53.420 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
passion

05:53.453 --> 05:58.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PBS his masterpiece present
Downton
Abbey in the United States and
Rebecca

05:58.625 --> 06:02.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eaton as the program's executive
producer has a lot of heart in
it

06:02.662 --> 06:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's a lot of generosity is
your
characters who are taking care
of each

06:07.334 --> 06:14.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other and that is a lot of who
Julian is
we dealt with all the characters
very

06:14.307 --> 06:20.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evenly I don't want to be
grounded and
my husband we didn't say the
family of

06:20.480 --> 06:24.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the important characters and the
servants of the comic relief for
the

06:24.117 --> 06:27.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
servants a gallant and suffering
but the
family is horrible

06:27.487 --> 06:31.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of which would have been a
treatment
in an earlier period you give
equal time

06:31.758 --> 06:37.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to everyone so in a way you're
looking
at that age old struggle that we
are

06:37.964 --> 06:45.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dealing with today in 2015 about
inequality discrimination and
the rest

06:45.305 --> 06:50.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of it and you bring your own set
of use
is this business of entitlement
that a

06:50.243 --> 06:54.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
child of the middle or upper
classes is
brought up to believe that
certain

06:54.981 --> 06:58.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things are sort of their right
that this
is the way they will leave
whereas other

06:58.752 --> 07:02.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people are brought up to feel
like
outsiders who your over-reaching
said

07:02.889 --> 07:06.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's not for the likes of
Arsenal all
this stuff still goes on it
interests me

07:06.926 --> 07:12.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it shocks me and it it drives me
mad
when people try to pretend it
doesn't

07:12.599 --> 07:16.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exist because of course it
doesn't exist
for their there are millions of
people

07:16.936 --> 07:21.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are being cheated of their
proper
destiny because he does still
exist

07:21.975 --> 07:26.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
do you think down and
contributes to add
to the conversation to the
discussion of

07:26.313 --> 07:32.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I hope it contributes I
mean I
think in our society
particularly for

07:33.019 --> 07:38.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the me me me generation there is
a kind
of underlying solipsistic in so
many

07:38.191 --> 07:44.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
others that the only life that's
really
happening is sorrow and everyone
else's

07:44.631 --> 07:52.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life is sort of dependent on our
life
one of the important things
about child

07:52.172 --> 07:59.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drama is to remind the viewer
that
everyone is a hundred percent at
the

07:59.145 --> 08:03.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
center of their own life there
is no
life being lived under that roof
that is

08:03.516 --> 08:10.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more or less important that Mary
or
Daisy what happens to them is is
just as

08:10.690 --> 08:17.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important and that's why we pass
equal
dramatic wait for all the
stories to

08:17.130 --> 08:21.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show that what do you think will
give
people great joy and excitement
and

08:21.134 --> 08:24.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surprise and in a good way and
what do
you think we'll see people sad
or

08:24.771 --> 08:29.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devastated or disappointed or IV
George
these questions because they're
always

08:29.943 --> 08:36.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asked in such optimism as if
there is
any chance that I'll answer I
mean was

08:36.483 --> 08:42.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are some things in the
season that
will make people sad and there
are other

08:42.155 --> 08:46.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things that will make them happy
and
Maggie will say some things that
I hope

08:46.626 --> 08:52.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will make them laugh what should
fans
expect the audience expect I
would say

08:52.399 --> 08:58.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the audience will feel
satisfied
that they've had a chance to say
goodbye

08:58.705 --> 09:07.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to every character in a
gratifying way I
think they'll feel whole and not

09:07.714 --> 09:13.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
short-changed it's enough for me
that
people enjoyed it and they had a
thing

09:13.853 --> 09:16.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Sunday night and they would
say to
each other

09:16.589 --> 09:20.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hurry up downtown starting in
five
minutes when I love that and I
think

09:20.193 --> 09:24.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that if we all managed to
produce a show
that families could watch
together and

09:24.497 --> 09:28.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
argue over the water cooler in
the
office the next day that's
enough of an

09:28.067 --> 09:31.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
achievement for me I don't need
to feel
that the world will never be the
same

09:31.805 --> 09:34.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
again after denton

09:34.574 --> 09:38.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so what do you think I should do
what
you like london life

09:38.845 --> 09:44.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
acted like a life and beginning
the
first Sunday in January fans can
lose

09:45.018 --> 09:49.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
themselves in the lives of the
people
they've come to know as friends
