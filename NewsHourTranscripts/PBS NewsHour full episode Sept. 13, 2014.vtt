00:31.331 --> 00:32.466
VULNERABLE AT THIS POINT.

00:32.466 --> 00:35.002
THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN’T FEED

00:49.683 --> 00:51.218
TO ENLIST EGYPT’S SUPPORT IN

00:51.218 --> 00:52.386
WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE DESCRIBED

00:52.386 --> 00:54.154
AS AMERICA’S WAR AGAINST THE

00:54.154 --> 00:55.522
ISLAMIC STATE, ALSO KNOWN AS

00:55.522 --> 00:56.456
ISIL.

00:56.456 --> 00:57.891
EGYPT IS THE MOST POPULOUS

00:57.891 --> 01:00.160
COUNTRY IN THE ARAB WORLD.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.062
>> IT WILL BE OUR GOAL IN EVERY

01:13.340 --> 01:14.641
RADIO ADDRESS, PRESIDENT OBAMA

01:14.641 --> 01:16.209

01:16.209 --> 01:18.412
BUILD AN ARAB COALITION TO FIGHT

01:18.412 --> 01:20.080
THE EXTREMIST GROUP, WHICH HAS

01:20.080 --> 01:21.882
SEIZED SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF

01:21.882 --> 01:23.317
SYRIA AND IRAQ.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.619
BUT THE PRESIDENT CAUTIONED:

01:25.619 --> 01:26.486
>> TO MEET A THREAT LIKE THIS,

01:26.486 --> 01:28.422
WE HAVE TO BE SMART, WE HAVE TO

01:28.422 --> 01:30.357
USE OUR POWER WISELY, AND WE

01:30.357 --> 01:31.725
HAVE TO AVOID THE MISTAKES OF

01:31.725 --> 01:32.926
THE PAST.

01:32.926 --> 01:33.860
>> Sreenivasan: THE IRAQI PRIME

IRAQI CITIES, INCLUDING MOSUL,

01:47.274 --> 01:49.743

02:03.657 --> 02:04.691
HE HAD BEEN DOING HUMANITARIAN

02:04.691 --> 02:05.892
WORK AROUND THE WORLD SINCE

02:05.892 --> 02:07.561
1999.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.895
TURNING NOW TO UKRAINE, WHERE

02:08.895 --> 02:10.430
DESPITE THE RECENT CEASE-FIRE

02:10.430 --> 02:12.132
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS ITS FORCES

02:12.132 --> 02:13.734
REPELLED AN ATTACK BY

02:13.734 --> 02:15.302
PRO-RUSSIAN REBELS AT THE

02:15.302 --> 02:16.937
AIRPORT IN DONETSK.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.272
NEARBY, IN LUHANSK, A CONVOY OF

02:19.272 --> 02:21.441
MORE THAN 200 RUSSIAN TRUCKS

02:21.441 --> 02:22.743
CROSSED THE BORDER TO DELIVER

02:22.743 --> 02:24.945
FOOD TO THAT REBEL-HELD CITY OF

02:24.945 --> 02:26.413
400,000.

02:26.413 --> 02:27.481
THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS THERE

02:27.481 --> 02:28.882
HAVE BEEN WITHOUT WATER OR

02:28.882 --> 02:30.884
ELECTRICITY FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.319
TODAY, UKRAINE’S PRIME MINISTER

02:32.319 --> 02:34.121
EXPRESSED PESSIMISM ABOUT A

02:34.121 --> 02:35.455
PEACEFUL RESOLUTION TO THE

02:35.455 --> 02:36.757
CRISIS.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.258
>> LET ME PUT IT BLUNTLY, WE ARE

02:38.258 --> 02:40.093
STILL IN THE STATE OF WAR, AND

02:40.093 --> 02:41.528
THE KEY AGGRESSOR IS RUSSIAN

02:41.528 --> 02:43.096
FEDERATION.

02:43.096 --> 02:43.430
>> Sreenivasan: BACK IN THIS

COUNTRY, LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:44.498 --> 02:45.999
OFFICIALS FROM THREE STATES

02:45.999 --> 02:47.501
CONVERGED ON A LOCATION IN

02:47.501 --> 02:48.935
NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA

02:48.935 --> 02:50.637
OVERNIGHT AFTER TWO STATE

02:50.637 --> 02:52.305
TROOPERS WERE SHOT OUTSIDE THEIR

02:52.305 --> 02:53.106
BARRACKS.

02:53.106 --> 02:54.508
ONE TROOPER WAS KILLED AND THE

02:54.508 --> 02:55.609
OTHER WOUNDED.

02:55.609 --> 02:56.710
THE INCIDENT OCCURRED IN

02:56.710 --> 02:58.645
BLOOMING GROVE, PENNSYLVANIA.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.013
POLICE ARE QUESTIONING A 48-

03:00.013 --> 03:01.448
YEAR-OLD MAN DESCRIBED AS A

03:01.448 --> 03:02.416
PERSON OF INTEREST.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.184
NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN MADE.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.452
WITH LESS THAN TWO MONTHS UNTIL

03:05.452 --> 03:07.154
ELECTION DAY, A FEDERAL APPEALS

03:07.154 --> 03:09.823
COURT HAS REINSTATED A WISCONSIN

03:09.823 --> 03:12.492
LAW REQUIRING VOTERS TO SHOW A

03:12.492 --> 03:14.094
PHOTO I.D. AT THE POLLS.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.529
A THREE-JUDGE PANEL ISSUED THE

03:15.529 --> 03:16.763
RULING YESTERDAY.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.665
LAST APRIL, A LOWER COURT FOUND

03:18.665 --> 03:20.500
THE LAW UNCONSTITUTIONAL, SAYING

03:20.500 --> 03:22.436
IT POSED AN UNFAIR BURDEN ON

03:22.436 --> 03:24.104
POOR AND MINORITY VOTERS.

03:24.104 --> 03:25.539
MORE THAN 30 STATES HAVE SOME

03:25.539 --> 03:27.507
FORM OF VOTER I.D. LAW ON THE

03:27.507 --> 03:28.508
BOOKS.

03:28.508 --> 03:29.709
THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE NOW

03:29.709 --> 03:31.611
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT UP TO A THIRD

03:31.611 --> 03:33.780
OF ITS RETIRED PLAYERS COULD

03:33.780 --> 03:35.882
DEVELOP LONG-TERM COGNITIVE

03:35.882 --> 03:37.517
PROBLEMS, MANY AT WHAT IT

03:37.517 --> 03:40.020
DESCRIBES AS "NOTABLY YOUNGER

03:40.020 --> 03:41.455
AGES" THAN THE GENERAL

03:41.455 --> 03:42.322
POPULATION.

03:42.322 --> 03:43.256
THE DISCLOSURE WAS MADE IN

03:43.256 --> 03:44.458
PAPERS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT IN

03:44.458 --> 03:45.725
CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT

03:45.725 --> 03:47.461
OF A LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY FORMER

03:47.461 --> 03:49.396
PLAYERS AGAINST THE LEAGUE.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.864
ADRIAN PETERSON, ONE OF THE

03:50.864 --> 03:52.632
N.F.L.’S BIGGEST STARS, HAS BEEN

03:52.632 --> 03:54.901
INDICTED IN TEXAS ON CHILD ABUSE

03:54.901 --> 03:55.669
CHARGES.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.404
HE ALLEGEDLY USED A BRANCH TO

03:57.404 --> 03:59.706
SPANK HIS FOUR-YEAR-OLD SON.

03:59.706 --> 04:00.974
THE CHILD REPORTEDLY SUFFERED

04:00.974 --> 04:02.342
NUMEROUS CUTS AND BRUISES ON HIS

04:02.342 --> 04:04.211
BACK, LEGS, BUTTOCKS AND

04:04.211 --> 04:05.145
SCROTUM.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.313
PETERSON’S LAWYER SAYS THE

04:06.313 --> 04:07.414
MINNESOTA VIKINGS RUNNING BACK

04:07.414 --> 04:09.649
NEVER INTENDED TO HARM THE CHILD

04:09.649 --> 04:10.884
AND SAID PETERSON HAD BEEN

04:10.884 --> 04:12.652
DISCIPLINED THE SAME WAY WHEN HE

04:12.652 --> 04:14.121
WAS GROWING UP.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.056
AND FOR 13 YEARS, NO ONE KNEW

04:16.056 --> 04:17.657
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE IN

04:17.657 --> 04:19.493
THIS PHOTOGRAPH, WHICH WAS FOUND

04:19.493 --> 04:21.495
AT GROUND ZERO A MONTH AFTER THE

04:21.495 --> 04:23.096
9/11 ATTACK.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.431
EACH YEAR, LESLEY UNIVERSITY

04:24.431 --> 04:25.866
PROFESSOR ELIZABETH STRINGER

04:25.866 --> 04:27.901
KEEFE POSTED THE PICTURE ONLINE

04:27.901 --> 04:29.803
HOPING TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.438
FINALLY, THIS WEEK, A NETWORK OF

04:31.438 --> 04:33.173
BOSTON BLOGS WROTE ABOUT HER

04:33.173 --> 04:35.375
SEARCH, AND MORE THAN 70,000

04:35.375 --> 04:37.644
PEOPLE RETWEETED THE PHOTO.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.146
ON FRIDAY, ONE OF THE PEOPLE IN

04:39.146 --> 04:40.313
THE PHOTO SAW IT AND CAME

04:40.313 --> 04:40.914
FORWARD.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.649
TURNS OUT, FRED MAHE WAS ON THE

04:42.649 --> 04:44.951
77th FLOOR OF THE SOUTH TOWER ON

04:44.951 --> 04:46.853
THE DAY OF THE ATTACK AND HIS

04:46.853 --> 04:48.288
PHOTO WAS LOST.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.823
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT EVERYONE

04:49.823 --> 04:51.791
IN THE PICTURE IS ALIVE.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.627
MAHE WROTE, "ON SEPTEMBER 11, WE

04:53.627 --> 04:54.961
REMEMBER WHAT WE LOST.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.630
ON SEPTEMBER 12, WE REMEMBER

04:56.630 --> 04:57.631
WHAT WE HAVE."

05:08.542 --> 05:08.975
>> Sreenivasan: FOR MORE ABOUT

05:08.975 --> 05:10.010
THE WAR ON THE ISLAMIC STATE, WE

05:10.010 --> 05:11.278
ARE JOINED NOW BY AUSTIN LONG.

05:11.278 --> 05:12.445
HE IS A PROFESSOR AT COLUMBIA

05:12.445 --> 05:13.613
UNIVERSITY’S SCHOOL OF

05:13.613 --> 05:14.548
INTERNATIONAL AND PUBLIC

05:14.548 --> 05:15.081
AFFAIRS.

05:15.081 --> 05:16.149
PREVIOUSLY, HE WAS AN ADVISER TO

05:16.149 --> 05:17.684
THE MULTINATIONAL FORCE IN IRAQ.

05:17.684 --> 05:19.419
SO THERE SEEMS TO BE IN PUBLIC

05:19.419 --> 05:21.521
OPINION POLLS SUPPORT FOR AIR

05:21.521 --> 05:23.323
STRIKES BUT NOT FOR GROUND

05:23.323 --> 05:23.823
TROOPS.

05:23.823 --> 05:24.891
AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE PLAN

05:24.891 --> 05:25.759
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS FOLLOWING

05:25.759 --> 05:26.593
AT THE MOMENT.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.428
HOW EFFECTIVE CAN AIR STRIKES BE

05:28.428 --> 05:29.496
WITHOUT INTELLIGENCE ON THE

05:29.496 --> 05:31.097
GROUND THAT CAN VERIFY WHAT’S

05:31.097 --> 05:32.632
HAPPENING AND GATHER MORE

05:32.632 --> 05:33.433
INTELLIGENCE ON WHETHER YOU’RE

05:33.433 --> 05:34.000
GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING OR

05:34.000 --> 05:34.668
NOT?

05:34.668 --> 05:35.335
>> IT’S VERY DIFFICULT TO

05:35.335 --> 05:36.536
CONDUCT EFFECTIVE AIR STRIKES

05:36.536 --> 05:38.038
WITHOUT SOME GROUND PRESENCE.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.806
IN EASTERN IRAQ, THE U.S. HAS

05:39.806 --> 05:41.174
SOME GROUND PRESENCE IN THE FORM

05:41.174 --> 05:41.775
OF ADVISERS.

05:41.775 --> 05:42.609
THERE’S PROBABLY ALSO

05:42.609 --> 05:44.344
INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS, THINGS

05:44.344 --> 05:44.778
LIKE THAT.

05:44.778 --> 05:45.845
YOU CAN ALSO COLLECT A LOT OF

05:45.845 --> 05:47.080
INTELLIGENCE WITH ASSETS LIKE

05:47.080 --> 05:48.348
DRONES.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.282
SO THERE CAN BE SOME

05:49.282 --> 05:50.483
EFFECTIVENESS.

05:50.483 --> 05:51.585
BUT THE BIG QUESTION IS WHO ARE

05:51.585 --> 05:52.452
GOING TO BE THE BOOTS ON THE

05:52.452 --> 05:54.154
GROUND THAT TAKE THE TERRITORY

05:54.154 --> 05:55.689
THAT AIR STRIKES SORT OF OPEN UP

05:55.689 --> 05:57.190
OPPORTUNITY TO SEIZE?

05:57.190 --> 05:57.891
>> Sreenivasan: RIGHT, AND THAT

05:57.891 --> 06:00.560
RECORD HAS BEEN MIXED AT BEST

06:00.560 --> 06:01.761
WHEN IT COMES TO IRAQI FORCES

06:01.761 --> 06:03.563
STAYING THROUGH THE FIGHT.

06:03.563 --> 06:04.164
>> ABSOLUTELY.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.799
THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES IN

06:05.799 --> 06:07.567
PARTICULAR ARE VERY MIXED.

06:07.567 --> 06:08.835
THEIR SPECIAL OPERATIONS UNITS

06:08.835 --> 06:10.136
ARE QUITE EFFECTIVE AND HAVE

06:10.136 --> 06:11.871
FOUGHT VERY WELL WITHIN THE

06:11.871 --> 06:14.241
LIMITATIONS THAT THEY HAVE.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.108
BUT THERE’S ONLY A FEW THOUSAND

06:15.108 --> 06:15.976
OF THEM.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.110
THE VAST BULK OF THE IRAQI

06:17.110 --> 06:18.411
MILITARY SUFFERS FROM A LOT OF

06:18.411 --> 06:19.846
WEAKNESSES, AND THE KURDISH

06:19.846 --> 06:20.847
PESHMERGA, WHO HAVE FOUGHT

06:20.847 --> 06:21.915
BETTER, STILL HAVE THEIR OWN

06:21.915 --> 06:22.916
WEAKNESSES, AS WELL.

06:22.916 --> 06:23.984
THERE ARE REAL QUESTIONS ABOUT

06:23.984 --> 06:26.052
WHO WILL BE THE EFFECTIVE BOOTS

06:26.052 --> 06:26.820
ON THE GROUND.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.021
>> Sreenivasan: ISIL, ISIS,

06:28.021 --> 06:29.055
ISLAMIC STATE, THEY STILL

06:29.055 --> 06:30.790
CONTROL MAJOR CITIES.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.726
HOW DO YOU FROM THE AIR TRY TO

06:32.726 --> 06:35.161
CLEAR SOME OF THOSE CITIES WHEN

06:35.161 --> 06:36.630
THESE GUYS CAN GO RIGHT BACK

06:36.630 --> 06:38.198
INTO THE CIVILIAN POPULATION?

06:38.198 --> 06:39.432
>> IT’S VERY CHALLENGING.

06:39.432 --> 06:40.967
EVEN WITH THE UNITED STATES

06:40.967 --> 06:43.103
HAVING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

06:43.103 --> 06:45.171
TROOPS IN IRAQ AND AT THE

06:45.171 --> 06:46.773
HEIGHT OF THE SURGE, WE WEREN’T

06:46.773 --> 06:48.008
ABLE TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE AL

06:48.008 --> 06:49.276
QAEDA IN IRAQ, WHICH WAS SORT OF

06:49.276 --> 06:50.710
THE PREDECESSOR OF THE ISLAMIC

06:50.710 --> 06:52.279
STATE, AND THEY HUNG ON AND HAD

06:52.279 --> 06:54.080
A PRESENCE IN MOSUL, SORT OF

06:54.080 --> 06:55.982
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TIME THE

06:55.982 --> 06:57.150
U.S. WAS THERE, EVEN IF IT WAS A

06:57.150 --> 06:58.585
MUCH LOWER LEVEL PRESENCE.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.186
IT’S VERY CHALLENGING TO CLEAR

07:00.186 --> 07:01.755
THAT KIND OF PRESENCE OUT.

07:01.755 --> 07:02.222
>> Sreenivasan: ONE OF THE

07:02.222 --> 07:03.990
LONGER TERM CONCERNS IS THE

07:03.990 --> 07:05.458
TRAINING WE WOULD PROVIDE OR

07:05.458 --> 07:06.826
ESPECIALLY THE EQUIPMENT WE

07:06.826 --> 07:08.161
WOULD PROVIDE IN THIS FIGHT.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.163
SOMETIMES THE EQUIPMENT IS USED

07:10.163 --> 07:10.997
AGAINST US.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.266
THERE’S A BACKLASH WHEN IT FALLS

07:13.266 --> 07:14.167
INTO THE WRONG HANDS.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.502
HOW DO WE PROTECT AGAINST THAT?

07:15.502 --> 07:17.737
>> IT’S EXTREMELY CHALLENGING.

07:17.737 --> 07:18.772
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TRAINING UP

07:18.772 --> 07:20.674
THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.108
WE HAD A BIG ENDEAVOR TO DO THAT

07:22.108 --> 07:23.843
FOR YEARS IN IRAQ, AND, YET,

07:23.843 --> 07:25.211
YOU SAW THE COLLAPSE IN MOSUL

07:25.211 --> 07:26.179
AND THE SEIZURE OF A LOT OF

07:26.179 --> 07:27.147
EQUIPMENT.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.782
THE KEY IS TO BUILD UP THE

07:28.782 --> 07:30.884
CAPABILITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION

07:30.884 --> 07:31.818
BEFORE YOU JUST DUMP A LOT OF

07:31.818 --> 07:33.053
WEAPONS ON IT, AND THAT’S ALSO,

07:33.053 --> 07:34.387
I THINK, A RISK ACROSS THE

07:34.387 --> 07:35.722
BORDER IN SYRIA, WITH TRYING TO

07:35.722 --> 07:37.590
ARM SYRIAN REBELS IS YOU HAVE

07:37.590 --> 07:39.025
THE POSSIBILITY THAT WITHOUT

07:39.025 --> 07:40.694
BUILDING UP THE ORGANIZATION,

07:40.694 --> 07:41.795
DUMP WEAPONS ON THEM, THE

07:41.795 --> 07:43.430
ISLAMIC STATE CAN THEN JUST TAKE

07:43.430 --> 07:44.431
THEM FROM THEM.

07:44.431 --> 07:44.864
>> Sreenivasan: SPEAKING OF

07:44.864 --> 07:45.932
SYRIA, WHEN YOU GO ACROSS THAT

07:45.932 --> 07:47.934
BORDER, WHO IS LEFT TO BE THE

07:47.934 --> 07:49.035
ALLY THERE?

07:49.035 --> 07:50.003
IT SEEMS THEY’VE BEEN, ON THE

07:50.003 --> 07:51.271
ONE HARD, DEGRADED BY AL-

07:51.271 --> 07:53.540
BASHAR’S FORCES AND ON THE OTHER

07:53.540 --> 07:55.508
HAND DEGRADED BY ISIL.

07:55.508 --> 07:59.212
>> THERE’S A FRAGMENTED

07:59.212 --> 08:01.147
SELECTION OF MILITIAS THERE THAT

08:01.147 --> 08:02.282
WILL HAVE TO BE REBUILT INTO

08:02.282 --> 08:03.183
SOMETHING THAT RESEMBLES AN

08:03.183 --> 08:03.683
ARMY.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.185
WHATEVER THE CHALLENGES IN IRAQ

08:05.185 --> 08:07.687
ARE, IN TERMS OF PROVIDING

08:07.687 --> 08:08.988
SUPPORT TO POTENTIAL LOCAL

08:08.988 --> 08:10.256
GROUND FORCES, I THINK THE

08:10.256 --> 08:11.391
CHALLENGE IS MUCH GREATER IN

08:11.391 --> 08:11.925
SYRIA.

08:11.925 --> 08:12.492
>> Sreenivasan: LET’S TALK ABOUT

08:12.492 --> 08:13.159
TIMELINES HERE.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.694
THE PRESIDENT SAID LET’S BRACE

08:14.694 --> 08:15.829
OURSELVES FOR A LONG-TERM

08:15.829 --> 08:16.696
ENGAGEMENT.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.164
HOW LONG IS THIS GOING TO TAKE?

08:18.164 --> 08:19.099
>> IT’S GOING TO TAKE A VERY

08:19.099 --> 08:19.999
LONG TIME.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.102
I THINK YEARS WOULD BE PRETTY

08:22.102 --> 08:22.702
GENEROUS.

08:22.702 --> 08:25.372
NOW, YEARS WOULD BE TO

08:25.372 --> 08:26.439
COMPLETELY DEFEAT THE GROUP.

08:26.439 --> 08:27.407
I THINK YOU CAN MAKE REAL

08:27.407 --> 08:28.608
PROGRESS IN TAKING SOME OF THESE

08:28.608 --> 08:30.076
KEY CITIES BACK ON A SHORTER

08:30.076 --> 08:31.511
TIMELINE BUT IT’S STILL NOT

08:31.511 --> 08:32.679
GOING TO BE DAYS OR WEEKS.

08:32.679 --> 08:33.847
IT’S PROBABLY GOING TO BE MONTHS

08:33.847 --> 08:35.148
TO YEARS.

08:35.148 --> 08:35.548
>> Sreenivasan: AND THAT’S IN

08:35.548 --> 08:37.150
BOTH IRAQ AND SYRIA?

08:37.150 --> 08:38.151
>> I THINK SYRIA IS PROBABLY

08:38.151 --> 08:39.185
EVEN MORE CHALLENGING.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.720
I MEAN THE ISLAMIC STATE IS MUCH

08:40.720 --> 08:42.655
STRONGER THAN MOST OF THE REBEL

08:42.655 --> 08:44.457
GROUPS THERE; REBUILDING THEM

08:44.457 --> 08:45.692
INTO SOMETHING LIKE A

08:45.692 --> 08:46.726
FUNCTIONING ARMY I THINK WILL

08:46.726 --> 08:49.195
TAKE A VERY LONG TIME.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.064
YOU CAN LAUNCH STRIKES IN SYRIA

08:51.064 --> 08:52.532
WITHOUT REBUILDING THOSE FORCES,

08:52.532 --> 08:53.566
BUT THEN YOU’RE, AT LEAST

08:53.566 --> 08:54.634
INDIRECTLY, GOING TO BENEFIT

08:54.634 --> 08:56.736
PRESIDENT ASSAD’S REGIME.

08:56.736 --> 08:57.504
>> Sreenivasan: AUSTIN LONG FROM

08:57.504 --> 08:58.671
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY’S SCHOOL OF

08:58.671 --> 08:59.773
INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS,

08:59.773 --> 09:00.340
THANKS SO MUCH.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.508
>> THANK YOU VERY HAVING ME.

09:12.185 --> 09:12.819

09:12.819 --> 09:13.853
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

09:13.853 --> 09:15.588
TONIGHT, PART TWO OF A SERIES BY

09:15.588 --> 09:16.956

09:19.726 --> 09:21.694
SEPTEMBER OF AMERICA’S LARGEST

09:21.694 --> 09:24.063
PORK PRODUCER, SMITHFIELD FOODS.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.532
LAST NIGHT’S REPORT EXAMINED THE

09:25.532 --> 09:27.133
CHINESE GOVERNMENT’S ROLE IN THE

09:27.133 --> 09:30.036
$4.7 BILLION ACQUISITION.

09:30.036 --> 09:31.905
TONIGHT, A LOOK AT HOW THE DEAL

09:31.905 --> 09:32.906
FITS INTO THE CHINESE

09:32.906 --> 09:34.774
GOVERNMENT’S PLANS TO FEED ITS

09:34.774 --> 09:36.876
1.4 BILLION PEOPLE.

09:36.876 --> 09:38.344
THE STORY, BY NATHAN HALVERSON,

FEW ACRES OF LAND ABOUT 300

09:46.252 --> 09:48.488
MILES SOUTH OF BEIJING.

09:48.488 --> 09:49.756
FARMERS LIKE LI PRODUCE THE BULK

09:49.756 --> 09:52.859
OF CHINA’S FOOD.

09:52.859 --> 09:53.259
>> (translated): IT HAS BEEN

09:53.259 --> 09:54.594
THE SAME WAY-- WHEAT IN THE

09:54.594 --> 09:56.563
SPRING AND CORN IN THE FALL.

09:56.563 --> 09:57.430
ALWAYS THIS WAY.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.032
IT HAS NEVER CHANGED.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.600
(LAUGHS)

10:00.600 --> 10:01.100
>> Reporter: BUT CHANGE IS

10:01.100 --> 10:01.901
COMING.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.203
FARMERS LIKE LI CAN NO LONGER

10:03.203 --> 10:05.038
PRODUCE ENOUGH FOOD TO SATISFY

10:05.038 --> 10:06.873
CHINA’S GROWING DEMAND.

10:06.873 --> 10:08.308
THE COUNTRY IS IN THE MIDST OF

10:08.308 --> 10:10.243
THE LARGEST AGRARIAN REFORMS IN

10:10.243 --> 10:11.845
WORLD HISTORY.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.246
>> CHINA IS ROUGHLY THE SAME

10:13.246 --> 10:15.482
SIZE AS THE UNITED STATES.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.984
THE CROPLAND AREA IS SIMILAR.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.853
THE GRAIN HARVEST IS SIMILAR.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.188
THE DIFFERENCE IS, IN THE U.S.,

10:22.188 --> 10:23.890
WE HAVE 300 MILLION PEOPLE, AND

10:23.890 --> 10:25.425
THERE THEY HAVE 1.4 BILLION

10:25.425 --> 10:26.559
PEOPLE.

10:26.559 --> 10:27.760

10:30.830 --> 10:31.998
HE SAYS CHINA MUST NOW MAKE THE

10:31.998 --> 10:34.334
MOST OF ITS LIMITED FARMLAND.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.835
>> AND THEY’RE FEELING VERY

10:35.835 --> 10:36.870
VULNERABLE AT THIS POINT.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.405
THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN’T FEED

10:39.405 --> 10:41.140
THEMSELVES ANYMORE.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.008
>> Reporter: THAT FEAR HAS

10:42.008 --> 10:44.444
RATTLED THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.

IN 2011, IT ANNOUNCED A FIVE-

10:46.646 --> 10:48.681
YEAR PLAN TO RADICALLY OVERHAUL

10:48.681 --> 10:50.216
CHINA’S FARM SYSTEM AND RELOCATE

10:50.216 --> 10:55.088
250 MILLION FARMERS TO CITIES.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.122
>> KEEP IN MIND THAT MOST OF THE

10:56.122 --> 10:57.590
LEADERS IN BEIJING TODAY

10:57.590 --> 10:59.759
CAN REMEMBER THE GREAT FAMINE OF

10:59.759 --> 11:04.163
1959-61 WHEN 37 MILLION PEOPLE

11:04.163 --> 11:05.498

11:07.300 --> 11:09.769
ABOUT STARVATION, BUT SATISFYING

11:09.769 --> 11:11.170
AN AFFLUENT AND GROWING MIDDLE

CLASS THAT WANTS TO EAT LIKE

11:43.903 --> 11:45.138
CONSUMERS WANT TO EAT,

11:45.138 --> 11:47.140
INCREASINGLY, IS MEAT.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.741
AND MEAT IS SO RESOURCE-

11:48.741 --> 11:50.209
INTENSIVE, IT PUTS EVEN MORE

11:50.209 --> 11:51.744
PRESSURE ON CHINA’S STRAINED

12:04.557 --> 12:05.625
ACQUISITION OF AN AMERICAN

12:05.625 --> 12:07.694

18:46.359 --> 18:47.259
AND WHAT IT SPEAKS TO IS THERE

18:47.259 --> 18:48.527
ARE REALLY TWO FORCES AT PLAY

18:48.527 --> 18:48.794
HERE.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.162
ONE IS THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS OF

18:50.162 --> 18:51.664
ALL THE CHILDREN CROSSING, AND

18:51.664 --> 18:52.798
THEY’RE STARTING TO SEE SOME

18:52.798 --> 18:54.567
IMPROVEMENT, SOME REDUCTION IN

18:54.567 --> 18:55.601
THE NUMBERS THERE.

18:55.601 --> 18:57.069
BUT THERE’S THE BROADER ISSUE OF

18:57.069 --> 18:58.738
WHAT PRETTY MUCH BOTH SIDES

19:00.206 --> 19:01.374
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IN THIS

COUNTRY, AND THE BORDER IS PART

19:02.975 --> 19:03.909
OF THAT.

19:03.909 --> 19:04.910

19:04.910 --> 19:06.412
FORCES, BUT THE LONG-TERM

19:06.412 --> 19:08.014
STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE

IMMEDIATE PROBLEM OF SO MANY

19:11.984 --> 19:13.386
CHILDREN CROSSING THE BORDER,

19:13.386 --> 19:15.287

19:15.287 --> 19:16.622
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

19:16.622 --> 19:17.823
TO CONSIDER SOME PRETTY

19:17.823 --> 19:18.958
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN HOW

19:24.764 --> 19:26.832

OPERATIONALLY FOR A LOT OF LAW

19:37.376 --> 19:39.945

ESSENTIALLY HAVE A MORE

19:42.114 --> 19:43.849
STREAMLINED CHAIN OF COMMAND,

19:43.849 --> 19:45.718
AND YOU HAVE MORE COORDINATION

19:45.718 --> 19:46.752

19:46.752 --> 19:48.320
PEOPLE WHO BOTH HAVE A BIG PART

19:55.394 --> 19:56.729
YOU HAVE TWO CHAINS OF COMMAND

19:56.729 --> 19:58.564
AND ESSENTIALLY CODIFY THE TURF

19:58.564 --> 19:59.899

19:59.899 --> 20:01.067
>> RIGHT, WELL, THAT IS THE

20:01.067 --> 20:02.968
CONCERN.

20:02.968 --> 20:03.936
ONE OF THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY

20:03.936 --> 20:05.237
SOME OF THE FOLKS I TALKED TO

20:05.237 --> 20:07.173
IS, IF YOU CREATE THIS MILITARY-

20:07.173 --> 20:08.741
STYLE CHAIN OF COMMAND, YOU

20:08.741 --> 20:10.242
COULD END UP WITH ACTUALLY TWO

20:10.242 --> 20:12.678
REPORTING CHAINS, TWO SETS OF

20:12.678 --> 20:14.213
BOSSES, ESSENTIALLY, AND HOW

20:14.213 --> 20:15.314
WILL THAT WORK?

20:15.314 --> 20:16.515
NOW THE PEOPLE WHO THINK THIS IS

20:16.515 --> 20:17.683
A GOOD IDEA SAY THAT, LOOK THE

20:17.683 --> 20:19.118
MILITARY HAS SHOWN YOU CAN DO

20:19.118 --> 20:20.986
THAT AND DO IT EFFECTIVELY AND

20:20.986 --> 20:21.887
EFFICIENTLY.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.389
THERE IS, OBVIOUSLY, SOME

20:23.389 --> 20:25.124
SKEPTICISM IN SOME QUARTERS.

20:25.124 --> 20:27.693
THE ONE THING THAT PEOPLE DO SAY

20:27.693 --> 20:30.596
IS THEY HAVE A MANPOWER--

20:30.596 --> 20:31.430
THERE’S A CONSTANT MANPOWER

20:31.430 --> 20:32.798
CHALLENGE ON THE BORDER.

20:32.798 --> 20:34.900
AND THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS THEY

20:34.900 --> 20:35.901
ARE CONSIDERING ONE OF THE

20:35.901 --> 20:36.836
THINGS THEY HAVE ON THE DRAWING

20:36.836 --> 20:38.437
BOARD AS THEY TRY TO COME UP

20:38.437 --> 20:39.805
WITH WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT

20:39.805 --> 20:40.873
MANPOWER ISSUE.

20:40.873 --> 20:41.107
>> Sreenivasan: ARE THERE

20:41.107 --> 20:43.008
SIGNIFICANT INEFFICIENCIES NOW

20:43.008 --> 20:43.776
WHERE THE AGENCIES AREN’T

20:43.776 --> 20:45.144
WORKING TOGETHER AS BEST THEY

20:45.144 --> 20:46.312
COULD?

20:46.312 --> 20:47.379

20:47.379 --> 20:49.215
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THAT.

20:49.215 --> 20:50.950
WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT IS THE

20:50.950 --> 20:53.252
NOTION OF POLICING THE BORDER

20:53.252 --> 20:54.520
AND GOING AFTER SORT OF THE

20:54.520 --> 20:56.589
LARGE SMUGGLING ORGANIZATIONS,

20:56.589 --> 20:57.990
BOTH HUMAN SMUGGLING AND DRUG

20:57.990 --> 20:58.858
SMUGGLING.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.360
SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IF YOU

21:01.360 --> 21:03.462
ACTUALLY GOT THESE GUYS DOING

21:03.462 --> 21:06.699
MORE JOINT OPERATIONS TOGETHER,

21:06.699 --> 21:08.634
LIKE THE MILITARY OFTEN DOES IN

21:08.634 --> 21:10.102
ITS SOUTHERN COMMAND STRUCTURE,

21:10.102 --> 21:11.937
THAT YOU WILL ACTUALLY DO BIGGER

21:11.937 --> 21:14.006
CASES, GET BETTER RESULTS.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.008
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE SKEPTICS WHO

21:16.008 --> 21:17.910
SAY WE ARE ALREADY DOING THIS

21:17.910 --> 21:20.012
WORK; YOU KNOW, MOVING THE

21:20.012 --> 21:22.114
CHAIRS AROUND, CREATING A NEW

21:22.114 --> 21:24.717
TITLE DOESN’T NECESSARILY FIX,

21:24.717 --> 21:25.918
YOU KNOW, THE CHALLENGES WE

21:25.918 --> 21:26.852
HAVE.

21:26.852 --> 21:27.286
>> Sreenivasan: THIS IS ON THE

21:27.286 --> 21:28.888
DRAWING BOARD PHASE NOW.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.723
HOW LONG BEFORE SOMETHING LIKE

21:30.723 --> 21:32.024
THIS COULD GET IMPLEMENTED,

21:32.024 --> 21:33.325
PROPOSED TO CONGRESS, WORK ITS

21:33.325 --> 21:34.894
WAY THROUGH?

21:34.894 --> 21:35.294
>> YOU KNOW, IT’S A TRICKY

21:35.294 --> 21:35.761
THING.

21:35.761 --> 21:38.130
THEY’RE TALKING TO CONGRESS IN

21:38.130 --> 21:39.298
LITTLE BITS AND PIECES ABOUT

21:39.298 --> 21:40.533
THIS.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.501
IT SOUNDS AS IF NO ONE’S REALLY

21:42.501 --> 21:44.136
GOING TO TRY AND PUT ANYTHING

21:44.136 --> 21:45.604
FORWARD BEFORE THE ELECTION.

21:45.604 --> 21:46.338
I THINK THAT’S PROBABLY JUST TOO

21:46.338 --> 21:47.239
DIFFICULT.

21:47.239 --> 21:48.374
AND I THINK, FRANKLY, PEOPLE

21:48.374 --> 21:50.242
WANT TO SEE WHAT THE ELECTION

21:50.242 --> 21:52.011
RESULTS ARE, AND IF THAT POINTS

21:52.011 --> 21:53.279
A WAY TOWARDS SOME SORT OF

21:53.279 --> 21:56.248
AGREEMENT AS TO SOME THINGS YOU

21:56.248 --> 21:57.883
COULD DO ON BORDER SECURITY.

21:57.883 --> 21:59.518
POLITICALLY, THE REPUBLICANS

21:59.518 --> 22:00.753
HAVE BEEN ARGUING FOR A WHILE

22:00.753 --> 22:01.787
YOU SHOULDN’T DO ANY MAJOR

22:01.787 --> 22:03.923
IMMIGRATION REFORM WITHOUT DOING

22:03.923 --> 22:05.391
BORDER SECURITY FIRST.

22:05.391 --> 22:06.759
THIS COULD BECOME A PIECE OF

22:06.759 --> 22:09.094
THAT DISCUSSION, BUT I WOULD BE

22:09.094 --> 22:10.930
SURPRISED IF THAT DISCUSSION

22:10.930 --> 22:12.231
HAPPENS BEFORE THE ELECTION.

22:12.231 --> 22:12.765
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

22:27.479 --> 22:29.081
ONE OF NORTH AMERICA’S LARGEST

22:29.081 --> 22:30.916
WORKS BY PABLO PICASSO?

22:30.916 --> 22:32.017
THE ANSWER, OF COURSE, IS VERY

22:32.017 --> 22:32.885
CAREFULLY.

22:32.885 --> 22:33.953
LAST WEEKEND, HERE IN NEW YORK

22:33.953 --> 22:35.120
CITY, THE NEWSHOUR’S STEPHEN FEE

22:35.120 --> 22:36.522
WATCHED AS A CREW WORKED

22:36.522 --> 22:38.257
OVERNIGHT TO REMOVE AND THEN

22:38.257 --> 22:40.326
MOVE A DELICATE STAGE CURTAIN

22:40.326 --> 22:41.794
PAINTED BY THE SPANISH ARTIST IN

WALL OF THE FOUR SEASONS

23:10.022 --> 23:13.092
RESTAURANT.

23:13.092 --> 23:13.592
>> I WAS REALLY CONCERNED THAT

23:13.592 --> 23:15.894
BY THE TIME IT GOT TO THE TOP IT

23:15.894 --> 23:17.263
MIGHT TEAR.

23:17.263 --> 23:18.797
AND I’VE HAD MANY SLEEPLESS

23:18.797 --> 23:21.066
NIGHTS THINKING OF THIS CURTAIN.

23:21.066 --> 23:21.433

CURTAIN FROM BOTTOM TO TOP,

23:24.370 --> 23:26.672
USING A 23-FOOT-LONG TUBE, THEN

23:26.672 --> 23:28.741
LOWERED IT TO A STEEL RIG,

23:28.741 --> 23:30.476
AFFORDING UPSIDE DOWN VIEWS OF

23:30.476 --> 23:32.344
TWO BULL FIGHT FANS.

23:32.344 --> 23:33.679
LAST FALL, THE BUILDING OWNERS

23:33.679 --> 23:35.581
DECIDED TO MOVE THE CANVAS

23:35.581 --> 23:36.949
CURTAIN, SAYING THEY NEEDED TO

23:36.949 --> 23:38.851
REPAIR THE WALL BEHIND IT.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.185
BUT THE CURTAIN BELONGS TO THE

23:40.185 --> 23:42.421
NEW YORK LANDMARKS CONSERVANCY.

THE BUILDING’S FORMER OWNER, AND

23:45.691 --> 23:47.826
