JUDY WOODRUFF: This week,
we're going to take a look at a
special series about living with

00:03.966 --> 00:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disabilities from our
network of Student Reporting
Labs around the country.

00:07.900 --> 00:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The series, called Limitless,
includes more than 30 stories
written, filmed and edited

00:14.233 --> 00:17.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
entirely by middle and
high school students.

00:17.233 --> 00:20.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tonight, we learn about
Ryan Hudson-Peralta.

00:20.466 --> 00:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a Web designer in
Detroit who was born with
congenital limb deficiency.

00:24.200 --> 00:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The video was produced by his
son, Noah, and the Student
Reporting Lab at Frederick V.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pankow Center High School
in Clinton, Michigan.

00:33.133 --> 00:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICK PERALTA, Father of
Ryan: We kind of figured
he was here for a purpose.

00:37.266 --> 00:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIMBERLY PERALTA, Mother of
Ryan: Everyone in the world
is going to know his name.

00:39.366 --> 00:41.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DARRYL BLANDING, Friend
of Ryan: He is different
than anybody else.

00:41.566 --> 00:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN GILBERT, CEO, Quicken
Loans: There's no better
word than inspirational.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So he inspires everyone.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He inspires me.

00:46.300 --> 00:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Ryan has taught me how to
not worry about the past, don't
focus on the future, but enjoy

00:51.333 --> 00:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
every moment of the present.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RYAN HUDSON-PERALTA,
Web Designer: My name
is Ryan Hudson-Peralta.

00:55.500 --> 01:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was born with a
disability called congenital
limb deficiency, which
basically is the shortening

01:00.233 --> 01:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the arms and the legs.

01:01.933 --> 01:05.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, in my case, I was
born without hands.

01:05.900 --> 01:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was born, the doctors
told my parents that I would
never drive a car or go to a

01:11.500 --> 01:12.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
regular school.

01:12.733 --> 01:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They said I would
never have a family.

01:14.533 --> 01:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, yes, everyone pretty much
doubted me when I was a kid.

01:18.733 --> 01:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIMBERLY PERALTA: Well,
after Ryan was born, the
doctors wouldn't show me him.

01:23.366 --> 01:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, all of a sudden, they
covered up the mirror and told
my husband, hey, Mr. Peralta,

01:28.333 --> 01:29.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
leave the room.

01:29.433 --> 01:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I didn't understand why.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I said, where's my baby?

01:32.400 --> 01:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I want to see my baby.

01:34.633 --> 01:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I kind of went into shock.

01:36.666 --> 01:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they told me something
was wrong with his arm, and
then something was wrong with

01:41.300 --> 01:43.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
his leg.

01:43.300 --> 01:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICK PERALTA: They
said, well, we will let you
see him in a little bit.

01:45.566 --> 01:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just looked at his face
and said, he's a fighter.

01:48.666 --> 01:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN GILBERT: Actually, I think
I saw Ryan Hudson-Peralta
before I heard about him, so

01:54.566 --> 01:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
- - and I asked somebody.

01:55.833 --> 01:56.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I said, wait, is
he working for us?

01:56.533 --> 01:58.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's he doing?

01:58.033 --> 02:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think somebody said,
well, he's a designer.

02:00.133 --> 02:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first thing you ask
yourself is, how does a man who
doesn't have limbs design stuff

02:05.000 --> 02:06.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on a computer?

02:06.966 --> 02:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's just really the
first question, because then
you see everything else he does.

02:10.266 --> 02:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you keep asking, how does
he do that, how does he do
that, how does he do that?

02:12.966 --> 02:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sooner or later, you stop asking
the question, because he just
figures out a way to do it.

02:17.566 --> 02:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it was truly remarkable
to me and very shocking and
also inspirational at the same

02:23.366 --> 02:24.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

02:24.900 --> 02:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DARRYL BLANDING: Never heard
him complain about nothing.

02:26.966 --> 02:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he has to work twice as
hard to do daily tasks, like
to send a text message or just

02:30.966 --> 02:32.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
anything.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he never complains
about that at all, nothing.

02:34.833 --> 02:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN HUDSON-PERALTA: As a
kid, I started to draw with
my pencil between my feet.

02:41.833 --> 02:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then I really realized one
day that it was going to be
pretty tough when I go into

02:44.733 --> 02:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a bank and have to hop up
on the counter to sign the
-- sign the deposit slip.

02:49.566 --> 02:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I moved the pencil from my
feet to my chin and shoulder
and I started to draw that

02:55.066 --> 02:57.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

02:57.166 --> 03:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2013, I started working for
Quicken Loans and their family
of companies as a Web and

03:00.400 --> 03:02.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Internet user
interface designer.

03:02.500 --> 03:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And about nine months after
working there, I got an e-mail
from Dan Gilbert's team asking

03:06.000 --> 03:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me to speak at these events he
has every -- about every month.

03:10.100 --> 03:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN GILBERT: We wanted Ryan
to talk about a philosophy
and how that plays out through

03:13.200 --> 03:15.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
him and his story.

03:15.700 --> 03:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he does a great
job, because, again, for
everyone in the audience,
it's probably their

03:18.333 --> 03:20.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
first time seeing Ryan.

03:20.333 --> 03:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's just so -- such a
unique individual that every
time people see him and see he's

03:27.833 --> 03:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just a regular, normal
guy who just gets it done,
just, you know, different
kind of challenges,

03:30.800 --> 03:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that inspires
everybody in a big, big way.

03:34.100 --> 03:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is a testament, a living
testament to that, with the way
that he interacts with people,

03:41.033 --> 03:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the way that he approaches
work, the way that he
builds community around him.

03:43.300 --> 03:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He understands the power
of relationship and he also
understands the power of people.

03:47.500 --> 03:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN HUDSON-PERALTA: Bad
things are going to happen to
you every day in your life.

03:51.633 --> 03:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And no matter what, if
you stay positive, you're
going to get through them.

03:54.766 --> 03:58.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, I could look
at every day in my life
as something negative.

03:58.866 --> 04:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Being born without hands is
not the greatest thing that
could happen to somebody.

04:02.233 --> 04:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I have a choice
every day that I wake up.

04:04.700 --> 04:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can either look at myself as
a poor guy with a disability
or somebody that can go

04:10.433 --> 04:11.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out and inspire people.

04:11.933 --> 04:16.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what
an inspiration Ryan is.

04:16.166 --> 04:18.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Remarkable.

04:18.633 --> 04:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
