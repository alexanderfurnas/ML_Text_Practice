JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.472 --> 00:07.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
President Obama says world
leaders are rattled

00:10.644 --> 00:15.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the newly named Republican
nominee -- a
look at the international
response to Donald

00:15.782 --> 00:17.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump's success.

00:17.784 --> 00:21.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Thursday:
rebuilding Ecuador -- a month
after a devastating

00:21.355 --> 00:26.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earthquake flattened buildings
and left thousands
homeless, how the country is
recovering.

00:26.193 --> 00:36.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we get a
backstage pass
to one of the nation's top music
venues, the

00:36.904 --> 00:40.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
9:30 Club, the spot for a new
music variety
show.

00:40.440 --> 00:45.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH HURWITZ, Co-Owner, 9:30
Club: We really
are curating this for everyone.
I have this

00:45.479 --> 00:50.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fantasy vision of three
generations sitting
around at the couch because
"Live at 9:30"

00:51.018 --> 00:52.352 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is coming on.

00:52.452 --> 00:54.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:54.721 --> 00:59.059 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:59.159 --> 01:11.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump has
now cemented
his status as the Republican
presidential

01:12.039 --> 01:17.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
standard=bearer in the fall. He
clinched the
delegates needed for the
nomination today,

01:17.210 --> 01:21.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even as he took fire from the
man who holds
the job now.

01:21.548 --> 01:23.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
The folks behind me got us right
over the

01:26.053 --> 01:27.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
top, from North Dakota.

01:28.021 --> 01:33.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Literally backed by
his North Dakota
delegates, Donald Trump
celebrated his status

01:33.994 --> 01:37.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the now certain nominee at a
news conference
in Bismarck.

01:37.864 --> 01:45.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Associated Press reports
that one of those
delegates gave him the 1,237
vote he needs

01:45.806 --> 01:52.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to win on the first ballot at
the Republican
Convention. It came on the same
day that President

01:52.412 --> 01:57.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Obama used his own news
conference at the
G7 Summit in Japan to say that
world leaders

01:57.517 --> 01:59.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are worried about a Trump
presidency.

01:59.419 --> 02:04.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
They're rattled by him, and for
good reason,

02:04.224 --> 02:12.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because a lot of the proposals
that he has
made display either ignorance of
world affairs

02:12.632 --> 02:20.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or a cavalier attitude or an
interest in getting
tweets and headlines.

02:20.107 --> 02:23.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump dismissed the
president's
criticism.

02:23.176 --> 02:27.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Many of our -- the
countries
in our world, our beautiful
world, have been

02:27.347 --> 02:32.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
absolutely abusing us and taking
advantage
of us. So, if they're rattled in
a friendly

02:32.919 --> 02:35.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way, we are going to have great
relationships
with these countries.

02:35.255 --> 02:39.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if they're rattled in a
friendly way,
that's a good thing, John, not a
bad thing.

02:39.693 --> 02:44.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Even as he clinched
the nomination,
Trump faces more turmoil within
his campaign

02:44.798 --> 02:50.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
staff. His national political
director, Rick
Wiley is out, just six weeks
after he was

02:50.837 --> 02:53.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
brought on to help
professionalize the Trump
effort.

02:53.540 --> 02:59.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement last night, the
campaign insisted
that Wiley was always a
short-term hire.

02:59.579 --> 03:05.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump seemed delighted by the
fact that his
nomination, once thought
improbable, was decided

03:05.318 --> 03:06.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before the Democrats.

03:07.087 --> 03:10.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And here I am
watching Hillary
fight, and she can't close the
deal.

03:10.924 --> 03:16.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In fact, Hillary
Clinton is within
78 delegates of locking up her
party's nomination,

03:16.496 --> 03:22.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but a new poll shows her in a
virtual tie
with Bernie Sanders in the
California primary

03:22.369 --> 03:24.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
less than two weeks away.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Clinton reacted to Trump
going over
the top.

03:27.340 --> 03:31.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
That means an unqualified loose
canon is within

03:31.878 --> 03:34.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reach of the most powerful job
in the world.

03:34.347 --> 03:38.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Clinton also
dismissed a State
Department watchdog report that
found she

03:38.518 --> 03:44.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
violated policy by using a
private e-mail
server as secretary of state.
She told a Univision

03:45.025 --> 03:49.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
affiliate last night, "I will
continue to
be open, and it's not an issue
that's going

03:49.930 --> 03:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to affect either the campaign or
my presidency."

03:52.966 --> 03:54.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIMMY KIMMEL, Host, "Jimmy
Kimmel Live": Here's
the question from Bernie.

03:54.968 --> 03:59.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Sanders, meanwhile,
used late-night
talk show host Jimmy Kimmel to
challenge Trump

03:59.439 --> 04:03.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a debate. Trump says he'd do
it for a price.

04:03.877 --> 04:08.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, I would love
to debate Bernie.
He's a dream. Well, I said --
and I said last

04:08.648 --> 04:13.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night on Jimmy's show -- the
question that
was posed, I said I would love
to debate him,

04:14.087 --> 04:17.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but I want a lot of money to be
put up for
charity. So, what we will do is,
if we can

04:17.124 --> 04:20.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
raise for by women's health
issues or something.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: If you raise $10
million, you will
get on a debate stage with
Bernie Sanders?

04:23.897 --> 04:24.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I would love to,
yes.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, Sanders says
he can't wait.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
And I'm very excited about it,
and I think

04:30.137 --> 04:35.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're going to st going to rent
out the largest
stadium you have here in
California.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:36.576 --> 04:40.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Sanders had asked
Clinton to debate,
but she declined.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

04:42.849 --> 04:47.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will focus on
how foreign
leaders are reacting to the rise
of Donald

04:47.854 --> 04:49.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump after the news summary.

04:49.756 --> 04:53.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
A fight over LGBT rights sank a
major energy

04:53.593 --> 04:57.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spending bill in the U.S. House.
Last night,
Democrats attached an amendment
that bars

04:57.898 --> 05:02.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
discrimination by federal
contractors. Today,
Republican conservatives
overwhelmingly voted

05:02.802 --> 05:04.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against the overall bill.

05:04.838 --> 05:09.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most Democrats did as well, over
a separate
provision that defends North
Carolina's law

05:09.943 --> 05:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
against transgender bathrooms.

05:11.878 --> 05:16.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congress came
under new pressure
today to approve funding for
fighting Zika.

05:16.550 --> 05:21.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The head of the Centers for
Disease Control
and Prevention spoke in
Washington, as lawmakers

05:21.121 --> 05:23.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
began a two-week Memorial Day
recess.

05:24.057 --> 05:30.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Tom Frieden urged action to
protect pregnant
women from infections that can
cause birth

05:30.530 --> 05:32.265 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
defects.

05:32.365 --> 05:34.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN, Director,
Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention:
We have a

05:34.367 --> 05:40.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
narrow window of opportunity to
scale up effective
Zika prevention measures, and
that window

05:40.140 --> 05:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of opportunity is closing.
Congress did the
right thing with Ebola. And I
hope in the

05:45.946 --> 05:47.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
end they will do the right thing
with Zika.

05:47.847 --> 05:53.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
is asking for
$1.9 billion to fight Zika. The
Senate has

05:53.553 --> 05:57.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
approved $1.1 billion. The House
voted for
$622 million.

05:57.824 --> 06:02.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: More than
4,000 migrants
were rescued in the
Mediterranean Sea today,

06:02.696 --> 06:07.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as calmer weather brought more
sailings and
sinkings. They were trying to
reach Italy

06:07.767 --> 06:11.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Libya just one day after
hundreds died
trying to make the journey.

06:12.072 --> 06:15.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Matt Frei of Independent
Television News narrates
our report.

06:15.141 --> 06:21.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT FREI: What actually happens
when a migrant
boat sinks in the Med? This is
what happens,

06:21.314 --> 06:27.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
filmed yesterday in searing
silence by the
CCTV camera of an Italian navy
ship.

06:27.687 --> 06:34.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The naval ship has sent a small
advance boat.
It takes away a handful of those
on board.

06:34.494 --> 06:38.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ten minutes later, with the
prospect of a
rescue for everyone, the
passengers on deck

06:39.099 --> 06:44.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have started to move, first to
one side, then
to the other.

06:44.771 --> 06:51.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is their fatal mistake.
This is what
happens far too often. Within
seconds, the

06:52.012 --> 07:02.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fishing boat carrying at least
570 people
lists and now turns over. What
should be a

07:02.622 --> 07:10.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rescue is turning into mayhem
and tragedy.
At least seven people have
drowned, but no

07:10.964 --> 07:16.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one can be sure how many more
are trapped
in the hull or, indeed, how many
of them can

07:16.970 --> 07:18.805 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
swim.

07:18.905 --> 07:26.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was yesterday. This was
today, another
sinking off the coast of Libya.
Here, at least

07:26.246 --> 07:32.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
20 drowned. Every week,
sometimes every day,
another boat without a name
sinks in the Med.

07:32.919 --> 07:38.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people who survived this
disaster looked
as if they were many Arab, not
African. They

07:38.358 --> 07:43.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
arrived in Sicily this
afternoon, and if it
turns out that they were from
Syria, they

07:43.430 --> 07:48.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be classified as refugees
and they will
probably be allowed to stay in
Europe, but

07:48.768 --> 07:56.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Europe that is less and less
willing to
take them in, despite their many
ordeals.

07:56.476 --> 08:01.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since Monday, 6,000 lives have
been saved,
but we have no idea whether the
number of

08:01.948 --> 08:06.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coffins represents the true
number of those
who have died.

08:06.386 --> 08:10.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The waters
between Libya
and Italy have become the focus
of migrant

08:10.757 --> 08:14.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attempts, now that the route
from Turkey to
Greece is largely closed.

08:14.561 --> 08:19.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Violence
escalated in France
today as labor protests gripped
the country.

08:19.866 --> 08:25.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clashes erupted in Paris between
demonstrators
and police, who fired tear gas
to disperse

08:25.138 --> 08:30.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the crowds. Thousands of union
members also
marched in the port city of Le
Havre. The

08:30.443 --> 08:35.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strikes have choked off much of
France's fuel
supply. At issue is the
government's plan

08:35.782 --> 08:38.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make the workweek longer and
layoffs easier.

08:38.718 --> 08:43.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A dire warning
today for
the world's top economies.
Japan's Prime Minister

08:43.156 --> 08:49.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shinzo Abe told his fellow
leaders that conditions
now resemble those before the
2008 financial

08:49.329 --> 08:54.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meltdown. He spoke at a Group of
Seven Summit
in Japan, and said his
counterparts agreed

08:54.334 --> 08:56.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the need for new stimulus
efforts.

08:57.003 --> 09:02.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHINZO ABE, Japanese Prime
Minister (through
translator): We rigorously
debated the global

09:02.509 --> 09:07.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economy this time, and we agree
it faces a
great risk at this moment. It
was a great

09:07.147 --> 09:11.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
achievement that we were able to
put together
and agree to an economic
initiative to face

09:11.484 --> 09:13.386 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those very risks.

09:13.486 --> 09:17.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A top aide to
Abe said later
that G7 nations will decide on
their own about

09:17.323 --> 09:19.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the timing and size of any
stimulus.

09:19.526 --> 09:24.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, new federal
guidelines issued today aim to
give states

09:24.731 --> 09:30.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more flexibility in identifying
failing schools.
The Department of Education is
proposing the

09:30.236 --> 09:36.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decision be based on a mix of
test scores,
academic growth and absenteeism.

09:36.576 --> 09:41.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, Congress revamped the
No Child
Left Behind Act to give states
more control

09:41.581 --> 09:43.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over education policy.

09:43.450 --> 09:47.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Baylor
University confirms
that Kenneth Starr is out as
president for

09:47.554 --> 09:52.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
failing to do more about sexual
abuse complaints
against football players. The
school also

09:52.158 --> 09:57.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fired head football coach Art
Briles today.
Starr is being demoted to
chancellor. He's

09:57.197 --> 10:01.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the former independent
prosecutor who investigated
President Clinton in the '90s.

10:01.100 --> 10:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street put
up mixed results
today. The Dow Jones industrial
average lost

10:06.172 --> 10:13.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
23 points to close at 17828. The
Nasdaq rose
nearly seven points, and the S&amp;P
500 fell

10:14.080 --> 10:15.849 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a fraction.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the
nation's Memorial
Day observances opened today,
with an event

10:19.052 --> 10:25.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
known as Flags In. At Arlington
National Cemetery,
outside Washington, some 1,000
soldiers placed

10:25.225 --> 10:31.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American flags on more than
230,000 grave
sites of fallen service men and
women. The

10:31.397 --> 10:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
flags will be removed after
Monday.

10:34.467 --> 10:38.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what the
rest of the world thinks of
Donald Trump;

10:38.338 --> 10:44.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how preparing for a volcanic
eruption helped
Ecuador respond to another
disaster; researchers

10:44.377 --> 10:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
find a superbug resistant to all
antibiotics
in a patient in Pennsylvania;
and much more.

10:54.220 --> 11:06.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn back to
the race for
the White House. But, tonight,
we get some

11:06.900 --> 11:12.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
global insight into how Donald
Trump's rise
to become the presumptive
Republican Party

11:12.405 --> 11:15.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nominee for president is seen
around the world.

11:15.542 --> 11:20.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, we're joined by Geoff
Dyer. He's
U.S. diplomatic correspondent
for The Financial

11:21.080 --> 11:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Times. He has reported from
London and used
to be his paper's Beijing bureau
chief. Joyce

11:26.953 --> 11:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Karam is Washington bureau chief
for the Pan-Arab
newspaper Al-Hayat. And Alan
Gomez focuses

11:33.626 --> 11:39.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Latin America and immigration
issues, among
other things, for USA Today.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we welcome all three of you
to the "NewsHour."
Thank you for being here.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ, USA Today: Thank
you.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Geoff Dyer,
let me start
with you. As we said, you have
reported from

11:45.271 --> 11:49.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe. You are based in the
U.S. now, but
you have also reported from
Asia.

11:49.275 --> 11:53.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But let's start with Europe. We
heard the
president's comments today. He
said world

11:53.479 --> 11:57.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders are rattled by what
they're hearing
from Donald Trump. Donald Trump
said it's

11:57.150 --> 12:01.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good that people are rattled.
What are you
seeing, what are you hearing
from the Europeans?

12:01.955 --> 12:04.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEOFF DYER, The Financial Times:
Well, we're
in quite an extraordinary
position, where

12:04.290 --> 12:08.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
several European leaders have
come out publicly
criticizing one of the main
candidates to

12:08.394 --> 12:10.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be the president of the United
States.

12:10.263 --> 12:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is a very, very rare thing.
That doesn't
happen very often. David
Cameron, the British

12:13.766 --> 12:17.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prime minister, has called
Donald Trump's
plan to ban Muslims divisive and
stupid. Matteo

12:17.704 --> 12:22.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Renzi, the Italian prime
minister, has said
he would vote for Hillary
Clinton.

12:22.208 --> 12:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even Angela Merkel, who has been
a bit more
diplomat, has gone out of her
way to say how

12:25.411 --> 12:30.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much she admires and likes
working with Hillary
Clinton. This is a very, very
unusual situation.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Politicians are not usually so
critical of
one of main candidates.

12:33.753 --> 12:37.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, for the Europeans,
there are three
main things. There is the ban on
Muslim that

12:37.123 --> 12:41.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump has proposed, where
a lot of
European politicians would say
this is stimulating,

12:41.661 --> 12:45.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
encouraging, giving a propaganda
victory to
ISIS.

12:45.131 --> 12:48.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's comments about NATO,
where he said
that potentially maybe perhaps
the U.S. should

12:48.468 --> 12:52.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pull out of NATO in some way.
That has also
obviously got the Europeans very
worried,

12:52.305 --> 12:55.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
especially at a time when
they're looking
anxiously at Vladimir Putin and
Russia.

12:55.742 --> 13:00.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then his comments that he
would tear up
the Paris climate change accord
from last

13:00.279 --> 13:04.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year, this is something that
most European
governments are fairly strongly
supportive

13:04.350 --> 13:06.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of. And it has got them very
worried.

13:06.152 --> 13:10.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But at the same
time, this
administration, the Obama
administration,

13:10.723 --> 13:13.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hasn't been universally loved by
many of these
leaders, has it?

13:13.926 --> 13:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEOFF DYER: That's fair to say
as well, though
Obama is still pretty popular in
Europe, and

13:18.398 --> 13:21.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he went to London recently and
had quite a
significant intervention into
the British

13:21.701 --> 13:24.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate about whether to stay
within the European
Union.

13:24.737 --> 13:28.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wouldn't have been invited if
he wasn't
still quite popular there. But
he's also said

13:28.307 --> 13:31.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some things that are quite
critical about
NATO as well. He and a lot other
American

13:32.078 --> 13:36.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politicians have said that
European governments
should spend more money on NATO,
that they

13:36.282 --> 13:38.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
need to increase their defense
spending.

13:38.284 --> 13:41.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's been part of Donald
Trump's message,
but he's gone one step further,
and essentially

13:42.021 --> 13:45.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raised the idea of maybe the
U.S. should pull
out of NATO in some way. And
that's really

13:45.224 --> 13:47.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a much bigger step.

13:47.193 --> 13:50.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Joyce Karam, I
know it's hard
to talk about the entire Middle
East, because

13:50.630 --> 13:55.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are so many different
countries and
so many different sets of
interests, but based

13:55.334 --> 14:00.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on your reporting, how would you
say leaders
in that part of the world are
looking at this

14:00.640 --> 14:02.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election and looking at Donald
Trump?

14:02.508 --> 14:06.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOYCE KARAM, Al-Hayat: I mean,
Judy, look,
when Donald Trump announced his
candidacy,

14:06.979 --> 14:10.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many of these leaders know
Donald Trump. They
have dealt with him. They have
done business

14:10.450 --> 14:12.218 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with him.

14:12.318 --> 14:17.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Trump Hotel is to waiting to
open in Doha
next year. So they know him on
the personal

14:17.857 --> 14:23.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
level. But I think the rhetoric
that was heard
from the campaign of Donald
Trump, the ban

14:23.963 --> 14:34.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on Muslims, reinstituting
torture, this all
is fueling a level of anti-Trump
mood in the

14:34.507 --> 14:36.275 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Middle East.

14:36.375 --> 14:41.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
People went from being
bewildered and perplexed
by Donald Trump's rise in
American politics

14:42.081 --> 14:49.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to being alarmed and terrified
today. Is he
really going to take the oil
from Iraq? Is

14:49.889 --> 14:56.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he really going to bomb ISIS
families? Is
he going to ban Muslims from
entering the

14:56.796 --> 14:58.564 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States?

14:58.664 --> 15:02.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are all valid questions
that you hear
them in Dubai and Beirut,
wherever you go

15:02.969 --> 15:11.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the Middle East. So there
is a sense
of high concern that America
that many Arabs

15:12.044 --> 15:19.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
love and admire has changed. And
what to expect
next, it's a big open question.

15:19.619 --> 15:24.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He's also talked,
as we know,
about undoing the Iran nuclear
treaty. He

15:24.557 --> 15:30.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has sounded, I think, for the
most part pretty
pro-Israel, wanting to support
Israel's defenses.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.131 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How is that seen?

15:32.231 --> 15:39.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOYCE KARAM: That also is not
sinking well
with Middle Easterners, with the
Arab street.

15:39.572 --> 15:47.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For me, growing up in Lebanon,
seeing how
America is portrayed, Donald
Trump is confirming

15:48.047 --> 15:55.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Arabs' worst fears about the
United States,
about the U.S. policy. We hear
conspiracies

15:55.588 --> 16:00.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Middle East, that the
U.S. is very
pro-Israel, doesn't care about
the Palestinians,

16:00.760 --> 16:06.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. is in the Middle East
to take the
oil, the U.S. is greedy and
imperial.

16:06.499 --> 16:12.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, this is -- today,
it matches
the rhetoric we hear from Donald
Trump. Will

16:12.972 --> 16:18.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump change as a
president? Perhaps,
but, for now, that's what Arabs
are hearing

16:18.978 --> 16:20.179 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and reacting to.

16:20.279 --> 16:23.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Alan Gomez, let's
talk about
Latin America.

16:23.816 --> 16:29.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have already heard reactions
just now from
Joyce and Geoff, from the other
parts of the

16:30.022 --> 16:34.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world, about his comments about
Muslims. But
what about that other border
that he has talked

16:34.994 --> 16:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so much about, about building
the wall, about
Mexicans and others from Central
America coming

16:41.000 --> 16:46.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
across the border, being
criminals, murderers,
rapists, and so forth? How would
you characterize

16:46.205 --> 16:50.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the reactions to him south of
the border?

16:50.576 --> 16:52.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ, USA Today: Yes. The
reactions
have been pretty
well-established since he

16:52.612 --> 16:57.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
originally made those comments
way back last
summer, when he was announcing
for president.

16:57.917 --> 17:01.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That speech that he gave where
he talked about
drug dealers and rapists coming
from Mexico

17:01.287 --> 17:06.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the U.S. pretty much shored
up the opinion
of Donald Trump throughout Latin
America,

17:06.826 --> 17:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because even though he was
talking specifically
about Mexico there, I think
Latin Americans

17:10.296 --> 17:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
took it as a collective insult.

17:12.431 --> 17:17.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you had the Nicaraguan
president talking
about that this -- Donald
Trump's rhetoric

17:17.970 --> 17:24.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being racist and warlike. You
had Mexican
President Enrique Pena Nieto
likening Trump's

17:24.744 --> 17:29.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rise to that of Mussolini and
Hitler. And
that's really permeated
throughout all levels

17:29.916 --> 17:33.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of Latin America, from
government down to
the people.

17:33.119 --> 17:36.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I can tell you, it's gotten
to the point
that it's almost a running joke
throughout

17:36.522 --> 17:41.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the region. In Argentina
recently, they have
been airing TV ads where they're
showing clips

17:41.294 --> 17:45.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Donald Trump's speeches
talking about building
that border wall, protecting the
Americans

17:45.965 --> 17:50.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from foreigners and
interspersing that with
images of Argentina's soccer
team and saying,

17:50.670 --> 17:54.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hey, they're on their way up
here to play
in Copa America, a soccer
tournament in the

17:54.840 --> 17:58.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. next month, and saying,
yes, they should
be worried about us.

17:58.377 --> 18:03.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's gotten to the point
that it's almost
a joke at this point how he's
viewed by Latin

18:03.449 --> 18:05.151 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Americans.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I know. And it's
very tough
to cover every part of the world
in just a

18:07.887 --> 18:09.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
few minutes.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Geoff Dyer, let me come
back to you and
ask you about Asia. That's where
President

18:12.625 --> 18:16.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama is right now. It's where
all this has
risen. Of course, Donald Trump
has spent a

18:16.128 --> 18:23.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of time talking about the
Chinese and
how they're taking the Americans
for granted,

18:23.235 --> 18:26.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting the benefit of trade
deals.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's the view of him on the
Asian continent?

18:28.441 --> 18:32.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GEOFF DYER: I suspect the
Chinese are a little
bit ambivalent. Donald Trump has
talked about

18:32.411 --> 18:34.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
starting a trade war and
imposing tariffs
on China.

18:34.914 --> 18:39.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also made some comments
about maybe stealing
or taking some of these manmade
islands in

18:39.585 --> 18:43.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the South China Sea that China
has been militarizing,
that we will have got their
attention. But,

18:43.289 --> 18:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the same time, the Chinese
are very suspicious
of Hillary Clinton. They see her
as the person

18:47.760 --> 18:51.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within the Obama administration
when she was
secretary of state in his first
term who effectively

18:52.064 --> 18:56.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
encouraged the administration to
take a much
more aggressive approach towards
China.

18:56.202 --> 19:00.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they're not big fans of
Hillary Clinton
either. I think, within Asia,
the big reaction

19:00.306 --> 19:03.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been from the Japanese and
the South Koreans,
who are America's key allies in
the region.

19:03.809 --> 19:07.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump has said that
he might consider
pulling troops out of both of
those countries,

19:07.913 --> 19:10.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans troops out of those
countries, and
also said that maybe it's a good
idea for

19:10.783 --> 19:12.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them to have nuclear weapons.

19:12.685 --> 19:17.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Both of those ideas would
completely overturn
the basic understandings in
those countries,

19:17.890 --> 19:21.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how they manage their security,
how they think
about their future in the next
couple of decades.

19:21.694 --> 19:24.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, these are not sort of minor
things. These
are huge deals for those
countries.

19:24.530 --> 19:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In just the very
short time
we have left, Joyce Karam, views
of Hillary

19:28.300 --> 19:29.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton, Middle East?

19:30.002 --> 19:33.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOYCE KARAM: I think Hillary
Clinton is a
known quantity in the Middle
East.

19:33.706 --> 19:39.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They know the name. The name
recognition is
big in the GCC countries and
across the region.

19:39.779 --> 19:45.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They know some of her advisers,
people that
she would bring if she's to be
president.

19:45.951 --> 19:49.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
With Donald Trump, you have the
opposite problem.

19:49.488 --> 19:55.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know from Secretary Clinton's
trips to
the region that she held very
long meetings.

19:55.261 --> 19:57.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She would be well-received in
Saudi and other
places.

19:57.997 --> 20:02.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Alan Gomez, and
Hillary Clinton,
view of her in Latin America?

20:02.301 --> 20:04.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: It's interesting.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hispanics in the U.S. actually
have a very
good view of Hillary Clinton,
because she

20:07.039 --> 20:11.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has already said that she would
continue President
Obama's programs and expand his
programs to

20:11.210 --> 20:13.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protect undocumented immigrants
from deportation.

20:13.946 --> 20:17.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once you get into Latin America,
things get
a little bit trickier because of
her tenure

20:17.216 --> 20:20.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as secretary of state. In
Honduras, a lot
of people are still upset that
she didn't

20:20.586 --> 20:24.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fight back hard enough against
the 2009 coup
there that has deposed its
president.

20:24.590 --> 20:28.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Haiti, there's a lot of
people upset over
the way that the Clinton
Foundation has handled

20:28.160 --> 20:31.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reconstruction money following
the earthquake
there. And there's all sorts of
problems around

20:31.831 --> 20:35.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the region about the
militarization that the
U.S. has pushed in the region to
fight against

20:35.968 --> 20:37.870 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the drug war.

20:37.970 --> 20:42.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is a lot of concern
about her specifically.
But, trust me, you ask anybody
down there

20:42.341 --> 20:44.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary or Donald, and it's a
very clear choice.

20:44.110 --> 20:48.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's very
unfair to ask
all three of you to condense the
views of

20:48.380 --> 20:54.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the entire world in just a few
minutes, but
we do appreciate your giving us
your insights.

20:54.720 --> 20:59.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joyce Karam, Geoff Dyer, Alan
Gomez, we thank
you, all three.

20:59.558 --> 21:04.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GEOFF DYER: Thank you.

21:04.330 --> 21:08.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN GOMEZ: Thank you.

21:09.034 --> 21:13.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOYCE KARAM: Thank you.

21:13.739 --> 21:19.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's been just
over a month
since a major earthquake
devastated swathes

21:19.311 --> 21:25.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of countryside and towns on
Ecuador's Pacific
coast; 663 people are officially
confirmed

21:25.718 --> 21:27.586 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dead.

21:27.686 --> 21:31.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as thousands more face the
loss of their
homes or workplace, videographer
Bruno Federico

21:31.657 --> 21:37.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and special correspondent Nadja
Drost bring
us this report from Manabi
province on Ecuador's

21:37.229 --> 21:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coast, where people are trying
to rebuild
their towns and lives.

21:41.800 --> 21:49.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFREDO JAMA, Fisherman (through
translator):
That night was unforgettable. I
was bringing

21:49.675 --> 21:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up the net, when, suddenly, I
felt the boat
vibrating too much. It was like
the floor

21:54.013 --> 21:55.781 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
burst open.

21:55.881 --> 22:01.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: It's the first time
that fisherman
Alfredo Jama has dared to return
out to sea

22:01.620 --> 22:06.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since an earthquake caught him
by surprise
on April 16th when he was
fishing.

22:06.659 --> 22:11.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALFREDO JAMA (through
translator): When I
looked around, I saw an
explosion that left

22:11.864 --> 22:16.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us without light. Everything was
dark. The
sea bellowed from beneath. It
was like there

22:16.101 --> 22:21.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a beast coming up from
under. When I returned
to the house, everything was a
disaster.

22:22.041 --> 22:28.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Jama's wife, Paola
Farias, walked
us through what used to be the
two-story home

22:28.814 --> 22:32.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of their extended family, which
she also used
for her nail salon.

22:32.318 --> 22:37.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAOLA FARIAS, Salon Owner
(through translator):
When I said, don't worry, it's
over, was when

22:37.223 --> 22:43.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the movement started more
strongly. The walls
started falling. We managed to
leave the house.

22:43.762 --> 22:48.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was terrible, because imagine
how one works
so hard for one's things, and
from one moment

22:48.634 --> 22:50.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to another, nothing.

22:50.569 --> 22:57.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Farias is one of at
least 250,000
Ecuadorians directly affected by
an earthquake

22:57.142 --> 23:02.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that knocked down thousands of
buildings.
It also set off an outpouring of
support from

23:02.414 --> 23:07.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fellow Ecuadorians, like Karla
Morales, the
director of local human rights
group Kahre.

23:07.586 --> 23:13.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was at home in the city of
Guayaquil,
over 150 miles south of the
epicenter, the

23:13.425 --> 23:14.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
night the quake hit.

23:14.827 --> 23:18.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARLA MORALES, Kahre: And in
that moment,
I just sent a tweet.

23:18.697 --> 23:23.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: "Bring supplies to
my house tomorrow,"
Karla wrote, and she'd drive
them north to

23:23.569 --> 23:26.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the earthquake-affected region
the next afternoon.

23:26.338 --> 23:31.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARLA MORALES: And I didn't
expect that people
were so interested in helping
and with so

23:31.977 --> 23:40.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much compassion and solidarity.
There were
like 600 or maybe 1,000 people
in my house,

23:40.386 --> 23:45.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bringing help and helping with
all that donations
that we were receiving in that
moment.

23:45.224 --> 23:50.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Karla ended up
sending 23 large
truckloads of materials that
day. Since then,

23:50.829 --> 23:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her team continues to distribute
donations,
from water filters to
mattresses, to rural

23:56.001 --> 24:00.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
areas, where help has been
slower to reach.

24:00.439 --> 24:08.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ecuador hadn't expected an
earthquake, but
preparing for a different
emergency, a volcanic

24:08.781 --> 24:13.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eruption and flooding, helped it
respond quickly,
says Tim Callaghan of USAID.

24:13.752 --> 24:18.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM CALLAGHAN, USAID: Many of
the countries
in this region, Peru, and
Paraguay, and including

24:18.524 --> 24:24.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ecuador, obviously were planning
for potential
negative impacts from El Nino
flooding. Thankfully,

24:24.196 --> 24:29.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that hasn't been as severe as
was forecast,
but it did force Ecuador and
other countries

24:29.501 --> 24:31.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to plan for emergencies.

24:31.570 --> 24:36.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: And that meant
Ecuador's government
already had a certain level of
resilience

24:36.975 --> 24:43.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and emergency coordination to
activate search-and-rescue
and channel aid to people, he
told us.

24:43.415 --> 24:48.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After getting frozen out of
Ecuador two years
ago for political reasons, USAID
is one of

24:48.454 --> 24:53.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
many international groups
sending experts
in. The U.S. has donated nearly
$3 million

24:53.792 --> 24:59.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of humanitarian aid towards
relief efforts.
The needs are still great.
Callaghan points

24:59.732 --> 25:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to water, sanitation and shelter
as the most
pressing.

25:05.437 --> 25:10.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over 28,000 people are living in
shelters,
most run by the military. Others
are living

25:10.576 --> 25:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in parks or makeshift refuges,
where aid is
harder to come by. Its scarcity
led to this

25:16.315 --> 25:22.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
near brawl in Manta after people
outside the
neighborhood tried to claim
rations.

25:22.821 --> 25:31.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as it looks towards renewal,
Ecuador first
has to ask some tough questions
over why the

25:31.764 --> 25:38.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
destruction was so extensive. As
municipal
employees in the city of
Portoviejo fly drones

25:38.103 --> 25:42.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to evaluate the damages, they
reveal a devastating
picture of what went wrong.

25:42.908 --> 25:47.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's a lot, says Patricio
Velez, the
head of territorial development
for the city

25:47.646 --> 25:49.415 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Portoviejo.

25:49.515 --> 25:53.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PATRICIO VELEZ, Head of
Territorial Development,
Portoviejo (through translator):
There was

25:53.585 --> 25:58.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a lot of informality,
constructions without
permits. People would add on a
third floor.

25:58.323 --> 26:03.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It took us by surprise. There
were new buildings
that collapsed and old ones that
stood up.

26:03.395 --> 26:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Ecuador is used to
plenty of
small quakes, and its building
code has developed

26:08.167 --> 26:13.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
over the years to include
seismic considerations,
says Jaime Argudo, a structural
engineer.

26:13.405 --> 26:18.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But he says that up to 85
percent of buildings
are constructed without planning
for an earthquake.

26:18.877 --> 26:24.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAIME ARGUDO, Structural
Engineer: There is
also a major issue in our
country, and many

26:24.883 --> 26:29.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries around the world, that
building
codes are not properly enforced.

26:29.221 --> 26:35.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NADJA DROST: Now the
consequences of poor
building materials and
construction are devastatingly

26:35.327 --> 26:37.896 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
obvious.

26:37.996 --> 26:43.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Portoviejo, a city of 300,000
people, the
area hit hardest by the
earthquake was also

26:43.168 --> 26:49.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the city's economic center and
downtown. Here,
in what's being called the
city's ground zero,

26:49.174 --> 26:53.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
everything is shut down.
Two-thirds of buildings
inspected so far are either
collapsed, or

26:54.079 --> 26:59.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
severely damaged, and demolition
is in full
swing. Now, this battered city
faces rebuilding

26:59.952 --> 27:02.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
its economy, and its future.

27:03.088 --> 27:09.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Velez points to how much of
ground zero
will be leveled, he also sees a
clean slate,

27:09.294 --> 27:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an opportunity for Portoviejo to
reinvent
itself and become more
resilient.

27:13.765 --> 27:19.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PATRICIO VELEZ (through
translator): The city
grew in a disorderly fashion,
without planning.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We should take advantage of this
moment now.

27:21.640 --> 27:26.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: But to carry out
new urban plans
and reconstruction across the
region will

27:26.778 --> 27:32.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
take big money, just as
Ecuador's economy
struggles against plummeting oil
prices.

27:33.018 --> 27:38.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Rafael Correa, an
economist, estimated
it could cost $3 billion. As he
surveyed the

27:38.857 --> 27:43.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
damages of a neighborhood
outside of Manta,
we asked how he plans to make
that happen.

27:43.762 --> 27:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAFAEL CORREA, President of
Ecuador (through
translator): We have a
contingency loan from

27:48.267 --> 27:54.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the World Bank and the IDB for
over $600 million.
We will probably reach over a
billion, and

27:54.573 --> 27:58.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have taken a line of credit
that will give
us another billion dollars. If
all the lines

27:58.944 --> 28:04.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of credit work out, we will have
over $2 billion
for reconstruction. However, I
think we're

28:04.116 --> 28:07.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to need more, but for the
short term,
it's a significant amount.

28:07.553 --> 28:11.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: The government has
taken several
special measures, such as
raising the national

28:11.456 --> 28:16.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sales tax and getting
higher-income earners
to forego part of their salary,
to build up

28:16.762 --> 28:19.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
earthquake recovery funds.

28:19.364 --> 28:23.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some communities have already
had to rebuild
following a natural disaster.
Here in the

28:23.835 --> 28:30.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town of San Vicente, Farias and
Jama's house
was first destroyed by an
earthquake in 1998.

28:30.842 --> 28:34.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After they rebuilt it, floods
from El Nino
washed it away.

28:34.212 --> 28:40.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAOLA FARIAS (through
translator): And now,
it fell, including the roof.
Three disasters

28:40.652 --> 28:46.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have happened to us, and thank
God we're alive,
and we have to keep going and
start rebuilding.

28:46.224 --> 28:51.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: But recovery will
take more than
reconstruction. reviving local
economies and

28:52.030 --> 28:57.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people's livelihoods is a
pressing challenge,
yet slow to realize. But in
trying to figure

28:57.669 --> 29:01.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out how, many residents are
thinking bigger,
says Morales.

29:01.607 --> 29:08.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARLA MORALES: I think this has
been an earthquake
that destroyed houses, but
rebuilt minds.

29:08.680 --> 29:14.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the suffering, they are very
hopeful. They
are like, teach me. I want to
learn something

29:14.219 --> 29:15.921 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
else.

29:16.021 --> 29:19.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: While many look for
new ways
to make a living, others want to
restart their

29:19.825 --> 29:22.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
business. For Farias, that was
her nail salon.

29:22.361 --> 29:27.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAOLA FARIAS (through
translator): When the
house fell, you had to survive,
one way or

29:27.165 --> 29:32.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another. When I saw there was
something left
of my business, I decided, OK, I
will start

29:32.270 --> 29:34.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from zero. And here we are.

29:34.706 --> 29:41.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Farias and her
family want to
move to a new lot. It appears
they already

29:41.446 --> 29:43.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
know how to rebuild.

29:43.915 --> 29:48.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Manabi province in Ecuador,
reporting
with Bruno Federico, I'm Nadja
Drost for the

29:48.620 --> 29:50.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
"PBS NewsHour."

29:50.789 --> 29:56.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On our Web site,
learn about
a special mapping project that's
helping in

29:57.095 --> 30:02.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ecuador's relief effort.

30:03.035 --> 30:12.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

30:13.011 --> 30:17.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Making Sense
of patent trolls. Are they
protecting or stifling

30:17.816 --> 30:24.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
innovation? The launch of a
brand-new musical
variety show. And a comedian's
take on why

30:24.189 --> 30:28.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people should pay for the media
they consume.

30:28.860 --> 30:32.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But first: a sobering new
development with
superbugs and public health
concerns about

30:32.831 --> 30:35.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the limited effect of
antibiotics.

30:35.100 --> 30:40.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the first time in the U.S.,
a person has
been found to be carrying a
strain of E. coli

30:40.739 --> 30:45.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's resistant to antibiotics
of last resort.
The Washington Post reported the
strain was

30:45.610 --> 30:50.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discovered last month in a
49-year-old Pennsylvania
woman. She was resistant to
Colistin. And

30:50.649 --> 30:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
researchers said it -- quote --
"heralds the
emergence of a truly
pan-drug-resistant bacteria."

30:56.555 --> 31:00.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Dr. Beth Bell is with the
Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. And she
is now working

31:00.659 --> 31:05.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Pennsylvania officials.
She's the director
of the National Center for
Emerging and Zoonotic

31:05.363 --> 31:06.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Infectious Diseases.

31:06.832 --> 31:07.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

31:08.066 --> 31:10.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
First, how -- what is so
distinct about these
findings?

31:10.602 --> 31:12.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. BETH BELL, Director,
National Center for
Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious
Diseases:

31:12.537 --> 31:16.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colistin is an antibiotic that
we have already
had for quite a long time, but
we use it as

31:16.374 --> 31:18.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a last line.

31:18.410 --> 31:23.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, it's our drug of last
resort. And so when
patients are infected with some
of these superbugs

31:23.281 --> 31:28.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that we have talked about
before, where the
strain is resistant to pretty
much every antibiotic,

31:28.787 --> 31:32.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we rely on Colistin as the last
resort.

31:32.224 --> 31:38.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we find here in this
patient, the
bacteria that infected this
patient, is that

31:38.196 --> 31:46.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her strain contains one of these
mobile genes
that confers resistance to
Colistin. So, because

31:46.772 --> 31:52.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bacteria can spread these mobile
genes among
themselves, it sets off a
situation where

31:52.778 --> 31:58.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we can see a bacteria that's
resistant to
every known antibiotic. And, of
course, that

31:58.350 --> 32:01.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a very frightening prospect
for all of
us.

32:01.286 --> 32:02.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right.

32:03.088 --> 32:05.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, when I am go to the
pharmacy, and I'm
prescribed something like
azithromycin or

32:05.457 --> 32:09.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something, it's pretty low on
the scale of
the arsenal that doctors have.
So, this is

32:09.661 --> 32:13.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the top end. There is nothing
after this.
That means that the patient is
untreatable,

32:13.899 --> 32:17.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that means there is a, what,
greater chance
that they might die because of
this?

32:17.936 --> 32:19.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DR. BETH BELL: Sure.

32:19.905 --> 32:24.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's -- we luckily haven't
seen actual
bacteria that are resistant to
every single

32:24.442 --> 32:28.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
antibiotic here in the United
States. But
there are reports of this in
other parts of

32:28.747 --> 32:34.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world, and these patients
have a very
high mortality rate. It's
extremely difficult

32:34.286 --> 32:38.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to treat them. And, again, this
raises the
specter of a post-antibiotic
era.

32:38.356 --> 32:41.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
how do bugs
get this strong?

32:41.927 --> 32:47.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. BETH BELL: You know,
bacteria are just
really, really smart. Microbes
have learned

32:47.165 --> 32:52.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how to evolve over centuries and
centuries,
and they have a number of
different methods

32:52.170 --> 32:54.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for outwitting antibiotics.

32:54.906 --> 33:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because, bacteria, they
reproduce so quickly,
by chance, sometimes there will
be a mutation

33:01.313 --> 33:06.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that allows a certain strain to
outwit an
antibiotic. And that, therefore,
means that

33:06.818 --> 33:13.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that bacteria grows
preferentially, and that's
how these bacteria develop
resistance.

33:13.558 --> 33:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, of course, that points
out the importance
of using antibiotics only at the
right time

33:21.800 --> 33:27.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the right dose, because
overuse of antibiotics,
of course, can spur these
bacteria to develop

33:28.006 --> 33:29.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
these resistance mechanisms.

33:29.908 --> 33:32.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But what can
we learn from
what happened to this specific
individual?

33:32.811 --> 33:37.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, it's just one person,
but what
do we know? Do we know anything
about how

33:37.449 --> 33:42.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she contracted this or perhaps
if her immune
system was already suppressed?

33:42.387 --> 33:47.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. BETH BELL: We don't know
much yet about
how she contracted it. It
doesn't sound like

33:47.292 --> 33:51.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she's traveled outside the
United States,
but we don't have the kind of
really specific

33:52.030 --> 33:53.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
information that we would like.

33:53.899 --> 33:57.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're working directly with the
Pennsylvania
Department of Health right now
to do that

33:57.702 --> 34:02.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of in-depth investigation
that will help
us figure out why she might have
gotten it,

34:03.008 --> 34:08.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether any of her household
contacts also
had the bacteria, and to just
give us the

34:08.179 --> 34:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of information that we need
about how
widespread the bacteria might be
in this particular

34:14.319 --> 34:16.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
situation.

34:16.288 --> 34:18.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Over the past
several months,
the CDC has been out talking
about so many

34:18.390 --> 34:20.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
different types of infectious
diseases.

34:20.225 --> 34:23.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One on the hand, we have had
Ebola, and now
there's lot of concern about
Zika. This is

34:23.762 --> 34:27.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something completely different.
This isn't
the type of communicable disease
that I can

34:27.165 --> 34:30.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get by just being in the same
room with you,
right?

34:30.135 --> 34:31.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DR. BETH BELL: Yes.

34:32.003 --> 34:36.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, the mode of transmission
of different
-- of communicable diseases
varies by the

34:36.341 --> 34:41.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bacteria. But certainly with
some of these
superbug strains, we do see them
transmitted,

34:41.746 --> 34:43.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
especially in health care
settings.

34:44.015 --> 34:50.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is why prevention
really is so important,
prevention in terms of
antibiotic stewardship,

34:50.121 --> 34:56.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
using antibiotics correctly, and
infection
control, using the kinds of
strategies that

34:56.294 --> 35:01.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
prevent environmental
contamination in hospitals
and spread of bacteria among
patients.

35:01.299 --> 35:04.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Dr.
Beth Bell
from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention,

35:04.502 --> 35:05.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thanks so much.

35:05.637 --> 35:09.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. BETH BELL: Thank you so much
for having
me.

35:09.741 --> 35:20.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Patents are often
called the
building blocks of innovation.
But in recent

35:20.485 --> 35:25.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, a broad fight over the
enforcement
of patents, and what should
qualify as a true

35:26.057 --> 35:32.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
invention, has drawn players
from every corner,
inventors, lawyers, giant
technology and pharmaceutical

35:32.464 --> 35:34.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
companies and universities.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul

TODD MOORE, CEO, TMSOFT: So
here's Amazon
jungle.

35:44.776 --> 35:49.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That's Todd Moore's
White Noise
mobile phone app, which
generates the call

35:49.647 --> 35:55.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the wild, and pretty much any
other sound
you can think of, to lull the
sleep-challenged

35:55.153 --> 35:56.421 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to la-la land.

35:56.521 --> 35:57.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And this is frogs?

35:57.922 --> 36:01.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TODD MOORE: Yes. Don't you just
want to fall
asleep?

36:01.493 --> 36:03.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: I'm getting
slightly drowsy.

36:03.628 --> 36:10.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was such a basic idea, Moore
didn't even
bother to apply for a patent.
And yet he himself

36:10.235 --> 36:12.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was sued for patent
infringement.

36:12.670 --> 36:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD MOORE: They were claiming a
hyperlink
inside the white noise app, that
you would

36:17.876 --> 36:22.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tap it and go to the Internet,
that was infringing
on one or more of their patents.

36:22.814 --> 36:26.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But doesn't almost
every app
have a hyperlink of some sort?

36:26.451 --> 36:31.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD MOORE: Yes. If you're using
the Internet
it does, so how can they say
that's infringing

36:31.489 --> 36:33.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on a patent?

36:33.425 --> 36:39.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And all they were
asking to go
away, $3,500. Welcome to the
world of so-called

36:39.297 --> 36:41.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
patent trolls.

36:41.466 --> 36:48.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: A patent troll is
someone that makes
their money by filing frivolous
lawsuits against

36:48.540 --> 36:53.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
companies, with the hope that
these companies
will pay a fee to settle, rather
than go to

36:53.611 --> 36:55.447 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
court.

36:55.547 --> 36:58.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The House Judiciary
Committee,
which put out this cartoon,
passed an anti-troll

36:58.917 --> 37:00.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bill last summer.

37:00.785 --> 37:04.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: They don't manufacture
anything.
They don't create jobs. Instead,
they're siphoning

37:05.056 --> 37:09.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money from companies that do.
It's nothing
more than legalized extortion.

37:09.594 --> 37:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The company suing
Moore was Lodsys.
When we called for comment, a
phone number

37:15.700 --> 37:21.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for its CEO was disconnected,
its Web site
domain name no longer operative.

37:21.406 --> 37:28.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In its prime, though, the
company was what's
known as a non-practicing
entity, or NPE,

37:28.146 --> 37:33.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
because it didn't create
inventions of its
own. It amassed those of others
and sued,

37:33.985 --> 37:40.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a common practice for years now.
And the numbers
show the scope. About two-thirds
of all patent

37:40.158 --> 37:44.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lawsuits in district court last
year were
filed by non-practicing
entities.

37:44.662 --> 37:49.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD MOORE: It's happening all
the time, and
there's nothing we can do about
it. We just

37:49.467 --> 37:51.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to write them a check, so
they will go
away

37:52.036 --> 37:54.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So this is like a
WeWork?

37:54.272 --> 37:58.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, Moore, who had only
three employees
at the time, couldn't afford to
stop them

37:58.810 --> 38:05.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in court. But he lucked into a
pro bono lawyer
spoiling for a troll fight. So,
when Lodsys

38:05.850 --> 38:07.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
asked for its measly $3,500...

38:07.719 --> 38:12.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD MOORE: I said no. And then
they came
back and said, well, would you
pay us $2,000?

38:12.690 --> 38:18.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I said no. And then they
came back and
said, what will you pay? And I
said nothing.

38:19.097 --> 38:24.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they said, OK, we will take
that, as long
as you promise not to sue us,
which that's

38:24.669 --> 38:26.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not my business model. That's
theirs.

38:26.571 --> 38:28.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAUREN COHEN, Harvard Business
School: So,
our patent and patent
enforcement system has

38:29.073 --> 38:31.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gotten to the brink of no
return.

38:31.543 --> 38:35.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Harvard Business
School professor
Lauren Cohen has studied the
economic impact

38:35.713 --> 38:37.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of trolls.

38:37.448 --> 38:40.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LAUREN COHEN: This is an
overused phrase.
The future of the U.S. economy
depends on

38:40.285 --> 38:43.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this. Right? You will hear
people say the
future of the U.S. economy
depends on seashells

38:43.655 --> 38:47.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or on pickles, right? But the
future of the
U.S. economy really does depend
on innovation.

38:47.825 --> 38:52.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And yet shakedown
artists may
be putting the squeeze on
America's innovators.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHIP HARRIS, Acacia Research:
We're in this
business to make money.

38:54.132 --> 38:59.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Chip Harris is
director of Acacia
Research, a decidedly
non-practicing entity,

38:59.837 --> 39:04.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which started out as a venture
capital firm,
investing in the V-chip, a
parental control

39:04.642 --> 39:07.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
technology for TV sets.

39:07.245 --> 39:13.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When it didn't sell, Acacia
decided to use
the V-chip patent it owned to
sue TV makers

39:13.551 --> 39:20.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who, it claimed, had applied the
idea without
paying for it. And pay, they
eventually did.

39:20.225 --> 39:25.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ever since, Acacia's business
has been, says
Harris, to protect patent
owners.

39:25.330 --> 39:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHIP HARRIS: Some of the big
companies out
there have done a wonderful job
of reframing

39:28.633 --> 39:35.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the argument. And they say,
well, you're a
non-practicing entity or you're
a patent troll.

39:35.873 --> 39:40.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, it's a little bit like
saying, well,
if you built your house, you can
rent it.

39:40.478 --> 39:42.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But if you bought it from
somebody else, you
can't rent it.

39:42.714 --> 39:46.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So is Acacia a
patent protector
or a patent troll?

39:46.985 --> 39:48.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And how many books have you got
here?

39:48.152 --> 39:50.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAY WALKER, Walker Innovation:
About 25,000.

39:50.188 --> 39:56.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What about an even
bigger player,
Jay Walker, whose practicing
company, Priceline,

39:56.127 --> 40:00.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fully protected by patents, made
him a fortune?

40:00.164 --> 40:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Walker's Library of the History
of Human Imagination
at his Connecticut home is a
world-class museum

40:06.337 --> 40:08.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
featuring the inventions of the
past.

40:08.373 --> 40:12.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY WALKER: This is one of the
few surviving
working Enigma machines in the
world.

40:12.710 --> 40:16.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: He even showed me
the famous
Nazi invention whose code the
Brits helped

40:16.648 --> 40:21.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crack in World War II, made
famous again recently
by the movie "The Imitation
Game."

40:21.786 --> 40:23.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR: It's beautiful.

40:23.554 --> 40:27.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR: It's the greatest
encryption device
in history and the Germans use
it for all

40:27.358 --> 40:29.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
communications.

40:29.160 --> 40:32.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Walker's own
invention record
is none too shabby. He's named
on more than

40:32.930 --> 40:39.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
500 U.S. and international
patents. But for
protecting them, by filing suit
against Microsoft,

40:39.737 --> 40:45.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Google, Apple, Sony, and others,
for infringement,
he's been called a patent troll,
slander,

40:45.943 --> 40:47.779 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
he says.

40:47.879 --> 40:51.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY WALKER: People want to say,
well, he took
me to court, he shouldn't have
taken me to

40:51.149 --> 40:54.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
court. He's a troll. What I
really want to
do is to say to somebody, look,
you're using

40:54.886 --> 40:57.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my patent. Pay me a reasonable
license, and
we're done.

40:57.322 --> 41:02.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But are all of
Walker's patents
themselves reasonable? Or, as
has been alleged,

41:02.994 --> 41:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were some invented just to cash
in on the
eventual practical innovations
of others?

41:08.366 --> 41:16.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can imagine people saying,
yes, so he writes
out all kinds of possible
inventions, that

41:16.207 --> 41:20.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then he figures somebody else
will eventually
actually use, so then he can
say, hey, wait

41:20.745 --> 41:22.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a second, I invented that first.

41:22.680 --> 41:26.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY WALKER: America is not a
country where
you have to invent things and
then bring them

41:26.484 --> 41:31.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to market. If you have a working
requirement
where everything you invent you
have to do

41:31.823 --> 41:35.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in order to keep your patent,
then you will
never have a group of inventors
inventing

41:35.426 --> 41:37.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things that they want others to
do.

41:37.395 --> 41:41.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAUREN COHEN: Patent trolling is
chasing cash
indiscriminate of infringement.

41:41.432 --> 41:47.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Professor Cohen
takes no position
on Jay Walker or Acacia. But
just look, he

41:47.438 --> 41:54.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says, at dusty Marshall, Texas,
teeming with
mailboxes for patent troll
firms. More than

41:54.879 --> 42:00.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
43 percent of 2015 patent cases
were filed
in the Eastern District of
Texas.

42:00.852 --> 42:05.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAUREN COHEN: Marshall, Texas,
is definitely
not a hotbed of U.S. innovation.
And so what's

42:05.123 --> 42:09.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bringing the NPEs there? Well,
two things
really. So, they try cases
quicker than other

42:09.660 --> 42:13.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
places, and that's because of a
few administrative
rules that they put in place.
And they rule

42:13.698 --> 42:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in favor of NPEs more than
anywhere else.

42:15.933 --> 42:20.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: So what, if
anything, should
be done? Enact that bill passed
by the House

42:20.671 --> 42:27.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judiciary Committee? It would
toughen requirements
for filing patent challenges in
court, could

42:27.111 --> 42:32.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make plaintiffs pay the legal
bills of defendants
if a claim's considered
unreasonable.

42:32.283 --> 42:36.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, the bill has yet to see
a vote on
the House floor. Same with a
similar bill

42:37.088 --> 42:41.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Senate. At a conference,
the head of
the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, Michelle

42:42.059 --> 42:47.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lee, said changes to the law can
help and
that past changes already have,
letting her

42:47.698 --> 42:51.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
office hire more examiners to
improve the
quality of the patents it
issues.

42:52.003 --> 42:53.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE LEE, Director, U.S.
Patent and Trademark
Office: All this discussion
about abusive

42:54.005 --> 42:58.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
patent litigation, it is even
more important
for us to issue patents that
should issue

42:58.843 --> 43:02.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and not to issue patents that
shouldn't, because
there's a cost both ways.

43:02.213 --> 43:07.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And ever since his
run-in with
Lodsys, developer Todd Moore,
himself named

43:07.952 --> 43:11.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on a handful of patents, has
pushed for reform.

43:11.389 --> 43:17.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD MOORE: I believe in having
a strong patent
system, but what I don't believe
in is just

43:17.562 --> 43:23.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suing everybody without actually
building
anything, without helping
people, without

43:23.568 --> 43:25.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
helping society in any way.

43:25.536 --> 43:30.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," this
is economics correspondent Paul
Solman, likely

43:30.308 --> 43:40.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to sleep more soundly tonight,
unless I start
thinking about the patent
system, that is.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Now: A new
music variety
show debuts on PBS, set in a
club with quite

43:50.761 --> 43:53.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a legacy in rock and alternative
music.

43:53.564 --> 43:55.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown explains.

43:55.433 --> 44:04.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's called "Live
at 9:30,"
and live is important. This is a
musical variety

44:05.042 --> 44:10.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show aimed at giving viewers an
experience
as close as possible to being at
a rock 'n'

44:10.414 --> 44:21.158 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
roll show.

44:21.259 --> 44:27.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unlike the much-loved "Austin
City Limits,"
now 40-plus-years old, each
hour-long episode

44:27.598 --> 44:37.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of "Live At 9:30" will feature
performances
by several groups, old and new.
The first

44:37.141 --> 44:47.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
includes Garbage, a band formed
in Madison,
Wisconsin in 1993, Ibeyi, a
French-Cuban sister

44:47.919 --> 44:56.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
act, and Yonder Mountain String
Band.

44:56.761 --> 45:06.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are also behind-the-scenes
interviews,
and short sketches from popular
comedians

45:06.771 --> 45:08.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like Hannibal Buress.

45:08.506 --> 45:12.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANNIBAL BURESS, Comedian: Who'd
freestyle
better, Donald Trump or Hillary
Clinton?

45:12.143 --> 45:16.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The setting for
all this, the
9:30 Club in Washington, D.C.,

45:16.213 --> 45:20.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH HURWITZ, Co-Owner, 9:30
Club: When you
want is, when that band that
goes on the stage,

45:20.184 --> 45:23.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you want the band and the
audience not to
be thinking about anything else.

45:24.055 --> 45:27.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Seth Hurwitz is
the club's
co-owner, and has made it into
one of rock

45:27.925 --> 45:34.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
music's best venues. Over the
years, it's
hosted the already famous Bob
Dylan, Prince

45:34.365 --> 45:43.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Dave Grohl and those on the
rise, Sonic
Youth, Psychedelic Furs and
Fugazi, just to

45:43.774 --> 45:45.476 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
name a few.

45:45.576 --> 45:51.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Rolling Stone" magazine dubbed
it number
one big room, best sound, best
backstage.

45:51.983 --> 46:00.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And "Billboard" has named it top
club 11 times.

46:00.358 --> 46:02.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now Hurwitz wants to reach a
larger audience.

46:02.827 --> 46:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH HURWITZ: When I grew up, we
watched "The
Midnight Special" or "In
Concert," or, in

46:09.233 --> 46:11.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the old days, "American
Bandstand."

46:11.202 --> 46:14.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I really wanted an "Ed Sullivan"
kind of show,
because that was fun, right?

46:14.772 --> 46:16.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:16.674 --> 46:20.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH HURWITZ: So, we really are
curating this
for everyone. I have this
fantasy vision of

46:20.311 --> 46:25.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three generations sitting around
at the couch
because "Live at 9:30" is coming
on.

46:25.516 --> 46:30.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One performer in
the new series
is three-time Grammy winner Ben
Harper, known

46:30.421 --> 46:36.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for his mix of blues, soul,
reggae, and rock.
He's played here often with his
band Innocent

46:37.061 --> 46:38.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Criminals.

46:38.996 --> 46:44.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN HARPER, Musician: The 9:30
Club was build
to plug in and go. It's made for
modern music.

46:44.435 --> 46:46.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's not a bad seat in the
house.

46:46.637 --> 46:52.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just -- the wraparound
balcony is always
a great rush. Music-first venues
are some

46:52.476 --> 46:57.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of my favorite worldwide. You
can tell by
their archive here as well. It's
music first.

46:57.915 --> 47:02.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It represents one of the best
aspects of the
human experience. And I think
music preservation

47:03.054 --> 47:06.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is as critical a cultural
component as science.

47:07.058 --> 47:13.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: On our visit,
crews set up
for Harper's act, placing a
dozen cameras

47:13.564 --> 47:19.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the venue to create a
you-are-there
experience for the viewer.

47:19.103 --> 47:30.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the sound check, Harper
did a short
interview for the TV show. A
portion of his

47:30.548 --> 47:33.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
live show will be featured in a
coming episode.

47:33.384 --> 47:43.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB BOILEN, Author, "Your Song
Changed My
Life": This club, you talk to
any artist who

47:43.661 --> 47:45.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
comes through here, they love it
here.

47:45.763 --> 47:50.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Bob Boilen is
best known today
as host of NPR's "All Songs
Considered" and

47:50.835 --> 47:52.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"Tiny Desk Concerts."

47:52.670 --> 47:58.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also a musician, and used
to perform
at the 9:30 Club in its early
years. He's

47:58.409 --> 48:01.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
now serving as one of the
rotating hosts on
"Live At 9:30."

48:01.645 --> 48:07.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB BOILEN: A lot of people when
they have
families, for whatever reason,
they lose the

48:07.985 --> 48:14.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
thread of music that was
important to them,
because they can't get out,
everything from

48:14.759 --> 48:16.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
baby-sitters to exhaustion.

48:16.494 --> 48:20.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right. Life
happens.

48:20.331 --> 48:24.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOB BOILEN: Life. Life happens.

48:24.201 --> 48:27.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The nice thing about the show is
that you
will get a variety. You might
like three of

48:27.505 --> 48:32.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the four things, or -- and then
you get a
little mix of comedy in there.
So, you can't

48:32.610 --> 48:37.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like everything as a viewer, but
if you could
understand who these people are,
you make

48:37.348 --> 48:40.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a connection with them, even if
you don't
like the music, you understand
why they make

48:40.985 --> 48:43.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their music, why they do what
they do.

48:43.788 --> 48:49.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: More than 40
bands have already
been recorded to weave into the
series, something

48:49.560 --> 48:51.195 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for everyone.

48:51.295 --> 48:58.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Live at the 9:30 Club in
Washington, D.C.,
I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

48:58.602 --> 49:04.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The 12-episode
season will
air on PBS stations in June.
Check your local

49:04.842 --> 49:06.710 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
listings.

49:06.811 --> 49:10.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Online, Seth Hurwitz takes Jeff
to the basement
of the 9:30 Club to discuss the
early days

49:10.481 --> 49:15.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the music scene there. Plus,
we have five
tips on how to take great photos
at the next

49:15.486 --> 49:18.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
concert you attend.

49:18.923 --> 49:32.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, another
installment
in our Brief But Spectacular
series, where

49:32.203 --> 49:34.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we ask interesting people to
describe their
passions.

49:35.072 --> 49:40.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from performer
Tim Heidecker,
best known for his part in the
absurdist comedy

49:40.778 --> 49:46.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
duo of Tim &amp; Eric. His latest
record, "In
Glendale," was released last
week.

49:46.851 --> 49:50.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here he lays out why we should
pay for entertainment
we get online.

49:50.521 --> 49:54.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MDNM-TIM HEIDECKER, Performer:
Hello, friends.
My name is Tim Heidecker. You
may not know

49:54.992 --> 49:56.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me, but I'm sure you have seen
me.

49:56.961 --> 50:01.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you have ever seen the film
"Bridesmaids,"
I play the groom in the film,
very -- I think

50:02.099 --> 50:09.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have one line in the movie.

50:09.273 --> 50:14.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your kids might know me from
"Tim &amp; Eric Awesome
Show, Great Job!" and a number
of other Tim

50:14.411 --> 50:16.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
&amp; Eric related projects.

50:16.347 --> 50:24.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People describe our show as
absurd, offensive,
disgusting, anti-comedy, which
is something

50:24.154 --> 50:30.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't believe in. We're trying
to make people
laugh, and sometimes that
doesn't work out.

50:30.427 --> 50:35.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm bit of a Twitter addict. I
tend to have
this bad habit of engaging only
in people

50:35.332 --> 50:41.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that hate me and my work. I want
to take them
out for dinner and get to the
bottom of where

50:41.972 --> 50:43.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all that anger is coming from.

50:43.841 --> 50:50.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A got a tweet the other day from
a gentlemen
who said, your "Awesome Show" is
not awesome,

50:50.514 --> 50:57.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I regret having BitTorrented
it, which
is otherwise known as illegally
downloading.

50:57.888 --> 51:04.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's little bit like going
into a motorcycle
shop and stealing a motorcycle,
and driving

51:04.695 --> 51:08.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it back and saying you don't
care for the
way it hums or something,
whatever motorcycles

51:08.699 --> 51:10.601 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

51:10.701 --> 51:14.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For a lot of kids, it's so easy
to just hit
this button and you immediately
get this thing.

51:14.238 --> 51:18.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can get whatever you
want. We work
with costume designers and set
decorators

51:18.542 --> 51:24.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and cinematographers and editors
and producers,
and people that we like to pay,
because they

51:24.581 --> 51:26.383 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like to eat.

51:26.483 --> 51:31.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a trickle-down effect.
When you stop
paying for the content at the
end, you can

51:31.956 --> 51:34.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- you have to stop paying
people to make
it in the beginning.

51:34.959 --> 51:39.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you pay for something,
those people get
to have livings. And we should
support that.

51:39.797 --> 51:45.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hi. This is Tim Heidecker, and
this is my
Brief But Spectacular take on
why people should

51:45.169 --> 51:49.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pay for things. And this is not
a PBS pledge
drive.

51:49.139 --> 51:52.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be
sure to like
you on Twitter.

51:52.409 --> 51:54.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:54.278 --> 51:56.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can watch
more videos
in our Brief But Spectacular
series on our

51:56.246 --> 51:59.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Web site. That's at
PBS.org/NewsHour/Brief.

51:59.817 --> 52:04.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And next week,
Gwen Ifill
will host a "NewsHour" special
that you don't

52:04.254 --> 52:06.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
want to miss. Take a look.

52:06.557 --> 52:15.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tune in Wednesday
for a "PBS NewsHour"
special, speaking with the
president to have

52:15.399 --> 52:17.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

52:17.267 --> 52:22.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm Gwen Ifill. Join me in
Elkhart, Indiana,
for a town hall with President
Obama, from

52:22.573 --> 52:27.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the economy, to fighting terror,
to who will
succeed him in the Oval Office.
Everything

52:28.012 --> 52:33.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is on the table. That's June 1
at 8:00 p.m.,
7:00 Central, only on PBS.

52:33.751 --> 52:37.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And that's the
"NewsHour"
for tonight. I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

52:37.254 --> 52:38.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're all going
to be watching
that.

52:38.722 --> 52:40.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

52:40.657 --> 52:43.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening with Mark Shields and
David Brooks.

52:43.994 --> 53:03.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
