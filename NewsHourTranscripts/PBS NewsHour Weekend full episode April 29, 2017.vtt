ON SAVING JOBS AND BRINGING

CHANGE TO WASHINGTON.

01:13.173 --> 01:14.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE

01:14.541 --> 01:16.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN BE FOUND IN THE RELATIONSHIP

01:16.476 --> 01:18.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND THEIR

01:18.378 --> 01:19.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

01:19.446 --> 01:21.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR TOO LONG, POLITICIANS CARED

01:22.515 --> 01:24.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SUCCESSFUL FUTURE FOR ALL

01:28.121 --> 01:29.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY TOOK OUR TAXPAYERS' MONEY

01:29.956 --> 01:31.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SENT THEIR JOBS AND WEALTH

01:31.458 --> 01:32.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO OTHER COUNTRIES.

01:32.859 --> 01:34.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT ANYMORE.

01:34.794 --> 01:35.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ON THE JOB IS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND

02:07.894 --> 02:09.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFF, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

02:09.629 --> 02:11.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HERE WE ARE, 100 DAYS IN.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT YOU'VE SAID ON THIS PROGRAM

02:14.033 --> 02:14.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND YOU'VE WRITTEN THAT YOU

02:14.868 --> 02:16.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T REALLY THINK THIS 100-DAYS

02:16.469 --> 02:18.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEASUREMENT IS A VERY RELIABLE

02:18.838 --> 02:20.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY TO MEASURE A PRESIDENT.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT DIDN'T TRUMP INVITE THIS

02:22.175 --> 02:23.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEASUREMENT IN THE SPEECH HE

02:23.276 --> 02:24.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GAVE RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION

02:24.377 --> 02:26.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN GETTYSBURG?

02:26.946 --> 02:28.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES, OCTOBER 22, HE SET DOWN

02:28.848 --> 02:30.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A 100-DAY ACTION PLAN.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE LATER RELEASED A CONTRACT

02:32.085 --> 02:34.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH 28 SPECIFIC PROPOSALS

02:34.821 --> 02:35.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COVERING EVERYTHING FROM

02:35.655 --> 02:37.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGISLATION TO EXECUTIVE ORDERS

02:37.891 --> 02:39.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO APPOINTMENTS TO TREATY

02:39.392 --> 02:40.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICY.

02:40.527 --> 02:42.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IF YOU JUDGE HIM BY THAT

02:42.028 --> 02:44.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
METRIC, IT IS VERY MUCH A MIXED

02:44.564 --> 02:45.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BAG.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE DID GET A CONSERVATIVE

02:46.199 --> 02:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUSTICE NOT ONLY NOMINATED BUT

02:47.700 --> 02:48.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFIRMED.

02:48.868 --> 02:49.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PULLED OUT OF THE TRANS-PACIFIC

02:49.869 --> 02:51.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

RENEGOTIATE NAFTA, HAS PUT A

02:53.673 --> 02:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLURRY OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS OUT

02:55.975 --> 02:57.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SEVERELY CHANGE THE

02:57.644 --> 02:59.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY.

02:59.546 --> 03:00.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE OTHER HAND, ON SOME

03:00.780 --> 03:01.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUES HE'S JUST SIMPLY BACKED

03:01.981 --> 03:03.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFF; NO, CHINA IS NOT A CURRENCY

03:03.983 --> 03:05.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANIPULATOR, WHICH HE SAID HE

03:05.185 --> 03:06.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD DECLARE THEM ON DAY ONE.

03:06.653 --> 03:08.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO, NATO IS NOT OBSOLETE.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ON THE LEGISLATIVE FRONT,

03:10.089 --> 03:11.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOTHING HAS BEEN PASSED; EVEN

03:11.591 --> 03:13.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DESPERATE EFFORT TO GET SOME

03:13.092 --> 03:14.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIND OF HEALTH CARE BILL THROUGH

03:14.694 --> 03:17.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE HOUSE BEFORE 100 DAYS DIED.

03:17.797 --> 03:18.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO THE WHITE HOUSE HAS

03:18.531 --> 03:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISMISSED THIS 100-DAY

03:20.533 --> 03:21.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEASUREMENT, BUT IT'S ALSO

03:21.568 --> 03:24.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIMULTANEOUSLY CLAIMED TO HAVE

03:24.470 --> 03:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE MORE ACHIEVEMENTS THAN ANY

03:25.705 --> 03:26.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT SINCE F.D.R.

03:26.706 --> 03:27.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, IS THIS PART OF A

03:27.407 --> 03:28.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PATTERN?

03:28.474 --> 03:29.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, IT'S

03:29.509 --> 03:30.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOUBLETHINK.

03:30.076 --> 03:31.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE ONE HAND, THEY SAY-- AND

03:31.144 --> 03:31.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I HAPPEN TO THINK THEY'RE

03:31.878 --> 03:32.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT-- THIS IS A LUDICROUS

03:32.979 --> 03:34.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
METRIC; AND ON THE OTHER HAND,

03:34.180 --> 03:35.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE TRIED TO COBBLE

03:35.882 --> 03:38.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOGETHER THIS CLAIM OF A RECORD

03:38.685 --> 03:40.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SET OF ACHIEVEMENTS.

03:40.820 --> 03:41.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE KINDEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THAT

03:41.988 --> 03:43.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS OVER-REACH AND THE LESS KIND

03:43.957 --> 03:46.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY IS TO CHANNEL JOHN McENROE

03:46.192 --> 03:48.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SAY "YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS."

03:48.061 --> 03:50.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THIS POINT, BARACK OBAMA HAD

03:50.296 --> 03:51.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD HIS MASSIVE STIMULUS BILL

03:51.698 --> 03:52.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PASSED.

03:52.665 --> 03:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RONALD REAGAN'S TAX CUTS WERE

03:53.933 --> 03:54.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL ON THEIR WAY THROUGH THE

03:54.934 --> 03:56.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.

03:56.302 --> 03:58.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GEORGE W. BUSH'S TAX CUT AND

03:58.171 --> 04:00.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EDUCATION PLANS WERE, AS WELL.

04:00.206 --> 04:01.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN

04:01.441 --> 04:02.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

>> SO, GIVEN YOUR SKEPTICISM

04:12.385 --> 04:14.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT WHAT 100 DAYS CAN TELL US,

04:14.354 --> 04:16.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED?

04:16.956 --> 04:18.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, I THINK THERE ARE TWO

04:18.024 --> 04:18.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE, IN ECONOMIC TERMS, THE IDEA

04:20.827 --> 04:21.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT TRUMP WAS GOING TO BE A

04:21.894 --> 04:23.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POPULIST PRESIDENT JUST HAS TO

04:23.463 --> 04:25.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE CLEARED OFF THE BOARD.

04:25.765 --> 04:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SAID DURING THE CAMPAIGN,

04:26.833 --> 04:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"YEAH, THERE ARE GOING TO BE

04:27.800 --> 04:28.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIGHER TAXES ON THE RICH.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S GOING TO HURT ME."

04:30.370 --> 04:33.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERY PROPOSAL IN THAT ONE-PAGE

04:33.206 --> 04:35.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SET OF BULLET POINTS, POINTS THE

04:35.074 --> 04:35.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER WAY.

04:35.908 --> 04:38.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT REMAINS OF THE "POPULIST"

04:38.144 --> 04:39.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPROACH IS, FOR INSTANCE, HIS

04:39.145 --> 04:41.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTITUDE TOWARD TRADE, THOSE

04:41.147 --> 04:42.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WICKED FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT

04:42.215 --> 04:44.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE EATING OUR LUNCH, AND

04:44.951 --> 04:45.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON IMMIGRATION.

04:45.985 --> 04:47.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ON ECONOMIC GROUNDS, THIS IS

04:47.520 --> 04:48.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A CLASSIC CONSERVATIVE

04:48.888 --> 04:50.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENCY.

04:50.323 --> 04:51.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER THING I THINK WE CAN

04:51.591 --> 04:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE IS THAT THE IDEA THAT TRUMP

04:52.792 --> 04:54.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS GOING TO RADICALLY CHANGE

04:54.527 --> 04:57.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW HE DECIDES IS ALSO, I THINK,

04:57.597 --> 04:59.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A NONSTARTER.

04:59.098 --> 05:01.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS A UNIQUE PRESIDENT IN

05:01.134 --> 05:03.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERMS OF HIS SKEPTICISM ABOUT

05:03.569 --> 05:05.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DETAILED POLICY PROPOSALS, HIS

05:05.638 --> 05:07.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPATIENCE WITH DETAIL, HIS

05:07.607 --> 05:09.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELIANCE ON HIS OWN INSTINCTS,

05:09.676 --> 05:11.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW HE GATHERS INFORMATION

05:11.077 --> 05:12.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM FRIENDS ON LATE-NIGHT

05:12.145 --> 05:13.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELEPHONE CALLS AND WATCHING

05:13.980 --> 05:15.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORNING CABLE NEWS SHOWS.

05:15.481 --> 05:18.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS.

05:18.017 --> 05:19.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THOSE WHO THOUGHT,

05:19.218 --> 05:20.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"OH, WELL, THE WHITE HOUSE IS

05:20.019 --> 05:22.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS GOING TO CHANGE HIM," I DON'T

05:22.655 --> 05:23.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

05:23.589 --> 05:25.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU

05:25.258 --> 05:27.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET

05:27.093 --> 05:29.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
