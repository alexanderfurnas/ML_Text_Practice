IN KABUL, THE LINES WERE VER

05:01.667 --> 05:01.833
LONG

05:01.833 --> 05:03.500
LOTS OF MEN AND WOMEN VOTING

05:03.500 --> 05:05.167

05:06.000 --> 05:07.967
PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO VOTE.

05:07.967 --> 05:10.300
WHERE I SPENT MOST OF THE DAY,

05:10.300 --> 05:14.100
ABOUT 70 MILES SOUTH OF KABUL,

05:14.100 --> 05:15.433
THERE WERE VERY FEW VOTERS

05:39.400 --> 05:41.833
UNIVERSITY, WHO RAN IN 2009.

05:41.833 --> 05:43.767
AND I THINK AT AROUND 3% OF TH

05:43.767 --> 05:43.967
VOTE

05:43.967 --> 05:45.767
DID VERY, VERY POORLY.

05:45.767 --> 05:47.900
BUT THIS TIME HAS MANAGED TO

REALLY GALVANIZE A HUGE NUMBER

05:49.733 --> 05:51.133
OF AFGHAN VOTERS

ABDULLAH, CAME IN SECOND T

06:15.000 --> 06:15.333
KARZAI

06:15.333 --> 06:18.267

06:18.267 --> 06:21.433
PROMINENT TAJC CANDIDATE AT THIS

06:21.433 --> 06:21.767
POINT.

06:21.767 --> 06:23.667
AND IT WILL DO VERY WELL IN TH

06:23.667 --> 06:24.100
FIRST ROUND.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.267
THE QUESTION IS, IN A COUNTR

06:26.267 --> 06:28.533
WHERE THE MAJORITY OF TH

06:28.533 --> 06:31.433
POPULATION ARE ETHNIC POSH

06:31.433 --> 06:34.700

06:34.700 --> 06:35.533
ABLE TO WIN THE ELECTION

06:35.533 --> 06:36.733
THAT SEEMS UNLIKELY.

FAVORED BY KARZAI, THE ONE

06:40.333 --> 06:42.667
TRAILING IN THE POLLS, AND A

06:42.667 --> 06:43.000

PREFERENCE

06:48.833 --> 06:50.333
THERE IS WIDESPREAD PERCEPTION

06:53.033 --> 06:55.333
HIS FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER.

06:55.333 --> 06:57.333
BUT IT'S UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHA

06:57.333 --> 06:58.900
THAT PREFERENCE WOULD MEAN, IF

06:58.900 --> 07:01.400
IT, IN FACT, IS TRUE

07:01.400 --> 07:06.533
BUT RASUAL IS A FRENCH EDUCATE

07:08.567 --> 07:10.233
ACCORDING TO THE POLLS, WHICH,

07:10.233 --> 07:11.500
OF COURSE, AREN'T PRECISE IN

COMES INTO POWER, IS THERE A

07:18.500 --> 07:20.533
DIFFERENCE IN POLICY LIKELY THAT

07:20.533 --> 07:21.567
WILL KEEP U.S. TROOPS ON THE

GROUND LONGER?

07:22.633 --> 07:24.500
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN A BIT O

07:24.500 --> 07:26.867
A GUESSING GAME FROM -- AT THE

07:26.867 --> 07:28.467
U.S. EMBASSY TO FIGURE OUT WOULD

07:28.467 --> 07:29.667
THERE BE A REAL DIFFERENCE I

07:29.667 --> 07:30.833
TERMS OF THE WAY THESE GUY

07:30.833 --> 07:31.400
WOULD GOVERN

07:31.400 --> 07:33.200

U.S. AND THE INTERNATIONAL

07:35.067 --> 07:35.367
COMMUNITY.

07:35.367 --> 07:36.733
AT THIS POINT, THEY HAVE ALL

07:36.733 --> 07:37.800
SAID ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME

07:37.800 --> 07:39.633
THING, WHICH IS THAT THE

07:39.633 --> 07:40.867
UNDERSTAND THAT A GOOD

07:40.867 --> 07:42.900
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S., WITH

07:42.900 --> 07:44.900
THE WEST, IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIA

07:44.900 --> 07:46.500
TO THE FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN

07:46.500 --> 07:48.567
OF COURSE, WE HEARD HAMID KARZAI

15:02.833 --> 15:04.033
THE POTENTIAL FOR REGULATION

FREE TO GO SEE THESE PEOPLE IF

15:15.867 --> 15:18.300
THEY PREFER THAT

LIKE MYSELF WHO ARE NO
