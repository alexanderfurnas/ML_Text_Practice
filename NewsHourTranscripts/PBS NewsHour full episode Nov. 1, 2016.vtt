JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.040 --> 00:10.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: only
one week before
Election Day.

00:10.744 --> 00:16.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump campaigns in
Pennsylvania, where
his poll numbers are lagging,
while Hillary

00:16.083 --> 00:18.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton pushes for early voting
in Florida.

00:18.685 --> 00:24.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: a report from the front
lines in Iraq,
where the battle with ISIS
fighters grows

00:24.291 --> 00:29.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fierce, as government troops
close in on the
key city of Mosul.

00:29.396 --> 00:34.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the diverse state of
California, the
debate over bilingual education
challenges

00:34.701 --> 00:36.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ideas on the best way to teach
kids.

00:36.603 --> 00:40.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICIA GANDARA, University of
California,
Los Angeles: We are blessed with
this richness

00:40.073 --> 00:41.808 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of languages.

00:41.842 --> 00:46.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to not take advantage of
that, to not
let our kids have that
opportunity seems to

00:46.613 --> 00:48.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
me just a tremendous waste.

00:48.081 --> 00:50.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON UNZ, Opposes Proposition 58:
Bilingual
education doesn't work now.

00:50.617 --> 00:53.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's never worked in the past.

00:53.120 --> 01:00.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And despite its advocates'
extremism ideological
commitment to that policy, it's
just totally

01:00.093 --> 01:01.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unsuccessful.

01:01.361 --> 01:04.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:04.731 --> 01:09.002 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:09.036 --> 01:22.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're now within
the last seven
days, and some polls are
tightening in the

01:22.516 --> 01:24.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
presidential race.

01:24.384 --> 01:29.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With that in mind, the two major
candidates
hit each other hard today on
policy and morality.

01:29.489 --> 01:32.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins begins our
coverage.

01:33.026 --> 01:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: One week to go,
three new
elements today in Pennsylvania
to the look

01:40.133 --> 01:43.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and feel of Donald Trump's
sprint to Election
Day.

01:43.603 --> 01:48.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His running mate, Mike Pence,
was there, congressional
supporters were there, and his
address was

01:48.675 --> 01:54.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all policy, especially health
care, as he
pounded away at Obamacare and
its rising costs.

01:54.414 --> 01:59.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
When we win on November 8, and
elect a Republican

01:59.953 --> 02:05.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congress, we will be able to
immediately repeal
and replace Obamacare.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Have to do it.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:09.196 --> 02:15.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: I will ask
Congress to convene
a special session, so we can
repeal and replace.

02:15.802 --> 02:20.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump's
Keystone State visit
is part of a final week push in
states that

02:20.607 --> 02:25.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voted twice for Barack Obama,
including Wisconsin,
where he is tonight.

02:25.445 --> 02:31.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the campaign just announced
new ad buys
in usually dark blue Michigan
and in New Mexico,

02:31.051 --> 02:33.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which may be a late swing state.

02:33.820 --> 02:38.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is also airing
new ads in
both those states, and she's
getting back

02:38.191 --> 02:42.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the air in Colorado, where
she had not
advertised since July.

02:42.396 --> 02:48.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, she was East in Florida,
the biggest
electoral jewel of all the
battlegrounds.

02:48.869 --> 02:49.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And her focus?

02:49.870 --> 02:51.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump's character.

02:51.705 --> 02:55.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She stumped with a former Miss
Universe, Alicia
Machado, who says Trump berated
her for her

02:55.742 --> 02:57.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weight.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
He thinks belittling women makes
him a bigger

02:59.713 --> 03:01.381 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
man.

03:01.415 --> 03:04.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And Clinton's
campaign coupled
that with a new anti-Trump TV
ad.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: A person who's
flat-chested
is very hard to be a 10.

03:08.021 --> 03:08.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: Do you treat women
with respect?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I can't say that
either.

03:10.824 --> 03:14.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All this as a
flurry of new
headlines swirled around the
presidential

03:14.795 --> 03:16.563 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
race.

03:16.596 --> 03:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times reported that
Trump, back
in the 1990s, used a tax scheme
that his own

03:20.233 --> 03:24.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lawyers questioned to save tens
of millions
of dollars.

03:24.337 --> 03:29.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NBC News reported the FBI is
conducting a
preliminary inquiry into Paul
Manafort, the

03:29.376 --> 03:33.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
former Trump campaign chair, and
his foreign
business connections.

03:33.113 --> 03:38.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was ousted from the campaign
in August
amid questions over possible
ties to Russia.

03:38.652 --> 03:45.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And CNBC was first to report
that FBI Director
James Comey had argued against
naming Russia

03:45.525 --> 03:48.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the prime suspect in recent
political hacking.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He argued it was too close to
the election.

03:51.598 --> 03:56.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton's campaign called that a
double standard,
given that Comey last week
revealed the FBI

03:56.736 --> 04:01.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is looking into more e-mails
related to Clinton's
use of a private server.

04:01.608 --> 04:08.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Overall, a wild presidential
contest is ending
with a storm of news and
battleground campaigning.

04:08.148 --> 04:10.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

04:10.050 --> 04:15.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: Iraqi
troops battled to make headway
on the eastern

04:15.989 --> 04:19.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
edge of Mosul, two years after
being driven
out.

04:19.559 --> 04:24.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The military said special forces
advanced
and took a state television
building, despite

04:24.664 --> 04:27.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fierce resistance from Islamic
State fighters.

04:27.467 --> 04:31.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will get a report from the
front lines
later in the program.

04:31.538 --> 04:36.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Pakistan, the opposition
leader, Imran
Khan, backed off today from his
call for mass

04:36.910 --> 04:38.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
protests in Islamabad.

04:38.979 --> 04:43.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The demonstrations were meant to
lock down
the capital and force embattled
Prime Minister

04:43.917 --> 04:46.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nawaz Sharif to resign.

04:46.353 --> 04:50.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's under fire over his
family's offshore
bank holdings.

04:50.323 --> 04:55.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supporters rallied at Khan's
home today after
Pakistan's highest court said
that it will

04:55.228 --> 04:57.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
look into Sharif's finances.

04:57.597 --> 05:03.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IMRAN KHAN, Opposition Leader
(through translator):
Today, I was overjoyed that the
Supreme Court

05:03.770 --> 05:07.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
decided Nawaz Sharif's
accountability will
soon begin.

05:07.207 --> 05:11.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have decided that tomorrow we
will thank
God and celebrate a day of
thanks at Islamabad's

05:11.945 --> 05:13.180 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
parade ground.

05:13.213 --> 05:16.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tomorrow, God willing, we will
gather a million
people.

05:16.149 --> 05:21.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In recent days,
police have
used batons and tear gas to
enforce a ban

05:21.288 --> 05:23.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on rallies in Islamabad.

05:23.757 --> 05:29.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government of Turkey today
rejected criticism
from Europe over its crackdown
on an opposition

05:29.596 --> 05:31.398 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
newspaper.

05:31.431 --> 05:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police arrested 13 top staffers
of the paper
yesterday, and the U.S. and the
European Union

05:36.503 --> 05:38.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
condemned the move.

05:38.138 --> 05:42.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the newspaper ran a
defiant headline
-- quote -- "We will not
surrender."

05:42.976 --> 05:47.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the Turkish prime minister
shrugged it
all off in a televised address.

05:47.080 --> 05:52.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BINALI YILDIRIM, Turkish Prime
Minister (through
translator): Today, somebody
from the European

05:52.619 --> 05:56.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parliament says the detention of
journalists
from that newspaper is a red
line.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brother, we don't care about
your red line.

05:59.559 --> 06:02.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the Turkish people who draw
the red line.

06:02.329 --> 06:04.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What importance does your line
have?

06:04.264 --> 06:09.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The paper rejects
government
claims that its employees were
-- quote -- "supporting

06:09.436 --> 06:12.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terror" during last summer's
coup attempt.

06:12.572 --> 06:17.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Back in this country,
Philadelphia's public
transit workers went on strike
after failing

06:17.177 --> 06:18.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to reach a contract deal.

06:18.979 --> 06:24.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That brought bus, trolley, and
subway service
to a halt, affecting hundreds of
thousands

06:24.451 --> 06:26.286 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of riders.

06:26.319 --> 06:31.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Workers took to the picket lines
to demand
better pensions, health care and
shift scheduling.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
No new talks have been
scheduled.

06:33.960 --> 06:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks
slipped over disappointing
earnings and concerns about the
presidential

06:39.699 --> 06:41.034 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
race.

06:41.067 --> 06:46.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 105
points to close at 18037.

06:46.239 --> 06:50.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 35, and the S&amp;P
500 slid 14.

06:50.777 --> 06:56.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what we still
don't know about the candidates
one week before

06:56.449 --> 07:04.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Election Day; Iraqi forces push
into the ISIS-held
city of Mosul; the debate over
providing bilingual

07:04.224 --> 07:18.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
education in public schools; and
much more.

07:18.204 --> 07:20.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We return now to the race for
the White House.

07:20.674 --> 07:25.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's November 1, and voters who
haven't already
made a firm decision about what
they're going

07:25.945 --> 07:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do, or even if they're going
to show up
at the polls, may be looking
around for new

07:31.685 --> 07:33.453 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information.

07:33.486 --> 07:37.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, new reports have
raised questions
about Donald Trump's ties to
Russia and his

07:37.657 --> 07:39.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
business dealings.

07:39.659 --> 07:45.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, of course, Hillary
Clinton's e-mail controversy
continues to unfold, which
raises the question:

07:45.298 --> 07:49.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is known and what isn't
about both candidates?

07:49.035 --> 07:52.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even if we learn more now,
will it make
a difference?

07:52.105 --> 07:56.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're joined by Susan Page,
Washington bureau
chief for USA Today.

07:56.142 --> 08:01.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Karen Tumulty, she's
national political
correspondent for The Washington
Post.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome back to both of you.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're glad to see you as the
clock is ticking
toward this election.

08:05.952 --> 08:08.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Susan, this is an unconventional
race.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's been that way from the
beginning.

08:10.256 --> 08:15.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we get close to Election Day,
how much
is known and not known about
these two candidates?

08:15.895 --> 08:17.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How different are they in that
regard?

08:17.697 --> 08:19.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
Well, let's talk about Donald
Trump.

08:19.566 --> 08:22.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a lot of Americans feel
like they
know him pretty well because
he's been a reality

08:22.268 --> 08:23.236 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
TV star.

08:23.269 --> 08:24.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have seen him.

08:24.704 --> 08:28.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have seen stories about him
and his three
wives and his children.

08:28.441 --> 08:33.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's opaque in many of the
ways in which
we have usually expected
presidential candidates

08:33.246 --> 08:34.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be transparent.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One is on his medical history.

08:35.648 --> 08:38.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He would be the oldest president
ever elected
in our history.

08:38.518 --> 08:42.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have not seen the traditional
medical releases
that we have seen from other
presidential

08:42.889 --> 08:44.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
contenders in modern times.

08:44.691 --> 08:48.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on his finances, he's the
first major
party nominee in 40 years not to
release his

08:48.795 --> 08:50.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tax returns.

08:50.730 --> 08:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there are things about
charitable contributions
or the degree to which he is in
debt to Russian

08:54.200 --> 08:56.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interests that we don't know
about.

08:56.136 --> 09:00.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Karen, there
are big questions
still out there, and we're not
likely to know

09:00.907 --> 09:02.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the answers to all of these by
next Tuesday.

09:02.742 --> 09:05.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY, The Washington
Post: No, we're
not, but there have been news
developments

09:05.578 --> 09:10.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have sort of spoken to the
fact that
we don't have this information
or that people

09:10.817 --> 09:13.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have doubts about this
information.

09:13.286 --> 09:18.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just today, The New York Times,
getting another
leak of some partial tax
documents, did a

09:18.892 --> 09:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big story where they did a deep
dive into
the tax law and did a story
about how hard

09:26.933 --> 09:32.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump was pushing some of
the tax breaks
that were available, to the
point where his

09:32.105 --> 09:38.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own financial and legal advisers
were warning
him he was risking audits, using
parts of

09:38.711 --> 09:41.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the tax law that were later
changed.

09:41.214 --> 09:44.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Things that he did on his taxes
would be illegal
now.

09:44.884 --> 09:50.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of that I think, though, is
going to be
read by Democrats, by Clinton
supporters as

09:50.890 --> 09:55.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just reinforcing what they
already thought
they knew about, you know, his
supposed malfeasance,

09:55.895 --> 10:02.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and among his own supporters
just further
proof that he's a financial
genius.

10:02.302 --> 10:06.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, and, Susan, a
story like
that comes out, but it does
remind us we don't

10:06.973 --> 10:08.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have the tax story.

10:08.641 --> 10:12.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This took a lot of digging just
to come up
with a little bit of information
from the

10:12.145 --> 10:14.147 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1990s.

10:14.180 --> 10:17.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: And about a very
complicated equity-for-debt
swap -- don't ask me to describe
it any more

10:17.750 --> 10:21.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than that -- that Trump used.

10:21.788 --> 10:25.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's almost, though, we haven't
flip side
with Hillary Clinton, because,
with her, we

10:25.625 --> 10:26.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
know a lot about her.

10:26.826 --> 10:29.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's been in the public eye for
decades.

10:29.195 --> 10:30.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We know a lot about her
finances.

10:30.797 --> 10:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's been pretty public,
reasonably open
about her health.

10:34.400 --> 10:38.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But her own people argue that
you don't know
-- we don't know that much about
her, that

10:38.037 --> 10:43.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her personality that they
describe as warm,as
engaging is not something that I
think a lot

10:43.176 --> 10:44.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of voters have had a glimpse of.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's like we -- we can ask,
what we do
know and what we don't know?

10:47.313 --> 10:50.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's like there's a reverse when
you look
at the two of them.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's right,
Karen.

10:52.252 --> 10:55.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We may know a lot about her, but
-- we have
her tax returns, for example,
but there is

10:55.588 --> 10:57.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still the private Hillary
Clinton.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY: And what has
happened this
week, this week was a week where
the Clinton

11:00.593 --> 11:08.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign had planned to make a
big, aggressive,
positive case for her and for
her vision.

11:08.868 --> 11:15.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, instead, what they have
found themselves
involved in is yet another
revival of the

11:15.408 --> 11:20.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
e-mail controversy, this one not
involving
Hillary Clinton herself
directly, involving

11:20.547 --> 11:24.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her aide Huma Abedin and the
fact that some
more of her e-mails were found
in the most

11:24.918 --> 11:29.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unfortunate place, which is her
husband's
laptop, while he's under
investigation for

11:29.956 --> 11:33.826 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sexting a minor.

11:33.860 --> 11:38.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what that does, we don't
know what's in
those e-mails, but what it does
is stir up

11:38.731 --> 11:46.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doubts, stir up reservations
that people had
already had about Hillary
Clinton and also,

11:46.039 --> 11:50.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans are telling us, you
know, reminding
us this is what the next four to
eight years

11:50.710 --> 11:53.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are going to look like if she's
elected.

11:53.146 --> 11:56.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, meanwhile,
Susan, the
FBI, we noticed today, just
surprisingly,

11:56.583 --> 12:04.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out of the blue released
documents about their
investigation back in 19 -- in
2000, when

12:04.524 --> 12:09.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bill Clinton was leaving office
about pardoning
Marc Rich, who was this
controversial financier.

12:09.162 --> 12:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just -- it's as if everywhere
you turn, there's
a little bit of this and a
little bit of that.

12:13.199 --> 12:18.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: And there are
long-term consequences
to the very messy end we see to
this campaign.

12:18.137 --> 12:22.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The FBI, for instance, posting
these documents,
they say they were responding to
a Freedom

12:22.041 --> 12:25.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Information Act request, and
maybe that's
correct.

12:25.311 --> 12:29.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it feeds the impression that
the FBI is
becoming a very political
institution as we

12:29.949 --> 12:35.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get to the end of this election,
that they
have talked -- the FBI director,
James Comey,

12:35.121 --> 12:38.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last Friday talked about the
investigation
into Hillary Clinton's e-mails
in a way that

12:38.691 --> 12:42.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is damaging for her, has really
curtailed
some of the momentum that we
thought she had

12:42.829 --> 12:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if we had been talking a week
ago about this
campaign, but not talking in the
same public

12:47.233 --> 12:51.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way about the investigations
into Donald Trump
and possible ties to Russian
interests.

12:51.638 --> 12:54.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Karen, when
you add it
all up, when you look at these
stories -- and

12:54.607 --> 12:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we haven't even talked about the
stories in
the last few days about Donald
Trump, connections

12:58.144 --> 13:01.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Russia, his former campaign
manager, Paul
Manafort.

13:01.914 --> 13:08.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At this stage in a campaign,
historically,
how much are voters susceptible
to either

13:08.388 --> 13:11.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
changing their mind, deciding
not to vote?

13:11.124 --> 13:12.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is the information?

13:12.925 --> 13:15.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY: Well, first of
all, at this
point, over 20 million voters
have already

13:15.628 --> 13:16.596 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voted.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, their votes are in the bank.

13:19.699 --> 13:26.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But of that small population of
people who
have not yet made up their minds
between these

13:26.339 --> 13:33.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two candidates or whether they
are even going
to vote at all, history would
suggest that

13:33.046 --> 13:38.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these people are particularly
susceptible
to swinging with news
developments, swinging

13:38.051 --> 13:41.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with, you know, what's hitting
them hour by
hour.

13:41.854 --> 13:45.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: You know, the Trump
supporters
are pretty enthusiastic about
him.

13:45.191 --> 13:49.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so even if you get the
stories that we
got today about Donald Trump, I
think they're

13:49.195 --> 13:50.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unlikely to be discouraged.

13:50.930 --> 13:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton supporters, she
has some very
enthusiastic supporters, but she
has some

13:54.701 --> 13:57.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supporters that are not as
enthusiastic about
her.

13:57.136 --> 14:01.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that would include
African-Americans,
who are not as warm to her as
they were Barack

14:01.507 --> 14:05.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama, and also millennial
voters, voters
under 35, who historically have
not been very

14:06.012 --> 14:09.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reliable voters, but were an
important part
of the Obama coalition.

14:09.282 --> 14:13.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the risk for Hillary
Clinton isn't
that they will decide to vote
for Donald Trump.

14:13.319 --> 14:15.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's that they will decide not
to vote at
all.

14:15.388 --> 14:18.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY: And just as
important, down
the ballot, too.

14:18.324 --> 14:23.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A week ago, it really looked
like the Democrats
were in very good shape to take
back the Senate.

14:23.296 --> 14:29.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now some of those races are sort
of getting
closer, back in play, in part
because the

14:29.469 --> 14:33.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans are making the
argument, we need
a Republican Congress there as a
check on

14:33.673 --> 14:38.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, not just on her
agenda, but
on her administration's
behavior.

14:38.244 --> 14:41.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, it's as if
whether these
news stories change anything or
not, they

14:41.948 --> 14:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can either raise or suppress
people's interest
in this election and turning
out.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: That's right.

14:48.521 --> 14:52.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And say these developments have
kept Hillary
Clinton from having the positive
close that

14:52.291 --> 14:54.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
she thought she could have.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That could also have long-term
consequences
in whether people feel like she
has a mandate

14:57.029 --> 15:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for issues that she talked about
at the end,
when people were finally going
to the polls.

15:00.266 --> 15:03.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which is
something we're already
starting to talk about, whoever
wins this

15:03.202 --> 15:04.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
election, what happens
afterwards?

15:04.937 --> 15:06.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much of a mandate do they
have?

15:06.172 --> 15:08.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much support do they have in
the country?

15:08.841 --> 15:12.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Karen Tumulty with The
Washington Post, Susan
Page with USA Today, thank you
so much.

15:12.879 --> 15:13.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY: Thank you, Judy.

15:15.848 --> 15:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In our election
coverage online,
we visit the suburbs, long a
Republican stronghold,

15:20.453 --> 15:25.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but now trending Democratic, and
we explore
what this transformation means
for American

15:25.391 --> 15:28.928 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
politics.

15:28.961 --> 15:39.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now let's turn to an election
story at the
state level.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are important ballot
initiatives all
around the country.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we look at one of those
battles,
over bilingual education in
California.

15:50.016 --> 15:56.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 9 percent of all
students in the
United States don't speak
English fluently.

15:56.189 --> 16:02.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They struggle more in school,
trailing behind
in every academic measure and at
every grade.

16:02.528 --> 16:08.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In California, that's true for
nearly one
in every four children, or
almost 1.5 million

Special correspondent Kavitha
Cardoza with
our partner Education Week
visited California,

16:14.941 --> 16:18.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where voters will soon decide
how to best
teach these children.

16:18.911 --> 16:21.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our weekly series
Making the
Grade.

KAVITHA CARDOZA, Education Week:
At a farmers
market in San Francisco, signs
of multiculturalism

16:27.086 --> 16:33.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are everywhere, a good place to
convince citizens
to vote in favor of allowing
bilingual education

16:33.793 --> 16:34.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in California schools.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SHELLY SPIEGEL-COLEMAN,
Californians Together:
Hi.

16:36.896 --> 16:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're here with information
about Proposition
58 that's going to be on the
ballot in November.

16:40.800 --> 16:45.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Proposition 58 will do will
really put
the decision-making back into
the hands of

16:45.938 --> 16:49.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the people closest to the
students, the parents
and the schools.

16:49.308 --> 16:55.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Almost 20 years
ago, Californians
overwhelmingly voted in favor of
doing exactly

16:55.248 --> 17:00.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the opposite, voting for a
proposition which
required students who didn't
speak English

17:00.353 --> 17:04.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fluently to be taught only in
English.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Most bilingual programs closed.

17:06.592 --> 17:12.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Silicon Valley software
developer was the
architect of the successful
English-only proposition

17:12.265 --> 17:13.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
back then.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ron Unz remains opposed today.

17:15.835 --> 17:20.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're not a parent or a teacher
or a researcher.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How did this become your issue?

17:22.174 --> 17:25.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON UNZ, Opposes Proposition 58:
Well, I come
from a little bit of an
immigrant background

17:25.745 --> 17:30.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
myself, in that my mother was
born in Los
Angeles, but grew up not
speaking a word of

17:30.716 --> 17:32.184 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
English.

17:32.218 --> 17:35.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She learned English very quickly
and easily
when she started kindergarten.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that really was the same
case with many
other people she knew.

17:38.557 --> 17:42.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Unz says
learning English
quickly is key to assimilating
in the U.S.

17:43.029 --> 17:45.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON UNZ: Bilingual education
doesn't work
now.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's never worked in the past.

17:47.967 --> 17:55.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And despite its advocates'
extremism ideological
commitment to that policy, it's
just totally

17:55.107 --> 17:56.776 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unsuccessful.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: California
State Senator
Ricardo Lara agrees that
learning English

18:00.012 --> 18:01.280 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is key.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He disagrees on how to get
there.

18:03.950 --> 18:09.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among his five siblings, he and
his sister
did well in an English-only
environment.

18:09.388 --> 18:13.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His other three siblings
struggled, until
they switched to bilingual
schools.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then they began to excel
academically.

18:15.861 --> 18:19.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICARDO LARA (D), California
State Senator:
Kids learn differently, and we
all know that

18:19.465 --> 18:21.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's a fact now.

18:21.400 --> 18:26.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So why are we going to have a
one cookie-cutter,
one-size-fits-all approach to
learning English

18:26.272 --> 18:28.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in California, which is one of
the most diverse
states?

18:28.441 --> 18:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: State senator
Lara is sponsoring
Proposition 58, which will make
it easier

18:33.612 --> 18:37.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for local school districts to
expand bilingual
education.

18:37.383 --> 18:42.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says it's part of a broader
cultural shift
in the past 20 years.

18:42.388 --> 18:48.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Globalization has made knowing
more than one
language a benefit, rather than
a burden.

18:48.794 --> 18:53.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Adelante Spanish Immersion
School saw the
benefit 20 years ago.

18:53.199 --> 18:56.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They managed to keep their
bilingual programs
intact.

18:56.836 --> 19:01.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Principal Christine Hiltbrand
says much of
the demand is being driven by
middle-class,

19:02.008 --> 19:03.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
educated parents.

19:03.843 --> 19:04.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE HILTBRAND, Principal,
Adelante Spanish
Immersion School: We had about
100 kids on

19:04.310 --> 19:06.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the wait-list.

19:06.178 --> 19:09.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the district, because of
that popularity,
has opened a second Spanish
immersion school.

19:09.548 --> 19:10.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's full, too.

19:10.883 --> 19:15.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Their method is
called dual-language
immersion.

19:15.287 --> 19:19.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Half the student body speaks
English at home,
half speak Spanish.

19:19.792 --> 19:24.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In early years, children here
spend most of
their time learning all their
subjects in

19:24.964 --> 19:26.832 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Spanish.

19:26.866 --> 19:30.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gradually more classes are
taught in English,
until the fourth grade, when
they spend exactly

19:30.770 --> 19:32.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
half the time in each language.

19:32.571 --> 19:37.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Learning a second language was
hard at first,
but Arianna Baca says it gets
easier.

19:37.877 --> 19:41.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARIANNA BACA, Student: And then
I'm like,
oh, so now it's English time,
and now I speak

19:41.447 --> 19:42.415 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in English.

19:42.448 --> 19:44.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And my brain just switches off.

19:44.583 --> 19:49.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Children say
knowing two
languages is useful, even beyond
school.

19:49.422 --> 19:54.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW TINSON, Student:
Sometimes, I use Spanish
when I go to, like, a market
because, sometimes

19:54.060 --> 19:56.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people at the market, they speak
Spanish.

19:56.929 --> 20:02.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, I went to Spain, and
so everybody
there speaks Spanish, so it was
very useful.

20:02.868 --> 20:07.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARVIN GARRIDO, Student: My mom
works cleaning
houses, and sometimes she wants
to, like,

20:07.039 --> 20:10.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
send messages to her boss to
clean the house.

20:10.876 --> 20:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, she wants me to help
her to put
what to say and stuff like that.

20:15.147 --> 20:17.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Laurie Olsen is
a bilingual
advocate.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LAURIE OLSEN, Bilingual
Advocate: Proficiency
in two or more languages is
important.

20:20.419 --> 20:21.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a skill.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a high-level skill.

20:23.189 --> 20:26.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We as a society need people who
can be the
firefighters and the service
providers and

20:26.926 --> 20:32.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the doctors and the diplomats
that have the
ability to speak across
languages and communities.

20:32.131 --> 20:36.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: There's a broad
coalition
in favor of giving school
districts the option

20:36.469 --> 20:38.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of bilingual education.

20:38.037 --> 20:41.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But critics like Ron Unz remain
unconvinced.

20:41.040 --> 20:47.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON UNZ: And I think it would be
very ridiculous
for the state to consider moving
back to the

20:47.313 --> 20:52.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
old Spanish almost-only system,
or so-called
bilingual education.

20:52.918 --> 20:57.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: He points out,
after the
English-only proposition passed,
test scores

20:57.223 --> 20:58.858 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
went up.

20:58.891 --> 21:01.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that's only half the story.

21:01.260 --> 21:06.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Though there was an initial
bump, when researchers
followed these children over
time, they found,

21:06.565 --> 21:12.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by middle school, those in
English-only classes
struggled, because it's hard to
keep up with,

21:12.571 --> 21:17.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say, history or science if you
don't fully
understand what's being said.

21:17.176 --> 21:22.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Only those in bilingual classes
continued
to do well in school.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How does Adelante stack up?

21:24.984 --> 21:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Student scores are seven points
higher in
reading than the state average,
and 13 points

21:29.822 --> 21:30.789 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
higher in math.

21:30.823 --> 21:34.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And by fifth grade, children are
fully bilingual.

21:34.760 --> 21:38.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Patricia Gandara is a researcher
with the
University of California, Los
Angeles.

21:38.764 --> 21:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICIA GANDARA, University of
California,
Los Angeles: Because we now know
definitively

21:41.467 --> 21:48.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there are huge advantages,
advantages
in employment, advantages --
social advantages,

21:49.008 --> 21:51.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
psychological advantages.

21:51.277 --> 21:53.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are -- and cognitive
advantages.

21:53.112 --> 21:57.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It just seems to me to be such a
shame that
we are an immigrant country.

21:57.283 --> 21:59.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are blessed with this
richness of languages.

21:59.985 --> 22:05.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to not take advantage of
that, to not
let our kids have that
opportunity seems to

22:05.891 --> 22:11.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me just a tremendous waste, a
tremendous waste
of resources.

22:11.497 --> 22:18.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Recent polling
in California
suggests voters support more
bilingual programs.

22:18.103 --> 22:21.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Spiegel-Coleman says, 20 years
ago, attitudes
were different.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHELLY SPIEGEL-COLEMAN: We
would've gotten
dirty looks.

22:23.742 --> 22:25.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We would've been insulted.

22:25.511 --> 22:28.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People would have said things to
us like,
that's the Spanish-only program,
they should

22:28.781 --> 22:29.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be learning English.

22:29.782 --> 22:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We didn't get any of that today.

22:32.585 --> 22:38.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: She's hoping
those changed
attitudes will translate into
votes this November.

22:38.490 --> 22:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" and
Education Week,
I'm Kavitha Cardoza reporting
from San Francisco.

22:47.299 --> 22:56.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:56.208 --> 23:01.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": are
political
strategists worth the millions
they're paid?;

23:01.814 --> 23:07.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the struggle to find health
insurance coverage
for children with autism; and
why conservative

23:07.286 --> 23:13.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters in some of the states
that need federal
assistance don't trust the
government.

23:13.092 --> 23:18.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: As we reported
earlier, Iraqi troops
crossed the city limits of the
ISIS-held city

23:18.130 --> 23:20.032 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Mosul today.

23:20.065 --> 23:24.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi
said that the
militants two choices are --
quote -- "surrender

23:24.937 --> 23:26.405 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or die."

23:26.438 --> 23:31.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraqi special forces fought into
the city's
eastern outskirts at Gogjali.

23:31.110 --> 23:35.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The road there has been long and
dangerous.

23:35.214 --> 23:39.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Special correspondent
Christopher Livesay
was there as the troops moved
in.

23:39.218 --> 23:41.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he filed this report.

23:41.487 --> 23:47.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: This is the
road to Mosul,
littered with the scorched
debris of ISIS

23:47.760 --> 23:49.028 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in retreat.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But they are not going quietly.

23:50.896 --> 23:56.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sky is black with smoke
billowing from
the oil fields ISIS has set
ablaze.

23:56.068 --> 24:00.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The terror group held this
territory for more
than two years, and, in that
time, they built

24:00.472 --> 24:05.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
an elaborate industry to
manufacture IEDs
and suicide car bombs.

24:05.611 --> 24:08.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Only now can they see that up
close.

24:08.380 --> 24:14.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a suicide car that they
were in the
process of packing with TNT,
but, apparently,

24:14.219 --> 24:16.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they didn't have enough time
before the invasion
started.

24:16.188 --> 24:17.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, they had to run out.

24:17.222 --> 24:20.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's still packed with
explosives.

24:20.492 --> 24:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The suicide car bomber appeared
to have gotten
away and set off the fighting
this morning

24:25.097 --> 24:31.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Gogjali, a neighborhood in
the outskirts
of Mosul, near an army Iraq
roadblock.

24:31.337 --> 24:36.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these soldiers with a
.50-caliber machine
gun?

24:37.009 --> 24:38.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Machine gun?

24:38.110 --> 24:40.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: They were
able to stop
him.

24:40.612 --> 24:42.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the driver was still able to
detonate
his vehicle.

24:43.015 --> 24:48.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His body is now covered by
debris, his vehicle
lodged in the roadblock.

24:48.253 --> 24:55.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The forces moving on ISIS
territory are varied,
including Shia militias backed
by Iran and

24:55.861 --> 25:00.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security forces from the Kurdish
region known
as Peshmerga.

25:00.733 --> 25:04.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's the Iraq army that is
leading the
charge in Mosul proper.

25:04.703 --> 25:09.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By midday, the ISIS side of the
battlefront
was still for a moment.

25:09.475 --> 25:14.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these terrified civilians
saw their chance
to flee the Islamic State after
two years

25:14.713 --> 25:16.115 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of captivity.

25:16.148 --> 25:18.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are the lucky ones.

25:18.050 --> 25:23.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reports are mounting of ISIS
rounding up locals
by the thousands to use as human
shields inside

25:23.622 --> 25:24.857 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mosul.

25:24.890 --> 25:28.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One mother didn't even have time
to stop and
give her name.

25:28.093 --> 25:32.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): The
last time
we tried to run away, they shot
at us.

25:32.931 --> 25:35.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This time, we had to stay very
low, so they
couldn't hit us.

25:35.901 --> 25:37.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today was the first chance that
we had.

25:37.770 --> 25:42.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: We found
this 20-year-old
shepherd fleeing east with his
flock, searching

25:42.674 --> 25:45.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for shelter in hastily built
refugee camps.

25:45.911 --> 25:50.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said ISIS wouldn't allow him
to attend
school and punished him for
breaking strict

25:50.883 --> 25:52.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Islamic dress codes.

25:52.551 --> 25:57.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
spent five days
in jail for wearing long pants.

25:57.523 --> 25:59.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They beat me in there, lashed
me.

25:59.992 --> 26:03.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now I know I'm in a safe place,
thank God.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: But the
relief is bittersweet.

26:04.930 --> 26:09.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had to leave behind his
parents, brothers
and sisters.

26:09.601 --> 26:14.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just when the coast looked
clear, ISIS proved
it wasn't giving up without a
fight.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(GUNFIRE)

26:15.607 --> 26:18.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: Gunfire
cracks all around.

26:18.143 --> 26:21.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At least one Iraqi soldier is
shot dead.

26:21.413 --> 26:26.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Iraqi special forces are
quick to rally
and return fire on virtually
every building

26:26.885 --> 26:29.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lining this road that leads to
the heart of
Mosul.

26:29.822 --> 26:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We are
waiting to
go inside the city of Mosul.

26:34.059 --> 26:36.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mosul is our land.

26:36.328 --> 26:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will enter in three or four
days.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
God willing, we will fly our
flag on the city.

26:40.933 --> 26:45.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: But the
violence shows
no signs of ceasing, as troops
move deeper

26:45.671 --> 26:51.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into Mosul, and there is no
telling how long
the city's total liberation will
take.

26:51.577 --> 27:01.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Christopher Livesay
in Gogjali, Iraq.

27:01.186 --> 27:11.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Regardless of the
outcome on
Election Day, political
scientists have already

27:11.797 --> 27:15.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
begun studying this
groundbreaking campaign.

27:15.100 --> 27:19.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One tantalizing subject: the
true value of
political consultants.

27:19.605 --> 27:23.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are they worth the millions they
charge politicians
each year?

27:23.475 --> 27:28.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Atlantic" magazine writer Molly
Ball explores
this question in her article,
"There's Nothing

27:28.380 --> 27:31.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Better Than a Scared, Rich
Candidate."

27:31.984 --> 27:33.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What a great quote.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.052 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

27:34.086 --> 27:36.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOLLY BALL, "The Atlantic": Yes.

27:36.054 --> 27:38.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is a quotation from a book
by a political
scientist about the political
consulting industry.

27:38.557 --> 27:44.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's something that a
consultant said
to him that just really summed
up what I was

27:44.296 --> 27:48.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting at with this article,
which was kind
of asking the question, is this
all a con

27:48.867 --> 27:51.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
game, this political consulting
racket?

27:51.303 --> 27:54.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Candidates are spending billions
of dollars,
and what are they really getting
for it?

27:54.706 --> 27:56.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or is it just the consultants
lining their
pockets?

27:56.975 --> 28:02.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, this is a
question that
has been asked for some time,
but it comes

28:02.247 --> 28:04.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into particular relief this
year, doesn't
it?

28:04.783 --> 28:06.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOLLY BALL: That's right.

28:06.585 --> 28:10.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, first of all, look at
what happened
particularly in the Republican
primaries.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You had the two extremes.

28:12.257 --> 28:17.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You had Jeb Bush spent $130
million, end up
with four delegates.

28:17.829 --> 28:21.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Former Florida
Governor: I'm
Jeb Bush, and I approve this
message.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOLLY BALL: Donald Trump spent
almost nothing.

28:23.835 --> 28:26.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I'm not doing that to brag,
because you know

28:26.838 --> 28:27.806 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
what?

28:27.839 --> 28:28.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't have to brag.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't have to, believe it or
not.

28:30.742 --> 28:33.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOLLY BALL: Had no experienced
consultants
on his staff, nobody who'd ever
run a presidential

28:33.078 --> 28:39.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign before, and barely
advertised on
television, didn't do any of the
tactical

28:39.318 --> 28:43.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stuff we're used to and we write
about so
much, building of field
operation and having

28:43.956 --> 28:47.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a communications shop and all of
that stuff.

28:47.392 --> 28:48.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he won the whole thing.

28:48.694 --> 28:53.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I humbly and
gratefully accept
your nomination.

28:53.332 --> 28:54.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

28:54.833 --> 28:58.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOLLY BALL: So, the question is,
does that
mean the emperor has no clothes?

28:58.136 --> 29:04.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does that mean that all this
spending -- there's
more money in politics than ever
before.

29:04.142 --> 29:09.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because of the way campaign
finance has been
deregulated, donor money is
pouring into the

29:09.114 --> 29:10.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political process.

29:10.315 --> 29:15.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's, by one estimate, $6
billion this
year alone.

29:15.153 --> 29:18.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where is all that money going,
what is it
doing, and is it having any
effect?

29:18.824 --> 29:24.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you spent
time talking
with one of the people who was
key in the

29:24.296 --> 29:30.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeb Bush campaign, Mike Murphy,
somebody who's
been around for a while in
American Republican

29:30.302 --> 29:32.004 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
politics.

29:32.037 --> 29:39.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what did you find from
talking to him
about what the plan was and how
he saw his

29:39.811 --> 29:41.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ability to shape the campaign?

29:41.113 --> 29:42.614 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MOLLY BALL: Yes.

29:42.648 --> 29:45.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I want to make it clear
that I'm not
really picking on Mike Murphy.

29:45.751 --> 29:49.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's just an exemplar of this
phenomenon.

29:49.254 --> 29:55.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's a pretty perfect
example of a campaign
that spent a lot of money, had a
very professional

29:55.527 --> 29:59.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
staff, and didn't achieve any
results.

29:59.131 --> 30:03.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Murphy's explanation was,
this just wasn't
the year for a candidate like
Jeb Bush.

30:03.969 --> 30:08.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's certainly
true in retrospect,
in hindsight.

30:08.674 --> 30:13.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he said that, we had to have
all that
money because it was the only
way we could

30:13.779 --> 30:17.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have gone against the headwinds
we were facing.

30:17.949 --> 30:26.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And nobody could have
anticipated the magnitude
of the electorate's appetite for
what he terms

30:26.758 --> 30:28.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a grievance candidate.

30:28.627 --> 30:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, the donors that I
spoke to,
the people who were giving Jeb
Bush $100 million,

30:35.400 --> 30:37.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they expect the consultants to
see those things.

30:37.469 --> 30:41.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For all the
controversy, the
questions around political
consultants, some

30:41.206 --> 30:48.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them have achieved near
mythic status,
James Carville from the Bill
Clinton campaign

30:48.280 --> 30:53.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of years ago, Karl Rove from
George W. Bush's
campaign.

30:53.985 --> 30:57.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They really helped make these
candidates who
they were, didn't they?

30:57.823 --> 31:03.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOLLY BALL: This is really a
modern phenomenon
of the consultants as a
celebrity in his or

31:03.862 --> 31:05.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her own right.

31:05.731 --> 31:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Political consulting gets
started back in
the 1930s, but they were really
sort of anonymous

31:09.434 --> 31:12.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
figures until really in the
1990s.

31:12.904 --> 31:18.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Political journalism really
started focusing
on these sort of Oz-like
figures, right, the

31:18.210 --> 31:20.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
man behind the curtain pulling
the strings.

31:20.445 --> 31:23.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, Political
Consultant:
I just took it as a good sign,
because I don't

31:23.682 --> 31:25.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think they would call back if
they weren't
considering.

31:25.617 --> 31:29.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOLLY BALL: And so you do have
-- you know,
you have the documentary "The
War Room" about

31:29.054 --> 31:31.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
James Carville and George
Stephanopoulos in
the '90s.

31:31.123 --> 31:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CARVILLE, Political
Consultant: It's
going to come out that Roger
Ailes is behind

31:33.759 --> 31:35.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot of this stuff before an
election.

31:35.761 --> 31:39.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOLLY BALL: Those men are now
famous in their
own right.

31:39.464 --> 31:43.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Karl Rove was supposedly George
W. Bush's
brain, right?

31:43.869 --> 31:49.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bush is, in this scenario, sort
of a hapless
pawn, and Rove is calling all
the shots.

31:49.441 --> 31:58.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, part of why we
turn consultants
into heroes like this is because
partisans,

31:58.216 --> 32:04.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particularly on the losing side,
want to believe
that there was some kind of
hidden genius.

32:04.890 --> 32:09.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It wasn't that their candidate
wasn't good
enough and people didn't like
what they were

32:09.694 --> 32:11.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
offering, and voters rejected
them.

32:11.663 --> 32:16.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's that there was this, you
know, sinister
Svengali on the other side who
had some kind

32:16.601 --> 32:19.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of magical ability to control
the electorate.

32:19.337 --> 32:24.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it possible to
know how
much of a campaign and a
candidate's performance

32:24.943 --> 32:30.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a campaign is thanks to the
consultant
and how much of it is the
candidate himself

32:30.248 --> 32:31.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or herself?

32:31.249 --> 32:33.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOLLY BALL: It's very difficult.

32:33.084 --> 32:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, political scientists
actually love
the Donald Trump campaign,
because it's sort

32:36.822 --> 32:39.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a control for the experiment,
right?

32:39.424 --> 32:44.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because there has been so little
consultant
input to Donald Trump's
presentation, you

32:44.095 --> 32:49.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can sort of isolate the effect
of a candidate
on his own with his particular
charisma and

32:49.367 --> 32:53.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no particular shaping or help,
at least until
the very late stages of his
campaign.

32:53.839 --> 32:57.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in general, political
scientists have
been studying this for decades.

32:57.709 --> 33:04.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A real landmark of this type of
study was
done when Rick Perry was running
for governor

33:04.249 --> 33:10.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Texas in 2010, and the
consultants running
his campaign actually allowed a
group of political

33:10.889 --> 33:16.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scientists to run a randomized
controlled
experiment, where they ran ads
in one part

33:16.728 --> 33:17.696 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Texas.

33:17.729 --> 33:18.697 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

33:18.730 --> 33:19.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICK PERRY (R), Texas: I'm proud
of Texas.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.299 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How about you?

33:21.333 --> 33:25.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOLLY BALL: They didn't run any
ads in the
other part of Texas.

33:25.203 --> 33:29.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these were pretty similar
populations,
so they could really see, what
was the effect?

33:29.574 --> 33:34.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much did people in this part
of Texas
like Rick Perry more, having
seen his ads,

33:34.212 --> 33:36.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vs. the people in this other
place?

33:36.648 --> 33:39.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they did find there was a
small effect,
about five points.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it was gone within a week.

33:42.354 --> 33:48.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And yet certain
political ads
are seared in our collective
memory as game-changers,

33:48.526 --> 33:55.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
such as the so called "Daisy" ad
Lyndon Johnson
ran against Barry Goldwater in
1964.

33:55.300 --> 33:59.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Two, one, zero.

33:59.204 --> 34:04.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Or the
windsurfing ad run against
John Kerry in 2004.

34:04.743 --> 34:07.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: John Kerry, whichever
way the wind
blows.

34:07.746 --> 34:13.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOLLY BALL: What the consultants
will tell
you is that the kind of
mythmaking that we

34:13.818 --> 34:19.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
journalists engage in, where we
say, this
ad was the turning point, that's
basically

34:19.157 --> 34:20.959 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
false.

34:20.992 --> 34:24.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the fundamental factors
driving the
electorate that led to one
candidate winning

34:24.963 --> 34:26.965 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or losing.

34:26.998 --> 34:31.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Kerry, according to the
political consultants,
was almost certainly going to
lose that election

34:31.369 --> 34:35.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anyway, given the makeup of the
race, being
up against an incumbent, the
economy doing

34:35.373 --> 34:37.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
how it was doing.

34:37.642 --> 34:41.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And LBJ almost certainly would
have won that
election without the "Daisy" ad.

34:41.746 --> 34:46.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did you come away
with a sense
of what tactics can work and
which ones are

34:46.918 --> 34:50.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
increasingly not shown to be
effective?

34:50.755 --> 34:57.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOLLY BALL: You do see an
increasing emphasis
on field organizing, as opposed
to advertising.

34:57.529 --> 35:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see this with labor and with
particularly
Democratic presidential
campaigns.

35:01.366 --> 35:05.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there is a much more
conclusive evidence
in the political science
literature that this

35:05.837 --> 35:08.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of thing actually works.

35:08.239 --> 35:13.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama campaign really
pioneered this model
of intensive field organizing,
hundreds of

35:13.578 --> 35:15.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign offices all over the
country.

35:15.613 --> 35:20.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you need a candidate who's
compelling
enough to attract a lot of
volunteers to make

35:20.685 --> 35:21.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an effort like that work.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can't just pay for it all.

35:23.421 --> 35:29.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To what extent
are these consultants
doing this to make money?

35:29.828 --> 35:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much do they really care
about what happens
in the political process?

35:32.931 --> 35:35.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are they committed to a
particular ideology?

35:35.266 --> 35:41.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOLLY BALL: Well, I attended the
convention
of the American Association of
Political Consultants.

35:41.306 --> 35:44.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the consultants will tell
you that they
are in this because they want to
make the

35:44.809 --> 35:46.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
world a better place.

35:46.344 --> 35:47.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most of them only work for one
side.

35:47.812 --> 35:51.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're either a Democratic
consultant or
a Republican consultant.

35:51.149 --> 35:54.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they're trying to advance
this vision
of the world, trying to achieve
changes in

35:55.020 --> 35:57.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
policy by helping candidates get
elected.

35:58.023 --> 36:00.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they will admit they also
have to make
a living.

36:00.458 --> 36:02.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: It's me, candidate for
president.

36:03.028 --> 36:08.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At this
conference you covered,
they showed a generic political
ad.

36:08.466 --> 36:11.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Talk about what was in that ad
and what the
reaction was.

36:11.302 --> 36:13.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOLLY BALL: This was a pretty
incredible video.

36:13.738 --> 36:15.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was completely generic.

36:15.874 --> 36:20.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a sort of generic white
man walking
through a generic field, and
there's images

36:20.111 --> 36:26.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of American flags, welders in a
factory, all
of the things that might come to
mind when

36:26.217 --> 36:29.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you imagine a generic political
ad.

36:29.220 --> 36:35.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the message it was sending
was, these
candidates are just someone that
the consultant

36:35.560 --> 36:39.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sticks in there to read the
script, and they
could all pretty much be saying
the same thing.

36:39.431 --> 36:40.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're all pretty much
interchangeable.

36:40.732 --> 36:43.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: I'm a candidate for
president, and I
endorse this message.

36:43.768 --> 36:46.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which is enough
to make one
pretty cynical about this.

36:46.104 --> 36:47.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOLLY BALL: I think it is.

36:47.939 --> 36:51.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that this actually
goes some way
to explaining the appeal of
Donald Trump to

36:51.276 --> 36:52.744 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so many voters.

36:52.777 --> 36:56.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is not someone who seems like
someone is
managing him, to put it lightly.

36:56.648 --> 37:02.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He seems utterly authentic in a
way that is
frequently offensive, but he
comes across

37:02.454 --> 37:04.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as unfiltered.

37:04.255 --> 37:08.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, in some ways, the
attraction
of a candidate like that is, in
part, voters'

37:08.326 --> 37:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reaction to the influence of
consultants and
how choreographed and how stale
and how totally

37:15.934 --> 37:21.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
staged and scripted so much of
our political
process has come to feel,
because it has become

37:21.473 --> 37:28.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so homogenized by the influence
of consulting.

37:28.580 --> 37:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today is the
first day of enrollment
for 2017 under the Affordable
Care Act, otherwise

37:42.127 --> 37:44.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
known as Obamacare.

37:44.162 --> 37:49.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for some people who have
health insurance,
getting appropriate coverage can
be a challenge.

37:49.901 --> 37:55.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 43 million Americans
suffer from
depression, anxiety or other
mental health

37:55.473 --> 38:00.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues, but more than half never
get help,
even people who have health
insurance.

38:00.945 --> 38:08.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From PBS station KQED in San
Francisco, reporter
April Dembosky and producer
Sheraz Sadiq bring

38:08.319 --> 38:13.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us a story of a single mother
struggling to
use her benefits to get
treatment for herself

38:13.992 --> 38:16.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and her son with autism.

38:16.127 --> 38:21.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL DEMBOSKY: On a Sunday
afternoon, Natalie
Dunnege and her boyfriend,
Russell Lifson,

38:21.833 --> 38:25.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
head to the park with Natalie's
13-year-old
son, Strazh.

38:25.737 --> 38:28.173 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Let's go.

38:28.206 --> 38:36.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL DEMBOSKY: He has autism, a
developmental
disorder that affects about one
in 70 children

38:36.114 --> 38:37.815 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the U.S.

38:37.849 --> 38:41.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STRAZH, Autistic: You have
strengths on one
side of your brain and
weaknesses on your

38:41.219 --> 38:46.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other side, like, you know,
controlling your
emotions or this and that, you
know?

38:46.991 --> 38:52.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Strengths could be like coding
or, you know,
focusing on one thing for hours.

38:52.730 --> 38:58.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL DEMBOSKY: Each week, an
applied behavioral
analysis, or ABA, therapist
comes to the house.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Are you ready?

39:00.338 --> 39:04.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL DEMBOSKY: ABA therapy
helps kids with
autism learn life skills and how
to control

39:04.809 --> 39:06.678 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their temper.

39:06.711 --> 39:11.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Strazh and his therapist, Gabby
Raders (ph),
create a schedule of carefully
timed activities,

39:11.649 --> 39:13.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so he can get better at
transitions.

39:13.651 --> 39:19.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STRAZH: This is the I.D., right,
the identification
with the enemy.

39:19.857 --> 39:23.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the width, height, speed
X and speed
Y.

39:23.995 --> 39:27.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
APRIL DEMBOSKY: Ending a
favorite activity
can trigger a meltdown.

39:27.832 --> 39:30.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STRAZH: I can't do it.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.870 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No, I can't.

39:32.904 --> 39:42.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIE DUNNEGE, Mother of
Strazh: ABA therapy
has helped my relationship with
Strazh tremendously.

39:42.080 --> 39:47.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's taught me how to
communicate with him,
when to back away, when to come
in and help.

39:47.819 --> 39:51.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL DEMBOSKY: As a single mom
working full-time,
money is tight for Natalie.

39:51.789 --> 39:54.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She can only afford a few hours
of ABA therapy
a week.

39:54.559 --> 39:59.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIE DUNNEGE: I want my son
to be as successful
as possible, so every time I get
a raise,

39:59.631 --> 40:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I just increase ABA hours.

40:02.100 --> 40:05.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
APRIL DEMBOSKY: She has
insurance through
Blue Shield.

40:05.069 --> 40:08.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But getting mental health
treatment has been
really tough.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NATALIE DUNNEGE: So, I went on
the site.

40:10.074 --> 40:14.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you can see it says,
like, doctors,
facilities, dentists, nothing
about where

40:14.979 --> 40:16.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to find a therapist.

40:16.214 --> 40:19.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I called them, and they e-mailed
me a list
of providers.

40:19.550 --> 40:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
APRIL DEMBOSKY: Oh, so this is
the list?

40:21.286 --> 40:22.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NATALIE DUNNEGE: Mm-hmm.

40:22.287 --> 40:23.254 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

40:23.288 --> 40:26.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They all have a three-month
waiting list.

40:26.457 --> 40:31.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, after the three-month
waiting list,
you have, like, two to eight
weeks of intake.

40:31.796 --> 40:34.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then hopefully you get
approved.

40:34.365 --> 40:40.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL DEMBOSKY: So, she pays $50
an hour,
out of her own pocket, for her
son's therapy.

40:40.605 --> 40:44.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now she's facing similar
hurdles finding
a therapist for herself.

40:44.208 --> 40:49.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIE DUNNEGE: Blue Shield
sent me a list,
like, I should be fine, just
make a few phone

40:49.113 --> 40:51.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
calls, I will find somebody.

40:51.082 --> 40:54.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I called everybody on this list.

40:54.719 --> 40:56.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Only one place called me back.

40:56.721 --> 41:05.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have to be as emotionally
healthy as possible,
so that I can be there for
Strazh, because

41:05.229 --> 41:07.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he has good weeks and he has bad
weeks.

41:07.332 --> 41:11.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL DEMBOSKY: Turns out that
Natalie's experience
is by no means unique.

41:11.703 --> 41:16.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I called 100 psychologists in
San Francisco
who take Natalie's insurance.

41:16.674 --> 41:22.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm wondering if you are indeed
taking new
patients with Blue Shield
coverage?

41:22.113 --> 41:26.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Half said they're no longer
taking insurance
or new patients, and a quarter
never even

41:26.484 --> 41:27.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
called back.

41:27.552 --> 41:29.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thanks so much.

41:29.053 --> 41:30.321 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Bye-bye.

41:30.355 --> 41:32.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Only eight had appointments
outside of normal
work hours.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I contacted Blue Shield for an
interview,
but they declined.

41:35.960 --> 41:40.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, they sent a statement
saying that
the provider has to notify Blue
Shield if

41:40.431 --> 41:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're no longer taking new
patients.

41:42.066 --> 41:46.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also said California is
facing a shortage
of mental health providers.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.106 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

41:48.139 --> 41:48.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHERINE HOPMAN, Psychologist:
Insurance
companies are saying that
there's a shortage

41:48.840 --> 41:50.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of mental health providers?

41:50.274 --> 41:52.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's hard for me to believe.

41:52.110 --> 41:55.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have many colleagues who are
trying to get
onto panels.

41:55.747 --> 42:00.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they run into the problem,
again and again,
where panels say, sorry, we're
closed.

42:00.418 --> 42:02.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have enough providers in your
area.

42:02.220 --> 42:07.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL DEMBOSKY: Dr. Hopman is a
psychologist
who accepts a variety of
insurance plans.

42:07.258 --> 42:10.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She can get up to 20 calls a
week from people
asking for her help.

42:10.428 --> 42:11.396 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

42:11.429 --> 42:13.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CATHERINE HOPMAN: It makes me
really angry.

42:13.297 --> 42:17.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It really is upsetting, and it
makes me wonder,
what are the insurance panels
doing and why

42:17.769 --> 42:21.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are they limiting how many
therapists they
take on onto their panels?

42:21.973 --> 42:25.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL DEMBOSKY: Why do you think
they might
be limiting the number of
therapists?

42:25.343 --> 42:27.245 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

42:27.278 --> 42:30.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHERINE HOPMAN: If you make
things too difficult
to access, then patients will
stop trying

42:30.748 --> 42:34.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to seek the therapy and the
treatment that
they need.

42:34.886 --> 42:38.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I guess part of me thinks
that that's
probably a good thing for the
insurance companies.

42:38.923 --> 42:43.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
APRIL DEMBOSKY: Another
difficulty patients
face is outdated or missing
information about

42:43.895 --> 42:45.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a therapist's specialty.

42:45.096 --> 42:46.898 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

42:46.931 --> 42:49.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHERINE HOPMAN: So, for
instance, if I need
a cardiologist for a heart
problem, and I

42:49.767 --> 42:54.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just get a list of all M.D.s
that are on my
health insurance panel, I'm not
going to know

42:54.839 --> 42:59.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who to call about my particular
issue that
I'm needing help with.

42:59.310 --> 43:03.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL DEMBOSKY: Many therapists
complain that
reimbursement rates are too low.

43:03.114 --> 43:04.916 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

43:04.949 --> 43:08.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHERINE HOPMAN: Over the past
18 years of
being on their panels, they have
not increased

43:08.920 --> 43:11.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their reimbursement rates.

43:11.255 --> 43:15.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet the co-pays and premiums
are increasing
for most of my patients.

43:15.493 --> 43:20.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL DEMBOSKY: Under state and
federal laws,
insurance plans must cover
mental health services

43:20.865 --> 43:23.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
equally compared to other forms
of care.

43:23.334 --> 43:28.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But millions of patients across
the country
like Natalie Dunnege and her son
Strazh still

43:29.006 --> 43:30.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
struggle to get the help they
need.

43:30.875 --> 43:32.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: We're almost done with
this.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I like that.

43:34.278 --> 43:38.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NATALIE DUNNEGE: Getting
services through
my plan, the hardest one by far
is getting

43:38.616 --> 43:40.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mental health services.

43:40.718 --> 43:42.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's nothing more difficult.

43:42.854 --> 43:45.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I needed to find a doctor.

43:46.023 --> 43:48.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I found one instantly.

43:48.125 --> 43:58.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But mental health, behavioral
health, psychiatrists,
to have that be even harder,
it's almost unbearable

43:58.402 --> 43:59.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sometimes.

43:59.370 --> 44:00.872 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Good night.

44:00.905 --> 44:10.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL DEMBOSKY: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
April Dembosky in San Francisco.

44:10.481 --> 44:20.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now back to the
campaign and
to the latest edition in our
Political Ink

44:20.525 --> 44:26.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now back to the
campaign and
to the latest edition in our
Political Ink

44:26.364 --> 44:28.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
series.

44:28.232 --> 44:32.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We look at what is behind some
of the underlying
anger that has permeated this
election.

44:32.637 --> 44:34.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown is in charge.

44:34.472 --> 44:38.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From Berkeley,
California,
to the Louisiana bayou country,
several thousand

44:38.676 --> 44:41.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
miles and a deep political and
cultural divide.

44:41.746 --> 44:46.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the new book "Strangers in
Their Own Land:
Anger and Mourning on the
American Right,"

44:46.083 --> 44:50.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Berkeley sociologist Arlie
Russell Hochschild
draws a portrait of that divide
through the

44:50.755 --> 44:54.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lives of people in and around
Lake Charles,
Louisiana.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the book has just been
nominated for a
National Book Award.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, welcome and congratulations.

44:58.529 --> 44:59.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARLIE RUSSELL HOCHSCHILD,
Author, "Strangers
in Their Own Land: Anger and
Mourning on the

44:59.196 --> 45:00.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
American Right": Thank you.

45:01.032 --> 45:02.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You start by
writing that you
were looking for an answer to a
great paradox

45:02.133 --> 45:04.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in American political life.

45:04.502 --> 45:06.304 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Explain that.

45:06.337 --> 45:10.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARLIE RUSSELL HOCHSCHILD: And
that is that
the red states are states with a
lot of needs,

45:10.041 --> 45:13.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
needs for their schools, needs
for their health.

45:13.144 --> 45:18.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have lower life expectancy,
more disruptive
families.

45:18.883 --> 45:24.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They depend more on the federal
government
than blue states.

45:24.755 --> 45:30.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they resist and distrust the
federal government
more.

45:30.494 --> 45:37.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Louisiana seemed to
exaggerate that, as
the poorest state, as receiving
44 percent

45:37.501 --> 45:42.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of its state budget from the
federal government,
and being overwhelmingly very
conservative.

45:42.340 --> 45:46.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you -- and
you're clear
throughout this book you're
coming from not

45:46.544 --> 45:50.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only a blue state, but a capital
of blue culture,
right, from Berkeley,
California.

45:50.715 --> 45:54.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you're coming as an outsider
to see what?

45:54.285 --> 46:01.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARLIE RUSSELL HOCHSCHILD: To
take my own alarm
system off and to try and cross
an empathy

46:01.325 --> 46:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wall and to really understand
mainly why it
is people feel so negatively
about the federal

46:08.866 --> 46:10.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

46:10.801 --> 46:15.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, your way in
is through
the environment, environmental
damage, well-documented

46:15.940 --> 46:16.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Louisiana.

46:16.941 --> 46:18.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARLIE RUSSELL HOCHSCHILD: That's
right.

46:18.776 --> 46:21.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But the people
that you're
talking to, they don't see
government as the

46:21.879 --> 46:23.381 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
answer.

46:23.414 --> 46:26.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You see, coming from the outside
-- you would
imagine that they would.

46:26.450 --> 46:27.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARLIE RUSSELL HOCHSCHILD: Right.

46:27.451 --> 46:28.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would imagine that they would.

46:28.686 --> 46:32.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they are victims of
tremendous pollution.

46:32.857 --> 46:37.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are different reasons why
they don't
like the federal government.

46:37.728 --> 46:44.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is, they think of the
federal government
as the finger-wagging North,
always with its

46:44.201 --> 46:45.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
moral judgment.

46:45.302 --> 46:46.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There's much
history there,
yes.

46:46.804 --> 46:48.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARLIE RUSSELL HOCHSCHILD: Much
history.

46:48.572 --> 46:57.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second is, they see the
companies as the
givers of jobs and gifts, gifts
which the

46:57.348 --> 47:05.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
company can afford because the
state is giving
it $1.5 billion.

47:05.089 --> 47:08.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's given to the Audubon
Society and various
things.

47:08.659 --> 47:16.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the state looks -- the
company looks very
generous, and the state doesn't
really regulate

47:16.767 --> 47:18.636 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the polluters.

47:18.669 --> 47:22.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so victims of the pollution
blame the
state.

47:23.007 --> 47:27.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, and, in
fact, as they
tell you over and over again,
the evidence

47:27.044 --> 47:29.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they see is that they have not
been benefited.

47:29.146 --> 47:31.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, why would they look to
government for
more regulation?

47:31.882 --> 47:36.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARLIE RUSSELL HOCHSCHILD: I
understand that,
actually, in a way I didn't when
I set out.

47:36.987 --> 47:46.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I feel like the companies
are making the
state do the moral dirty work of
not -- promising

47:46.864 --> 47:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to protect, but not protecting.

47:49.533 --> 47:55.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's another reason that
I think that
they don't trust the government.

47:55.039 --> 48:02.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They see it as an instrument of
their own
marginalization, because they
feel especially

48:02.847 --> 48:10.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic administrations have
favored blacks,
women, immigrants, refugees.

48:10.955 --> 48:17.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all of these groups, they
see as getting
ahead of them, as almost like
line-cutters,

48:17.495 --> 48:19.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pushing them back in line.

48:19.330 --> 48:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I know you
started this several
years ago, but, of course, here
we are in

48:22.733 --> 48:25.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the middle of a campaign.

48:25.336 --> 48:29.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does Donald Trump offer?

48:29.373 --> 48:31.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do they see in him?

48:31.242 --> 48:35.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARLIE RUSSELL HOCHSCHILD: I feel
as if I had
studied for four years the
kindling, and then,

48:35.980 --> 48:43.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when I went to see Donald Trump
in his primary
rally in New Orleans, I saw the
match that

48:43.154 --> 48:44.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lit the kindling.

48:44.955 --> 48:53.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They see in him someone who
recognizes their
sense of loss and discouragement
and someone

48:53.531 --> 48:58.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who is going to rescue them,
almost in a secular
rapture.

48:58.035 --> 49:03.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, where does
this all leave
you, personally and in thinking
about the

49:03.307 --> 49:04.975 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country?

49:05.009 --> 49:10.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARLIE RUSSELL HOCHSCHILD: I
think it leads
me to realize that we have a job
to do to

49:10.181 --> 49:17.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heal this big divide, and that
it's a very
important thing for us to do it
at this political

49:17.488 --> 49:18.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
moment, and that...

49:18.889 --> 49:19.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Is it doable?

49:19.890 --> 49:21.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARLIE RUSSELL HOCHSCHILD: It is
doable.

49:21.425 --> 49:28.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It leaves me optimistic,
because, for example,
there are crossover issues.

49:28.933 --> 49:32.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I heard many people say, let's
get money out
of politics.

49:32.036 --> 49:35.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought, well, the two sides
can agree on
that.

49:35.840 --> 49:39.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And let's clean up this
environment for real.

49:39.910 --> 49:42.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And two sides can agree on that.

49:42.546 --> 49:45.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's lower prison populations.

49:45.716 --> 49:47.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Two sides can agree on that.

49:47.585 --> 49:51.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's stop insulting each other
and really
get to know people.

49:51.522 --> 49:56.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, have a few beers and go
on a fishing
trip, and you will find a friend
who won't

49:57.027 --> 50:01.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see the world the way you do,
but where you
can have a really good
conversation about

50:01.098 --> 50:02.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

50:02.366 --> 50:04.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The book is
"Strangers in Their
Own Land."

50:04.034 --> 50:08.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Arlie Russell Hochschild, thank
you very much.

50:08.606 --> 50:16.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARLIE RUSSELL HOCHSCHILD: Thank
you.

50:16.447 --> 50:24.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tune in later
this evening
on PBS for the final episode of
"The Contenders

50:24.255 --> 50:30.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
- 16 for '16," which has focused
on the different
strategies used by former
presidential candidates

50:30.928 --> 50:34.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the years as they try to
win the White
House.

50:34.565 --> 50:39.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight's features the campaign
of President
Obama, and that of his
predecessor, President

50:39.436 --> 50:41.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
George W. Bush.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.806 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here's a look.

50:42.840 --> 50:49.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU, The National
Review: George
W. Bush differed from his father
in a number

50:49.313 --> 50:50.347 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of ways.

50:50.381 --> 50:53.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He differed from him in being
more conservative.

50:53.550 --> 50:56.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His father had been from
Connecticut.

50:56.620 --> 50:59.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was raised in Texas.

50:59.523 --> 51:02.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he really played that up.

51:02.293 --> 51:04.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, he had the cowboy
boots.

51:04.295 --> 51:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN HOCKENBERRY, Journalist and
Radio Host:
If you look at the stories of
the Bush family,

51:08.799 --> 51:12.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he wasn't the one who was
expected to make
it to the White House.

51:12.870 --> 51:15.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeb was seen as more credible.

51:15.606 --> 51:17.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeb was seen as maybe smarter.

51:17.942 --> 51:22.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB WEISBERG, Slate.com: The
whole family
took the 1992 loss incredibly
hard.

51:22.112 --> 51:25.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM BROKAW, NBC News: We have a
whole run
of presidential projections for
you.

51:25.816 --> 51:27.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They all belong to Bill Clinton.

51:27.117 --> 51:29.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has passed the magic number
of 270.

51:29.186 --> 51:33.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL CLINTON, President of the
United States:
I, William Jefferson Clinton, do
solemnly

51:33.691 --> 51:35.459 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
swear.

51:35.492 --> 51:39.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB WEISBERG: They had to
redeem the family
name through winning another
election.

51:39.496 --> 51:44.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, the great
question became
whether it was going to be Jeb
or George W.

51:44.101 --> 51:52.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID AXELROD, Obama Campaign
Chief Strategist:
People ask me, why do you think
you can win

51:52.776 --> 51:54.111 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iowa.

51:54.144 --> 51:57.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, if we're in a close
race, these kids
are going to win it.

51:57.081 --> 51:58.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They think they're changing the
world.

51:58.615 --> 52:01.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT GIBBS, Obama Campaign
Strategist: The
good news is, I think they are.

52:01.919 --> 52:03.554 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

52:03.587 --> 52:06.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader:
The next president of the United
States!

52:06.090 --> 52:09.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARL ROVE, Former Senior Adviser
to President
George W. Bush: What led me to
believe he

52:09.193 --> 52:14.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could win the nomination was the
speech in
Des Moines, the
Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner

52:14.565 --> 52:15.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Speech.

52:15.599 --> 52:17.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You could just see the crowd
reacting to this.

52:17.735 --> 52:23.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I don't want to pit red America
against blue

52:23.574 --> 52:24.875 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
America.

52:24.908 --> 52:28.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to be the president of
the United States
of America.

52:28.812 --> 52:31.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

52:31.115 --> 52:38.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: "The Contenders -
16 for '16"

stations.

52:44.762 --> 52:46.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
