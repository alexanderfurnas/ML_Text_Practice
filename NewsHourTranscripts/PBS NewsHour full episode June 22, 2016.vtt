Democrats in the House of

00:11.044 --> 00:17.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

the European

LINDA DUFFIN, Financial
Journalist: I do think
a lot of Brexiters have
essentially got their

00:32.933 --> 00:37.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fingers in their ears and they
are going la,
la, la, la, la, because if we
leave Europe,

00:37.938 --> 00:40.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on what terms do we then do
business with
Europe?

00:40.374 --> 00:46.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: One hundred percent out.
My dad, his
dad, my grandparents all fought
to keep this

country British.

00:48.215 --> 00:53.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the shrinking

middle class. I talk with IMF
head Christine

00:53.353 --> 00:58.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lagarde about why the numbers
are lagging
and how the country can build
itself back

01:00.827 --> 01:02.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE LAGARDE, Managing
Director, International
Monetary Fund: If you look at
the size of

01:02.596 --> 01:08.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the middle class in 1975, it was
roughly 60
percent of total population. If
you look at

01:08.135 --> 01:11.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the middle class today, it is
about 50 percent.

01:11.104 --> 01:18.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on

JUDY WOODRUFF: The politics
around guns in
the U.S. took a dramatic turn
today, with

01:31.224 --> 01:36.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an almost unprecedented sit-in
on the floor
of the House of Representatives.

01:36.229 --> 01:41.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Nearly 100 Democrats are
refusing to leave
the chamber until they secure a

The time for
silence is over.

01:46.306 --> 01:51.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The extraordinary
protest came
in the wake of the mass shooting
in Orlando,

01:51.712 --> 01:57.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the goal, to force a vote on
legislation that
would prevent anyone on the
government's terrorist

01:57.517 --> 02:00.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and no-fly lists from being
allowed to buy
a gun.

02:00.320 --> 02:05.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. JOHN LEWIS: We are calling
on the leadership

02:07.961 --> 02:11.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

JUDY WOODRUFF: Democrats
continued to chant
and sit on the floor, as
Republicans gaveled

02:23.510 --> 02:27.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

bringing legislative
business to a halt.

House in recess
the hour of 12 noon.

02:31.051 --> 02:36.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That meant the
official House
cameras went dark, so Democrats
took to social

02:36.823 --> 02:39.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
media to share photos of the
sit-in.

02:39.459 --> 02:44.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Representative Debbie Wasserman

REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ

Speaking is difficult for me,
but I haven't

02:49.236 --> 02:59.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been silenced, and neither
should the American
people. And we will be here and
sit in and

02:59.980 --> 03:06.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stand strong until we can make
sure there
are no more guns, no more
Orlando, no more

03:06.987 --> 03:10.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

chamber, Minority
Leader Nancy Pelosi rallied
support in front

03:16.663 --> 03:22.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of cameras and blamed the
Republican leaders
for not bring any gun
legislation to the floor.

03:22.769 --> 03:29.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, she underlined the sit-in
will continue
until a vote is called, adding,
"We are in

03:29.076 --> 03:30.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the long haul here."

03:31.011 --> 03:35.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama voiced his
support for the
effort in a tweet.

03:35.148 --> 03:40.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For their part, Republican
leaders have not
commented, nor signaled plans
for the House

03:40.187 --> 03:42.022 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to reconvene.

Department has completed the
largest-ever

03:46.359 --> 03:52.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
takedown of Medicare scammers.
Today, the

03:52.532 --> 03:58.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including doctors and other
health care professionals,
with defrauding Medicare of $900
million.

03:58.505 --> 04:03.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The cases include
money-laundering, billing
for unnecessary treatments, and
identity theft

04:03.677 --> 04:09.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to obtain prescriptions. Donald
Trump launched
a full-frontal assault against
his Democratic

04:09.382 --> 04:15.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opponent, Hillary Clinton, today
in yet another
pre-general election campaign
salvo.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has the story.

04:17.157 --> 04:22.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The gloves were off
in the presidential
campaign trail today, as Donald
Trump and

04:22.896 --> 04:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton traded barbs
from 500 miles
apart.

04:26.733 --> 04:31.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Hillary Clinton may be the most
corrupt person

04:31.338 --> 04:35.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever to seek the presidency of
the United
States.

04:35.108 --> 04:42.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Look, I know Donald hates it
when anyone points

04:42.315 --> 04:46.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out how hollow his sales pitch
really is.

04:46.319 --> 04:48.088 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

04:48.121 --> 04:55.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: He's
going after me
personally because he has no
answers on the

04:55.162 --> 04:55.695 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
substance.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:57.430 --> 04:59.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In New York this
morning, Trump
delivered a blistering attack on
Clinton.

04:59.332 --> 05:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He hit her on her character.

05:00.901 --> 05:06.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: As you know, she
-- most people
know she's a world-class liar.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: And on her
immigration proposals.

05:08.808 --> 05:14.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Under her plan, we
would admit
hundreds of thousands of
refugees from the

05:14.648 --> 05:21.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most dangerous countries on
Earth, with no
way to screen who they are, what
they are,

05:21.621 --> 05:23.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what they believe, where they
come from.

05:23.757 --> 05:28.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That last claim about
screening
refugees isn't new, but
PolitiFact has rated

05:28.995 --> 05:34.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it false, citing the current
federal system,
a process that typically takes
between one

05:34.367 --> 05:36.236 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and two years.

05:36.269 --> 05:41.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a sign of what the four
months until Election
Day may be like, the Clinton
campaign quickly

05:41.408 --> 05:47.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issued a list of what they say
are the top
15 inaccurate statements in
Trump's speech.

05:47.414 --> 05:50.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Speaking in Raleigh, North
Carolina, Clinton
responded personally.

05:50.584 --> 05:55.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: He has
no real strategy
for creating jobs, just a string
of empty

05:55.922 --> 05:57.691 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
promises.

05:57.724 --> 06:04.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And maybe we shouldn't expect
better from
someone whose most famous words
are, "You're

06:04.431 --> 06:06.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fired."

06:06.199 --> 06:11.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, here's what I want you to
know. I do
have a jobs program, and, as
president, I'm

06:11.905 --> 06:14.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to make sure that you
hear, you're hired.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

06:16.810 --> 06:22.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clinton also got some
bipartisan
signs of support, an endorsement
from Republican

06:22.515 --> 06:28.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national security expert Brent
Scowcroft,
and a rousing welcome from House
Democrats

06:28.121 --> 06:29.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a meeting on Capitol Hill.

Marco Rubio announced

06:39.199 --> 06:45.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's now changed his mind and
will run for
reelection to the Senate from
Florida. Rubio

06:45.238 --> 06:49.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said it is important to run
again because
control of the Senate could come
down to the

06:49.576 --> 06:54.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Florida race. And he pledged to

07:32.519 --> 07:38.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
roughly 7,000 FARC rebels will

07:38.358 --> 07:44.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

latest back-to-back missile
tests mean it's

07:52.706 --> 07:58.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
closer to being able to hit U.S.

The test was the sixth in just
the last two

JUDY WOODRUFF: On Wall Street
today, stocks
fell in anticipation of
tomorrow's British

09:33.940 --> 09:39.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
referendum on whether to remain
in the European
Union. The Dow Jones industrial

09:39.245 --> 09:47.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nearly 49 points to close at

fell 10 points, and the S&amp;P 500
dropped three.

Cleveland celebrated
its basketball team's national
championship

09:53.026 --> 09:58.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

52-year winning

09:58.498 --> 10:04.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

player, LeBron

what residents in Britain are
saying on the

to the polls tomorrow to make a
momentous

10:42.709 --> 10:48.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decision on their future. Will
they remain
a part of the European Union, or
strike out

10:48.214 --> 10:50.016 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on their own?

10:50.049 --> 10:54.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour" special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant
has been talking to people in
the East of

10:54.254 --> 10:56.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
England. He brings us this
report.

10:56.422 --> 11:01.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: With local
polls suggesting
that most East Anglians favor
Brexit, the

11:01.694 --> 11:06.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remain campaigners cranked up
their polite
offensive in the market town of
Ipswich.

11:06.065 --> 11:10.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: What do you think about it?
Are you going
to vote yes?

11:10.436 --> 11:13.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIAH BENJAMIN, Student: Yes, I'm
going to
vote to remain, because I don't
really see

11:13.273 --> 11:17.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the point in not voting to
remain, because
you literally lose like so much.

11:18.011 --> 11:21.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Hi. Will you be voting
next Thursday?
Do you know which way you're
going to vote?

11:21.814 --> 11:22.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Yes. Remain.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Remain. Fantastic,
excellent.

11:23.883 --> 11:24.417 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Out.

11:24.450 --> 11:25.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Out.

11:25.718 --> 11:28.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Definitely out. OK. Do
you want to
talk about it?

11:28.288 --> 11:29.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Shut that bloody channel
tunnel up,
mate.

11:29.956 --> 11:30.790 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Really?

11:30.823 --> 11:31.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Yes, absolutely, concrete
it up.

11:31.391 --> 11:31.758 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: OK.

11:31.791 --> 11:32.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Yes.

11:32.759 --> 11:36.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: I think (INAUDIBLE) for
our country.

11:36.496 --> 11:41.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But her
suggestion that immigration
made the country's foundation
stronger met

11:41.734 --> 11:43.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a sharp response.

11:43.670 --> 11:50.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: My husband served 27
years in the military,
and what have we got to show for
it? Nothing.

11:50.043 --> 11:56.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fighting to keep them out,
definitely out,
absolutely, 100 percent, 100
percent out.

11:56.816 --> 12:03.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My dad, his dad, my grandparents
all fought
to keep this country British.

12:03.122 --> 12:11.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: So, is Britain
about to chime
in with a painful divorce, after
an often

12:11.798 --> 12:17.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turbulent, fractious, and
skeptical 43-year
union with her neighbors across
the North

12:17.704 --> 12:20.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sea, and declare independence
day?

12:20.540 --> 12:25.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At this gentle summer garden
party in the
village of Hoxne, in amongst the
cream teas,

12:25.845 --> 12:29.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the key referendum issues
reared its
head in an almost visceral
manner.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETER LOCKETT, Retired
Electrician: I think
we should stop immigration and
not allow any

12:32.552 --> 12:37.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more people in the country. I
think there's
far too many as well pinching
our money for

12:37.123 --> 12:39.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
national health and all that
sort of thing.

12:39.058 --> 12:44.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Next to the
sausage stand,
the conversation switched to
national sovereignty

12:44.430 --> 12:49.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the deep resentment many
Britons feel
about the amount of control
exerted by unelected

12:49.902 --> 12:53.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
European commissioners and their
unaccountable
staff in Brussels.

12:53.373 --> 12:58.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART JARROLD, Sports Reporter:
Every year,
every day, every hour, we are
spending so

12:58.044 --> 13:03.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
much money with faceless
individuals who -- we
can't even govern ourselves. Why
can't we,

13:03.883 --> 13:05.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as a nation, run our own
country?

13:05.685 --> 13:08.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY BENTON, Great Britain:
In the long
run, if the human race is going
to exist to

13:08.554 --> 13:13.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
survive on this planet that
we're wrecking,
then we need to come together
and work together.

13:13.593 --> 13:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Karon Saunders
is a truly
international woman with part
Italian heritage

13:20.199 --> 13:26.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who's worked around the world.
But she will
vote to leave. She says
excessive E.U. regulation

13:26.372 --> 13:31.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is endangering her small organic
free-range
farm. She struggles to get her
animals into

13:31.944 --> 13:37.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abattoirs that favor industrial
food producers,
has given up breeding turkeys
and has lost

13:37.884 --> 13:40.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
money because of E.U. rules
governing slaughtering.

13:40.687 --> 13:44.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARON SAUNDERS, Organic Farmer:
I don't want
people's employment rights, I
don't want their

13:45.024 --> 13:50.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
human rights changed. I don't
want that to
be lessened. And I don't think
it will.

13:50.863 --> 13:59.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I do want is to be able to
look at legislation
in a realistic manner. We may be
able to put

13:59.238 --> 14:06.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the small slaughter houses,
have that working
for us, rather than working
against us. Why

14:06.179 --> 14:12.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do we need a vet to stand over
people who
for centuries have always killed
the animals

14:12.518 --> 14:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
usually at the back of the
butcher's or at
home? There are legislations and
there are

14:16.856 --> 14:20.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ways that we can work that our
standards don't
drop.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LINDA DUFFIN, Financial
Journalist: I do think
a lot of Brexiters have
essentially got their

14:23.663 --> 14:28.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fingers in their ears and they
are going la,
la, la, la, la, because if we
leave Europe,

14:28.701 --> 14:30.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on what terms do we then do
business with
Europe?

14:30.837 --> 14:35.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Mrs. Portly has
spoken. That's
the name financial journalist
Linda Duffin

14:35.575 --> 14:37.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
uses when she blogs about food.

14:37.944 --> 14:42.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA DUFFIN: My concerns are
the potential
for a drop in trade and investor
uncertainty.

14:42.915 --> 14:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at the figures, 42
percent of
our exports are to the E.U., 48
percent of

14:48.821 --> 14:54.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our foreign direct trade is from
the E.U.
Essentially, if we leave the
E.U., we will

14:54.060 --> 15:00.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to toe the line, but we
won't have any
say in where that line is drawn.

15:00.333 --> 15:05.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Every week, the United
Kingdom sends
350 million pounds of taxpayers
money to the

15:05.071 --> 15:12.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
E.U. That's the cost of a fully
staffed brand-new
hospital.

15:12.145 --> 15:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GORDON BROWN, Former British
Prime Minister:
I'm walking through the remains
of Coventry

15:16.849 --> 15:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cathedral, bombed and destroyed
by Nazi warplanes
75 years ago, and now
painstakingly and lovingly

15:24.056 --> 15:29.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maintained as a monument to wars
that we have
left behind and to the sanctuary
of peace.

15:29.796 --> 15:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what message would we send
to the rest
of the world if we, the British
people, the

15:33.933 --> 15:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most internationally minded of
all, were to
walk away from our nearest
neighbors? We should

15:40.072 --> 15:42.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be leading in Europe, and not
leaving it.

15:42.975 --> 15:47.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Nostalgia for
Britain's fighting
spirit during the Second World
War is never

15:47.680 --> 15:54.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
far away at Frinton-on-Sea,
where a portrait
of Winston Churchill adorns the
railway station.

15:54.320 --> 16:00.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Frinton, a bastion of gentility
and snobbishness,
has frequently rebelled against
convention

16:00.726 --> 16:05.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and common causes. When
Churchill promised
that Britain would fight
Hitler's Germany

16:05.565 --> 16:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the beaches, there was the
following response.

16:08.034 --> 16:13.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS OPPERMAN, Frinton-on-Sea:
Frinton Parish
Council cabled Whitehall and
said, "Not on

16:13.206 --> 16:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our beaches, you're not."

16:15.007 --> 16:16.742 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

16:16.776 --> 16:20.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: A Second World
War machine
gun nest is part of the fabric
of Frinton

16:20.112 --> 16:25.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Station, and for the remain
campaign symbolizes
the bunker mentality of the
Brexiters.

16:25.585 --> 16:31.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chris Opperman, a former pig
farmer and broadcaster,
was going to vote to remain, but
changed his

16:31.057 --> 16:32.892 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mind.

16:32.925 --> 16:37.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS OPPERMAN: I believe
England is better
off by itself, because we have
the drive and

16:37.463 --> 16:47.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tenacity to make up for any of
the so-called
benefits. I believe the
engineering powerhouse

16:47.506 --> 16:50.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is still locked away somewhere
in Britain.

16:50.509 --> 16:59.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been inspired by some
impassioned speeches
by employers of small factories,
major employers

16:59.485 --> 17:06.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well, who've said, we can get
on, we don't
have to have the -- what they
call the feather

17:06.859 --> 17:09.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bed of Europe to push our
exports.

17:09.328 --> 17:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: during the
course of this
campaign, the lead has changed
hands. According

17:13.666 --> 17:17.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the latest opinion polls,
though, both
sides are running neck and neck.

17:17.570 --> 17:21.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But during recent campaigns,
such surveys
have been proved to be fallible,
because people

17:21.908 --> 17:30.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have sought to mislead the
pollsters. And
so it's far too risky to predict
the outcome.

17:30.716 --> 17:35.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Watching from the sidelines as
Britain tears
itself apart are immigrants from
Eastern Europe,

17:35.388 --> 17:40.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who're concerned about a
campaign that some
say featured a xenophobic edge.
These are

17:40.293 --> 17:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of the 5,000 Poles who live
in Ipswich.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Student Julia Rusek:

17:45.698 --> 17:54.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA RUSEK, Polish Student:
It's quite hurtful
that people like me get blamed
for things

17:54.206 --> 17:59.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like the fall of the -- the fall
the England.
And apparently we're stealing
the jobs that

17:59.512 --> 18:04.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other English people could do.
We want to
give back to the country that
gave us education.

18:04.317 --> 18:09.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to -- when I grow up,
after I finish
university, I want to be paying
my taxes,

18:09.055 --> 18:13.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to be paying all of my
bills. The way
I was brought up was to give
back to the -- to

18:13.993 --> 18:15.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people that give to me.

18:15.861 --> 18:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The campaign
has also generated
quiet despair in Professor
Stephen Bazire,

18:20.833 --> 18:26.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a leading pharmacist, his hobby,
railway modeling.
He believes Prime Minister David
Cameron's

18:26.372 --> 18:31.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pledge to hold the referendum
was a mistake
that could lead to the breakup
of the United

18:31.210 --> 18:33.012 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Kingdom.

18:33.045 --> 18:37.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN BAZIRE, Pharmacist: I'm
quite worried
that there will be a lot of
vindictiveness

18:37.316 --> 18:44.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going around between pros and
antis. And I
don't see Britain becoming at
all united as

18:44.290 --> 18:49.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a result of this, because if the
result is
very close, then you will have
people who

18:49.095 --> 18:52.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really are quite worried about
staying in
Europe and people who are quite
worried about

18:52.498 --> 18:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leaving Europe, and will be
blaming each other.

18:55.935 --> 19:00.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Scotland will probably then
go for another
referendum and will probably
leave. Wales

19:00.873 --> 19:07.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
might well do the same. And I
think we become
little Englanders then, again,
rather than

19:07.380 --> 19:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being part of a wider community.

19:09.648 --> 19:15.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Only the voters
can now decide
whether the Brexit express is a
runaway train

19:15.354 --> 19:21.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that may lead to the shrinking
of world's
fifth largest economy. If
Britain votes leave,

19:21.093 --> 19:26.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there can be no turning back,
and no one seems
to know what the consequences
will be.

19:26.265 --> 19:33.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Malcolm Brabant
in East Anglia.

19:33.239 --> 19:46.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The American
middle class is
shrinking and struggling. The
six-year-long

19:46.285 --> 19:51.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economic recovery is showing
some signs of
slowing. And the pronounced
wealth divide

19:51.390 --> 19:54.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the U.S. may get worse
without bigger steps.

19:54.960 --> 20:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That warning was part of a new
report issued
today about the U.S. economy by
the International

20:00.099 --> 20:02.034 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Monetary Fund.

20:02.068 --> 20:06.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I sat down with its managing
director, Christine
Lagarde, at IMF headquarters
here in Washington

20:06.972 --> 20:11.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earlier today to hear more of
her concerns
about what's happening to the
middle class

20:11.644 --> 20:15.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the poor, and what could be
done about
it.

20:15.514 --> 20:18.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Managing Director Christine
Lagarde, thank
you for talking with us.

20:18.184 --> 20:19.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE LAGARDE, Managing
Director, International
Monetary Fund: Pleasure.

20:20.019 --> 20:23.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, this latest
report from
the IMF looks at the American
economy, says

20:23.823 --> 20:30.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is in good shape overall,
shows resiliency,
but then it goes on to point out
a number

20:30.196 --> 20:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of factors that provide concern
for the future.

20:34.667 --> 20:39.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of them has to do with
the shrinkage
of the American middle class.
What do you

20:39.271 --> 20:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and your colleagues see, and
what concerns
you?

20:42.441 --> 20:46.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: We are seeing
a shrinking
of the middle class.

20:46.212 --> 20:52.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at the size of the
middle class
in 1975, it was roughly 60
percent of total

20:52.351 --> 20:58.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
population. If you look at the
middle class
today, it is about 50 percent.
So, that's

20:58.124 --> 21:05.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a significant decline of the
middle class.
And it is an economic issue,
because the middle

21:05.898 --> 21:11.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
class has always been the
consumption force
of this nation.

21:11.904 --> 21:19.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The upper class doesn't spend as
much. The
lower class doesn't have as much
to spend.

21:19.245 --> 21:25.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the maximum impact in terms
of consumption
is generated by the middle
class.

21:25.084 --> 21:29.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What's happening
here? You
also write in the report your
concern about

21:29.889 --> 21:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the so-called labor force
participation rate,
the number of people who are
actually working.

21:37.196 --> 21:43.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know that there is
concern about the
number of men and women who are
able to find

21:43.202 --> 21:45.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a job. What do you see there?

21:45.037 --> 21:52.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: What we are
seeing is something
that affects us all, which is
aging.

21:52.912 --> 21:58.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. population is aging,
like in other
economies of the world, and, as
a result,

21:58.717 --> 22:08.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the participation of active
workers in the
economy is declining. Now, we
cannot stop

22:08.360 --> 22:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the course of time, but what
policies can
do is encourage people who are
not joining

22:14.466 --> 22:19.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the workplace, the job market,
to actually
do so.

22:19.371 --> 22:26.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would point to a couple of
policies.
One is support given to women.
And, by that,

22:27.012 --> 22:35.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean maternity leave policy
that would help
them face the decision of, do I
stay or do

22:35.721 --> 22:43.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I go? Second, child care
support, and not
just child actually, but the
kind of support

22:43.796 --> 22:51.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would help families look
after a child
or look after an elderly,
because, with aging,

22:51.203 --> 22:54.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we will have to support more
parents or grandparents.

22:54.907 --> 22:59.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're
describing a real
squeeze on the middle class in
this country.

22:59.912 --> 23:04.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Yes, there is
that squeeze.
And that's where you head in the
directions

23:04.383 --> 23:09.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of people feeling insecure,
people not wanting
to move from one job to the
other, people

23:09.922 --> 23:13.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not spending as much as they
would otherwise
do.

23:13.125 --> 23:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those behaviors, those decisions
have an economic
impact on our growth.

23:18.731 --> 23:22.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Help us
understand, what's
the connection with the overall
economy?

23:22.034 --> 23:27.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Well, the
major engine
for growth in this country and
in quite a

23:27.406 --> 23:32.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
few advanced economies as well
is typically
consumption.

23:32.144 --> 23:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the U.S. consumer consumes,
there is
demand, more demand, and,
therefore, the U.S.

23:39.618 --> 23:44.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
manufacturers must manufacture
more. If they
have to manufacture more, they
have to create

23:44.390 --> 23:51.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more jobs. It's a fairly simple
virtuous circle
that is generally initiated by
consumption.

23:51.964 --> 23:56.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A number of
remedies you lay
out would cost money. They would
require action

23:56.969 --> 24:03.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the Congress at a time when
this country
is very politically polarized.
How realistic

24:03.876 --> 24:06.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
do you think your
recommendations are at a
time like this?

24:06.545 --> 24:11.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I see one
area where there
is some agreement.

24:11.550 --> 24:18.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's on the Earned Income
Tax Credit,
which, if combined with the
minimum wage increase,

24:18.557 --> 24:23.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would certainly bring people up
and would
boost consumption. So, on the
Earned Income

24:23.929 --> 24:26.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tax Credit, there seems to be
common ground.

24:26.665 --> 24:32.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope we can find many of those
small-ticket
items which will push the
envelope further

24:32.271 --> 24:34.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and increase growth in the U.S.

24:34.173 --> 24:40.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And if these
remedies that
you lay out are not enacted,
what's your concern

24:40.612 --> 24:42.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the future of the economy?

24:42.414 --> 24:49.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: You know, if
those issues
such as low participation in the
labor force,

24:49.221 --> 24:58.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
increased poverty, reduced
productivity and
polarization in terms of income
are not addressed,

24:58.230 --> 25:04.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then the U.S. economy will face
what I have
called this new mediocre, where
potential

25:04.303 --> 25:11.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growth is lower, there is
growth, there is
a degree of recovery, but not
sufficiently

25:11.377 --> 25:18.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to bring people out of those
poverty levels
that we talked about, not enough
to increase

25:18.851 --> 25:23.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the middle class, and not enough
to address
the unemployment of those who
are still looking

25:23.922 --> 25:25.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for jobs.

25:25.657 --> 25:30.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But those forces, poverty,
participation,
productivity, and polarization
of income,

25:30.763 --> 25:33.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are there to stay unless they
are addressed.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, a
different question.

25:36.568 --> 25:41.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Voters go to the polls tomorrow
in Great Britain
to say one way or another
whether their country

25:41.807 --> 25:46.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should leave the European Union.
You have
been clear. You have made public
statements

25:46.745 --> 25:51.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about how you think this, if it
happens, would
be harmful to Great Britain, to
other parts

25:51.917 --> 25:53.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the world.

25:53.752 --> 25:57.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you see the effect on the
United States
if there is a vote to leave,
Brexit, to leave

25:57.856 --> 25:59.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the European Union?

25:59.658 --> 26:03.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Well, if the
U.K. decided
to leave the European Union,
there would be

26:03.962 --> 26:10.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some effect on the U.S. economy.
How big that
effect would be, difficult to
say.

26:10.436 --> 26:18.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are two channels of
communication of
uncertainty and lack of demand.
One is through

26:18.177 --> 26:24.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trade, less trade between the
U.S. and the
U.K. most likely. But it's not a
huge volume.

26:24.883 --> 26:28.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So that impact would be
relatively low.

26:28.120 --> 26:35.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, on the financial front,
because of
the role played by London as a
financial center,

26:35.594 --> 26:43.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of the potential impact
on volatility,
on the anxiety of people who
then sort of

26:43.268 --> 26:50.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fly to -- fly their money to
safe havens,
then there could be a
significant impact on

26:50.409 --> 26:51.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the U.S. economy.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Americans
should be watching
closely?

26:53.445 --> 26:57.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I think we
should all be
watching closely, yes. And I
hope the right

26:57.549 --> 26:59.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decision is made, but it's for
the U.K. people
to decide.

27:00.018 --> 27:04.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Christine
Lagarde, the managing
director of the IMF, thank you
very much.

27:04.490 --> 27:13.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Thank you,
Judy.

27:13.765 --> 27:23.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

27:23.275 --> 27:28.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
high schooler
creates a device that turns
breath into words;

27:28.914 --> 27:36.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
efforts for more racially
integrated classrooms;
and a plea to adopt the metric
system in the

27:36.221 --> 27:38.056 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
U.S.

27:38.090 --> 27:42.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: The president and
Congress have
reached rare agreement on a new
law that will

27:42.361 --> 27:48.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
regulate everyday toxic
chemicals. The president
signed it today, setting in
motion the biggest

27:48.433 --> 27:50.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
changes in four decades.

27:50.335 --> 27:55.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Environmental Protection
Agency now has
new authority to review and
eventually restrict

27:55.807 --> 28:01.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or ban tens of thousands of
chemicals that
could be carcinogenic or
otherwise harm human

28:02.014 --> 28:07.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health, among them, substances
found in household
detergents and cleansers, flame
retardants

28:07.753 --> 28:09.421 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and furniture.

28:09.454 --> 28:11.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it may take a while.

28:11.123 --> 28:13.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins joins us to fill
in the picture.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa, why is this significant?

28:15.427 --> 28:17.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is
incredibly significant.

28:17.696 --> 28:22.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking about a vast
universe of things
that we touch in our everyday
lives. Some

28:22.768 --> 28:27.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
estimate that one out of every
three sort
of processed products that we
buy, not food,

28:27.573 --> 28:30.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but everything else, could have
toxic chemicals
in it.

28:30.275 --> 28:35.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what happened, Gwen, was the
law passed
40 years ago was essentially
toothless. So

28:35.113 --> 28:41.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the EPA wasn't even able to
regulate forcefully
something like asbestos, which
we know from

28:41.119 --> 28:45.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scientific evidence is lethal
and may -- causes
a lethal form of cancer, but yet
it's not

28:46.024 --> 28:49.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
banned because the law
previously wasn't strong
enough.

28:49.361 --> 28:53.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You and I both have
covered Washington
for a while. We know how hard it
is to get

28:53.098 --> 28:56.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
bipartisan agreement on
anything. Why this,
why now?

28:56.268 --> 28:56.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Imagine.

28:56.702 --> 28:58.503 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Wow.

28:58.537 --> 29:00.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Nothing is
getting done in
Washington. A sweeping bill over
an $800 billion

29:00.973 --> 29:04.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
industry? Well, that's the
answer. The industry
got on board.

29:04.209 --> 29:09.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The chemical industry felt this
was in their
interest because, up until now,
they have

29:09.114 --> 29:14.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
self-regulated and states have
regulated,
Gwen. So the chemical industry
has dealt with

29:14.519 --> 29:19.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
50 different sets of laws across
this country.
They found that it was in their
interest at

29:19.291 --> 29:22.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this time to have a national
law, have the
EPA take this over.

29:23.028 --> 29:27.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what we're going to have now
from this
law is the EPA having dominance,
being able

29:27.733 --> 29:31.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to override states, with some
exceptions,
in general when it comes to
chemical safety.

29:31.970 --> 29:34.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There are so many
different arguments
on either side of this.

29:34.573 --> 29:36.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

29:36.341 --> 29:39.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: One is that this is
the best it
could get and this is a strong,
big move.

29:39.978 --> 29:41.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is the argument for that?

29:41.046 --> 29:42.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

29:42.814 --> 29:46.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So let's talk about supporters.
They feel
like this was something that was
a long time

29:46.218 --> 29:50.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming, that these are dangerous
chemicals
that are unregulated and could
explain things

29:50.689 --> 29:55.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like, oh, autism or cancer. We
don't know
if they do, but the question is,
no one is

29:55.761 --> 29:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
investigating. Now the EPA can
investigate.

29:57.996 --> 30:03.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that group includes people
like Tom Udall
of New Mexico. And he spoke to
us about this

30:03.135 --> 30:04.870 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law.

30:04.903 --> 30:07.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TOM UDALL (D), New Mexico:
The first
thing to realize, we're doing
zero today.

30:07.639 --> 30:13.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not doing any chemicals
today. And so
what this bill does is stand up
the agency

30:13.679 --> 30:17.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get working in a really
constructive way
on chemicals.

30:17.616 --> 30:22.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are going to be many
chemicals, and
that's why I think many
chemicals that aren't

30:22.721 --> 30:27.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
addressed in the first couple
years, and that's
why I would urge the states to
get out there

30:27.893 --> 30:29.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and to regulate.

30:29.661 --> 30:33.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And yet, Lisa, there
are people
who don't think that this goes
far enough,

30:33.632 --> 30:36.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not only members of Congress,
but a lot of
people involved in activist
groups.

30:36.902 --> 30:40.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.
This bill tried
to address a problem of scale,
but it has

30:40.739 --> 30:42.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a problem of scale.

30:42.541 --> 30:46.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Let's look at a graphic
explaining this. As
we mentioned earlier in this
segment, there

30:46.044 --> 30:50.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are some 84,000 chemicals that
the EPA has
yet to review and now can
review. But the

30:50.916 --> 30:57.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem is how long it takes to
do that. Under
this law, the EPA is required to
examine at

30:57.355 --> 31:01.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
least 20 of those chemicals
within a four-year
time span.

31:01.193 --> 31:05.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That gives you a sense of how
long it takes
to go through each of these
chemicals. And

31:05.630 --> 31:09.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some who are nervous about this
bill say,
realistically, we're in the sure
this is even

31:09.267 --> 31:12.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to scratch the surface of
the problem.

31:12.337 --> 31:15.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Someone who has those questions
is Scott Faber
with the Environmental Working
Group. He talked

31:15.707 --> 31:17.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to us for this story.

31:17.476 --> 31:20.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT FABER, Environmental
Working Group:
The bill provides half as much
money as the

31:20.278 --> 31:25.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agency needs just to get through
the thousand
most dangerous chemicals out of
many thousands

31:26.017 --> 31:28.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of chemicals that are used in
commerce.

31:28.487 --> 31:33.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, if you ask the
question, is this
law better than what we have on
the books,

31:33.091 --> 31:38.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the answer is yes. If you ask
the question,
does this law give EPA the
ability to quickly

31:38.363 --> 31:42.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
review and regulate the most
dangerous chemicals,
the answer is almost certainly
no.

31:42.768 --> 31:48.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That's not the most
enthusiastic
-- in fact, not criticism or
endorsement.

31:48.807 --> 31:52.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And yet groups
like this
still signed on, because they
feel like this

31:52.677 --> 31:55.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is better than nothing, which is
exactly what
you heard.

31:55.247 --> 31:59.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's because this is
sort of an
invisible problem. When we say
this is a huge

31:59.885 --> 32:05.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amount of products, it's a vast
number of
products, baby bottles, car
seats, mattresses.

32:05.323 --> 32:08.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even, Gwen, something like the
necklace I'm
wearing right now, I know you
will be shocked

32:08.660 --> 32:13.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it's not real gems. It
probably is made
of chemicals that are
unregulated. We don't

32:13.899 --> 32:16.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know what these are doing in our
lives.

32:16.034 --> 32:19.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're saying something is
better than
nothing, but we will see what
actually happens

32:19.971 --> 32:21.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in reality.

32:21.740 --> 32:24.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Now, we say
unregulated. They
were unregulated by the federal
government.

32:24.342 --> 32:25.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.
That's right.

32:25.977 --> 32:28.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But states often
were able to
regulate a lot of these
substances.

32:28.313 --> 32:30.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

32:30.148 --> 32:34.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was one of the final
pivot points
to making this bill become
reality, that some

32:34.286 --> 32:38.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats, including Democrats
from California,
like Barbara Boxer, where they
have some of

32:38.056 --> 32:42.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the strongest regulations on
these chemicals,
were concerned about this.

32:42.394 --> 32:46.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they ended up carving out an
exemption
where some of the laws they
already have on

32:46.198 --> 32:51.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the books will stay on the
books. But, going
forward, anything passed after
2015 by the

32:51.303 --> 32:57.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states can be overridden by the
EPA. It has
to go out of its way to do it,
but that can

32:57.542 --> 32:59.311 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happen.

32:59.344 --> 33:01.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It really sounds a
little bit
to me, however, as if states are
being deprived

33:01.947 --> 33:06.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of some of their role. Usually,
the argument
on Capitol Hill is that the
states -- or even

33:06.551 --> 33:09.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the Supreme Court -- that the
states should
have more power, not less.

33:09.387 --> 33:12.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, that's
the argument,
I think, that states are making
clearly, and

33:12.691 --> 33:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the opponents of this
law are very
concerned about.

33:14.926 --> 33:19.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But think about it. This is not
the only issue
where we have seen this trend.
How about CAFE

33:19.898 --> 33:24.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
standards, the mileage
requirements for our
vehicles? Those used to be state
by state.

33:24.102 --> 33:28.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under President Obama, those
were raised,
so that carmakers had to make
our cars more

33:28.540 --> 33:31.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fuel-efficient on a national
level. Previously,
it had been on a state level.

33:31.910 --> 33:36.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The argument being
that a patchwork
series of law didn't apply to
everybody equally.

33:36.081 --> 33:40.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right, and
especially that
it was a burden on the product
makers, the

33:40.385 --> 33:44.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
manufacturers that had to --
could make a
product that fit 50 different
sets of rules.

33:44.122 --> 33:47.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's fascinating,
the way things
get done in Washington,
sometimes not done

33:47.759 --> 33:48.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on some days like today.

33:48.994 --> 33:50.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And surprising,
but this
really did happen.

33:50.996 --> 33:51.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It really did
happen.

33:51.997 --> 33:58.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins, thank you so
much.

33:58.103 --> 34:03.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.

34:03.041 --> 34:11.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: a promising
and affordable
technology that could give voice
literally

34:11.816 --> 34:14.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to people unable to speak.

34:14.185 --> 34:18.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fred de Sam Lazaro reports from
India. It's
part of our weekly series
covering The Leading

34:19.024 --> 34:20.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Edge of science.

34:20.792 --> 34:24.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARSH SHAH DILBAGI, Inventor: Hi.
My name is
Arsh Shah Dilbagi. I'm from
Panipat, India.

34:24.896 --> 34:30.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I love robots. I'm good at
computer science
and math. And I wish to change
the world.

34:30.602 --> 34:35.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He was 15
when he made
this video two years ago, as a
finalist in

34:35.507 --> 34:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Google's Science Fair, with a
smartphone-sized
device called TALK that converts
breath into

34:41.947 --> 34:43.782 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
speech.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COMPUTER VOICE: TALK is an
innovative device
for people with developmental
disabilities.

34:46.251 --> 34:52.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He is also
savvy at marketing,
abundantly displayed on social
media.

34:52.490 --> 34:54.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here he is giving a TED Talk in
Mumbai:

34:54.592 --> 34:59.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARSH SHAH DILBAGI: I felt that,
as long as
you are breathing, you should be
able to live,

34:59.931 --> 35:01.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
truly live.

35:01.733 --> 35:05.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He's always
like to tinker,
he says. When his parents gave
him a LEGO

35:05.470 --> 35:08.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kit, instead of a dog, there was
only one
thing to do.

35:08.340 --> 35:12.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARSH SHAH DILBAGI: I made a
little dog out
of the LEGO kit.

35:12.577 --> 35:16.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The very fact that we humans are
capable of
creating machines which can be
more capable

35:16.915 --> 35:23.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than we ever can be, that is
fascinating.
That's just like cheating
evolution.

35:23.822 --> 35:29.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Over the years, learned
locomotion, how to
control motors, how to put
things together,

35:29.227 --> 35:30.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how to make robots better.

35:31.029 --> 35:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He learned
to turn toys
into tools. The idea for the
speech device

35:35.533 --> 35:40.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
began when he accompanied his
grandmother
to the hospital, he says, and
saw a severely

35:40.472 --> 35:43.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
speech-impaired Parkinson's
disease patient.

35:43.174 --> 35:47.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARSH SHAH DILBAGI: I researched
about everything
I could about all the speech
impediments.

35:47.545 --> 35:51.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That research went on for a long
time. And
after that, I decided, OK, there
are problems

35:51.416 --> 35:53.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I found out with the
currently available
solutions.

35:53.752 --> 35:57.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He says
devices now on
the market, like the one used by
one of his

35:57.655 --> 36:03.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
favorite authors, Stephen
Hawking, all require
a laptop computer, they can be
invasive, and

36:03.328 --> 36:09.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are, of course, expensive,
well beyond
vast majority of people,
especially in India.

36:09.901 --> 36:15.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He doesn't recall the actual
light bulb moment,
when the idea popped in his
brain for a breath-driven

36:15.673 --> 36:18.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interface, breath through either
nose or mouth.

36:18.510 --> 36:24.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARSH SHAH DILBAGI: The user has
to give sharp
bursts or long bursts from the
nose, which

36:24.416 --> 36:26.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are interpreted as Morse code.

36:26.217 --> 36:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: As he points
out in his
own promotional online videos,
he had to learn

36:30.221 --> 36:33.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how a machine learns as he built
on the idea.

36:33.558 --> 36:38.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARSH SHAH DILBAGI: I had this
computation
engine which could take in
signals through

36:38.763 --> 36:44.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a microphone, distinguish noise
and normal
breathing, a single exhale and a
double exhale.

36:44.969 --> 36:50.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once I had that, I developed an
entire library
wherein those signals were put
into Morse

36:50.675 --> 36:51.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
code and then into English
alphabet.

36:52.010 --> 36:54.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The next
step, miniaturize
the hardware.

36:55.013 --> 36:58.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARSH SHAH DILBAGI: And this has
a little speaker.
And it just goes in like that.

36:58.783 --> 37:04.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Some 35 of
them are now
being tested by users across
India. Their

37:04.155 --> 37:09.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feedback is expected by this
summer, in the
first step of a long, uncertain
journey from

37:09.794 --> 37:14.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
prototype to an actual product.

37:14.766 --> 37:19.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We showed the device to Ben
Munson, a speech
scientist at the University of
Minnesota.

37:19.070 --> 37:22.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN MUNSON, University of
Minnesota:
I have high hopes for him, but
this device

37:22.841 --> 37:25.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
itself, I think, is going to be
of limited
impact.

37:25.143 --> 37:30.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Munson said
the TALK device
requires far too much lung
control and effort

37:30.515 --> 37:35.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a typical user a Parkinson's
patient, for
instance, couldn't muster.
Nonetheless, he

37:35.887 --> 37:37.655 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sees potential.

37:37.689 --> 37:41.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN MUNSON: It's extremely
clever. He's
marketing the Wright brothers'
plane as the

37:41.926 --> 37:43.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Concorde or something.

37:43.695 --> 37:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact is that we live in
a day and
age where you can see in your
lifetime the

37:48.967 --> 37:52.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
evolution in different
technologies going
from the Wright brothers' plane
all the way

37:52.837 --> 37:54.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up to the Concorde.

37:54.606 --> 37:59.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this device very well may
prove to be
useful for a subset of the
population with

37:59.611 --> 38:01.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
degenerative conditions.

38:01.346 --> 38:05.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: More
immediately, Arsh
Dilbagi, like so many high
school seniors,

38:05.617 --> 38:11.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is focused on transitioning to
college life.
He's headed this fall to
Princeton.

38:11.055 --> 38:15.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam
Lazaro in Panipat, India.

38:15.360 --> 38:20.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fred's reporting
is part of
our Breakthrough series and a
partnership

38:20.265 --> 38:31.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Under-Told Stories
Project at Saint
Mary's University in Minnesota.

38:31.075 --> 38:42.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The U.S. Justice
Department recently
hailed a federal court ruling
affirming plans

38:42.754 --> 38:48.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to desegregate schools in
Cleveland, Mississippi.
Desegregation, the court ruled,
allows students

38:48.359 --> 38:51.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to learn, play and thrive
together.

38:51.462 --> 38:56.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As part of her year-long look at
solutions
to racism, special correspondent
Charlayne

38:56.568 --> 39:02.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hunter-Gault talks with a
teacher on how to
successfully teach in integrated
settings.

39:02.207 --> 39:06.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: The
percentage of
black and Latino students in
what's being

39:06.678 --> 39:12.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called apartheid schools is on
the increase,
and yet most schools seem
ill-prepared to

39:12.183 --> 39:17.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
help those students be the best
they can be,
while reducing prejudice and
teaching them

39:17.522 --> 39:19.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to learn to live with each
other.

39:19.657 --> 39:24.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Maureen Costello of the
Southern Poverty
Law Center says there are ways
to achieve

39:24.295 --> 39:26.164 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all three.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maureen Costello, thank you for
joining us.

39:27.865 --> 39:29.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAUREEN COSTELLO, Southern
Poverty Law Center:
Thank you.

39:29.567 --> 39:33.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: The
Southern Poverty
Law Center has a curriculum that
looks at

39:33.771 --> 39:37.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
teaching tolerance in schools.
What caused
that to happen?

39:37.342 --> 39:42.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN COSTELLO: Well, before
we started
this program, we were fighting
hate crimes,

39:42.680 --> 39:44.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
basically.

39:44.549 --> 39:50.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Morris Dees, our founder, was
bringing civil
suits against groups like the
Klan, and often

39:50.054 --> 39:59.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the young men who had committed
some terrible
acts against others were
motivated by terrible,

39:59.330 --> 40:02.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
terrible hatred and just
complete misunderstanding
of what other people were like.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: It was
mostly race
at that point.

40:04.702 --> 40:08.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN COSTELLO: It was usually
race, although,
sometimes, it was also
ethnicity.

40:08.573 --> 40:13.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he was seeing 19- and
20-year-old perpetrators
who were going to spend the rest
of their

40:13.778 --> 40:20.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lives in prison. And he said,
you know, we
have to do something to stop
this before it

40:20.051 --> 40:23.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
starts. And he said, we need a
school program.

40:23.321 --> 40:28.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that really was the
beginning of teaching
tolerance. Let's find the best
research we

40:28.226 --> 40:33.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can find about how we can reduce
prejudice
starting at early ages, and
let's get it out

40:33.298 --> 40:35.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there to teachers.

40:35.066 --> 40:38.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the issues in American
education is
that 80 percent of our teachers
are white

40:38.436 --> 40:39.404 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
women.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: In the
whole country?

40:41.205 --> 40:44.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN COSTELLO: Yes. And I'm
not saying
white women can't teach, because
I am a white

40:44.776 --> 40:47.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
woman, and I did teach for a
very, very long
time.

40:47.912 --> 40:55.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they bring in all of their
own expectations
and beliefs into class. And
teachers have

40:55.653 --> 41:00.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to kind of constantly examine
those and say,
wait a minute, am I making some
judgments

41:00.491 --> 41:02.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here that I shouldn't be making?

41:02.260 --> 41:05.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: How do
you then deal
with such an equation?

41:05.363 --> 41:10.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN COSTELLO: American
classrooms are
diverse as a whole, but, in
fact, when you

41:10.501 --> 41:15.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
get down to individual
classrooms and individual
schools, we see a lot of the
diversity fade

41:15.673 --> 41:17.608 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

41:17.642 --> 41:21.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have schools today that
are more segregated
than they have been in the last
25 years were.

41:21.446 --> 41:23.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: This is
even in public
schools?

41:23.381 --> 41:25.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAUREEN COSTELLO: Absolutely,
absolutely.
There's real disparities.

41:25.917 --> 41:28.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So how
do you get
a handle on that?

41:28.086 --> 41:32.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAUREEN COSTELLO: Every
teacher's job and
the job of school is to help
students develop

41:32.056 --> 41:35.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the skills that they need to
thrive in a diverse
society.

41:35.960 --> 41:42.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lots of people think it's a
natural thing.
We're all born open-minded, and
then we learn

41:42.400 --> 41:47.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to become bigots. And the fact
is, that's
not necessarily true. You have
to actually

41:47.071 --> 41:52.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
develop skills to cross
boundaries. And we
look at it three ways. We say,
OK, first of

41:52.977 --> 41:58.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
all, we want to reduce
prejudice, which means
dismantle stereotypes as much as
possible.

41:58.449 --> 42:00.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: How do
you do that?

42:00.218 --> 42:05.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN COSTELLO: You challenge
them. You
get kids to explore stereotypes
about their

42:05.656 --> 42:11.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
own group. And once they
recognize that the
stereotypes of their group are
not really

42:11.662 --> 42:16.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
real, you ask them to look at
other stereotypes
in other groups.

42:16.768 --> 42:21.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A stereotype is simply a box.
It's a very
convenient one. It helps us
categorize people.

42:21.939 --> 42:29.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're natural categorizers. But
real people
don't all fit in the box. And so
what we have

42:29.046 --> 42:32.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to do is help students
understand that there
is no single story.

42:32.683 --> 42:35.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What do
you do to
break through some of these
problems?

42:35.987 --> 42:38.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAUREEN COSTELLO: We provide
resources for
teachers.

42:38.156 --> 42:42.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the main resources is
a curriculum.
So, we have a curriculum called
Perspectives

42:42.994 --> 42:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a Diverse America. And at
its heart are
a series of texts that we have
chosen because

42:49.534 --> 42:52.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're either windows or
mirrors.

42:52.503 --> 42:58.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Windows. Windows are how I can
look outside
and I can see experiences and
lives that are

42:58.376 --> 43:02.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different than mine. And that's
something
we have always said is important
in education,

43:03.014 --> 43:06.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is to learn about other people
and how other
people live.

43:06.117 --> 43:11.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mirrors are where I can see
myself reflected
in the books that I'm reading.
And, of course,

43:11.722 --> 43:17.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's important too, and it's
particularly
important for a child of color,
for a child

43:17.462 --> 43:24.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who perhaps has immigrant
parents, for children
living in poverty, to recognize
that they're

43:24.135 --> 43:28.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not on the outside, that they
can be the heroes
of their own story, too.

43:28.206 --> 43:30.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So where
do they get
those books and that material?

43:30.708 --> 43:34.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN COSTELLO: We have it in
our Web site,
Perspectives for a Diverse
America. Many of

43:34.779 --> 43:40.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them are from published works.
And we have
chosen them because they help
teachers explore

43:40.718 --> 43:45.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the issues -- the areas of
identity, diversity,
justice, and action, which we
consider to

43:46.023 --> 43:48.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be really the key parts of
teaching tolerance.

43:48.493 --> 43:53.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Do you
find that teachers
around the country want this
kind of information,

43:53.130 --> 43:54.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and how are they responding?

43:54.866 --> 43:59.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN COSTELLO: The feedback
we're getting
is, we need this. Thank goodness
you have

43:59.170 --> 44:03.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it. And we need to incorporate
it into our
everyday lessons.

44:03.608 --> 44:05.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And how
are you disseminating
this?

44:05.576 --> 44:08.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN COSTELLO: We have it
available for
free on the Web site. We have a
social media

44:08.880 --> 44:14.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
page on Facebook. We have a
Twitter channel.
And we send newsletters to
teachers. So we

44:14.585 --> 44:17.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have this kind of virtual
community of about
half-a-million teachers.

44:17.955 --> 44:22.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: How
important is taking
these issues on in school?

44:22.927 --> 44:24.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAUREEN COSTELLO: I think it's
incredibly
important.

44:24.896 --> 44:30.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, schools are one of
the few institutions
we have left that, in some ways,
we all share.

44:30.768 --> 44:36.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's one of those few common
institutions.
Every child goes to school. And
they go home

44:36.207 --> 44:38.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they have conversations with
their parents.

44:38.075 --> 44:41.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the more important thing is
that, you
know, let's remember the
original purpose

44:42.013 --> 44:48.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of schools. It had a civic
mission. Schools
are supposed to take young
people and not

44:48.686 --> 44:55.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just equip them for jobs and not
just equip
them to make money, but to equip
them to be

44:55.326 --> 45:03.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizens who can analyze issues,
take action,
take informed action, and stand
up for each

45:03.100 --> 45:06.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other, and stand up for the
ideals that we
believe in.

45:06.404 --> 45:11.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we think that this is
something that
belongs in school, belongs in
every school.

CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
Maureen Costello,
thank you for joining us.

45:14.078 --> 45:18.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAUREEN COSTELLO: Thank you.

45:18.583 --> 45:30.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return to the
U.S. Capitol
now, but for a different form of
speaking

45:30.595 --> 45:32.463 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

45:32.496 --> 45:36.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The light sentencing of a
Stanford University
swimmer for sexually assaulting
an unconscious

45:36.601 --> 45:40.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
woman sparked outage across the
country and
in Congress.

45:40.738 --> 45:46.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The story prompted New Hampshire
Congresswoman
Ann McLane Kuster to share her
own experience

45:46.210 --> 45:49.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with sexual assault during a
speech on the
House floor Tuesday night.

45:50.014 --> 45:54.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. ANN MCLANE KUSTER (D), New
Hampshire:
I was an 18-year-old student. I
was going

45:54.185 --> 46:00.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a dance. The dance was at a
fraternity,
and I intended to enjoy the
evening with my

46:00.124 --> 46:01.859 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
friends.

46:01.892 --> 46:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We danced. We listened to music.
We enjoyed
the evening, and we enjoyed the
party, until

46:08.666 --> 46:16.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one young man assaulted me in a
crude and
insulting way, and I ran, alone,
into the

46:16.474 --> 46:18.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cold dark night.

46:18.909 --> 46:28.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have never forgotten that
night. I was filled
with shame, regret, humiliation,
while he

46:28.753 --> 46:34.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was egged on by everyone at that
party standing
by.

46:34.191 --> 46:40.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Several years later, I was
working as a legislative
assistant right here on Capitol
Hill, and

46:41.032 --> 46:49.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was assaulted again, this time
by a distinguished
guest of the United States
Congress. I was

46:49.340 --> 46:56.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
23 years old, and as Judge Poe
referenced
tonight, I didn't say a word to
anyone.

46:56.981 --> 47:03.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, until I wrote
these words to
share with you tonight, I had
never told anyone

47:03.754 --> 47:10.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this story. My family didn't
know, my husband
my children, my friends.

47:10.127 --> 47:16.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I tell these stories tonight on
the floor
of the United States Congress
not because

47:16.567 --> 47:24.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are remarkable or unique.
Sadly, I tell
these stories because they are
all too common,

47:24.475 --> 47:29.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, tonight, we will not be
silent anymore.

47:29.146 --> 47:36.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we stand together,
Republicans and
Democrats, mothers and sisters,
from across

47:36.120 --> 47:42.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country to take a stand for
liberty and
justice for all.

47:42.193 --> 47:47.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congresswoman
Kuster also called
for more accountability and
education about

47:47.998 --> 47:55.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sexual assault on college
campuses and in
communities.

47:55.106 --> 48:06.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight, we
return to
one of -- another of our
periodic essays.

48:06.917 --> 48:12.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are many hot topics under
debate in
2016. Bestselling author Daniel
Pink wants

48:12.223 --> 48:17.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us to focus on one issue not
making headlines,
how the metric system measures
up.

48:17.795 --> 48:22.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL PINK, Author: This is my
phone. Like
many of you, I use it to check
the temperature.

48:22.433 --> 48:28.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And right now, a spring
afternoon in Washington,
D.C., my phone says that,
outside, it's 16

48:29.006 --> 48:30.775 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
degrees.

48:30.808 --> 48:35.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's not a mistake. That's
Celsius. And
I'm not a crank or a Canadian.
It's just that,

48:35.679 --> 48:41.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a few years ago, I went metric,
and it's time
for you and the rest of America
to join me.

48:41.152 --> 48:47.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let me take you back in time,
the 1970s, Columbus,
Ohio. I'm in third grade. One
day, Mrs. Williams

48:47.191 --> 48:52.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tells us something amazing. In a
few years,
she says, the United States will
go fully

48:52.863 --> 48:54.598 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
metric.

48:54.632 --> 49:00.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Four decades later, I'm still
waiting, all
84 kilograms of me. Today, only
two other

49:00.371 --> 49:06.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
countries still have not
embraced the metric
system, Liberia and Myanmar. But
metric is

49:06.944 --> 49:09.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a good idea whose time has
finally come.

49:09.914 --> 49:16.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the muddy racetrack of 2016,
it now offers
a rare political trifecta. It's
good for business,

49:16.053 --> 49:19.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
good for international harmony
and good for
kids.

49:19.490 --> 49:24.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Begin with business. Getting our
organizations
on a single standard will avoid
mistakes like

49:24.061 --> 49:30.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the one a while back when a $125
million Mars
orbiter exploded because NASA
was using the

49:30.601 --> 49:35.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
international standard, but its
contractor
was using pounds. Metric makes
international

49:35.472 --> 49:40.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trade easier and smoother and
eliminates duplication
in manufacturing and labeling.

49:41.011 --> 49:46.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Next, international relations.
America has
a tattered image overseas, but
going metric

49:46.217 --> 49:50.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can help mend that by showing
we're ready,
willing and able to work with
the rest of

49:50.321 --> 49:52.189 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world.

49:52.223 --> 49:56.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, finally, children, those
little creatures
every candidate says are the
future. Our kids'

49:57.027 --> 50:03.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
future is global and high-tech.
Well, 95 percent
of the globe has already gone
metric. So has

50:04.001 --> 50:09.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
100 percent of science and
technology. Just
as kids in China are racing to
learn English,

50:09.039 --> 50:13.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world's linguistic standard,
shouldn't
American kids be mastering
metric, the world's

50:13.410 --> 50:15.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
measurement standard?

50:15.512 --> 50:19.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's another advantage I have
learned from
my own conversion to liters and
meters. Metric

50:19.650 --> 50:25.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is easier than the Liberian
system. Believe
me, it's much simpler to divide
by 10 and

50:25.789 --> 50:28.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
100 than by eight and 12.

50:28.525 --> 50:32.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's even evidence that, when
prescriptions
calls for doses in milliliters
and come with

50:32.863 --> 50:38.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a metric dispenser, people make
far fewer
mistakes than when dosages are
in teaspoons,

50:38.502 --> 50:41.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which raises another question.

50:41.038 --> 50:46.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Teaspoons? It's two-and-a-half
centuries since
we broke from King George, and
our health

50:46.544 --> 50:51.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care system is using teaspoons?
We can do
better, America, but we will
have the lead

50:51.815 --> 50:54.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our politicians, instead of
waiting for them
to lead us.

50:54.518 --> 51:00.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, take out your phones and
switch to Celsius.
Reset your bathroom scale to
kilograms. Maybe

51:00.524 --> 51:03.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even dump your yardsticks into
Boston Harbor.

51:03.494 --> 51:08.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Together, we can lead this
country into the
future, even if we have to do it
millimeter

51:08.632 --> 51:09.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by millimeter.

51:09.400 --> 51:11.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: All right.

51:11.068 --> 51:20.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can find all of our essays

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: 42 percent of grades in
four-year college

51:32.222 --> 51:37.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students get As, a major change
since the
1960s, when the most frequent
grade was a

51:37.761 --> 51:44.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
C. On our Making Sense page, we
have a columnist
who compares grade inflation
with economic

inflation. All that and more is
on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:50.507 --> 51:52.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And a news update before we go.

51:52.509 --> 51:59.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The speaker of the House, Paul
Ryan, has criticized
the Democratic sit-in taking
place in Congress.

51:59.483 --> 52:02.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On CNN, he called it a -- quote
-- "publicity
stunt."

52:02.786 --> 52:07.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, Democratic
congressional leaders
are still deciding whether to
stay in the

52:07.057 --> 52:12.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chamber through the night. Under
House rules,
they can leave and resume the
sit-in tomorrow.

Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening. For all of us at the

52:39.356 --> 52:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.

52:49.400 --> 52:57.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
