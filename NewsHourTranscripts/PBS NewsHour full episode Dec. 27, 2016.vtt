they want to
work, they will be beggars.

00:26.226 --> 00:29.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will live in the street,
and have no
future.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some lost their sons, others,
daughters and
wives.

00:31.598 --> 00:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For them, there is no meaning to
life.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is better to die.

by tomorrow.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That has resulted in egg

prices.

people on

02:49.803 --> 02:51.204 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

to the surface
and sent it to Moscow.

02:53.774 --> 02:58.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They say it is not badly

have played down the possibility
of terrorism

03:16.129 --> 03:17.798 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the crash.

03:17.831 --> 03:22.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're focusing instead on
possible human
error, equipment failure or bad
fuel.

03:22.069 --> 03:27.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

exits, and dozens
of people were arrested.

03:36.850 --> 03:41.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police are saying troublemakers

social media to organize the
fights.

03:41.655 --> 03:45.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

has to save
our skins.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Into the garbage chute, flyboy.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It was the
role of a lifetime,
and for Carrie Fisher, playing
Princess Leia

04:16.923 --> 04:19.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Organa defined much of her life.

04:19.226 --> 04:22.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As she once said: "I have always
been in 'Star
Wars.'

04:22.496 --> 04:24.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have never not been in 'Star
Wars.'"

04:24.598 --> 04:29.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From an early age, she knew
something of Hollywood
fame, as the child of actress
Debbie Reynolds

04:29.503 --> 04:31.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and singer Eddie Fisher.

04:31.338 --> 04:33.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIER FISHER: I didn't want to
be different
than other people, and that's
what celebrities

04:33.874 --> 04:34.841 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So being a celebrity kid, that's
the dichotomy.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You want to fit in, not stick
out.

04:39.212 --> 04:40.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLIE ROSE, Host, "The Charlie
Rose Show":
With other celebrity kids.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARRIER FISHER: No, I wasn't
just around celebrity
kids.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLIE ROSE: Oh, you wanted to
fit in with
other normal people who weren't
celebrity

04:45.919 --> 04:46.887 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kids?

04:46.920 --> 04:47.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CARRIER FISHER: Yes.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My fantasy was to be normal.

04:49.656 --> 04:53.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Fisher began
her own career
in "Shampoo" with Warren Beatty
in 1975.

04:53.226 --> 05:00.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, starting in 1977, the
original "Star
Wars" trilogy made her instantly
famous.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE FISHER: ®MD+IT /MD-IT /
I'm a member

sequel, "The Force Awakens."

05:08.475 --> 05:10.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARRIER FISHER: I like Princess
Leia.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I like how she handles things.

05:12.045 --> 05:15.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I like how she treats people.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She tells the truth.

05:17.817 --> 05:22.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Her screen
career included
lesser parts as well in "Hannah
and Her Sisters"

05:22.622 --> 05:24.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and "When Harry Met Sally."

05:24.457 --> 05:30.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She won notice as a screenwriter
and author,
too, depicting her struggle with
drug addiction

05:30.697 --> 05:36.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in 1987's "Postcards From the
Edge," her semi-autobiographical
novel and later movie.

05:36.603 --> 05:37.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTRESS: I'm not doing any
drugs.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTRESS: We know that, dear.

05:39.706 --> 05:41.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
These are businessmen.

05:41.541 --> 05:44.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In later
years, Fisher used
her one-woman show, "Wishful
Drinking," to

05:44.477 --> 05:47.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
try to balance enduring fame
with real life.

05:47.214 --> 05:49.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARRIER FISHER: This will
really, really impress
you.

05:49.583 --> 05:54.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I am in the abnormal psychology
textbook.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How cool is that?

05:55.855 --> 06:01.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, keep in mind, I am a PEZ
dispenser, and
I'm in the abnormal psychology
textbook.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who says you can't have it all?

06:04.030 --> 06:04.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

06:05.031 --> 06:06.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

06:06.132 --> 06:10.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Donald Trump's
Cabinet and Obama's last days;
an uncertain

06:20.146 --> 06:25.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
road ahead for refugees after
the fall of
Aleppo; the reach of opioids
into elementary

06:25.952 --> 06:32.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
schools; and much more.

06:32.659 --> 06:41.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We begin with politics tonight
and new questions
surrounding president-elect
Donald Trump's

06:41.935 --> 06:43.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
private foundation.

06:43.603 --> 06:45.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has our report.

06:45.438 --> 06:50.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: 'Tis the season
for charitable
giving, but charity has been a
long-running

06:50.543 --> 06:56.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and controversial topic for
president-elect
Trump, one that he reignited
last night.

06:56.216 --> 07:01.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He posted two tweets, staunchly
defending
the Donald J. Trump foundation,
his private

07:01.221 --> 07:03.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
charity, as both generous and
efficient.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But those tweets ricocheted.

07:05.692 --> 07:08.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some say they are misleading or
plain false.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So what do we know?

07:10.163 --> 07:11.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's start with this.

07:11.598 --> 07:15.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump tweeted: "I gave
millions of dollars
to DJT Foundation."

07:15.135 --> 07:17.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And he did.

07:17.037 --> 07:22.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tax filings confirm Mr. Trump
and his companies
donated $6 million of his own
money to the

07:22.275 --> 07:24.077 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
foundation.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: I wanted
to make this out of the goodness
of my heart.

07:25.578 --> 07:27.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But here's the
issue: Timing.

07:27.547 --> 07:32.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tax filings show he donated
nothing to the
foundation in recent years.

07:32.619 --> 07:37.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Instead, most of the
foundation's funding,
about $9.5 million, has come
from outside

07:37.824 --> 07:42.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
donors, including Vince and
Linda McMahon,
the professional wrestling
tycoons.

07:42.395 --> 07:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Linda McMahon is now the Trump
nominee to
head the Small Business
Administration.

07:46.766 --> 07:50.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The couple gave $5 million in
two years.

07:50.470 --> 07:55.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Next, this claim from Trump:
that all of his
foundation money is given to
charity.

07:55.942 --> 07:58.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Again, context is critical here.

07:58.411 --> 08:04.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of Trump Foundation money
did go to nonprofits
or charities, but philanthropy
may not have

08:04.284 --> 08:06.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been the only motivation.

08:06.586 --> 08:13.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Public documents show foundation
funds also
went to help settle lawsuits
against Mr. Trump,

08:13.226 --> 08:17.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or to political allies, as The
Washington
Post's David Fahrenthold
recently explained

08:17.564 --> 08:19.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the "NewsHour."

08:19.399 --> 08:21.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID FAHRENTHOLD, The
Washington Post: They
gave to this group called And
Justice For

08:21.201 --> 08:24.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All, which is a political
campaign committee
helping Florida Attorney General
Pam Bondi,

08:24.938 --> 08:29.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who, at the time, just happened
to be considering,
her office was considering
whether to pursue

08:29.109 --> 08:30.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an investigation against Trump
University.

08:30.977 --> 08:34.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They, later on, after the money
came in, decided
not to pursue that
investigation.

08:35.014 --> 08:39.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump paid that money out of the
Trump Foundation,
which is against the law.

08:39.052 --> 08:44.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Finally, Trump
tweeted that
his foundation "never paid fees,
rent, salaries

08:44.057 --> 08:45.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or any expenses."

08:45.959 --> 08:47.694 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That is true.

08:47.727 --> 08:51.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His children serve as the
foundation's board,
and the foundation is run by the
staff of

08:51.398 --> 08:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Trump Organization, his
business.

08:53.767 --> 08:58.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that creates an efficient
family charity,
but has raised some serious
questions.

08:58.638 --> 09:04.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Charities are not supposed to
directly benefit
or overlap with for-profit
businesses like

09:04.511 --> 09:09.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Trump Organization, and
that's one reason
the New York state attorney
general is investigating

09:09.916 --> 09:11.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the charity.

09:11.251 --> 09:14.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all that leads us to what's
next for the
Trump Foundation.

09:14.487 --> 09:17.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The president-elect has
announced he plans
to close it.

09:17.490 --> 09:22.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, legally, he's not allowed
to do that
until the New York investigation
is over.

09:22.929 --> 09:25.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

09:25.165 --> 09:29.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now for more
on the state
of the Trump transition and the
last weeks

09:29.669 --> 09:34.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Obama administration, we
turn to presidential
historian and "NewsHour" regular
Michael Beschloss,

09:34.674 --> 09:39.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and White House correspondent
and Washington
bureau chief for American Urban
Radio April

09:39.379 --> 09:43.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ryan, author of "At Mama's Knee:
Mothers and
Race in Black and White."

09:43.216 --> 09:44.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ms. Ryan, I want to start with
you.

09:45.018 --> 09:49.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems President Obama is
still leaving
his mark on his time here with
commutations

09:49.823 --> 09:55.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from federal prisons, even in
Gitmo some of
the prisoners being transferred
out, obviously

09:55.595 --> 09:57.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
abstaining from the U.N. vote
regarding Israel.

09:57.730 --> 10:01.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL RYAN, American Urban Radio
Networks:
Well, he's going to be president
until the

10:01.835 --> 10:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very end, January 20, at 12:00,
noon, 2017.

10:06.139 --> 10:10.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this president has a legacy
when it comes
to criminal justice.

10:10.510 --> 10:14.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The commutations, he says, will
be on par
-- the pardons and commutations
will be on

10:14.981 --> 10:18.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
par by the end of his
administration with
other presidents.

10:18.985 --> 10:23.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this is a legacy piece that
he wants to
show and make a mark with.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then when it comes to Gitmo,
that's been
a piece.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's been wanting to close
Gitmo.

10:26.926 --> 10:31.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's been one of those pieces
that just
has not fully worked for him the
way he wanted

10:31.264 --> 10:35.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it to, but he still -- once
again, he's being
presidential.

10:35.435 --> 10:41.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as we were talking, he has
had a day with
the Japanese leader, Abe, and
they're working

10:41.608 --> 10:47.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on issues of trying to show the
world how
reconciliation could look years
after what

10:47.313 --> 10:53.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened at Pearl Harbor and
also talking
about a world without any nukes,
a hope for

10:53.152 --> 10:54.888 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

10:54.921 --> 10:59.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he again is trying to set an
example and
keep his legacy in place as much
as he can

10:59.559 --> 11:03.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
until that last moment that he
is president
in Washington, D.C., next year.

11:03.963 --> 11:08.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael
Beschloss, do presidents
try to secure their legacies in
these last

11:08.635 --> 11:10.603 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
few days?

11:10.637 --> 11:13.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are there other historical
examples of presidents
taking significant policy
positions or diplomatic

11:13.373 --> 11:14.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stances on their way out?

11:14.607 --> 11:16.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, Presidential
Historian:
Sure they do.

11:17.010 --> 11:23.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
George H.W. Bush in 1992 sent
American troops
into Somalia for humanitarian
reasons, although,

11:23.950 --> 11:28.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in his case, he called up Bill
Clinton, the
new president, and said, is this
OK with you,

11:28.454 --> 11:30.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Bill Clinton said, yes, I'm
for that.

11:30.557 --> 11:33.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's basically be for this
together.

11:33.893 --> 11:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Dwight Eisenhower before he
left the presidency
in 1961, he broke diplomatic
relations with

11:40.466 --> 11:42.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Cuba for a long time.

11:42.769 --> 11:46.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the difference here is that
you have got
Donald Trump, who began right
after the election

11:46.839 --> 11:52.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing all sorts of things that
were new, like,
for instance, the telephone call
to the president

11:52.345 --> 11:57.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Taiwan, all sorts of tweets
to make it
clear that someone new is going
to be in charge

11:57.717 --> 12:02.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with very different views, and
very different
from, for instance, Ronald
Reagan, who waited

12:02.922 --> 12:09.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until a week after he became
president to
say the Soviets lie, cheat,
commit crimes

12:09.062 --> 12:10.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to achieve their ends.

12:10.897 --> 12:15.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Reagan felt the time to do
that wasn't
during the transition, but right
after he

12:15.602 --> 12:18.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was president, when he had the
full power
of being in the White House.

12:18.571 --> 12:22.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael, does
that a cooling
effect or does that impact in
any way how

12:22.742 --> 12:26.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rest of the world perceives
the abilities
and actions of the current
president?

12:27.013 --> 12:28.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Sure, it
does.

12:28.514 --> 12:31.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It muffles what President Obama
is trying
to do.

12:31.718 --> 12:36.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the past, usually, a
president-elect
would be careful about sending a
signal that

12:36.823 --> 12:39.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there are sort of two presidents
here at once.

12:39.192 --> 12:44.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Or, for instance, in the
Eisenhower case,
the Bush case that I mentioned,
they usually

12:44.797 --> 12:49.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tried to at least do it together
with the
president who is still there --
or -- excuse

12:49.802 --> 12:51.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
me -- with the incoming
president.

12:51.838 --> 12:56.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have seen all sorts of
precedents shattered
by Donald Trump, and this is one
more.

12:56.643 --> 13:00.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: April Ryan,
these tweets
and these sort of disagreements
seem to be

13:00.747 --> 13:05.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happening in public and at the
same time the
incoming White House and the
transition team

13:05.051 --> 13:09.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say that there is back-channel
communication
that continues between President
Obama and

13:09.255 --> 13:10.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
president-elect Trump.

13:10.256 --> 13:11.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
APRIL RYAN: Right.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's very interesting.

13:13.159 --> 13:18.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I asked some White House
officials about that
communication, and all they
would say is the

13:18.631 --> 13:25.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact that it's very interesting
that Donald
Trump during his time running
for the Oval

13:25.905 --> 13:29.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Office would chastise President
Obama, talk
about Hillary Clinton following
President

13:29.976 --> 13:35.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Obama, and now he calls
President Obama quite
a bit looking for advice or just
wanting to

13:35.815 --> 13:37.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
talk about issues.

13:37.750 --> 13:41.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I find that very
interesting, to the point
where the president, though,
however, no matter

13:41.754 --> 13:45.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how interesting it is, he makes
it a point
to pick up the phone and call
him as soon

13:45.625 --> 13:50.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as he can, call him back, just
for the smooth
transition that the president
was afforded

13:50.463 --> 13:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from George W. Bush to his
presidency.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this president finds it very
interesting.

13:56.135 --> 14:00.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And particularly this is a crazy
time, as
they are watching this president
say that

14:00.807 --> 14:05.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if he were running against
Donald Trump, he
would win, and Donald Trump is
going after

14:05.211 --> 14:09.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him on social media, saying, I
don't think
so, and then trying to keep the
transition

14:09.582 --> 14:10.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
working.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a very interesting piece
by itself.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael
Beschloss, let's
talk a little bit about the
Cabinet, or at

14:14.987 --> 14:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
least the announcements so far.

14:16.856 --> 14:21.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
How do they stack up on
different axes, whether
it's gender or race or
socioeconomic status?

14:21.794 --> 14:26.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Well, even
the most ardent
Trump supporter would have to
say it's not

14:26.299 --> 14:31.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exactly the most diverse Cabinet
on earth,
a lot of billionaires and
generals in the

14:31.337 --> 14:37.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
close entourage, not a great
deal of -- many
women, not a lot of diversity
here.

14:37.310 --> 14:42.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the interesting thing to me
is that John
Kennedy, let's take that
example, he was elected

14:42.415 --> 14:49.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1960 by only 100,000 popular
votes, and his
electoral vote was about 303,
very close to

14:49.655 --> 14:51.357 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump's.

14:51.390 --> 14:55.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet, Donald Trump, who didn't
win the popular
vote and the electoral vote like
Kennedy,

14:55.962 --> 15:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, unlike Kennedy, feels
that he can
basically do this and doesn't
feel a political

15:01.434 --> 15:06.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need to, you know, make more of
an effort
with Democrats on the other
side.

15:06.773 --> 15:10.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kennedy, in his case, said, you
know, I was
barely elected by the popular
vote.

15:10.943 --> 15:15.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would rather make some efforts
to show that
I get along with Republicans.

15:15.081 --> 15:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he put Republicans at the
Defense Department,
the Treasury, in key positions
to show that

15:21.120 --> 15:24.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he recognized that that wasn't
the most resounding
mandate on earth.

15:24.524 --> 15:27.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: April Ryan,
this transition
team has said that they have
been looking

15:27.160 --> 15:28.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for something different.

15:28.961 --> 15:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL RYAN: Well, yes, they are
looking for
something different, something
totally not

15:33.566 --> 15:35.368 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington.

15:35.401 --> 15:39.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we're getting from many
persons that
I have talked to, be it Democrat
or Republican,

15:39.105 --> 15:45.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is a general consensus
that this is
a business approach to social
problems, and

15:45.845 --> 15:47.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that, you know, with no
governance really.

15:47.847 --> 15:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are few people who are in
the Cabinet
who have a governance stance and
government

15:53.186 --> 15:55.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
knowledge, governing knowledge.

15:55.154 --> 16:00.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the problem for many is that
this is so
new and so fresh.

16:00.126 --> 16:05.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on racial terms, George W.
Bush, I'm thinking
back to that administration.

16:06.032 --> 16:11.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
George W. Bush had the most
diverse racial
construct of his Cabinet.

16:11.604 --> 16:17.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now you go to the next
Republican president,
number 45, Donald J. Trump, who
is listening

16:17.977 --> 16:22.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to his constituency and standing
by what he
said when he was campaigning,
that he didn't

16:22.615 --> 16:24.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care about being politically
correct.

16:24.784 --> 16:27.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's going to be very
interesting to see.

16:27.220 --> 16:30.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael, how
does this transition,
at least historically, play out,
when you

16:31.023 --> 16:37.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have perhaps captains of
industry moving into
roles where they're leading
organizations

16:37.096 --> 16:39.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with thousands of people, but
they're different
kinds of organizations?

16:39.632 --> 16:43.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: It's one of
the biggest
experiments or even gambles we
have seen in

16:43.970 --> 16:45.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
American history.

16:45.738 --> 16:49.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump's whole thing, and
he said this
in the campaign, is, I don't
think having

16:49.909 --> 16:53.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political or public service
experience is
particularly helpful.

16:53.679 --> 16:57.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He essentially said -- he even
essentially
said that he thinks it's harmful
because you're

16:57.750 --> 17:00.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part of an old establishment
that didn't work.

17:00.453 --> 17:04.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're about to see whether
this works
or not, and four years from now,
we will know.

17:04.924 --> 17:05.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will have you back then.

17:07.226 --> 17:08.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael Beschloss, April Ryan,
thank you very
much.

17:08.995 --> 17:12.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Great to see
you.

17:12.899 --> 17:15.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

17:15.034 --> 17:19.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
APRIL RYAN: Thank you.

17:19.338 --> 17:25.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: When the
Syrian uprising
turned into a civil war in 2012,
the country's

17:25.044 --> 17:30.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
largest city, Aleppo, became a
bastion for
the rebel forces that opposed
the Syrian regime.

17:30.983 --> 17:34.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
After months of Russian
airstrikes, last week,
the Syrian government declared
the entire

17:34.987 --> 17:37.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
city to be within their control.

17:37.757 --> 17:43.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Aleppo fell, civilians and
rebels were
escorted out in an historic
evacuation.

17:43.362 --> 17:48.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Jane
Ferguson and videographer
Alessandro Pavone traveled to
the Turkish-Syrian

17:48.334 --> 17:50.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
border to meet those who
escaped.

17:50.636 --> 17:52.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A warning: Some of the images
are disturbing.

17:52.705 --> 18:00.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: These are the
survivors of
Eastern Aleppo, battered by
years of war and

18:00.413 --> 18:03.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
months of unremitting
airstrikes.

18:03.549 --> 18:08.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The lucky ones who lived through
the siege
come here to Turkey for medical
treatment.

18:08.888 --> 18:18.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shrapnel from an airstrike
smashed into Ahmad's
tiny 4-year-old body.

18:18.297 --> 18:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His father says that his brother
was killed
in the same air raid, and that
he has had

18:23.736 --> 18:26.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his leg very badly damaged.

18:26.405 --> 18:30.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mohanned cradles a severely
wounded hand.

18:30.376 --> 18:36.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is just 17, and says he too
was injured
by bombs dropping from the sky.

18:36.215 --> 18:41.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHANNED, Injured in Aleppo
(through translator):
In 11 days, they will do another
operation

18:41.654 --> 18:44.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on me, and, God willing, when it
is finished,
I will go back.

18:44.824 --> 18:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Outside a Turkish
hospital
by the border with Syria, the
wounded gather.

18:54.934 --> 18:59.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two months ago, she says that
she was hit
with an airstrike, so she has
only just now

18:59.238 --> 19:03.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
managed to get out to Turkey for
treatment.

19:03.442 --> 19:09.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They came here after fleeing
Aleppo city,
the last major bastion of
revolution and revolt

19:09.315 --> 19:12.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against Bashar al-Assad's rule
in Syria.

19:12.585 --> 19:18.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Government forces defeated the
city's remaining
pockets of resistance last
Friday, after a

19:18.491 --> 19:25.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
siege and aerial bombing
campaign by Russian
and Syrian warplanes; 35,000
people, including

19:25.898 --> 19:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the remaining fighters and
civilians, were
evacuated in the last two weeks,
after tense

19:31.070 --> 19:32.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
negotiations.

19:32.805 --> 19:37.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They joined hundreds of
thousands already
displaced to other
rebel-controlled areas

19:37.410 --> 19:39.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
outside the city.

19:39.145 --> 19:45.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A convoy of buses leaving the
shattered city
became a symbol of the rebels'
defeat.

19:45.651 --> 19:51.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a somber exodus of people
who once
came close to overthrowing
President Bashar

19:51.057 --> 19:54.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
al-Assad.

19:54.226 --> 19:59.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of those who held out to the
end was Salah
Ashkar, an activist from Aleppo.

19:59.899 --> 20:04.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spent the final days of the
bombardment
documenting it on social media,
and begging

20:04.870 --> 20:13.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the outside world for help.

20:13.312 --> 20:17.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He fled to Turkey just days ago,
still haunted
by what he saw in Aleppo.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALAH ASHKAR, Activist (through
translator):
Death was following us during
the last days

20:20.753 --> 20:22.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we spent in Aleppo.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The amount of airstrikes we had
there, I don't
think has been seen anywhere in
the world,

20:25.858 --> 20:28.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or the types of bombs they
dropped on us.

20:28.294 --> 20:31.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russian airplanes were
constantly in the
air, never leaving.

20:31.363 --> 20:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: But, he says,
help never came.

20:34.133 --> 20:37.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SALAH ASHKAR (through
translator): The people
of Aleppo lost their faith in
countries that

20:37.870 --> 20:39.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
supported the revolution.

20:39.805 --> 20:40.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everyone just watched them
dying.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They watched Aleppo say goodbye
to its people.

20:43.609 --> 20:48.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No one helped us, without
exception, not America,
not France, not Turkey.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They just watched.

20:49.348 --> 20:52.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: For Salah, the
revolution is
now over.

20:52.551 --> 20:59.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A man wanted by the Syrian
regime, if he returns
to Aleppo, he risks arrest,
torture and execution.

20:59.525 --> 21:03.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SALAH ASHKAR (through
translator): I think
I should search for a safe place
where I can

21:03.596 --> 21:07.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be free, I can live my life and
express my
opinion freely.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am searching for a new place
to continue
my studies.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I cannot go back while Assad is
in power.

21:12.138 --> 21:15.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Neither can
anyone who fought
with the rebels.

21:15.941 --> 21:21.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the outskirts of the Turkish
city of Antakya,
just across the mountains from
Syria, we met

21:21.113 --> 21:25.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with these two men hiding in an
apartment
after fleeing across the border
two weeks

21:25.584 --> 21:27.319 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

21:27.353 --> 21:31.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cousins who fought together in
Aleppo, they
were just teenage boys when they
joined the

21:31.123 --> 21:33.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rebels more than five years ago.

21:33.359 --> 21:36.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now they are broken men.

21:36.495 --> 21:39.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is no room for bravado
here.

21:39.098 --> 21:41.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have lost the will to fight
any longer.

21:41.967 --> 21:45.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Always
there were
airstrikes.

21:45.504 --> 21:47.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They controlled the whole
situation there.

21:47.773 --> 21:49.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was no point in fighting
against them.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.277 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It is finished.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I felt like there is no point
staying there.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We could not fight airstrikes
with rifles.

21:55.781 --> 21:59.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: They have little
hope for the
people who fled rebel-held areas
of Aleppo.

21:59.785 --> 22:03.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): They
are homeless,
without a future.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If they want to work, they will
be beggars.

22:05.791 --> 22:08.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will live in the street,
and have no
future.

22:08.227 --> 22:10.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some lost their sons, others,
daughters and
wives.

22:10.796 --> 22:12.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For them, there is no meaning to
life.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is better to die.

22:14.233 --> 22:19.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Despite the
dangers, others
are still inside Syria, helping
the people

22:19.471 --> 22:22.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who have run from the
government's advance.

22:22.074 --> 22:27.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an environment too dangerous
for most foreign
aid workers, it is often Syrians
themselves

22:27.713 --> 22:31.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
risking their lives to help
their fellow citizens.

22:31.884 --> 22:37.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S.-based Mercy Corps provides
food and supplies
to many in rebel-held areas.

22:37.289 --> 22:41.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are only able to do this
with the help
of those who stayed.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CASEY HARRITY, Mercy Corps: It's
incredibly
risky.

22:42.962 --> 22:46.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it is impossible to
understate the
risks that our Syrian colleagues
and Syrian

22:46.966 --> 22:50.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NGOs are taking to make sure
that people have
the services that they need.

22:50.469 --> 22:55.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are on the front lines of a
conflict
that has not abated and they are
risking their

22:55.040 --> 22:58.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lives every day to make sure
that these services
reach the people that need them.

22:58.811 --> 23:04.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Back at the
hospital in Turkey,
Mehmet Alver, a pharmacist
living nearby,

23:04.583 --> 23:06.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

treatment.

He has been overwhelmed by the
huge numbers
running away from the
bombardment in Aleppo.

MEHMET ALVER, Pharmacist
(through translator):
I am a human being.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.427 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I have children.

23:15.461 --> 23:16.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I have a heart.

23:16.562 --> 23:17.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Look at the situation there.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I cannot stay in my house just
watching.

23:20.299 --> 23:21.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I cannot do that.

23:22.001 --> 23:27.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This war happening next to me, I
cannot close
my eyes or close my ears or keep
silent.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tomorrow or in the future, that
might happen
to me.

23:29.508 --> 23:34.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: After being
bandaged and stitched
back together, these people
can't stay here,

23:34.914 --> 23:37.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and must now return to Syria.

23:37.516 --> 23:41.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of them will have to stay
in refugee
camps, now that they have lost
their homes

23:41.220 --> 23:42.588 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Aleppo city.

23:42.621 --> 23:52.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Ferguson
on the Turkey-Syria border.

23:52.064 --> 23:58.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

23:58.337 --> 24:03.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
Greek scientist
who claims he can transform
water to energy;

24:03.976 --> 24:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the best of 2016, starting
with books.

24:06.679 --> 24:13.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: The number of deaths
from opioid
abuse continues to climb,
topping 33,000 in

24:13.519 --> 24:15.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2015, according to the federal
government.

24:15.354 --> 24:20.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the hardest-hit states is
West Virginia,
where the impact of the opioid
problem can

24:20.192 --> 24:22.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reach elementary schools.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not the students who are
using, but their
parents.

24:24.797 --> 24:30.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Grandparents, foster parents and
the schools
are figuring out how to cope for
the youngest

24:30.069 --> 24:31.704 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kids.

24:31.737 --> 24:34.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Lisa Stark
with our
partner Education Week traveled
to Jackson

24:34.473 --> 24:35.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
County, West Virginia.

24:35.974 --> 24:39.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the focus of our weekly
education series,
Making the Grade.

24:39.311 --> 24:43.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A warning to our viewers: Some
of the scenes
may be difficult to watch.

24:43.415 --> 24:51.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Emily Durst's
fourth-grade class
is a lively place.

24:51.323 --> 24:59.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Cottageville Elementary
School teacher
likes to combine math with
movement and with

24:59.264 --> 25:01.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
music.

25:01.100 --> 25:07.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's not surprising that
10-year-old Briana
(ph) Sotomayor looks forward to
school and

25:07.973 --> 25:08.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to learning.

25:08.974 --> 25:10.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRIANA SOTOMAYOR, Student: I
love to write.

25:10.442 --> 25:12.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I write stories all the time.

25:12.544 --> 25:16.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Briana came to
Cottageville Elementary
at the end of second grade.

25:16.882 --> 25:19.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It had been a tough year.

25:19.251 --> 25:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She and her sister Riley (ph)
ricocheted among
four schools and three foster
homes, ending

25:24.723 --> 25:26.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up at the Sotomayor home.

25:26.525 --> 25:30.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE SOTOMAYOR, Mother: They
had reached
a certain point where it was
just they didn't

25:30.062 --> 25:31.163 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
trust anybody.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They didn't believe anybody.

25:32.965 --> 25:39.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: For the sisters,
life had had
a rough start, born to a mother
addicted to

25:39.405 --> 25:44.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drugs, including prescription
pain pills,
and a father in and out of jail.

25:44.109 --> 25:53.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE SOTOMAYOR: They were able
to in great
detail tell you how to crush
pain medications

25:53.886 --> 25:59.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and mix them with water and
inject them, among
other things.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they knew far more about it
than I did.

26:02.594 --> 26:08.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Carrie and Paul
Sotomayor have
now adopted the girls, and also
a little boy,

26:08.901 --> 26:12.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Zeke (ph), who had been
neglected as an infant.

26:12.271 --> 26:13.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now they're a family.

26:14.006 --> 26:17.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOTOMAYOR, Father: We have
adopted three
children, and, lord willing, one
more.

26:17.443 --> 26:22.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Like Briana and
Riley, the fourth
child they hope to adopt, a boy,
3 months

26:22.781 --> 26:26.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
old, was also born to a
drug-addicted mother.

26:26.351 --> 26:31.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE SOTOMAYOR: When we
brought him through
the door, Riley just burst into
tears and

26:31.723 --> 26:36.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, how could anybody have
done drugs and
hurt this little baby?

26:36.428 --> 26:38.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it just -- it broke her
heart.

26:38.797 --> 26:44.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: The impact of the
opioid epidemic
on children, parents almost
dying from pain

26:44.470 --> 26:53.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pills, fentanyl or heroin, has
been on graphic
display in pictures released by
law enforcement.

26:53.078 --> 26:55.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The epidemic has hit hard in
West Virginia.

26:56.014 --> 27:01.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With more parents abusing drugs,
the number
of children placed in foster
care has jumped

27:01.086 --> 27:06.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
24 percent in five years, to
more than 5,000.

27:06.725 --> 27:12.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here in Jackson County, local
officials saw
a spike in overdoses among
adults after this

27:12.197 --> 27:17.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aluminum factory shut down in
2009, throwing
hundreds out of work.

27:17.102 --> 27:21.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unemployment is just one of the
risk factors
that puts West Virginia right at
the heart

27:21.640 --> 27:23.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the opioid epidemic.

27:23.876 --> 27:28.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also a state with dangerous
jobs, not
just manufacturing, but coal
mining.

27:28.847 --> 27:29.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Workers get injured.

27:29.982 --> 27:33.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are prescribed powerful
opioids for pain
relief.

27:33.418 --> 27:38.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That can begin a cycle of
addiction.

27:38.357 --> 27:43.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jackson County Sheriff Tony
Boggs, who is
part of a community task force
to combat drug

27:43.061 --> 27:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
abuse, says heroin is now his
number one drug
problem, after marijuana.

27:47.933 --> 27:52.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY BOGGS, Jackson County
Sheriff: I think
in the mid- to late- '90s,
OxyContin was a

27:52.137 --> 27:53.438 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
huge ordeal.

27:53.472 --> 27:59.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It was prescribed, in my
opinion, way out
of control.

27:59.177 --> 28:02.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It got a lot of people addicted.

28:02.414 --> 28:05.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once it starts drying up, then
they have to
have something to turn to.

28:05.484 --> 28:09.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's whatever's easiest and
readily available,
and that has become heroin.

28:09.888 --> 28:13.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: This has not gone
unnoticed at
Cottageville Elementary.

28:13.926 --> 28:17.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY LEMASTERS, Principal,
Cottageville Elementary:
We definitely see that impact.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one is waking them up to get
them to school.

28:20.432 --> 28:28.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're often late because their
parents are
sleeping in because they had
partied too late

28:28.373 --> 28:29.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the night before.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The child has no food.

28:32.144 --> 28:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are hungry when they enter
the building.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't want to go home on
the weekends.

28:37.983 --> 28:43.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Principal Tracy
LeMasters, who
holds a hallway huddle with her
staff every

28:43.488 --> 28:48.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
morning, regularly checks the
local paper
to see if any of her students'
parents have

28:48.894 --> 28:54.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been arrested, so she and the
teachers can
be ready to help that child.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRACY LEMASTERS: It can be very
heartbreaking.

28:56.134 --> 29:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I have -- I have
preschool students
that, freely, at mealtime, talk
about their

29:02.274 --> 29:04.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mommies or daddies being in
jail.

29:04.076 --> 29:08.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: And under a new
program here,
called Handle With Care, law
enforcement now

29:08.480 --> 29:12.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contacts the school districts if
they have
an interaction with a family
overnight.

29:12.918 --> 29:17.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY BOGGS: They will know that,
hey, that
kid had a rough night last
night.

29:17.456 --> 29:20.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a reason that they're
acting out in
school today, or there's a
reason they are

29:21.026 --> 29:22.794 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not here today.

29:22.828 --> 29:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: At Cottageville
Elementary, the
percentage of low-income
students is so high,

29:28.367 --> 29:34.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over 90 percent, that everyone
gets a free
breakfast and lunch.

29:35.007 --> 29:41.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The school's 137 students come
from the surrounding
neighborhoods, including three
nearby trailer

29:41.113 --> 29:42.914 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
parks.

29:42.948 --> 29:47.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Principal LeMasters figures
about a third
of her students do not live with
their biological

29:47.886 --> 29:50.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parents, mainly due to drug
abuse.

29:50.856 --> 29:54.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does that impact you as a
principal of
a school, running a school?

29:54.726 --> 29:59.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY LEMASTERS: We assume that
everything
needs to be provided here.

29:59.231 --> 30:03.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that means, if they need
clothes, we're
going to give them clothes.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they need food, we're going
to get them
food.

30:06.338 --> 30:09.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, they need love, we're
giving them
the hug.

30:09.341 --> 30:15.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: School counselor
Robin Corbin
meets with kids three days a
week.

30:15.280 --> 30:16.381 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not enough.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The school could use her full
time.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not in the budget.

30:20.819 --> 30:28.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Corbin last year began
enlisting help,
turning to employees of a local
plastics company

30:28.093 --> 30:32.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to become mentors for students
who needed
extra support.

30:32.297 --> 30:37.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The kids see it as a weekly
half-hour of fun,
but it's really much more.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What are you hoping to
accomplish with this
program?

30:39.738 --> 30:44.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBIN CORBIN, School Counselor:
Just someone
else in their life that they can
depend on.

30:44.376 --> 30:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was one of the main things
that we ask
of these mentors, is that they
be reliable

30:47.746 --> 30:49.414 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and dependable.

30:49.448 --> 30:52.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they say they're going to be
here Tuesday
11:30, please be here Tuesday
11:30.

30:52.350 --> 30:55.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they have been fantastic
with that.

30:55.554 --> 30:59.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's something that these
children don't
have and don't see, an adult
that they can

30:59.558 --> 31:01.359 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
depend on.

31:01.393 --> 31:05.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: And like many school
districts
nationwide, this one
participates in a national

31:05.130 --> 31:09.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drug prevention education week,
holding an
essay and poster contest.

31:09.468 --> 31:12.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Next, we will have our
essay award
presentation.

31:12.504 --> 31:19.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: And among the
winners, Briana
Sotomayor, whose essay spoke
volumes.

31:19.177 --> 31:20.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you mind reading us what you

I'm going to give you -- this is

BRIANA SOTOMAYOR: OK.

"A Better Life."

31:28.053 --> 31:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"There once was this woman who
was on drugs,
and I was her daughter.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now she is very sick."

31:32.524 --> 31:36.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Briana goes on to
talk about her
ambitions: to be a gymnastics
teacher, to

31:36.762 --> 31:40.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a husband and children, to
stay away
from drugs.

31:40.599 --> 31:47.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIANA SOTOMAYOR: "If I grew up
to be like
my biological mom, I wouldn't
get any of these

31:47.672 --> 31:49.508 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things."

31:49.541 --> 31:56.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOTOMAYOR: It was
definitely heart-touching,
and to see a girl, especially 10
years old,

31:56.548 --> 31:58.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to really just be honest.

31:58.383 --> 32:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: For Briana and her
sister, Riley,
there's a community helping them
move beyond

32:04.289 --> 32:09.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their past, from their new mom
and dad, to
the educators who nurture them.

32:09.995 --> 32:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I come back and talk to you
when you're
20 years old or 30 years old,
what's going

32:15.333 --> 32:17.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to -- what is Briana going to be
like then?

32:18.003 --> 32:21.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRIANA SOTOMAYOR: Well, I'm
going to be old.

32:21.840 --> 32:22.808 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

32:22.841 --> 32:24.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

32:24.709 --> 32:35.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRIANA SOTOMAYOR: But,
hopefully, I won't
be on drugs, and I will be
succeeding in my

32:35.420 --> 32:39.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
priorities and just succeeding
in life.

32:39.457 --> 32:44.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: That's a lesson
these schools
are trying to teach all their
students.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Now a look at
some of the
outstanding books of 2016.

33:08.119 --> 33:12.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown sat down recently
with bestselling
authors Jacqueline Woodson, the
2016 National

33:12.123 --> 33:17.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Book Award winner for fiction,
and Daniel
Pink, at Politics &amp; Prose, a
popular bookstore

33:17.128 --> 33:18.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here in Washington, D.C.

33:18.930 --> 33:22.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Daniel Pink, the highlight
of the year
was Matthew Desmond's "Evicted:
Poverty and

33:22.868 --> 33:24.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Profit in the American city."

33:24.436 --> 33:26.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL PINK, Author: This is an
incredible
book.

33:26.504 --> 33:30.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's by a guy named Matthew
Desmond, who is
a sociologist at Harvard.

33:30.141 --> 33:32.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this is not a dry, academic
book.

33:32.444 --> 33:36.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, it almost reads like a
novel, a very
harrowing novel.

33:36.214 --> 33:40.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spent about a year living in
two different
low-income parts of Milwaukee.

33:40.719 --> 33:44.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this book, I think, shines a
light on
things that middle-class people
don't really

33:44.589 --> 33:46.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
understand.

33:46.324 --> 33:48.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, most low-income
people in this
country do not live in public
housing.

33:48.627 --> 33:50.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They operate in the private
rental market.

33:50.428 --> 33:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second thing is that they're
spending
60 percent, 70 percent,
sometimes 80 percent

33:55.000 --> 33:57.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of their income on housing.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's not sustainable.

33:59.070 --> 34:01.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what happens, they scrape
together
money for a deposit.

34:01.806 --> 34:03.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They pay the first month's rent.

34:03.608 --> 34:05.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then they can't sustain it and
they get evicted.

34:05.543 --> 34:10.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so these evictions are
happening not in
thousands, but by the millions.

34:10.115 --> 34:11.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's actually a virus in the
system.

34:11.950 --> 34:17.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I consider this book in
the same kind
of historical tradition as James
Agee's "Let

34:17.989 --> 34:21.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Us Now Praise Famous Men,"
Michael Harrington's
"The Other America."

34:22.027 --> 34:27.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think this book, if you have a
friend who
is a public official, hand him
or her this

34:27.065 --> 34:28.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
book.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's that important.

34:29.901 --> 34:32.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this book raises some
serious questions
about what kind of country do we
want to be.

34:32.470 --> 34:35.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This wasn't on
your list, but
you know this book?

34:35.173 --> 34:36.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON, Author: Yes.

34:36.308 --> 34:38.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm just dittoing everything he
says about
it.

34:38.410 --> 34:39.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's such an important book.

34:39.477 --> 34:40.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what do you want to start
with?

34:42.347 --> 34:45.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: So, I want
the start with
"Ghost" by Jason Reynolds, which
is considered

34:45.550 --> 34:49.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a -- quote, unquote --
"middle-grade book,"
but it's for anyone who has ever
had a family,

34:49.988 --> 34:53.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever loved running, ever felt
outside of a
place.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this book does everything.

34:55.660 --> 34:57.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, my 8-year-old loves it.

34:57.729 --> 34:58.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My 14-year-old loves it.

34:58.997 --> 35:00.231 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I love it.

35:00.265 --> 35:02.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it just crosses a lot of
boundaries in
beautiful ways.

35:02.801 --> 35:08.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's about a young boy who
joins a track
team.

35:08.406 --> 35:13.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he comes from an underserved
family, a
single mom and finds a new
family in this

35:13.111 --> 35:17.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
track team, but also becomes
this amazing
runner, and has started out by
running away

35:17.349 --> 35:19.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from this tragedy that happens
in his family.

35:19.517 --> 35:21.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I won't give it away.

35:21.653 --> 35:25.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's such a satisfying
story, and you
meet all of these amazing young
people.

35:25.590 --> 35:26.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

35:26.992 --> 35:28.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL PINK: So, I'm going to
give this to
my 14-year-old runner.

35:28.526 --> 35:29.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: Oh, cool.

35:29.527 --> 35:30.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL PINK: But I will read it
first.

35:30.562 --> 35:31.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: Yes.

35:31.563 --> 35:32.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Dan,
next?

35:32.731 --> 35:34.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL PINK: Well, I have got
this book right
here.

35:34.099 --> 35:38.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's "March: Book Three" by John
Lewis and
a couple of colleagues.

35:38.236 --> 35:40.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is actually a graphic
memoir.

35:40.238 --> 35:44.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the third book in a trilogy
that John
Lewis, the legendary civil
rights figure,

35:44.642 --> 35:46.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the current Georgia congressman
wrote.

35:46.745 --> 35:47.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He lived it.

35:47.712 --> 35:48.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANIEL PINK: He lived it.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And this is about an
extraordinary moment
in time.

35:50.849 --> 35:53.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's 1963 to 1965.

35:53.084 --> 35:56.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the tumultuousness of that
period is breathtaking.

35:56.087 --> 36:00.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's captured, because of
the form, I
think, in this incredibly
cinematic way.

36:00.925 --> 36:05.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a book about violence
perpetrated
against people because of their
skin color.

36:05.130 --> 36:10.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is a book about
irregularities in our
voting system and the integrity
of our democratic

36:10.168 --> 36:11.669 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

36:11.703 --> 36:14.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a book about a world
that seems like
it's spinning out of control.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's endlessly relevant.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: I completely
agree.

36:17.809 --> 36:19.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that's such an important
book.

36:19.611 --> 36:22.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL PINK: And what is
interesting is that
John Lewis actually got
interested initially

36:22.180 --> 36:24.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the civil rights movement
because of a
comic book.

36:24.382 --> 36:28.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So part of it, he's paying
homage to this
tradition that you can tell
serious stories

36:28.553 --> 36:31.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and talk about serious issues in
graphic form.

36:31.156 --> 36:33.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Jacqueline, number
two?

36:33.191 --> 36:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: While we're
talking about
graphics, I have to bring up
Ta-Nehisi Coates'

36:37.162 --> 36:38.129 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
"Black Panther."

36:38.163 --> 36:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was the first black superhero
in 1966.

36:41.699 --> 36:49.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
T'Challa comes from a fictional
place in Africa
and is this amazing superhero.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's about a lot of stuff that
we're talking
about now.

36:51.910 --> 36:52.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's about race.

36:52.911 --> 36:53.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's about power.

36:53.912 --> 36:56.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's about just trying to change
the world.

36:57.015 --> 36:58.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's fascinating.

36:58.383 --> 37:02.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I am a big Black Panther
fan, even though
I wasn't as a child.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I didn't read comic books.

37:03.354 --> 37:04.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I read "Mad" magazine.

37:04.355 --> 37:06.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I have turned a corner.

37:06.157 --> 37:11.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL PINK: "Mad" magazine is
like one of
my few formative experiences,
absolutely.

37:11.696 --> 37:15.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Mad" magazine teaches a whole
generation
of people to be irreverent
toward power.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:17.469 --> 37:20.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: It's so
true, that question
of, you can really do that?

37:20.505 --> 37:23.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL PINK: Yes, and get away
with it, and
you actually make money it from
too.

37:23.308 --> 37:24.275 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

37:24.309 --> 37:25.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

37:25.510 --> 37:27.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Daniel Pink, number three?

37:27.178 --> 37:29.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL PINK: So, I have got this
one here,
this terrific book called "Lab
Girl."

37:29.781 --> 37:33.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I read this book, and I
loved it, I was
thinking about the pitch meeting
for this

37:33.818 --> 37:39.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
book, because I can't imagine it
went all
that well, because this is a
memoir of a geobiologist.

37:39.224 --> 37:41.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can't imagine people jumping
up and down
over this.

37:41.693 --> 37:44.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what I love about this book
is that this
is a great book about science.

37:44.462 --> 37:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is this one scene in
there that
I find just unforgettable, where
she's working

37:48.800 --> 37:52.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for her Ph.D., and she discovers
something
that nobody ever imagined.

37:52.504 --> 37:56.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in that moment, she realizes
that, an
hour ago, nobody knew this
thing, and she

37:56.407 --> 37:58.143 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
knew it.

37:58.176 --> 38:01.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even more than that, at that
moment, she
is the only person on the planet
who knows

38:01.713 --> 38:02.680 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this thing.

38:02.714 --> 38:04.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, it's
scientific discovery.

38:05.016 --> 38:07.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL PINK: I mean, it's
thrilling.

38:07.085 --> 38:08.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I love this book.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's an important book
now.

38:09.187 --> 38:11.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think that science has
had a good
year.

38:11.356 --> 38:13.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think women have had a
good year.

38:13.091 --> 38:16.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So a book by a woman scientist
is a great
pickup for the end of the year.

38:16.861 --> 38:20.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Jacqueline, what
is in your last for this section
of our time?

38:20.965 --> 38:22.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: OK.

38:22.200 --> 38:25.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a book, "You Can't Touch
My Hair,"
Phoebe Robinson.

38:25.603 --> 38:32.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I was torn in choosing this
over the other
two books, because of -- they're
all phenomenal.

38:32.177 --> 38:34.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I will talk about the other
two later.

38:34.379 --> 38:38.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it was because I didn't
think this got
the attention that it deserved
to get.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And people don't know about it.

38:40.618 --> 38:42.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's a book about race.

38:42.720 --> 38:46.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a book about what it means
to grow up
female in this country and
female and black.

38:46.524 --> 38:48.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

38:48.359 --> 38:51.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I mean, the whole
title, "You
Can't Touch My Hair and Other
Things I Still

38:51.896 --> 38:53.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have to Explain."

38:53.131 --> 38:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: "Things I
Still Have to
Explain."

38:54.899 --> 38:57.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, basically, she is talking
about what
happens when you grow up black,
and you have

38:57.502 --> 38:58.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to explain your hair, right?

38:58.937 --> 39:00.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to explain people
wanting to put
their hands in your hair.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have to explain your body.

39:02.574 --> 39:08.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to explain -- she ends
up being the
only black girl at an all-white
school.

39:08.112 --> 39:14.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so there's a lot of
explaining that goes
into being African-American,
also dates interracially

39:14.953 --> 39:17.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and has to kind of explain that
to the black
community.

39:17.455 --> 39:23.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's this dialogue that I
think we're
finally beginning to have across
lines of

39:23.461 --> 39:24.596 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
race.

39:24.629 --> 39:27.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she makes people feel safer
talking about
race.

39:27.432 --> 39:34.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think it's kind of the
gateway into having
these bigger dialogues that we
need to have

39:34.038 --> 39:36.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this country, given where
this country
is right now.

39:36.908 --> 39:41.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, "You Can't Touch My Hair,"
Phoebe Robinson,
it's funny.

39:41.980 --> 39:43.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's thoughtful.

39:43.648 --> 39:48.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's wickedly brilliant and
comes to the
table with everything from Queen
Latifah,

39:48.620 --> 39:50.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to NWA, to Obama, Oprah.

39:50.255 --> 39:52.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

39:52.457 --> 39:55.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will continue the discussion
online with
lots more recommendations.

39:55.893 --> 39:58.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I will invite the audience
to join us
there later on.

39:58.963 --> 40:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For now, Jacqueline Woodson,
Daniel Pink,
thanks very much.

40:01.966 --> 40:03.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANIEL PINK: Thanks, Jeff.

40:03.034 --> 40:04.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: Thank you.

40:04.969 --> 40:07.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right now on
our Web site,
find holiday book
recommendations from "NewsHour"

40:07.872 --> 40:08.840 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
staff.

40:08.873 --> 40:10.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

40:10.975 --> 40:15.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And tomorrow on the program,
Jeff looks at
some of 2016's best television
programs.

40:15.513 --> 40:20.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He talks with Eric Deggans of
NPR and Andrew
Sepinwall of the Web site the
Uproxx about

40:20.285 --> 40:25.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the hundreds of shows now
available, what
some call too much TV.

40:25.089 --> 40:28.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC DEGGANS, National Public
Radio: Well,
what's amazing about this moment
is, not only

40:28.092 --> 40:29.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
do we have a lot of quantity.

40:29.894 --> 40:34.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do have a lot of quality,
because that
quantity is coming from media
outlets or from

40:34.632 --> 40:39.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TV outlets that are trying the
build their
brand by creating great
television.

40:39.070 --> 40:40.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, we have Hulu.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We have Amazon.

40:41.572 --> 40:42.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We have Netflix.

40:42.874 --> 40:46.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's all supposed to be very
well done.

40:46.044 --> 40:49.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're not just pumping shows
out there to
put them out there.

40:49.147 --> 40:50.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're trying to do great work.

40:50.948 --> 40:55.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that means that, for fans,
there's a wide
array of shows out there.

40:55.219 --> 40:59.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can pick and choose
according to your
very specific taste, and come up
with a list

40:59.857 --> 41:03.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of top 10 or top 12 that's
totally different
from anything that Alan and I
pick.

41:03.861 --> 41:05.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all of those shows would
also be great,
too.

41:05.863 --> 41:09.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN SEPINWALL, Uproxx: So, we
do this television
critics poll where we reach out
to about 60

41:09.767 --> 41:13.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TV critics across the country,
including Eric,
and we ask them to name their 10
favorite

41:13.504 --> 41:15.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shows of the year.

41:15.273 --> 41:18.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I get the ballots back, and
I haven't
even heard of some of these
shows, and it's

41:18.943 --> 41:21.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
my job to watch television.

41:21.679 --> 41:23.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's how much great stuff is
out there.

41:23.681 --> 41:25.350 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's ridiculous.

41:25.383 --> 41:28.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Clearly, my
apologies to
Alan, not Andrew, Sepinwall from
Uproxx.

41:28.786 --> 41:31.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Before we go, another lens on
the migrants
and refugee crisis.

41:31.989 --> 41:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This year has already proven to
be the deadliest
yet for those trying to reach
Europe by crossing

41:37.061 --> 41:38.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Mediterranean.

41:38.796 --> 41:43.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United Nations' latest
numbers show some
5,000 people have died so far in
2016.

41:43.735 --> 41:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among the reasons for that
spike, people setting
off in increasingly flimsy, less
seaworthy

41:48.272 --> 41:50.007 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
boats.

41:50.041 --> 41:53.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Later tonight on PBS,
"Frontline" profiles
the perils of the journey,
including cell

41:53.544 --> 41:59.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
phone video shot by the refugees
themselves
as their boat which left Turkey
takes on water.

41:59.350 --> 42:05.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's a short excerpt from
"Exodus," a two-hour
PBS "Frontline" special.

42:05.823 --> 42:09.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's a short excerpt from
"Exodus," a two-hour
PBS "Frontline" special.

42:33.351 --> 42:40.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HASSAN, Syrian Refugee: There
was a kid who
was sitting right in front of me
on the boat.

42:40.091 --> 42:43.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HASSAN, Syrian Refugee: There
was a kid who
was sitting right in front of me
on the boat.

43:07.618 --> 43:18.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to be seeing the fear, and
it's not -- I
mean, first, we're young men.

43:18.830 --> 43:19.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can handle it.

43:19.831 --> 43:21.599 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We can do it.

43:21.632 --> 43:25.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to see that, like, to see
that kids are
going through this, and they're
crying for

43:25.636 --> 43:29.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
help, they're pleading for you
to help them
or do something, it was like
literally -- it

43:29.474 --> 43:30.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was like, just do something.

43:30.475 --> 43:31.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he was crying.

43:31.476 --> 43:36.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To see, to witness that is just
hard.

43:36.314 --> 43:38.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After half-an-hour, the coast
guards showed
up.

43:38.082 --> 43:40.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Turkish coast guard showed
up.

43:40.384 --> 43:48.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they -- we all got on the --
we were rescued,
all of us.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Luckily, no one died.

43:49.894 --> 43:51.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No one drowned.

43:51.963 --> 43:56.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we were taken back to the
coast guard
station.

43:56.934 --> 43:58.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The treatment was good.

43:58.703 --> 44:00.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They gave us food and water.

44:00.671 --> 44:09.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, after a while, we --
after they
took our information, they
released us after

44:09.680 --> 44:11.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like a couple of hours.

44:11.682 --> 44:20.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we went back to Ismiah (ph),
back to square
one.

44:20.992 --> 44:26.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: "Frontline"
airs tonight
at 9:00 p.m. Eastern on most PBS
stations.

44:26.364 --> 44:30.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Online, read our tribute to
acclaimed astronomer
and pioneering feminist Vera
Rubin, who died

44:30.868 --> 44:32.603 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Sunday.

44:32.637 --> 44:35.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubin's work provided the first
convincing
evidence of dark matter and
showed that the

44:35.840 --> 44:39.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mysterious material makes up 90
percent of
our universe.

44:39.544 --> 44:42.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Find all that and more at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

44:42.880 --> 44:44.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

44:44.649 --> 44:49.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wednesday, Race Matters
Solutions: progress
in a segregated New York City
school.

44:49.153 --> 44:50.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

44:50.221 --> 44:51.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

44:52.023 --> 44:58.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS

you, and good night.

44:58.262 --> 45:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
