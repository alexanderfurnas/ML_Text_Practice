JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.673 --> 00:12.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: After
hosting last
night's Democratic debate, we
review the candidates'

00:12.512 --> 00:18.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
answers and talk with Mark
Shields and David
Brooks about the state of the
race for president.

00:18.652 --> 00:25.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: Pope Francis and Patriarch
Kirill of
the Russian Orthodox Church
meet, an historic

00:25.492 --> 00:30.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
moment 1,000 years in the
making, since the
two churches split.

00:30.464 --> 00:35.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus: repairing the violins
played by Jewish
musicians in the Holocaust.

00:35.769 --> 00:39.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMNON WEINSTEIN, Founder,
Violins of Hope:
Today, this violin is alive, is
existing,

00:40.040 --> 00:45.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and is going to talk to all the
world. Each
violin like that that you are
going to play,

00:45.946 --> 00:53.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's for millions of people that
are dead.
That is victory. And each
concert is a victory.

00:53.120 --> 01:01.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:01.561 --> 01:04.264 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:04.364 --> 01:14.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Democratic
presidential
rivals moved on from Milwaukee
today, fresh

01:14.207 --> 01:16.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
off their "PBS NewsHour" debate.

01:16.977 --> 01:20.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the arguments they had on
stage continued
at long distance.

01:20.614 --> 01:26.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
As I pointed out last night, he
has called

01:26.386 --> 01:29.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the president weak, a
disappointment.

01:29.823 --> 01:34.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton
returned to
South Carolina this afternoon
and to a line

01:34.461 --> 01:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of attack she used in last
night's debate,
that Bernie Sanders has
distanced himself

01:40.200 --> 01:42.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from President Obama.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: The kind
of criticism
that we've heard from Senator
Sanders about

01:46.073 --> 01:50.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our president I expect from
Republicans. I
do not expect from someone
running for the

01:50.744 --> 01:54.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic nomination to succeed
President
Obama.

01:54.114 --> 01:59.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:
That is...

01:59.820 --> 02:01.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Madam
Secretary, that
is a low blow.

02:01.855 --> 02:09.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you know what? Last I heard,
we lived
in a democratic society. Last I
heard, a United

02:10.097 --> 02:15.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States senator had the right to
disagree with
the president, including a
president who has

02:15.535 --> 02:17.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
done such an extraordinary job.

02:17.437 --> 02:23.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Vermont
senator also defended
his plans for enlarging
government's role

02:23.377 --> 02:27.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to allow for free college
tuition and a single-payer
health care system.

02:28.015 --> 02:32.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: When today
you have massive
levels of income and wealth
inequality, when

02:32.753 --> 02:37.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the middle class is
disappearing, you have
the highest rate of child
poverty of almost

02:37.657 --> 02:44.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any major country on Earth, yes,
in my view,
the government of a democratic
society has

02:44.364 --> 02:50.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a moral responsibility to play a
vital role
in making sure all of our people
have a decent

02:50.704 --> 02:52.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
standard of living.

02:52.739 --> 02:57.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Clinton was
quick to charge
that Sanders' proposals are, in
effect, grandiose

02:57.711 --> 02:59.346 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and unworkable.

02:59.446 --> 03:02.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: The best
analysis
that I have seen, based on
Senator Sanders'

03:03.016 --> 03:08.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plans, is that it would probably
increase
the size of the federal
government by about

03:08.121 --> 03:10.123 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
40 percent.

03:10.223 --> 03:14.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the
former secretary
of state said the price tag of
going to government-run

03:14.261 --> 03:16.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health care would simply be too
high.

03:16.463 --> 03:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Every
progressive
economist who has analyzed that
says that

03:19.833 --> 03:26.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the numbers don't add up, and
that's a promise
that cannot be kept. This is not
about math.

03:27.074 --> 03:32.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is about people's lives,
and we should
level with the American people
about what

03:32.279 --> 03:35.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we can do to make sure they get
quality, affordable
health care.

03:35.782 --> 03:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sanders countered
that Clinton's
claims are inaccurate, and he
talked up his

03:41.088 --> 03:47.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
idea of higher taxes on Wall
Street and having
the wealthy to pay for his
plans. It was part

03:47.527 --> 03:49.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of his stepped-up pitch to
minority voters.

03:49.830 --> 03:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Instead of
giving tax
breaks to billionaires, we are
going to create

03:54.101 --> 04:00.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
millions of jobs for low-income
kids, so they're
not hanging out on street
corners.

04:00.540 --> 04:05.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think when you give
low-income kids
-- African-American, white,
Latino kids -- the

04:06.012 --> 04:10.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opportunities to get their lives
together,
they are not going to end up in
jail. They're

04:10.684 --> 04:13.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
going to end up in the
productive economy,
which is where we want them.

04:14.054 --> 04:17.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sanders moved on
to campaign
in Minnesota today.

04:17.724 --> 04:20.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
OK. We're spinning around. Hi.
Hi.

04:20.994 --> 04:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the
Republican contenders
made stops all across South
Carolina. And

04:26.766 --> 04:33.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeb Bush's campaign called in
his brother
and former President George W.
Bush to join

04:33.306 --> 04:35.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
him in the state on Monday.

04:35.775 --> 04:41.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But front-runner Donald Trump
dismissed that
move during a rally in Louisiana
last night.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
And I see he is bringing his
brother in now.

04:43.550 --> 04:47.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's bringing -- he tried the
mother, who
is a very nice lady, I'm sure,
but he tried

04:47.420 --> 04:53.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the mother. That didn't work out
so good.
Now he is bringing in his
brother. I won't

04:53.426 --> 04:55.128 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
say anything.

04:55.228 --> 04:58.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the opposite
end of public
opinion polls, Ben Carson sought
to rally

04:59.065 --> 05:04.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his flagging support today at a
Faith and
Family Forum in Greenville,
South Carolina.

05:04.271 --> 05:07.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARSON (R), Presidential
Candidate: Bernie
Sanders and Hillary Clinton will
come along

05:07.307 --> 05:11.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and say, it's those evil rich
people and that's
what's causing you your problem.
No, it's

05:11.945 --> 05:16.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not the evil rich people. It's
the evil government,
and we need to get them under
the control.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.785 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

05:18.885 --> 05:23.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican voters
in South
Carolina will have their say on
February 20.

05:23.490 --> 05:28.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Democratic caucuses in
Nevada are that
same day.

05:28.695 --> 05:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And late today, word came that
former Virginia
Governor Jim Gilmore is dropping
out of the

05:33.533 --> 05:37.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican race. He had been a
nonfactor in
the voting thus far.

05:37.537 --> 05:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will turn to Shields and
Brooks for full
analysis of the race on both
sides and the

05:42.275 --> 05:45.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democratic debate later in the
program.

05:45.612 --> 05:50.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news, Wall
Street finally
broke a five-day losing streak,
as oil prices

05:50.317 --> 05:55.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surged 12 percent, and bank
prices bounced
back as well. The Dow Jones
industrial average

05:55.922 --> 06:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gained 313 points to close near
15974. The
Nasdaq rose 70, and the S&amp;P 500
added 35.

06:05.599 --> 06:11.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for the week, the Dow lost
about 1.5
percent, the S&amp;P was down nearly
1 percent,

06:11.972 --> 06:14.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the Nasdaq dropped half of a
percent.

06:14.841 --> 06:20.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Pakistan, the military
announced almost
a hundred hard-core terrorists
have been arrested

06:20.580 --> 06:26.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in raids nationwide. A spokesman
said they
include al-Qaida militants and
other extremists

06:26.686 --> 06:32.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
linked to major terror attacks.
The men were
taken into custody over the last
several months.

06:32.559 --> 06:38.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some had allegedly plotted to
break Daniel
Pearl's killer out of prison.
The Wall Street

06:38.265 --> 06:42.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Journal correspondent was
murdered in 2002.

06:42.269 --> 06:47.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The migrant crisis in Europe
seemed to move
closer to a breaking point
today. Austria

06:47.474 --> 06:53.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that it is about to reach
the maximum
number it plans to accept this
year. The Austrian

06:53.546 --> 06:58.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreign minister spoke during a
visit to Macedonia,
saying his government will help
countries

06:58.318 --> 07:01.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in the Balkans, where the
migrants arrive
first.

07:01.388 --> 07:06.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN KURZ, Austrian Foreign
Minister
(through translator): Macedonia
must be ready

07:06.626 --> 07:10.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to completely stop the entry of
migrants on
its borders, since it is the
first country

07:11.064 --> 07:15.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that migrants reach after
Greece. We know
it is a very difficult task, so
we have agreed

07:15.935 --> 07:20.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Austria will give its
support, not only
in personnel, like police and
army, but also

07:21.074 --> 07:22.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in equipment as well.

07:23.009 --> 07:27.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the
European Union
warned that it will suspend its
open borders

07:27.213 --> 07:33.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system for two years, unless
Greece can stem
the flow of migrants within the
next three

07:33.186 --> 07:35.121 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
months.

07:35.221 --> 07:40.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, President
Obama is granting
national monument status to
nearly 1.8 million

07:40.293 --> 07:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
acres of desert in the United
States. Today,
he designated three areas in
Southern California,

07:46.633 --> 07:52.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including the Castle Mountains,
the Mojave
trails, and Sand to Snow in the
Sonoran Desert.

07:52.939 --> 07:59.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House says the move
will maintain
the area's ecosystem and natural
resources.

08:00.046 --> 08:06.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on this Valentine's Day
weekend, police
in Iran have declared a
crackdown. They say

08:06.486 --> 08:11.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
retailers who run Valentine's
promotions will
be charged with promoting
decadent Western

08:11.991 --> 08:17.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
culture. In particular, that
means no special
events at coffee or ice cream
shops where

08:17.897 --> 08:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young lovers might exchange
gifts.

08:21.101 --> 08:26.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a fragile
agreement to pause the Syrian
civil war; how

08:26.973 --> 08:34.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Egypt's revolution has affected
women's rights;
a historic meeting 1,000 years
after the church's

08:34.514 --> 08:41.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
great schism; Mark Shields and
David Brooks
analyze a packed week of news;
plus, violins

08:41.154 --> 08:57.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from the Holocaust become
instruments of hope.

08:57.203 --> 09:01.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now hopes for the first steps in
the road
to peace in Syria.

09:01.441 --> 09:07.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. and Russia agreed on a
cease-fire
plan and a rush of humanitarian
aid to areas

09:07.580 --> 09:13.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the country ravaged by years
of war. But
there are doubts the pledges
will hold.

09:13.253 --> 09:17.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Our chief foreign affairs
correspondent, Margaret
Warner, reports.

09:17.257 --> 09:21.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: There was no
letup in the
intensity of Russian airstrikes
across Syria

09:22.061 --> 09:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today hours after major powers
made their
announcement in Munich.

09:27.033 --> 09:31.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry
and Russian
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
unveiled an

09:31.337 --> 09:35.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agreement by the -- quote --
"International
Syria Support Group" of 17
nations.

09:35.375 --> 09:42.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: This
progress has the potential,
fully implemented,

09:42.615 --> 09:48.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fully followed through on, to be
able to change
the daily lives of the Syrian
people.

09:48.788 --> 09:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Specifically,
the agreement
calls for implementing a
nationwide cessation

09:52.892 --> 09:58.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of hostilities a week from
today, immediate
acceleration and expansion of
humanitarian

09:58.531 --> 10:04.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aid deliveries into Syria, and
increased coordination
between the U.S. and Russia air
campaigns

10:04.437 --> 10:09.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against the Islamic State and
other terror
groups.

10:09.342 --> 10:14.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. had sought an immediate
full-scale
cease-fire in Syria, for the
first time since

10:14.147 --> 10:19.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fighting began in 2011. Kerry
acknowledged
this agreement falls well short.

10:19.619 --> 10:23.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY: A cease-fire, in the
minds of
many of the participants in this
particular

10:23.823 --> 10:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moment, connotes something far
more permanent
and far more reflective of sort
of an end

10:33.199 --> 10:36.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of conflict, if you will. And it
is distinctly
not that.

10:37.070 --> 10:42.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Moreover, the
agreement allows
continued airstrikes against
ISIS and similar

10:42.475 --> 10:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terror groups. That provision
could let Russia
continuing attacking any rebel
groups fighting

10:48.515 --> 10:52.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
against its ally, Syrian
President Bashar
al-Assad.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a point not lost on rebels
on the ground
today.

10:55.822 --> 11:00.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I do
not like the
idea of cease-fire, because it
might be for

11:00.326 --> 11:05.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our benefit only for a short
period of time.
But the things we're watching
right now, including

11:05.265 --> 11:10.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airstrikes in the northern and
southern rural
areas or in the liberated areas
that we are

11:10.136 --> 11:12.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in, this is not called
cease-fire.

11:12.171 --> 11:17.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: As if to
confirm it, Assad
told Agence France-Presse in an
interview

11:17.110 --> 11:22.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yesterday, before the deal was
announced,
that he means to retake the
whole of Syria.

11:22.415 --> 11:26.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said: "This is a goal we are
seeking to
achieve without any hesitation.
It makes no

11:27.020 --> 11:30.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sense for us to say that we will
give up any
part."

11:30.290 --> 11:35.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Indeed, the Syrian military and
its allies,
backed by Iran and by the
Russian airstrikes,

11:35.995 --> 11:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are now on the verge of cutting
off Aleppo,
the country's largest city. They
have severed

11:41.167 --> 11:46.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all but one of the rebels' vital
supply lines
to the north from Turkey, and
continue gaining

11:46.906 --> 11:52.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ground. That would leave Assad
stronger than
he has been in years.

11:52.845 --> 11:58.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All this leaves the various
rebel factions
in a precarious position. They
were not part

11:58.451 --> 12:03.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Munich agreement and must
now decide
whether to abide by what was
approved there.

12:03.456 --> 12:08.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the main opposition
umbrella group,
which supports the cease-fire
generally, called

12:08.895 --> 12:11.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this one a weak agreement.

12:11.230 --> 12:15.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
An adviser for the group
predicted the Russians
will intensify their bombing in
the coming

12:15.768 --> 12:20.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days, telling the "NewsHour":
"The Russians
are setting the pace on the
ground and they

12:20.139 --> 12:26.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
still will. The agreement
weakens us and moderate
allies, while allowing Assad to
set the terms."

12:26.813 --> 12:32.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the unrelenting human
toll mounts.
In Geneva today, officials today
convened

12:32.318 --> 12:37.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the first meeting of a
humanitarian task force
created under yesterday's
agreement.

12:37.123 --> 12:40.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAN EGELAND, Former U.N.
Emergency Relief
Coordinator: Convoys can go very
soon, if

12:41.027 --> 12:45.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and when we have the permission
and the green
light from the parties. And that
is what we

12:45.732 --> 12:52.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expect to get now, because we
hope to see
really the action taken by the
members of

12:52.372 --> 12:57.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the ISSG, who have influence on
both the government
and the armed opposition groups.

12:57.777 --> 13:04.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It cannot come
too soon for
the sea of refugees. Turkey says
up to 40,000

13:04.283 --> 13:09.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have arrived in camps north of
Aleppo, just
inside the Syrian border. And
more are flooding

13:09.989 --> 13:10.923 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

13:11.024 --> 13:18.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

13:18.231 --> 13:31.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Egyptian women
were on the
front lines of the revolution
that began in

13:31.511 --> 13:36.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tahrir Square. The five years
since have seen
the collective and individual
struggles of

13:36.849 --> 13:40.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
women in Egypt become a
revolution in itself.

13:40.319 --> 13:46.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, special correspondent
Nick Schifrin
presents the final story in our
series 5 Years

13:46.726 --> 13:48.528 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
On.

13:48.628 --> 13:55.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMINE EL-BARAMAWY, Egyptian
Activist: I
never joined any demonstrations
before. Once

13:55.635 --> 14:06.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I went to the square, I was
really happy.
A revolution is about hope, is
about change.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's about being better.

14:08.815 --> 14:14.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MONA AL-MASRY, Wife of Muslim
Brotherhood
Member (through translator): It
was a great

14:14.654 --> 14:19.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
victory. We managed to change
the way men
think, because they understand
that we are

14:19.959 --> 14:22.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now on the front line with them.

14:22.495 --> 14:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALMA SAID, Egyptian Activist:
People were
trying to create a different
society.

14:32.772 --> 14:42.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Five years ago,
Egyptians did
create a different society.
Throughout the

14:42.281 --> 14:44.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
revolution, women were at the
center of the
movement.

14:44.817 --> 14:49.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALMA SAID: Women went to Tahrir
Square and
imposed this situation. We're
going to sleep

14:49.756 --> 14:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the street like everyone else
and we are
going to organize and we are
part of the protests.

14:55.094 --> 14:58.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're going to lead protests
sometimes
and lead organizations.

14:58.898 --> 15:04.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In Tahrir Square,
female protesters
found a freedom they hoped the
culture would

15:04.370 --> 15:07.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
echo. Salma Said has been
protesting for 15
years.

15:07.707 --> 15:14.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALMA SAID: I have never been
surrounded with
so many Egyptian and
non-Egyptian men without

15:14.847 --> 15:21.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being harassed before. And, of
course, that
changed right after, even in the
protests,

15:21.487 --> 15:28.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because this utopia doesn't last
for even
the length of a full revolution.
It ends.

15:28.828 --> 15:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: No one knows that
more than
Yasmine El-Baramawy. She joined
hundreds of

15:33.666 --> 15:39.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thousands of protesters in
Tahrir Square.
And then, one night in late
2012, horror.

15:39.672 --> 15:44.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YASMINE EL-BARAMAWY: They
attacked me, and
they stripped me and they raped
me. And I

15:44.710 --> 15:50.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was beaten. It was really
violent. It lasted
for 70 minutes. If it was 15
minutes, if it

15:50.750 --> 15:59.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was 20 minutes, it was 30
minutes, I was learning
all that time. And it felt like
I had the

15:59.258 --> 16:03.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
experience of 30 years or 40
years in this
hour.

16:03.229 --> 16:08.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: From late 2012
through the
middle of 2013, human rights
groups say hundreds,

16:08.167 --> 16:13.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perhaps thousands of female
protesters were
sexually assaulted. In at least
some cases,

16:13.773 --> 16:17.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
activists believe the government
used violence
as a political weapon.

16:17.210 --> 16:23.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMINE EL-BARAMAWY: I didn't
doubt for a
moment that this is a
coincidence. I believe

16:23.182 --> 16:27.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is organized and it happened
to many other
women that day and later.

16:27.753 --> 16:34.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALMA SAID: The government was
on the television
saying, women who go to the
square deserve

16:34.260 --> 16:36.128 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this to happen.

16:36.229 --> 16:39.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: President Abdel
Fattah El-Sisi
has tried to strike a different
tone. He visited

16:39.532 --> 16:44.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a sexual assault victim in
hospital. But his
government defends a
controversial procedure

16:44.670 --> 16:46.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
called virginity tests.

16:46.672 --> 16:50.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAGLAA EL-ADLY, National Council
for Women:
It is some type of protection
for women themselves.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.378 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

16:52.478 --> 16:57.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Naglaa El-Adly is
on the government-sponsored
National Council for Women. In
2012, virginity

16:57.650 --> 17:03.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tests administered by security
officials sparked
massive protests. Human rights
defenders call

17:03.456 --> 17:05.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them an example of sexual
assault.

17:05.825 --> 17:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These tests are being forced
upon these women.
And they don't have a choice.
And they are

17:10.630 --> 17:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
physically invasive and
emotionally very difficult.

17:13.666 --> 17:18.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAGLAA EL-ADLY: Yes. It's a
rule. I have to
obey the rule and the law.

17:18.237 --> 17:22.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Female activists
knew, if they
wanted to continue protesting,
they couldn't

17:22.208 --> 17:27.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rely on police for protection.
So, they started
organizations that protected one
another.

17:28.047 --> 17:32.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can see one of the group's
bodyguards
in bright yellow vests trying to
defend female

17:32.184 --> 17:33.986 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
protesters.

17:34.086 --> 17:38.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALMA SAID: We saw horrible
things that I
never thought I would
experience. The third

17:38.791 --> 17:44.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anniversary of the revolution,
which is 25th
of Jan., 2013, there were 19
cases of rape

17:44.530 --> 17:53.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the square. I personally went
to the hospital
with a girl who has been raped
with knives

17:53.439 --> 17:55.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the square. And I never
forgot that.

17:55.875 --> 18:00.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But violence
against women
is not limited to protests. A
U.N. study found

18:00.379 --> 18:04.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
99 percent of Egyptian women
suffered sexual
harassment or assault.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REEM WAEL, Director, HarassMap:
All women
face sexual harassment. It is an
endemic problem.

18:09.088 --> 18:13.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The women's
rights group HarassMap
is trying to fight the violence.
Its Web site

18:14.060 --> 18:16.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
features locations where people
have been
harassed.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Reem Wael is the executive
director.

18:18.764 --> 18:24.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MDNM-REEM WAEL: It helps us
monitor the
trends of sexual harassment and
use this information

18:24.337 --> 18:26.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to debunk all the stereotypes.

18:26.238 --> 18:29.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: At Cairo
University, the group
helped create the first sexual
misconduct

18:29.875 --> 18:31.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
policy in the Middle East.

18:31.811 --> 18:36.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the streets, HarassMap teamed
up with Uber
to educate drivers how to avoid
harassing

18:37.049 --> 18:42.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
customers. Drivers now stick
these harassment-free
zone stickers onto their cars.
And the group

18:42.321 --> 18:47.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
launched a TV campaign after
Egypt passed
its first sexual harassment law
last summer.

18:47.793 --> 18:52.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ads empower women to report
harassment.
They deliver the message the
fault is never

18:52.932 --> 18:54.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the victims.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONDOS SHABAYEK, Theater Group
Leader: We
try to remove the stigma of the
stories.

18:56.635 --> 19:01.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Sondos Shabayek
tries to turn
harassment victims into
storytellers. She

19:01.440 --> 19:05.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leads a theater troupe that
recrates moments
of harassment on stage.

19:05.611 --> 19:15.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONDOS SHABAYEK: Something that
was a source
of shame becomes a source of
empowerment.

19:15.254 --> 19:20.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Mona al-Masry had
found empowerment
in her own home. Her husband is
a senior member

19:21.060 --> 19:26.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Muslim Brotherhood. He is
in jail,
sentenced to death. Before the
revolution,

19:26.198 --> 19:32.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muslim Brotherhood men led
protests. But with
the men silenced, women are
leading, and getting

19:32.371 --> 19:34.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
arrested.

19:34.306 --> 19:42.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MONA AL-MASRY: The women of the
Muslim Brotherhood
once knew an easier life. Now we
know of a

19:43.015 --> 19:48.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
harder, more powerful life. The
future is
beautiful and better, and we
raise our daughters

19:48.687 --> 19:50.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to understand this.

19:50.389 --> 19:55.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Do you want to
introduce me
to your children?

19:55.895 --> 20:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her two daughters, 7-year-old
Aisha and 12-year-old
Tasbeeh, are learning her
lessons.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TASBEEH AL-MASRY, Daughter of
Muslim Brotherhood
Member (through translator): I
learned that,

20:05.805 --> 20:08.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when difficult things happen, I
should be
strong.

20:08.607 --> 20:15.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But, in this
family, mom's
students are not her daughters.
Youssef is

20:16.048 --> 20:17.950 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
15.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YOUSSEF AL-MASRY, Son of Muslim
Brotherhood
Member (through translator): I
have been learning

20:21.720 --> 20:25.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from her since I was born. She
taught me how
to be a man.

20:25.624 --> 20:36.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: How do you feel
when you hear
him say that? I can see you
getting emotional.

20:36.836 --> 20:42.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMINE EL-BARAMAWY: Women are
supposed to
be weaker, but I don't see it
this way at

20:42.374 --> 20:44.110 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
all.

20:44.210 --> 20:48.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: There may be no
woman, no person
who's changing society's
expectations than

20:48.547 --> 20:54.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yasmine El-Baramawy. During her
attack, outnumbered
by more than a hundred, she
found strength

20:54.353 --> 20:56.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
she didn't know she had.

20:56.155 --> 21:02.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMINE EL-BARAMAWY: I changed
from defending
to attacking. I had this feeling
that the

21:02.361 --> 21:06.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people must know and we can't be
silent.

21:06.599 --> 21:11.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But before going
public, she
had to teach that lesson to her
own family.

21:11.570 --> 21:17.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMINE EL-BARAMAWY: When I told
my father,
he said, no, don't go on TV. And
he threatened

21:17.676 --> 21:20.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me that he will deny I'm his
daughter.

21:20.579 --> 21:26.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But she was
stronger than he
was. She went on TV to become
the first Egyptian

21:26.952 --> 21:32.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman to publicly describe her
rape. Later,
she became the first Egyptian
woman to prosecute

21:32.258 --> 21:37.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
her attackers. Her father
learned the lesson
when her entire family supported
her.

21:37.496 --> 21:42.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMINE EL-BARAMAWY: They said,
your girl
is a hero. And he became proud
of me.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.336 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

21:44.436 --> 21:47.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: She became the
face of a global
rally against sexual assault.
Hundreds of

21:47.907 --> 21:50.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thousands celebrated her
courage.

21:50.776 --> 22:05.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMINE EL-BARAMAWY: Everybody
avoids talking
about this, but when I did it,
it became sort

22:05.457 --> 22:10.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of a power to change the
culture.

22:10.262 --> 22:20.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I felt the need to say, I'm
someone. I have
a job and I have a life and I do
many things,

22:21.073 --> 22:34.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I have a brain I use, I have
opinions,
I have many things. I'm not just
a victim

22:34.153 --> 22:35.521 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of that.

22:35.621 --> 22:38.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Nick Schifrin,
"PBS NewsHour,"
Cairo.

22:38.557 --> 22:43.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can watch
all three
of Nick's reports from Egypt in
our series

22:43.362 --> 23:02.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
5 Years On. You can find them on
our World
page at PBS.org/NewsHour.

23:02.114 --> 23:09.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This afternoon in Havana, at
Jose Marti Airport,
a meeting 1,000 years in the
making. Pope

23:09.488 --> 23:14.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Francis met with Patriarch
Kirill of the Eastern
Orthodox Church, the first
meeting between

23:14.960 --> 23:21.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the leaders of Christianity's
two largest
churches since 1054, when a
schism split the

23:21.867 --> 23:23.669 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ancient church.

23:23.769 --> 23:29.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The meeting on
neutral ground
was decades in the planning. The
leaders met

23:30.042 --> 23:35.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for two hours behind closed
doors, and later
signed a joint declaration
decrying persecution

23:35.180 --> 23:37.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Christians around the world.

23:37.416 --> 23:43.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We explore this historic moment,
and its impact
going forward, with His
Beatitude Metropolitan

23:43.322 --> 23:47.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tikhon. He is the Orthodox
archbishop of Washington,
D.C., and the primate of the
Orthodox Church

23:47.960 --> 23:53.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in America, its senior-most
leader in the
U.S. and Canada. And His
Eminence Theodore

23:53.599 --> 23:59.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the
Roman Catholic
archbishop emeritus of
Washington, D.C.

23:59.271 --> 24:04.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, for someone who hasn't
been following
the 1,000-year-long rift between
these two

24:04.610 --> 24:08.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
branches, why is this so
important, and why
did it happen now?

24:08.747 --> 24:11.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THE MOST BLESSED TIKHON, Primate
of the Orthodox
Church in America: There's been
attempts to

24:11.650 --> 24:16.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bridge that gap over the years,
none of which
have really been successful.

24:16.488 --> 24:24.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the last, you know,
number of years,
the last few decades, the
groundwork for such

24:24.296 --> 24:33.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a possible discussion has been
taking place.
So, while this meeting may seem
like a somewhat

24:33.706 --> 24:42.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new or surprising event, it has
been discussed
with both Pope Francis'
predecessors and patriarchals,

24:42.481 --> 24:47.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but somehow the particular
meeting that is
happening today in Cuba didn't
take place.

24:47.386 --> 24:54.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's -- there have certainly
been relations
between the Roman Catholic and
Orthodox churches

24:54.493 --> 25:00.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during the past 1,000 years, but
there has
been a lot of both theological
and ecclesiastical

25:00.366 --> 25:07.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
differences that need to be
worked out, as
well as just the simple physical
separation

25:07.573 --> 25:12.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that has sort of contributed to
sort of a
great divide.

25:12.211 --> 25:21.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a great opportunity now in
this time of
strife in the world to see two
great world

25:21.186 --> 25:27.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaders come together and begin
more -- perhaps
more formally, a dialogue.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Your Eminence,
why now?

25:29.595 --> 25:31.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARDINAL THEODORE MCCARRICK,
Archbishop of
Washington, D.C.: Well, I think
it's special

25:31.597 --> 25:35.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for many reasons, as the
beatitude mentioned
many of them.

25:35.134 --> 25:40.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But many of us think of the
Russian Orthodox
Church as the church of the
martyrs, because

25:41.006 --> 25:47.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during the communist age, it was
very, very
difficult. It's a great
blessing, actually,

25:48.080 --> 25:56.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the Russian people kept
faithful to the
church. There were -- it wasn't
easy to be

25:56.889 --> 26:03.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a fervent Orthodox Christian in
the days of
communism.

26:03.128 --> 26:09.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, that's all passed now,
and the church
has come into its own. And we
see so many

26:09.768 --> 26:15.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the people who suffered over
those years
coming back and very fervently
and very wonderfully

26:15.407 --> 26:20.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
saying, we are Orthodox
Christians, we know
who we are.

26:20.712 --> 26:25.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what a great time to do it.
It's a good
moment because there are a lot
of good things

26:25.384 --> 26:29.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happening, and it's a good
moment because
there are a lot of bad things
happening, and

26:29.121 --> 26:31.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we all have to stay together
more than we
ever have before.

26:31.490 --> 26:34.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And what are
some of the
bad things? What are the
concerns that your

26:34.226 --> 26:36.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
two churches agree on?

26:36.228 --> 26:42.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THE MOST BLESSED TIKHON: Well,
certainly,
I think what you will see from
the joint declaration

26:42.868 --> 26:48.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
from today's meeting, the
persecution of Christians
in the Middle East.

26:48.207 --> 26:54.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, really, the persecution of
all religious
minorities in every context, I
think, has

26:54.279 --> 27:01.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been certainly a concern for the
pope, and,
you know, for Orthodox
Christians as well.

27:01.420 --> 27:09.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The care for our brothers,
whether they are
Christians or not, should be
something that's

27:09.194 --> 27:10.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
foremost in our hearts.

27:11.096 --> 27:16.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, the Orthodox, not
only during
communist times, but in
previous, you know,

27:17.069 --> 27:22.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decades and centuries, have
often lived in
various contexts of persecution
and strife,

27:22.741 --> 27:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but also living together with
Muslims, for
example, in various countries,
where -- the

27:30.249 --> 27:39.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
very places where strife
sometimes erupts
have also been places where
people have genuinely

27:39.124 --> 27:47.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tried to live together and be
together, regardless
of their religious or ethnic
background.

27:47.232 --> 27:53.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Your Eminence,
1,000 years
ago, when this split happened,
the Roman Empire

27:53.238 --> 27:59.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was torn in two, there were
cultural differences
that were allowed to harden,
linguistic differences.

28:00.012 --> 28:03.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The world is in many ways a much
smaller place
now.

28:03.916 --> 28:09.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What's the likelihood of
potentially a reunion
between these two churches? How
long be will

28:09.922 --> 28:11.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that take? Another 1,000 years?

28:11.657 --> 28:15.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARDINAL THEODORE MCCARRICK: I
don't have
my crystal ball with me on that
one.

28:15.193 --> 28:19.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do have a -- we do have
the Gospels
with us, and we hear the lord
Jesus saying

28:19.865 --> 28:29.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that all may be one. So, our
Orthodox brethren
and sisters and Catholic people,
the Christians,

28:29.441 --> 28:34.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the whole world that accepts
Jesus Christ
as lord listens to him saying
that all the

28:34.846 --> 28:36.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
time: I want you to be one.

28:36.882 --> 28:42.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, as we look around now,
with all the
troubles, with all the
difficulties, with

28:42.154 --> 28:47.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the persecutions in so many
parts of the
world, this is the time to be
together. This

28:47.259 --> 28:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the time to say, we are
together. If there's
any time when we want to get
together and

28:54.566 --> 28:59.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
embrace each other in our faith,
that time
is now.

28:59.371 --> 29:04.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Your
Beatitude, it seems
that, back then, there were
political concerns.

29:04.876 --> 29:11.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now there are also political
concerns, especially
in regions like Russia and the
Ukraine.

29:11.617 --> 29:17.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do churches put this behind
them and say,
for the greater good, we need to
make these

29:18.023 --> 29:23.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compromises and we need to --
you have a 100-,
a 1,000-year horizon, not just
who's elected

29:23.729 --> 29:25.530 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
next?

29:25.631 --> 29:29.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THE MOST BLESSED TIKHON: I think
what we see
today with the meeting with the
pope and the

29:29.301 --> 29:32.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
patriarch is, it's a personal
meeting.

29:32.237 --> 29:40.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, regardless of all the
preparation
and the churches that sort of
are behind them

29:40.345 --> 29:49.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that they lead, this is a
meeting of two Christians
in a neutral location, but
coming -- taking

29:50.055 --> 29:55.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the time to meet together and to
just be with
one another.

29:55.160 --> 30:02.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regardless of what plans might
be set in motion
for the future, whether it's
another 50 years

30:02.501 --> 30:09.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or 100 years, we hope that, you
know, the
dialogue will continue. But the
personal relations,

30:09.307 --> 30:15.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think, are so crucial,
especially, as you
say, when the world we live in
is so small.

30:15.313 --> 30:19.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, really, those personal
contexts are really
crucial.

30:19.951 --> 30:22.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Same question
to you.

30:22.587 --> 30:28.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARDINAL THEODORE MCCARRICK:
It's a world
whose horrors call for harmony
among those

30:28.760 --> 30:30.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who really believe in what we
believe in.

30:31.029 --> 30:37.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We believe in the beatitudes. We
believe in
the position of the lord Jesus
in the world.

30:38.070 --> 30:43.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We believe the Holy Spirit is
inspiring us
all to come and work together
and to be together

30:43.875 --> 30:45.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and to have this one family.

30:46.011 --> 30:50.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Holy Father is always talking
about family
these days, and maybe the
greatest family

30:50.382 --> 30:55.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of all is the family of the
Christians. This
is the time now for us to say,
OK, we are

30:55.587 --> 31:01.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- we know who we are. We are
the children
of the lord's. And we know who
our brothers

31:01.460 --> 31:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and sisters are. We could have a
wonderful
world here, and that's the world
God wants

31:05.864 --> 31:07.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
us to have.

31:07.733 --> 31:08.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Your Eminence,
Your Beatitude, thanks so much
for joining

31:09.067 --> 31:09.935 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

31:10.035 --> 31:13.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARDINAL THEODORE MCCARRICK:
Thank you.

31:13.538 --> 31:17.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE MOST BLESSED TIKHON: Thank
you.

31:17.943 --> 31:21.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARDINAL THEODORE MCCARRICK:
Thank you.

31:21.646 --> 31:25.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE MOST BLESSED TIKHON: Thank
you.

31:26.084 --> 31:31.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Democrats
faced off on
the debate stage last night, and
now the focus

31:31.723 --> 31:35.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the race for the White House
turns to South
Carolina and Nevada.

31:35.994 --> 31:40.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With that, we turn to the
analysis of Shields
and Brooks. That's syndicated
columnist Mark

31:40.565 --> 31:44.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shields and New York Times
columnist David
Brooks.

31:44.469 --> 31:49.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And welcome, gentlemen. Some of
us are back
from Milwaukee, and glad to be
back.

31:49.141 --> 31:54.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark, Tuesday -- it was only
three nights
ago -- Bernie Sanders won the
New Hampshire

31:54.746 --> 31:59.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primary big time. How did that
change the
race, how did it change the
dynamics, do you

31:59.951 --> 32:01.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
think, in last night's debate?

32:01.887 --> 32:05.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, it changed
the race, Judy,
by guaranteeing that we will
probably have

32:05.757 --> 32:12.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a race in June, that there will
be a Bernie
Sanders/Hillary Clinton
competition in California.

32:12.497 --> 32:18.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It guaranteed Bernie Sanders
$6.5 million
in the first 19 hours after the
polls closed.

32:18.804 --> 32:24.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's got a national following.
He's got a
national treasury. It puts her
at a disadvantage.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It gave him credibility.

32:26.812 --> 32:32.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, going in last night, Hillary
Clinton,
on the heels of a thrashing 48
hours earlier,

32:32.684 --> 32:39.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was in a position of trying to
bring him back
down to earth as they head
South. And I thought

32:39.825 --> 32:42.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she arrived, surprisingly, with
her poise
and confidence intact.

32:42.761 --> 32:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How did you see
the dynamics
going into the debate last
night?

32:46.832 --> 32:50.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, going into
the debate,
it was a question of how
aggressive she would

32:50.735 --> 32:53.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get, and would she get overly
aggressive or
not?

32:53.438 --> 32:56.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I thought her demeanor,
especially in the
first half-hour, 45 minutes, was
quite good.

32:56.842 --> 33:00.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She can be sometimes lecturing.
But she was
more explaining, because -- you
were there,

33:00.912 --> 33:01.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Judy, so you might know this.

33:01.780 --> 33:02.414 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:02.514 --> 33:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I know this.

33:04.249 --> 33:07.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: That they were --
it was a debate
over pragmatism vs. vision.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

33:09.487 --> 33:11.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: And she was
saying, well, you
know, that's not reality. You
can't start

33:11.389 --> 33:14.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the health care system as if we
don't have
a health care system; 100
million people have

33:14.292 --> 33:16.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their employer health care. You
just can't
do that.

33:16.328 --> 33:19.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so she was trying to explain
reality to
them. And I thought she was
quite effective.

33:20.065 --> 33:25.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, toward the end, one of
have the central
facts in the structure of the
race, the first

33:25.604 --> 33:31.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is pragmatism vs. his radical
vision, but
the second is, on what ground is
this debate

33:31.843 --> 33:33.612 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being fought?

33:33.712 --> 33:37.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because he has such a strong
narrative
and his campaign is built around
that narrative,

33:37.315 --> 33:42.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his life is built around that
narrative, it's
always fought on his ground. And
she has no

33:42.754 --> 33:47.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
narrative. And she's trying to
create one
with Obama, but that's Obama's
narrative.

33:47.926 --> 33:52.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think, as the domestic
part went
on, he sort of gained strength
just by the

33:52.797 --> 33:54.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
structure of the way the
argument is.

33:54.766 --> 33:58.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Mark, she
does keep hammering
-- and she did it last night --
it's just

33:58.303 --> 34:02.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not practical to say you're
going to completely
have the government take over
health care.

34:02.807 --> 34:07.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not practical to have all
college paid
for by the government.

34:07.178 --> 34:11.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: She did. She did.
And I agree
with David on her tone. Her tone
was far better

34:11.850 --> 34:19.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than it had been previously. It
was well-modulated.
It wasn't adversarial or
confrontational.

34:19.391 --> 34:25.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Judy, this is the 13th
presidential campaign
I have either worked in or
covered. And there's

34:25.430 --> 34:31.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a first question that every
potential White
House aspirant has to address.
Some of them

34:31.469 --> 34:33.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
don't. It's revealed.

34:33.405 --> 34:37.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, why do you want to
be president
and what real difference is it
going to make

34:37.108 --> 34:40.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if you're president, rather than
anybody else
who is running?

34:40.779 --> 34:46.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders, as David said,
has a compelling
reason, that the deck is stacked
against people

34:47.085 --> 34:53.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the rich, by the powerful.
They do it through
the campaign finance system. The
top 1 percent,

34:53.625 --> 34:58.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it tilts in their favor, and
working Americans
have gotten the short end of the
stick.

34:58.997 --> 35:06.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton doesn't have a
theme. Her
campaign lacks a theme. So, it
became last

35:06.204 --> 35:11.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night, and it seems today, that
the argument
is not why Hillary Clinton
should be president.

35:11.376 --> 35:14.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's why Bernie Sanders
shouldn't be president.

35:14.412 --> 35:19.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that seems to be now the --
but it's still
a campaign that doesn't have an
overarching

35:19.684 --> 35:22.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
theme. There's nothing there to
say, let's
march.

35:22.220 --> 35:28.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, when she
says, "I'm not
a one-issue candidate," David,
is that half-a-theme

35:28.693 --> 35:30.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for her or...

35:30.628 --> 35:31.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, that's
half-a-theme, but
sometimes when someone gives you
nine explanations

35:31.997 --> 35:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for why they did something, they
have got
no real explanation.

35:35.100 --> 35:39.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you're writing a book,
for example,
weirdly, a book is about one
thing, and a

35:39.170 --> 35:42.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign is the same thing. It's
about one
thing. And she doesn't have that
one thing.

35:42.607 --> 35:46.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What she is trying to do now is
make Obama
her one thing. But she's trying
to borrow

35:46.878 --> 35:48.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obama's narrative.

35:48.813 --> 35:53.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's sort of popular. There
was a YouGov
poll of Democratic primary
voters as if Obama

35:53.885 --> 35:59.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was running against these two.
And the results
were Obama 56, Clinton 20,
Sanders 17. So,

35:59.824 --> 36:04.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's popular. So, that is a good
thing. But
it's a substitute for her own
explanation.

36:04.896 --> 36:10.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think the Obama moment,
to me, was
one of the crucial moments of
the night, but

36:10.402 --> 36:12.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's still not a justification
for herself.

36:12.570 --> 36:16.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, the Clinton
campaign,
Mark, is saying, well, we're
going into these

36:16.775 --> 36:20.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states, South Carolina, Nevada,
that are much
more diverse. This is going to
be much more

36:20.612 --> 36:22.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
friendly territory for us.

36:22.781 --> 36:25.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that something that could
work in her favor?

36:25.383 --> 36:29.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, it certainly
should be.
And it is an explanation for
her. She's the

36:29.854 --> 36:33.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only candidate in history who
has been the
wife of one president, and yet
she is surgically

36:33.725 --> 36:36.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
joined at the hip with the
incumbent president.

36:36.227 --> 36:42.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And President Obama is
enormously popular
among democrats everywhere,
especially among

36:43.001 --> 36:48.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minority Democrats, particularly
African-American
Democrats. And she's not only
got his back.

36:48.873 --> 36:54.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's got his side. She's got
his foot. She's
got -- she really is running as
not simply

36:54.679 --> 37:01.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Barack Obama's -- his defender,
his apologist,
his protector against Bernie
Sanders' occasional

37:01.586 --> 37:03.288 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
criticism of him.

37:03.388 --> 37:07.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, no, I think these are -- no,
these are
-- demographically, these are
territories

37:07.692 --> 37:12.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which should be more welcoming
and more friendly
to her. But we don't have any
measurements

37:12.797 --> 37:20.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the states prior to sort of
the earthquake
of New Hampshire and the
standoff of Iowa.

37:20.338 --> 37:29.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're
basically saying
that this theme problem that she
has may override

37:29.481 --> 37:33.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any advantage she could have,
David, the fact
there are more African-Americans
in South

37:33.251 --> 37:36.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Carolina, they're more disposed
to vote for
Clinton than for Sanders.

37:36.354 --> 37:39.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it's
obviously getting
harder for Sanders. There's no
question about

37:39.557 --> 37:41.259 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

37:41.359 --> 37:44.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As many people have said on this
program,
Iowa and New Hampshire were his
best states.

37:45.029 --> 37:49.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nonetheless, does he stop? I
don't think he
does. You know, if there's an
African-American

37:49.968 --> 37:52.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- the first African-American
president is
running for president,
obviously, there's

37:52.537 --> 37:56.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be a surge of pride and
affiliation
in the African-American
community.

37:56.808 --> 38:04.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But most people, whether they're
Latino, African-American,
white or anybody else,
pocketbook issues matter.

38:04.349 --> 38:08.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so if Bernie Sanders comes
in and is compelling
on pocketbook issues -- I
personally don't

38:08.820 --> 38:11.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think he's compelling at all --
I think he's
completely unrealistic -- but if
he is compelling

38:11.956 --> 38:17.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to them, then I think there will
be some spanning
of he will win Latino votes, he
will win African-American

38:17.328 --> 38:18.663 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
votes.

38:18.763 --> 38:20.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he doesn't have to win all
of them, but
he will win a chunk.

38:20.665 --> 38:26.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: That is Tad
Devine, his principal
strategist's point, just as
David said.

38:26.171 --> 38:31.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie doesn't have to win a
majority of African-American
votes. He just has to win enough
to join the

38:31.176 --> 38:37.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coalition of whites. Judy, his
strength among
young voters, everybody in the
political world

38:37.348 --> 38:42.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
just marvels at, this
74-year-old grandfather,
kind of crotchety and all the
rest of it,

38:42.754 --> 38:43.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but it's remarkable.

38:43.621 --> 38:45.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Eighty-some
percent.

38:45.590 --> 38:48.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Eighty percent.
And he's leading
in one national -- established
national survey

38:48.960 --> 38:52.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
35 points among voters under the
age of 35.

38:52.830 --> 38:59.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is impressive. And these
are people who,
if you talk to people who have
surveyed them,

38:59.504 --> 39:04.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who really do feel that it's
stacked against
them, so his message is
resonating across

39:04.676 --> 39:06.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the generational divide.

39:06.444 --> 39:09.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, let's
talk for a
minute about the Republicans,
David.

39:09.113 --> 39:13.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump came -- talking
about New Hampshire,
came roaring back in New
Hampshire, disappointed

39:14.085 --> 39:22.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Iowa. Is he now the man to
beat? It looks
like we're just looking at one
candidate shooting

39:22.160 --> 39:25.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at another, shooting at another,
shooting
at another right now on the
Republican side.

39:25.129 --> 39:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, you would
have to say
he's the man to beat because he
did well in

39:28.366 --> 39:30.201 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every group.

39:30.301 --> 39:33.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so he did well among
moderates, among
conservatives, among people who
are pro-immigration,

39:33.371 --> 39:36.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who are anti-immigration.
So if you're
looking for a lane to get at
him, he did well

39:37.008 --> 39:39.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in all the groups. So you can't
find a lane.

39:39.944 --> 39:45.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having said that, South Carolina
has a couple
of things that New Hampshire
doesn't have,

39:45.717 --> 39:49.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tons of evangelical Christians
and tons of
people who call themselves
extremely conservative.

39:49.988 --> 39:55.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Ted Cruz is looking -- he's
looking much
more promising, not only in
South Carolina,

39:55.660 --> 39:58.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but in the SEC primary states a
little while
later.

39:58.663 --> 40:03.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, for the next little
while, it wouldn't
be surprising if we're talking
about Cruz

40:03.234 --> 40:04.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Trump, Cruz and Trump, Cruz
and Trump.

40:04.435 --> 40:06.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you see?

40:06.204 --> 40:10.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think Trump's
victory in New
Hampshire was enormously
impressive.

40:10.775 --> 40:17.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was disappointing in Iowa. He
was knocked
off-stride. He really didn't
have his game

40:17.849 --> 40:21.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going for the first few days,
and yet then
he started building the rallies.
The rallies

40:22.053 --> 40:27.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
translated into enthusiasm,
translated into
votes. He carried men. He
carried women. He

40:27.492 --> 40:29.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
carried -- he carried every age
group.

40:29.861 --> 40:33.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has got 35 percent. We have
always said
he had a lower ceiling. The
ceiling is getting

40:33.398 --> 40:38.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
higher. He got 35 percent
basically across
the board. I think -- and it
couldn't have

40:38.636 --> 40:43.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turned out better for them. John
Kasich, who
did the traditional New
Hampshire thing, 106

40:43.574 --> 40:49.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town meetings, won one out of
six votes, and
emerged to fight another day,
but not with

40:49.781 --> 40:52.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any great strength in the South.

40:52.550 --> 40:57.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's no establishment
figure around
whom they coalesce. The
candidate whom the

40:57.288 --> 41:03.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
establishment most favored and
Democrats most
feared, Marco Rubio, got caught
in the debate,

41:03.828 --> 41:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where Chris Christie, looking
like an 18-wheeler
coming down the highway with his
high beams,

41:09.233 --> 41:12.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marco Rubio looked like Bambi
caught in those
headlights.

41:12.337 --> 41:17.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just think whether he can
recover from
that, I'm not sure, because
everybody knew

41:17.475 --> 41:20.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was going to happen. It
happened, and he
didn't handle it well.

41:20.778 --> 41:24.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you Rubio
right now?
And let's talk just quickly
about Jeb Bush.

41:25.083 --> 41:29.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's bringing in his brother,
the former President
George W. Bush, on Monday. Could
that make

41:29.654 --> 41:31.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a difference for him? And how do
you see Rubio?

41:31.622 --> 41:34.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think Rubio can
recover. I
don't think this is a recurring
moment, because

41:34.926 --> 41:36.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rick Perry was genuinely not a
great communicator.

41:36.861 --> 41:41.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Marco Rubio genuinely is a
good communicator.
So, as he performs well in
future debates,

41:41.165 --> 41:46.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he can cover over that
very bad moment
he had. Not saying he will, but
it's possible,

41:46.704 --> 41:48.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just because that's his natural
strength.

41:48.773 --> 41:55.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for George Bush, people like
George Bush,
but he's not of the moment. The
moment is

41:55.880 --> 42:01.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an angry moment. And so I don't
think he will
help Jeb. If Jeb wants to run,
as he seems

42:01.185 --> 42:05.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be doing, as the anti-Trump
-- and maybe
-- let's hope there is an
emotional recoil

42:05.189 --> 42:10.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- then George W. Bush can help
him, because
he is sort of a genial, good
guy.

42:11.062 --> 42:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm not sure it will -- I
just don't feel
a lot of excitement building
around George

42:16.033 --> 42:17.301 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
W. Bush.

42:17.402 --> 42:19.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I want to say
something good
about Jeb Bush.

42:19.303 --> 42:23.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In that debate last Saturday
night, the Republican
debate, Donald Trump made one of
the more

42:23.107 --> 42:27.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reckless statements of all he's
made about,
I'm not going to bring back
water-boarding,

42:27.678 --> 42:29.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm going to do worse than that.

42:29.914 --> 42:36.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Ted Cruz was slippery. He
wouldn't take
him on. Marco Rubio went mute.
Jeb Bush was

42:36.354 --> 42:41.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the one person who stood up and
said, that's
against the law of the United
States and that

42:41.325 --> 42:46.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is -- it's a dishonor to our
troops, it's
a dishonor to our values, and I
would uphold

42:46.764 --> 42:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it. And for that, I give him
credit.

42:49.033 --> 42:52.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I agree. This is not a
surrogates year,
I don't think.

42:52.870 --> 42:55.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, one
other candidate
I want to ask you about on the
Republican

42:55.239 --> 42:56.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
side is John Kasich.

42:57.074 --> 43:02.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's somebody who didn't do
well, didn't
even compete, really, David, in
Iowa, but

43:02.747 --> 43:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he came in decently, what, third
or fourth,
in New Hampshire. And now he's
really trying

43:09.287 --> 43:11.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to carve out a lane for himself.

43:11.289 --> 43:14.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, he faces the
Southern problem,
that we go South, where he's
naturally going

43:15.092 --> 43:19.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be the weakest. But if he can
hang around
to the Midwest maybe, he can do
well.

43:19.630 --> 43:24.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, the Trump thing is
so much about
manners. And if you can have
somebody with

43:24.869 --> 43:29.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the opposite manners, I have to
feel there
is a group of Republicans there
who want that,

43:29.173 --> 43:33.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who want civility, who want
decency, someone
who won't be wearing on a dinner
party.

43:33.578 --> 43:36.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We used to say this about Chris
Christie.
For the first 30 minutes of the
dinner party,

43:36.981 --> 43:41.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're like thrilled he's there,
and then
the last 45, really like time to
go, Chris.

43:42.019 --> 43:46.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think -- I still think
that may happen
with Trump. People will just get
wary of the

43:46.591 --> 43:49.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
act. I have been wrong about
this for eight
months. I realize that.

43:49.494 --> 43:51.295 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:51.395 --> 43:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But if there's
going to be an
alternative, it would be
somebody with Kasich's

43:55.766 --> 44:02.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
manner, which is genial, and
then also, substantively,
pragmatic. It's not been a great
year on either

44:02.206 --> 44:06.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party for pragmatism and for
actually getting
stuff done. But maybe that will
kick in. It

44:06.978 --> 44:08.813 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
normally does.

44:08.913 --> 44:12.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But is it --
quickly, how do
you read Kasich? And, Mark, how
do these guy

44:12.984 --> 44:18.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knows who they need to destroy
in all this?
Should they all be shooting at
Trump or should

44:18.422 --> 44:19.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they go after one...

44:19.457 --> 44:21.359 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:21.459 --> 44:24.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I do think
that the debate
in South Carolina will be
different, because...

44:24.195 --> 44:25.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The debate
tomorrow night,
thing Republican debate.

44:25.997 --> 44:27.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Tomorrow night.

44:27.899 --> 44:31.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In New Hampshire, Trump sat at
the head of
the table eating his prime rib
while the others

44:31.269 --> 44:36.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were having food fights among
themselves.
Now, in South Carolina, Cruz
understands,

44:36.607 --> 44:40.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio understands they have got
to take on
Trump. Jeb Bush has taken on
Trump.

44:40.645 --> 44:44.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that will be -- the
problem is that
everybody who has taken on Trump
has paid

44:44.682 --> 44:51.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dearly for it up to now. But I
-- Ted Cruz's
problem is very simple. He won 8
percent of

44:51.856 --> 44:58.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nonevangelical voters in New
Hampshire. That's
all. And he's got to do better.

44:58.596 --> 45:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David's right. There are more
conservative
voters in South Carolina, but
he's got to

45:02.800 --> 45:08.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engage Trump and be willing to
go toe-to-toe
with him. And Rubio seems a
little bit liberated

45:08.372 --> 45:13.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since on election night he did
take full responsibility
for what happened, which in
itself is refreshing.

45:13.644 --> 45:17.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There is so much
to look at,
look for. And we can't wait to
see it all

45:17.815 --> 45:20.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and we can't to have you back
next Friday.

45:20.451 --> 45:26.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you so much.

45:26.557 --> 45:34.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
David Brooks,
thank you.

45:34.732 --> 45:41.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A collection of violins largely
silent for
seven decades is giving voice to
the horrors

45:41.172 --> 45:43.074 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the Holocaust.

45:43.174 --> 45:49.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
David C. Barnett from
Cleveland's Public Television
Station WVIZ's Ideastream tells
the story

45:49.981 --> 45:56.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
behind the instruments that were
once owned
by the inmates of Nazi
concentration camps.

45:56.287 --> 46:04.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Stanley
Bernath has a vivid
memory of his arrival at the
Mauthausen concentration

46:05.029 --> 46:10.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
camp in 1944. Bernath and his
fellow Jewish
prisoners were shipped to the
camp in a cattle

46:10.801 --> 46:12.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
car, and marched to the front
gate.

46:12.703 --> 46:18.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STANLEY BERNATH, Holocaust
Survivor: The huge
gate with a name on top in
German, "Arbeit

46:19.043 --> 46:25.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Macht Frei," meaning work will
make you free.
As we entered, there is an
orchestra playing

46:25.516 --> 46:31.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Beethoven. It was an
unbelievable sight. People
were being killed and beaten,
and there's

46:31.822 --> 46:33.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an orchestra playing.

46:33.724 --> 46:38.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: That's a story
that Israeli
violin maker Amnon Weinstein has
heard before.

46:38.462 --> 46:43.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first time was 50 years ago,
when a man
brought a battered, old
instrument into his

46:43.467 --> 46:45.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shop that had once been played
in a death
camp.

46:45.803 --> 46:48.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMNON WEINSTEIN, Founder,
Violins of Hope:
I was very afraid of it, because
that's the

46:49.006 --> 46:52.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
point. When I opened this
violin, there was
a black powder inside, which,
for me, was

46:52.810 --> 46:58.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the ashes. And I know it
from the man
who played on it. He played on
the way to

46:58.315 --> 47:00.151 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the gas chamber.

47:00.251 --> 47:04.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: For Weinstein,
that instrument
was a chilling reminder of the
hundreds of

47:04.121 --> 47:09.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relatives he had lost in those
prison camps.
And for the last 20 years, he's
been on a

47:09.527 --> 47:14.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
quest to collect and repair
violins of the
Holocaust.

47:14.765 --> 47:20.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amnon Weinstein's Tel Aviv shop
is filled
with violins, violas and cellos
in various

47:20.204 --> 47:25.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states of repair, and he reckons
he and his
son Avshalom have restored about
60 instruments,

47:25.876 --> 47:30.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so far, as part of a project he
calls the
Violins of Hope.

47:30.681 --> 47:34.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This past fall, they packed up
about a third
of the collection for a series
of concerts

47:34.785 --> 47:36.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and exhibits in Cleveland.

47:36.220 --> 47:40.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMNON WEINSTEIN: Bring me please
the Five
Star of David violin.

47:40.858 --> 47:51.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a violin that it took me
1.5 years
to restore from scratches,
beautiful violin,

47:51.836 --> 48:01.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this Five Star of David, one,
two, three,
four, and the beautiful one on
the back. Now

48:01.846 --> 48:05.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's going to Cleveland to the
concert.

48:05.850 --> 48:21.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the last one, Auschwitz
violin. This violin,
what we know, the man who played
on it played

48:21.565 --> 48:27.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Auschwitz orchestra, main
orchestra,
the big orchestra that was every
day in the

48:27.438 --> 48:32.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
morning and in the evening
playing not far
away from the sign "Arbeit Macht
Frei."

48:32.343 --> 48:37.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Holocaust
historian Jay
Geller says the ability to play
an instrument

48:37.515 --> 48:39.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saved numerous prisoners from
the gas chambers.

48:39.884 --> 48:43.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY GELLER, Case Western Reserve
University:
The musicians who played in the
camp orchestras

48:43.254 --> 48:48.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were still prisoners, and they
were still
mistreated by the camp
authorities, but they

48:48.759 --> 48:53.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did have a special skill that
made them particularly
useful. So, in a sense, they
were the prize

48:53.764 --> 48:55.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cattle.

48:55.766 --> 48:59.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Geller says
these musicians
were sometimes used to entertain
the commandants

48:59.336 --> 49:04.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
running the camps. In other
instances, the
orchestras served to lull the
inmates into

49:04.475 --> 49:06.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a false sense of security.

49:06.911 --> 49:08.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what happened to Hedy
Milgrom's family
members.

49:08.979 --> 49:11.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HEDY MILGROM, Senior Vice
President, Jewish
Federation of Cleveland: When my
mom and her

49:12.082 --> 49:17.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
twin sister and her father and
other siblings
and nieces arrived at Auschwitz,
and they

49:17.888 --> 49:21.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tumbled off of this horrible
cattle car that
had been on for, I think eight
days, whatever

49:21.525 --> 49:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
length of time it was, the first
thing that
they heard and saw was this
orchestra.

49:29.333 --> 49:34.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my mother turned to her twin
sister and
said -- you know, took her by
the arm: "See?

49:34.205 --> 49:37.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It can't be all that bad. Right?
There's music
here."

49:37.308 --> 49:42.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: The story of
these prison
camp orchestras was told in
display cases

49:42.146 --> 49:47.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Cleveland's Maltz Museum of
Jewish Heritage,
the personal history of each
instrument carefully

49:47.484 --> 49:51.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
documented, many of them
intricately ornamented.

49:51.322 --> 49:56.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Historian Jay Geller says that,
in Jewish
households, a decorated violin
was often a

49:56.193 --> 49:59.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
way to get around certain
biblical restrictions
on art.

49:59.730 --> 50:03.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAY GELLER: In the Jewish
tradition, the Second
Commandment of the Ten
Commandments is thou

50:03.901 --> 50:10.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shall not make graven images.
Historically,
this had the effect that Jews
didn't do representational

50:10.474 --> 50:15.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
art. Jewish artistic endeavors
focused on
practical objects, especially
objects for

50:16.046 --> 50:24.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ritual use, but also to decorate
and embellish
objects that one might use on a
regular basis,

50:24.154 --> 50:25.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
including the violins.

50:26.056 --> 50:31.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, while these violins and
other instruments
were meant to be played as
ordinary objects,

50:31.729 --> 50:35.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were also works of art.
They could be
embellished, decorated with
inlay.

50:35.699 --> 50:39.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Amnon
Weinstein is proud
whenever people get to see the
violins and

50:40.070 --> 50:45.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learn about their history, but
he's especially
happy when these instruments are
played for

50:45.776 --> 50:47.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
live audiences.

50:47.645 --> 50:58.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMNON WEINSTEIN: The violins are
to play on,
not to be like a furniture. That
is very good

50:58.289 --> 51:01.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for violin. You can keep them
for 500 years.

51:01.992 --> 51:11.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But violins have to speak. And
the most important
part of the life of a violin is
to be played

51:11.869 --> 51:14.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in concert. And then they can
tell stories.

51:14.138 --> 51:18.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: The largest
violins of Hope
Concert took place in an
historic Northeast

51:18.609 --> 51:24.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ohio temple, and featured 22
instruments from
the Holocaust era played by
members of the

51:25.049 --> 51:28.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Cleveland Orchestra.

51:28.652 --> 51:39.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEDY MILGROM: There is a power
in music that
is -- that breeds resilience,
that gives people

51:39.563 --> 51:41.298 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hope.

51:41.398 --> 51:45.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: The Violins of
Hope are
Holocaust survivors. Scarred by
the war years,

51:45.736 --> 51:52.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were silent for decades.
But now they
have music to play. And Amnon
Weinstein says

51:52.142 --> 51:55.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
each one has a story to tell.

51:55.212 --> 52:00.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMNON WEINSTEIN: This violin is
alive, is
existing, and is going to talk
to all the

52:00.451 --> 52:06.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world. Each violin like that
that you are
going to play, it's for millions
of people

52:06.290 --> 52:11.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are dead. That is victory.
And each concert
is a victory.

52:11.695 --> 52:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: And Weinstein
says that's
why he continues to look for
more violins

52:16.734 --> 52:20.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to bring back to life.

52:20.938 --> 52:29.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: For
exiled Syrian artist Tammam
Azzam, living

52:46.530 --> 52:51.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in abroad has given him a sense
loss on two
accounts, being away from his
home, while

52:51.869 --> 52:57.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also seeing it become destroyed
by war. So
he began to paint. The result is
an arresting

52:57.875 --> 53:02.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visual chronicle of the physical
and emotional
toll the war has taken.

53:02.946 --> 53:07.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of a new exhibit. And
you can see
a gallery of that work on our
home page, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:07.718 --> 53:14.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And a reminder about some
upcoming programs
from our PBS colleagues.

how the city of Chicago is using
data and

53:41.752 --> 53:48.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
social media to target
restaurant health inspections.
That's tomorrow night on "PBS

That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Judy
Woodruff.

54:00.604 --> 54:17.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Have a great weekend. Thank you,
and good
night.
