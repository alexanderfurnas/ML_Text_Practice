JUDY WOODRUFF: And now it's time
for Politics Monday with Amy
Walter of The Cook Political

00:04.766 --> 00:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Report and Tamara Keith of NPR.

00:07.333 --> 00:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Amy, Tam, you have
just been hearing what
Congresswoman Bustos has said.

00:11.666 --> 00:14.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In fact, she's still
here at the table.

00:14.366 --> 00:16.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, Amy, what do
you make of that?

00:16.400 --> 00:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are you hearing from the
Democrats where they want
to take this country?

00:19.366 --> 00:23.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well, I will say this.

00:23.066 --> 00:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Every party that's the out party
always struggles with this.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Who are we now that
we're not in charge?

00:27.866 --> 00:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in this case, Democrats
are not only the out party.

00:29.666 --> 00:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't control anything.

00:30.766 --> 00:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not just the White House.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't have the House or
the Senate or the White House.

00:34.500 --> 00:39.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It is -- and every
election is a referendum
on the party in power.

00:39.033 --> 00:41.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Republicans are
the party in power.

00:41.100 --> 00:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The 2018 election is going to
be a referendum on whether they
were able to accomplish what

00:44.900 --> 00:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they said they were
going to do or not.

00:47.333 --> 00:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's Democrats' job getting,
I think, as we get into 2020
and the battle is for who is

00:52.266 --> 00:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to occupy the White
House to have that message that
their standard bearer -- you

00:56.600 --> 00:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ask the question, who is
the leader of your party?

00:58.733 --> 01:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The leader of their party is
going to be the person that they
nominate in 2020 to be their

01:02.466 --> 01:03.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nominee.

01:03.900 --> 01:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But that's
several years away.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER:
ÑMD+ITÑÑMD-ITÑIt's very
ÑMD+ITÑÑMD-ITÑmany years away.

01:07.766 --> 01:10.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Remember, Republicans
were successful in the
midterm elections in
2010, Democrats were

01:10.200 --> 01:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
successful in the
midterm elections in
2006 in taking control
of Congress away from the

01:16.333 --> 01:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opposite party, not because
they were unified with a message
about who they were or what

01:19.400 --> 01:20.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they stood for.

01:20.633 --> 01:23.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They stood against
the party in power.

01:23.033 --> 01:24.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was a referendum
on that party.

01:24.866 --> 01:27.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Voters were not happy
with the party in power.

01:27.966 --> 01:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the out party benefited.

01:29.966 --> 01:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there is plenty of time
for Democrats to figure out
who they are, but they are,

01:35.966 --> 01:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just like Republicans,
very divided ideologically.

01:38.066 --> 01:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Tam, from
your reporting on the Hill,
your reporting from the White

01:42.266 --> 01:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House, do the Democrats feel
like a force that's together,
that's found their voice

01:46.366 --> 01:48.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now?

01:48.466 --> 01:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: They have certainly found
a way to oppose the Republican

01:50.700 --> 01:51.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
legislation.

01:51.933 --> 01:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They not splintered
when it comes to votes.

01:54.400 --> 01:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And part of that is credit to
Nancy Pelosi's ability to whip
votes, which she has honed

02:01.300 --> 02:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over many years in leadership,
and also Chuck Schumer
has kept them together.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There haven't been the
defections that -- particularly
in the Senate, that
President Trump had hoped

02:09.600 --> 02:12.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he would get.

02:12.133 --> 02:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had brought some of
these moderate Republicans
in red states who were
up for reelection over

02:16.366 --> 02:17.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the White House.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He had sort of tried
maybe to woo them.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It didn't work.

02:21.966 --> 02:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have not been in
any way forced to have
a wedge between them and
the rest of the Democratic

02:26.833 --> 02:28.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party.

02:28.866 --> 02:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which has been
-- so far, Amy, has contributed
to the fact that Republicans

02:31.100 --> 02:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are still struggling to get
an answer on health care.

02:33.733 --> 02:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: ÑMD+ITÑÑMD-ITÑRight.

02:35.833 --> 02:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this goes to the challenge,
Judy, which is, when you're a
party that has been successful,

02:41.700 --> 02:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Republicans were successful
in the last few years, by
being basically the party of

02:44.966 --> 02:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no, right, they were against
everything that Democrats and
President Obama stood for, that

02:52.000 --> 02:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was successful to get them a
governing -- or a political
majority, but not a governing

02:55.666 --> 02:57.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
majority.

02:57.700 --> 03:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So now that they're in
power, they're struggling
with, what do you do?

03:00.300 --> 03:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have multiple
factions in the Republican
Party, just as Democrats
have multiple factions.

03:03.300 --> 03:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trying to get them all together
to agree on something like
a health care bill, which is

03:07.100 --> 03:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
super complicated, is a
lot harder than getting
them all to agree that
Obamacare is terrible.

03:13.533 --> 03:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Tam, you
have been out on the road.

03:16.066 --> 03:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You were following Bernie
Sanders in the last
couple of days, who has
been holding rallies,

03:17.766 --> 03:19.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
trying to say what
the Republicans are
doing is all wrong.

03:19.900 --> 03:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are you seeing?

03:20.900 --> 03:22.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are you feeling?

03:22.966 --> 03:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ÑMD+ITÑÑMD-ITÑTAMARA KEITH:
So, one interesting thing
about that is that Bernie

03:24.433 --> 03:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sanders wants Medicare for
all, single-payer health care.

03:27.733 --> 03:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he didn't make a big
thing out of it at this rally.

03:30.666 --> 03:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most of the focus at this
rally that I went to in West
-- or in Kentucky was about the

03:37.800 --> 03:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican bill and what
it would mean for people.

03:40.366 --> 03:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Sanders' message was
really that the Affordable
Care Act, Obamacare,
needs to be fixed, which

03:48.433 --> 03:51.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is actually standing
for something.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's like -- it's not just no.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's yes.

03:54.833 --> 03:59.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now, it's not clear
that Democrats can agree
on what the fix is.

03:59.033 --> 04:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's more people who
are quietly saying, well, maybe
single-payer, maybe Medicare for

04:03.633 --> 04:05.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
all.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But that -- and that
is a longstanding
divide among Democrats.

04:08.433 --> 04:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it sounds
Democrats can be unified,
at least around that.

04:11.666 --> 04:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: ÑMD+ITÑÑMD-ITÑAt
least around that.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think Tam
is exactly right.

04:14.966 --> 04:18.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's going to be the
bigger challenge in
2020, as the Democrats
try to figure out their

04:18.066 --> 04:23.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
messaging on, do we go further
to the left, talk about
single-payer, Medicare for all,

04:24.700 --> 04:28.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
or do we just say, well,
try to fix what isn't
working in health care?

04:28.333 --> 04:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That, I think, is going
to be a big dividing line
in the Democratic primary.

04:31.466 --> 04:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, can't let
you go without a quick question
about our lead tonight, Tam.

04:35.333 --> 04:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is the new revelations
about the Trump campaign and
Russia, Donald Trump Jr. meeting

04:41.500 --> 04:42.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the Russian
lawyer and so on.

04:42.733 --> 04:44.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we have been doing
a lot of reporting.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this more of the same, or
have we turned some kind of
an important corner with this

04:47.966 --> 04:49.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information?

04:49.466 --> 04:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I think it's hard
to know where the corners are.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a new person.

04:55.600 --> 05:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is Donald Trump Jr., who
is now a person that is involved
in this whose name is out

05:00.900 --> 05:02.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

05:02.966 --> 05:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And a remarkable thing
about this is that he
basically confirmed much
of it on the record,

05:07.800 --> 05:10.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which is a pretty
remarkable thing.

05:10.300 --> 05:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He confirmed that he arranged
a meeting with top campaign
officials with a Kremlin-linked

05:17.366 --> 05:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
lawyer because she was
potentially offering
damaging information
about Hillary Clinton.

05:21.333 --> 05:22.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's something.

05:22.766 --> 05:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not necessarily collusion.

05:24.933 --> 05:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And collusion isn't necessarily
a violation of the law.

05:28.700 --> 05:32.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But in this sort of
ongoing drip, drip,
drip, was a bigger drip.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: ÑMD+ITÑÑMD-ITÑYes.

05:34.566 --> 05:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it also goes back to
something I feel like we
talk about every time, Judy.

05:37.700 --> 05:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Theoretically, what we should
be talking about today is
simply about health care.

05:41.666 --> 05:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was supposed to be how
we were set up this week.

05:44.366 --> 05:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is a big week to
get something through.

05:46.533 --> 05:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president should be
focusing all of his energy
and attention on doing that.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Instead, now we're talking
once again about Russia.

05:53.666 --> 05:56.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The other thing that
is consistent, these
are all self-inflicted.

05:56.666 --> 06:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not something that the
committees brought up or that
Robert Mueller, the special

06:00.733 --> 06:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
prosecutor, has brought up.

06:02.800 --> 06:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is coming from the lack
of transparency from people
either during the campaign or

06:08.700 --> 06:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
during the transition about
their connections to Russia.

06:11.333 --> 06:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because they had
filled out forms that didn't
include this latest information.

06:14.566 --> 06:15.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER:
ÑMD+ITÑÑMD-ITÑCorrect.

06:15.566 --> 06:17.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Correct.

06:17.033 --> 06:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when this
information comes out...

06:17.700 --> 06:19.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

06:19.700 --> 06:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: ÑMD+ITÑÑMD-ITÑNow
it looks like they have to
correct, and then it looks

06:21.133 --> 06:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like they're hiding something,
whether they are or not.

06:23.166 --> 06:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just imagine, in another world,
had they come from the very
beginning and been completely

06:25.733 --> 06:28.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
transparent, even
overtransparent, right?

06:28.366 --> 06:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anybody that I met that even has
a Russian-sounding last name,
I'm going to put their name on

06:32.633 --> 06:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a piece of paper and I'm going
