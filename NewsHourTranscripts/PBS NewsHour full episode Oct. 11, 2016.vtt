AMMAR ZAITOON, Refugee: We have
the right
to teach all of our children.

We like education.

00:35.302 --> 00:38.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syrian people are very good
workers.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when they study, they will
be good in
school.

HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and

HARI SREENIVASAN: It was another
contentious
day on the campaign trail on the
ground and

01:00.727 --> 01:05.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
online, as the candidates turn
their focus
to a handful of key states.

done to us.

LISA DESJARDINS: The Republican

Donald Trump's

01:14.908 --> 01:17.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
favorite platform, Twitter.

01:17.044 --> 01:22.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The GOP nominee sent a flurry of
tweets criticizing
his party, calling House Speaker
Paul Ryan

01:22.783 --> 01:29.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an ineffective leader one day
after Ryan told
GOP members of Congress he will
not defend

01:29.122 --> 01:30.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

01:30.991 --> 01:35.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump followed by calling his
opponents within
the party disloyal Republicans
who don't know

01:35.228 --> 01:36.863 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
how to win.

01:36.897 --> 01:41.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in person, Trump was on the
attack, too,
after saying the shackles are
off.

01:41.134 --> 01:46.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speaking to thousands last night
in Wilkes-Barre,
Pennsylvania, he doubled down on
jailing opponent

01:46.673 --> 01:48.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton if elected.

01:48.809 --> 01:53.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Lock her up is
right.

01:53.714 --> 02:02.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I said we are going to get
a special
prosecutor to figure this deal
out...

02:02.856 --> 02:06.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:22.442 --> 02:27.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a man who represents the
importance of each
Florida vote, former Vice
President Al Gore.

02:27.881 --> 02:31.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I'm running against a guy who
denies science,

02:31.918 --> 02:35.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
denies climate change, says it's
a hoax created
by the Chinese.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:36.957 --> 02:46.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

wait to have
Al Gore advising me when I am
president of

02:46.333 --> 02:47.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:49.136 --> 02:50.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The event's
focus on climate
change is part of a push for
younger voters.

02:50.804 --> 02:55.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also today, Clinton proposed
doubling the
child tax credit to $2,000 per
child.

02:55.475 --> 02:58.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She not alone in the Sunshine

Donald Trump plans a rally on
the Florida
Panhandle tonight.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that tells us something.

03:04.451 --> 03:08.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Florida is one of 10 states
where campaigns
are focused, where either
Clinton or Trump

03:09.022 --> 03:11.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has been in the last two weeks.

03:11.124 --> 03:16.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Five of those, Florida,
Pennsylvania, New
Hampshire, Michigan and Ohio,
have seen the

03:16.263 --> 03:18.065 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
most visits.

03:18.098 --> 03:22.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton's rally in Columbus,
Ohio, just last
night drew one of her biggest
crowds of the

03:22.436 --> 03:24.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cycle, some 18,000 people.

03:24.404 --> 03:31.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both candidates now have just 28
days to reach
what polls say is a shrinking
number of undecided

03:32.012 --> 03:33.046 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voters.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

03:34.981 --> 03:38.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We will have
more on the
fight in the battleground states
and unpack

03:38.885 --> 03:43.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the latest hack of Clinton
campaign e-mails
released by WikiLeaks.

03:43.790 --> 03:48.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Russian
jets resumed
heavy bombing of Aleppo, Syria,
after days

03:48.095 --> 03:49.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of relative calm.

03:49.896 --> 03:54.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least 16 people were killed
there today
in airstrikes on rebel-held
neighborhoods.

03:54.334 --> 03:58.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Recent drone footage showed the
scale of the
devastation in eastern parts of
the city.

03:58.939 --> 04:03.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, French President
Francois Hollande
criticized Moscow's actions in
Syria, just

04:03.410 --> 04:06.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Russian President Vladimir
Putin canceled
a trip to Paris.

04:06.046 --> 04:09.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French
President (through
translator): I think it is
necessary to have

04:09.116 --> 04:10.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dialogue with Russia.

04:10.317 --> 04:12.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it must be firm and frank.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Otherwise, it has no role to
play.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Otherwise, it's just a charade.

04:16.656 --> 04:20.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I'm ready to meet President
Putin if we
can make progress on peace, stop
the bombings

04:20.861 --> 04:22.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and implement a cease-fire.

04:22.596 --> 04:26.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Southern
Syria, rebels
fired rockets at government-held
areas.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

killing at least
six people, mostly children.

04:30.770 --> 04:34.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been another long day for
thousands of
people coping with the aftermath
of Hurricane

04:34.307 --> 04:35.275 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Matthew.

04:35.308 --> 04:38.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The U.S. death toll rose to at
least 30 today.

04:38.044 --> 04:40.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Half of those deaths were in
North Carolina.

04:40.180 --> 04:44.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, President Obama
signed a disaster
declaration for South Carolina.

04:44.417 --> 04:48.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in hard-hit Haiti, there
were rising fears
of disease.

04:48.655 --> 04:51.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William Brangham has our report
on the day's
developments.

04:51.424 --> 04:57.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Main streets
turned into
waterways, as rescuers boarded
boats and helicopters

04:57.130 --> 05:00.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again today to search for people
stranded
in the deluge.

05:00.667 --> 05:05.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some 1,500 people became trapped
in the town
of Lumberton, North Carolina,
when a river

05:05.472 --> 05:08.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there began overflowing on
Sunday.

05:08.041 --> 05:13.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning, North Carolina
Governor Pat
McCrory urged those who could to
leave, and

05:13.113 --> 05:14.080 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fast.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.081 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAT MCCRORY (R), North Carolina:
Get out.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Get out now.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You are putting not only your
life at jeopardy.

05:18.785 --> 05:21.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You are putting our emergency
rescue teams
in jeopardy.

05:21.388 --> 05:24.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One new death
in the state
wasn't by water.

05:24.925 --> 05:29.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, state troopers shot
and killed
an armed man during a
search-and-rescue mission.

05:29.563 --> 05:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor McCrory would only say
the shooting
happened under -- quote -- "very
difficult

05:33.133 --> 05:34.935 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
circumstances."

05:34.968 --> 05:38.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Floodwaters continue to inundate
towns like
Lumberton after Hurricane
Matthew poured more

05:38.838 --> 05:44.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than a foot of water on Eastern
North Carolina
from the capital, Raleigh, south
to Fayetteville

05:44.511 --> 05:46.313 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and beyond.

05:46.346 --> 05:50.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Interstate 95 was still
inundated and blocked
off near the South Carolina
border, severing

05:50.650 --> 05:55.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the major north-south route
along the East
Coast for another day.

05:55.155 --> 05:59.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds of other roads were
flooded or damaged,
leaving whole neighborhoods cut
off.

05:59.659 --> 06:04.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Moore County, residents were
evacuated
late last night as crews worked
until morning

06:04.464 --> 06:07.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to shore up a dam that
threatened to burst.

06:07.234 --> 06:10.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where the waters have receded,
the damage
is ruinous.

06:10.737 --> 06:16.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Bob Swilley piled up 400
sandbags to protect
his Fayetteville print shop from
the waters,

06:16.443 --> 06:17.711 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all in vain.

06:17.744 --> 06:19.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOB SWILLEY, Flood Victim:
Saturday night,
this flooded over.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It just -- of course, you can
see the damage
here.

06:21.815 --> 06:26.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it came over the road, came
over the road,
into the bottom of our building.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's where all of our
equipment is.

06:28.822 --> 06:32.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The scale of
the destruction
is still unclear as the flooding
continues,

06:32.792 --> 06:35.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but thousands of homes have been
damaged already.

06:35.495 --> 06:39.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And half-a-million are still
without power
throughout the Southeast.

06:39.266 --> 06:44.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Still, nowhere was more
devastated by Hurricane
Matthew than the Caribbean
nation of Haiti,

06:44.537 --> 06:50.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where cleanup efforts pressed on
today amid
catastrophic damage, but another
potential

06:50.110 --> 06:53.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deadlier crisis is emerging in
the impoverished
country.

06:53.747 --> 06:57.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New cases of cholera have spiked
dramatically
due to a lack of safe water.

06:57.851 --> 07:05.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An outbreak after the 2010
earthquake killed
more than 10,000 people and
sickened 800,000.

07:05.158 --> 07:10.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The World Health Organization
said today it
was sending one million doses of
cholera vaccine

07:10.830 --> 07:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to hinder any new epidemic.

07:12.799 --> 07:15.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sean Casey is the International
Medical Corps
in Haiti.

07:15.902 --> 07:19.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The "NewsHour" reached him by
phone in the
port town of Les Cayes.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN CASEY, International
Medical Corps: In
addition to the myriad health
challenges we

07:22.342 --> 07:29.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have after a disaster, we now
have a cholera
outbreak on top of it, which
requires additional

07:29.149 --> 07:35.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health resources, but which is
also pulling
health resources away from
primary care services

07:35.255 --> 07:37.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that are also needed.

07:37.123 --> 07:40.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In the south,
where Hurricane
Matthew struck, about a quarter
of the health

07:40.327 --> 07:43.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

07:46.199 --> 07:50.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In China, more
than 1,000
protesters demonstrated today
outside the

07:50.403 --> 07:53.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Defense Ministry in Beijing.

07:53.273 --> 07:57.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many wore army uniforms and
stood for hours
outside the ministry to denounce
military

07:57.610 --> 08:00.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
downsizing and problems with
veterans' pensions.

08:00.914 --> 08:06.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds of police used buses
and other vehicles
to obstruct views of the
protest.

08:06.319 --> 08:11.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The World Health Organization
called today
for higher taxes on sugary
drinks.

08:11.124 --> 08:15.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials at the U.N. health
agency said it
could cut consumption of the
drinks and help

08:15.261 --> 08:17.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fight obesity and diabetes.

08:17.831 --> 08:24.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As of 2014, 11 percent of men
and 15 percent
of women were classified as
obese, more than

08:24.571 --> 08:27.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
500 million people around the
world.

08:27.774 --> 08:31.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thousands of nurses in Minnesota
have reached
a tentative deal to end a strike
that began

08:31.578 --> 08:33.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Labor Day.

08:33.313 --> 08:37.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The governor announced the
agreement after
a 17-hour mediation between the
Minnesota

08:37.117 --> 08:39.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nurses Association and five
hospitals.

08:39.986 --> 08:43.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The nurses walked out over
issues including
health insurance.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're set to vote on the
agreement Thursday.

08:45.392 --> 08:50.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And stocks fell sharply on Wall
Street today,
led by heavy losses in the
health care sector

08:50.563 --> 08:52.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and a drop in oil prices.

08:52.632 --> 08:56.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
plummeted
200 points to close at 18128.

08:56.903 --> 09:01.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell nearly 82
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 lost 27.

09:02.008 --> 09:07.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Samsung's
mounting smartphone troubles; a
look at must-win

09:07.180 --> 09:12.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states for the presidential
candidates; a
country inundated with child
refugees sends

09:12.385 --> 09:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them to school; and much more.

09:26.299 --> 09:30.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an eventful day and a
humbling one for
the electronic giant Samsung,
the world's

09:30.570 --> 09:32.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
largest maker of smartphones.

09:32.806 --> 09:37.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the company announced
that it is halting
production of its beleaguered
Galaxy Note

09:37.744 --> 09:39.546 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
7 phone.

09:39.579 --> 09:43.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reports of the Note 7 catching
fire caused
the company to issue a recall
and then create

09:43.950 --> 09:48.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
replacement devices that were
also found to
be a fire risk.

09:48.655 --> 09:54.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It comes, coincidentally, as a
prolonged battle
between Apple and Samsung over
money, patents

09:54.761 --> 09:59.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the designs of those phones
you use went
before the U.S. Supreme Court
today.

09:59.632 --> 10:02.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Jessi Hempel is with
Backchannel, a Web-based
platform that covers the tech
world.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She joins us now.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, tell us a little bit about
the issues
surrounding this.

10:06.806 --> 10:10.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen dribs and drabs of
people saying,
look at this burned-out battery,
look at this

10:11.010 --> 10:12.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
burned-out shell.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How long has this been going on?

10:13.146 --> 10:14.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How serious it is?

10:14.247 --> 10:15.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSI HEMPEL, Backchannel: Well,
it's quite
serious.

10:15.815 --> 10:20.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it's really impossible
to underestimate
how serious this is for Samsung.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's been a month-and-a-half.

10:22.322 --> 10:26.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, at first, when the
phones started
catching fire, Samsung acted
decisively and

10:26.259 --> 10:28.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
immediately and got a lot of
credit for that.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It said, we issued a recall.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People went and returned their
phones.

10:31.831 --> 10:35.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then the new phones started
catching fire.

10:35.168 --> 10:38.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's when it became a very
serious problem
for Samsung.

10:38.204 --> 10:40.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It suggests that we really can't
trust the
brand.

10:40.240 --> 10:45.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, frankly, when people think
about this,
yes, maybe they will remember
that it's the

10:45.678 --> 10:48.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Samsung Galaxy Note 7, or maybe
they will
just think about the brand name
Samsung.

10:48.948 --> 10:49.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right.

10:49.949 --> 10:51.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's a big company.

10:51.518 --> 10:54.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They make everything from
washers and dryers
to lots of other bigger things.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JESSI HEMPEL: Yes.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.155 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But how
important is this?

10:57.957 --> 10:59.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is sort of the flagship
phone, the thing
they're supposed to be the most
proud of.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JESSI HEMPEL: This is their
flagship phone.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, therefore, it's really
important.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's important for a couple
reasons.

11:05.298 --> 11:10.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First off, this was what they
put forward
to compete with Apple's new
iPhone.

11:10.136 --> 11:12.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, quite frankly, it didn't
work.

11:12.939 --> 11:15.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It will be a huge financial loss
for the company.

11:15.575 --> 11:19.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, it's hard to say exactly
how much, and
it will be a while before we
know, but I have

11:19.779 --> 11:22.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seen estimates put it at between
$4 and $5
billion.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So it's very important.

11:24.651 --> 11:27.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so,
speaking
of Apple, they're in the Supreme
Court today,

11:27.587 --> 11:28.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the arguments.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JESSI HEMPEL: Right.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What's the
sort of core
of the disagreement between
Apple and Samsung?

11:33.026 --> 11:37.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSI HEMPEL: You know, anybody
who has watched
Samsung and Apple over the last
five years

11:37.931 --> 11:42.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has seen this play out in
ticktock, this ongoing
fight between Samsung and Apple.

11:42.835 --> 11:48.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's at issue today is no
longer the question
of, did Samsung copy Apple?

11:48.508 --> 11:51.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, everyone has agreed Samsung
has copied
Apple.

11:51.811 --> 11:54.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's no longer the question of,
should Samsung
pay Apple?

11:54.614 --> 11:55.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Yes, the courts have agreed.

11:56.015 --> 11:58.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Samsung already paid Apple.

11:58.751 --> 12:02.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is at question now is, how
much money
does Samsung really owe Apple?

12:02.822 --> 12:10.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the courts, the federal
courts in California
said, according to the law,
Samsung owed the

12:10.296 --> 12:15.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
total profit on the phones that
it ripped
off pieces of the design from
Apple.

12:15.635 --> 12:21.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Samsung at this point is saying,
no, wait,
hold on a minute, why should we
pay total

12:21.074 --> 12:22.442 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
profit?

12:22.475 --> 12:25.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're raising an objection over
three design
elements on this phone.

12:25.578 --> 12:29.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Surely, we shouldn't have to pay
the total
profit for the phone just over
three design

12:29.882 --> 12:31.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
elements.

12:31.684 --> 12:34.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, this is
really just
about deciding how much money
either Apple

12:34.253 --> 12:37.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will continue to keep or if it
would have
to give it back?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JESSI HEMPEL: That's right.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, the reason why
this matters,
the reason why the Supreme Court
would even

12:42.428 --> 12:46.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decide to look at this right now
is because
it raises the question and the
importance

12:46.132 --> 12:48.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of design to a product.

12:48.901 --> 12:52.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that, of course, is a big
issue for Silicon
Valley write large.

12:52.205 --> 12:57.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's been a very long time,
I think 130
years, since the courts took up
this issue

12:57.477 --> 12:59.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of patent, of design patent.

12:59.479 --> 13:04.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It gets to the question of, what
is core to
a product?

13:04.350 --> 13:06.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What differentiates it in the
market?

13:06.686 --> 13:08.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, you know, it's funny.

13:08.354 --> 13:13.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These three design elements,
each on their
own, they just don't seem that
big.

13:13.226 --> 13:17.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's the question of the
rectangle shape
of the face of the phone.

13:17.597 --> 13:22.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's the question of the
raised glass on
the front of the phone, and then
there's the

13:22.068 --> 13:25.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
question of the icons on the
front of the
phone.

13:25.238 --> 13:29.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, if you think about all
these things,
right, they have become central
to what we

13:29.409 --> 13:33.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think of as not just an iPhone
at this point,
but a smartphone.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Apple says, hey, we get credit
for that.

13:35.281 --> 13:36.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We designed those.

13:36.282 --> 13:37.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We own those.

13:37.984 --> 13:41.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you owe us all the money off
of the phones
that you sold that ripped those
off.

13:41.521 --> 13:46.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Samsung says, well, wait a
minute, you know,
parallel to this is like a car
and a cup holder

13:46.893 --> 13:48.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the car.

13:48.628 --> 13:53.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Would you say that if I ripped
off the design
of a cup holder in the car, that
I should

13:53.132 --> 13:55.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pay you the total profits on the
entire car?

13:55.968 --> 13:58.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that what differentiates it
to the consumer?

13:58.071 --> 14:01.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jessi Hempel
from Backchannel,
thanks so much.

14:01.974 --> 14:07.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JESSI HEMPEL: Thank you.

14:07.680 --> 14:17.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Since Friday,
the anti-secrecy
group WikiLeaks has been
releasing e-mails

14:17.457 --> 14:22.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that were hacked from the
account of Hillary
Clinton campaign chairman John
Podesta.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The stolen messages detail how
the campaign
responded to important issues
through the

14:25.898 --> 14:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
race for the White House.

14:27.834 --> 14:32.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is unclear who was behind
this latest digital
theft, but, on Friday, the Obama
administration

14:32.138 --> 14:37.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did blame Russia for the hacking
of Democratic
Party Web sites earlier this
year and attempts

14:37.376 --> 14:42.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to breach state election
systems, in order
to influence the vote for
president.

14:42.215 --> 14:45.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, White House spokesman
Josh Earnest
said there will be a U.S.
response to the

14:45.985 --> 14:47.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
alleged Russian hacking.

14:47.920 --> 14:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told reporters aboard Air
Force One: "The
president has talked before
about the significant

14:52.458 --> 14:57.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
capabilities that the U.S.
government has
to both defend our systems in
the United States,

14:57.797 --> 15:02.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but also carry out offensive
operations in
other countries.

15:02.201 --> 15:07.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, there are a range of
responses that are
available to the president, and
he will consider

15:07.106 --> 15:09.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a response that's proportional."

15:09.675 --> 15:14.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With me now to sift through what
all this
means in both political and
diplomatic terms

15:14.113 --> 15:16.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are the "NewsHour"'s Margaret
Warner and Lisa
Desjardins.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa, tell me -- let's start
with what is
in the e-mails.

15:19.719 --> 15:20.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

15:21.020 --> 15:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this latest dump, so people
can keep track,
began on Friday.

15:24.724 --> 15:30.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are about 2,000 e-mails, a
little bit
more, coming from Clinton
campaign chairman

15:30.763 --> 15:35.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Podesta, obviously a very
big player
in the Clinton world now and for
years.

15:35.735 --> 15:39.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, in these, we see one of the
standout
notes that we have gotten --
there haven't

15:39.572 --> 15:43.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been all that many -- is from a
Clinton 2013
speech to an Italian bank.

15:43.509 --> 15:45.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You may have seen that quote.

15:45.411 --> 15:51.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the speech that was
referenced in these
e-mails, it was purported to say
-- quote

15:51.150 --> 15:55.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "My dream is a hemispheric
common market
with open trade and open
borders."

15:55.721 --> 16:00.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, that's raised a lot
of questions
in this year of very heated talk
about trade

16:00.359 --> 16:04.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and especially after Clinton
herself came
out against one of the
largest-in-history

16:04.397 --> 16:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trade deals, the Trans-Pacific
Partnership.

16:06.699 --> 16:10.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's probably the biggest
kind of headline
that's come out of these
e-mails, but also

16:10.970 --> 16:16.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they include a great deal of
campaign tactics,
including a 71-page briefing,
sort of oppo

16:16.275 --> 16:18.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
research to some extent on
Bernie Sanders.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of this was happening during
that very
heated primary campaign.

16:21.948 --> 16:26.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the Clinton campaign
themselves is not
confirming the authenticity of
any of these

16:26.185 --> 16:27.453 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
e-mails.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very important to say that
WikiLeaks
has posted these.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know they were hacked, so the
authenticity
is fair to question.

16:33.860 --> 16:38.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Clinton campaign is
pushing back strongly,
saying this is from a state
actor, and this

16:38.431 --> 16:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is obviously an illegal act in
politics.

16:41.033 --> 16:43.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so,
Margaret,
how did these e-mails come to
light in the

16:43.269 --> 16:45.071 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
first place?

16:45.104 --> 16:47.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Well, as Lisa
said, not only
did they come out on WikiLeaks,
this latest

16:47.773 --> 16:52.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
batch, but there have been two
other sources,
something called Guccifer 2 and
something

16:53.012 --> 16:54.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
called D.C.

16:54.046 --> 16:55.815 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Leaks.

16:55.848 --> 17:00.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the U.S. government,
intelligence officials
and also many cyber-experts have
been sure

17:00.686 --> 17:09.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for -- at a 90 percent degree of
certainty
for months that two Russian spy,
cyber-spy

17:09.462 --> 17:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agencies, one tied to Russian
intelligence,
one tied to Russian military
intelligence,

17:14.467 --> 17:15.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had been behind these.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These have been known for
months.

17:18.137 --> 17:24.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FBI Director James Comey did
tell the Congress,
in fact, he said, "We're trying
to determine

17:24.510 --> 17:28.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just what mischief Russia is up
to in connection
with our election."

17:28.481 --> 17:32.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there is a difference
between the hacking
and the leaking.

17:32.952 --> 17:37.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Russian M.O., U.S.
officials believe,
is that they do the hacking, and
then they

17:37.356 --> 17:39.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
give them to others to do the
leaking.

17:39.692 --> 17:43.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
let's talk
a little bit about the timing,
coincidence

17:43.129 --> 17:44.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or not, in an election year?

17:44.931 --> 17:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's the political fallout?

17:46.699 --> 17:49.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, the
fallout, first
of all, has not been related
directly to the

17:50.002 --> 17:51.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
content of these e-mails.

17:51.804 --> 17:55.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the worst fallout for
Hillary Clinton
is whenever the topic of e-mails
comes up,

17:55.675 --> 17:59.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whenever the idea comes out that
maybe she
and her strategists are doing
things in secret

17:59.879 --> 18:01.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the public don't know
about.

18:01.580 --> 18:04.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The truth is, there is no
indication of any
wrongdoing.

18:04.183 --> 18:07.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is typical campaign
operations for the
most part in these e-mails.

18:07.720 --> 18:11.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some, you could say, are not
good on style
or there's infighting or
whatever, but there

18:11.724 --> 18:13.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is really no indication of
wrongdoing here.

18:13.759 --> 18:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, this whole concept of
e-mails and
a shadowy Clinton world is the
problem for

18:18.331 --> 18:21.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her, which they say is all sort
of a shadow
conspiracy.

18:21.734 --> 18:25.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think there's a greater
issue here,
Hari, in that what these e-mails
are doing

18:25.338 --> 18:28.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, it's changing how our
political operatives
communicate.

18:28.975 --> 18:33.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, I know sources now
who will not
communicate with me over e-mail,
who must

18:33.412 --> 18:35.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
communicate by phone.

18:35.181 --> 18:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When our leaders aren't able to
talk to each
other over the most common
device they use,

18:39.652 --> 18:42.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that's a success for the
opponents of the
United States.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's something that may be
happened
now already.

18:44.557 --> 18:50.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Margaret, that
statement
from Josh Earnest, that the U.S.
has the potential

18:50.096 --> 18:53.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a proportional response,
what can the
administration do?

18:53.265 --> 18:57.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was almost one of the first
explicit
moments where we said we are in
an active

18:57.803 --> 18:59.138 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cyber-war.

18:59.171 --> 19:02.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Well, in which
we outed somebody,
another country.

19:02.241 --> 19:04.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The only other one ever outed is
North Korea.

19:04.310 --> 19:09.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia has done previous hacks
of U.S. government
databases, and so have the
Chinese.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This time, it was different.

19:11.751 --> 19:15.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, the reasons they did it,
I was told
by a senior cyber-official, had
a lot to do

19:15.888 --> 19:17.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the upcoming debate.

19:17.256 --> 19:19.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Julian Assange had been saying
there was going
to be a new dump.

19:19.959 --> 19:25.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The administration strongly
believes, as Lisa
said, that this is all aimed to
help Trump

19:25.131 --> 19:26.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and hurt Clinton.

19:26.932 --> 19:31.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this was definitely, at a
time a very
high tension with the Russians
anyway over

19:31.337 --> 19:36.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aleppo, a way of trying the
neutralize Trump
from saying, who knows if the
Russians are

19:36.108 --> 19:37.076 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behind it?

19:37.109 --> 19:38.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Of course he said it again.

19:38.544 --> 19:39.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's in the kit bag?

19:39.645 --> 19:42.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of things for the United
States to retaliate.

19:42.248 --> 19:46.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The name and shame may be the
only thing it
does, trying the put Russia on
notice that,

19:46.819 --> 19:50.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look, you're crossing a line
here because
you're interfering with, as Lisa
again said,

19:50.656 --> 19:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the sanctity of the American
election system,
not just communications, but the
real sanctity

19:55.027 --> 19:57.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here, sowing mistrust and doubt.

19:57.329 --> 20:02.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, certainly, if the U.S.
wanted to turn
out all the lights in Moscow, it
could, but

20:02.268 --> 20:04.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia could do the same to New
York.

20:04.437 --> 20:08.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the administration has been
reluctant
to get into any kind of real
cyber-war.

20:09.008 --> 20:12.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Margaret
Warner, Lisa Desjardins,
thanks so much.

20:12.111 --> 20:16.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The head of WikiLeaks, Julian
Assange, has
said they could release 100,000
pages of new

20:16.582 --> 20:18.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
material before the election.

20:18.284 --> 20:22.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We turn now to take a closer
look at two key
battleground states.

20:22.288 --> 20:24.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang is our guide.

20:24.223 --> 20:28.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Early voting begins
tomorrow in
Ohio and Arizona, two states
where the presidential

20:28.694 --> 20:30.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
candidates are running
neck-and-neck.

20:30.996 --> 20:35.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Ohio, long considered a
political bellwether,
we are joined by Karen Kasler.

20:35.935 --> 20:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's statehouse bureau chief
for Ohio Public
Radio and TV.

20:39.839 --> 20:44.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Christopher Conover is a
reporter for
Arizona Public Media, where
polls show the

20:44.710 --> 20:50.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Grand Canyon state could turn
blue this year
for the first time in decades.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Karen and Christopher, thanks so
much for
joining us.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let me start in Arizona.

20:55.154 --> 21:02.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christopher, the Republican
presidential nominee
has won Arizona every election
but one since

21:02.328 --> 21:03.996 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1948.

21:04.029 --> 21:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why is it so close this time?

21:07.900 --> 21:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER CONOVER, Arizona
Public Media:
This year is, I think, just an
interesting

21:10.069 --> 21:11.203 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

21:11.237 --> 21:14.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 1996, Bill Clinton was the
last Democrat
to win.

21:14.240 --> 21:19.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at Arizona when it
comes to voter
registration, the state is split
almost evenly

21:19.712 --> 21:26.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in thirds, with independents,
Republicans,
and Democrats making up those
large portions.

21:26.552 --> 21:28.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Independents are the largest
bloc.

21:28.521 --> 21:32.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They picked up 51,000 new voters
just this
week.

21:32.958 --> 21:38.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the state is split very
interestingly
along political lines.

21:38.731 --> 21:43.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Arizona's always marched to
its own drummer
a little bit also politically.

21:43.235 --> 21:49.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Karen, Ohio has
always been a swing
state, a decider in elections.

21:49.708 --> 21:52.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are the forces shaping the
race this
time?

21:52.578 --> 21:57.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN KASLER, Ohio Public Radio:
Well, I think
you have polling in Ohio before
the tapes

21:57.616 --> 22:02.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the weekend were released
that showed
that Clinton and Trump were
very, very close.

22:02.254 --> 22:06.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Quinnipiac poll last week
had Trump up
by five points.

22:06.091 --> 22:09.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Monmouth poll had Clinton up
by two points,
so a very close race.

22:09.595 --> 22:10.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have got three major
markets.

22:10.863 --> 22:12.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have got a lot of rural
voters.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got a lot of things
that are going
on here.

22:14.333 --> 22:19.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Trump is reaching out to
voters in some
of these areas where Republicans
haven't necessarily

22:19.972 --> 22:21.340 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
done well.

22:21.373 --> 22:23.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what the Republican Party
chair, Matt
Borges, has even said.

22:23.475 --> 22:27.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you see Trump going to areas
like Youngstown,
which is typically Democratic,
that has a

22:27.780 --> 22:30.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of blue-collar voters that
Trump seems
to be reaching.

22:30.783 --> 22:35.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is reaching a lot of voters
in areas where
the unemployment rate is higher
than it is

22:36.021 --> 22:37.423 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nationally.

22:37.456 --> 22:39.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so you have got that going
on, but Clinton
has also reached out.

22:39.258 --> 22:43.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was just here yesterday with
her largest
crowd to date at Ohio State
University.

22:43.295 --> 22:45.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, she's reaching out in some
of these areas.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you have got these two
forces together.

22:47.566 --> 22:51.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This was Clinton's first
appearance back in
Ohio for quite a while, though.

22:51.370 --> 22:55.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some people had wondered if she
had abandoned
the Buckeye State, but her
campaign said that

22:55.874 --> 22:57.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was absolutely not the case.

22:57.409 --> 23:00.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, President Obama
will be here
on Thursday.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump will also be here
on Thursday.

23:02.481 --> 23:06.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We start early voting tomorrow
statewide in
Ohio, so I think that's part of
the reason

23:06.252 --> 23:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why both those campaigns will be
here.

23:07.620 --> 23:10.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Karen, you mentioned
that videotape,
of course.

23:10.689 --> 23:15.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is the -- is it too early
to tell or
can you tell what the impact is
in Ohio?

23:15.694 --> 23:20.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN KASLER: I think there are
a lot of undecided
voters who are very concerned
about that tape.

23:20.266 --> 23:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have a lot of Christian
evangelical
voters, you have a lot of voters
who are independent

23:25.170 --> 23:27.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voters who are very concerned
about that tape.

23:27.640 --> 23:31.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump's weakness has
been in some
Republican counties like the
state's most

23:31.510 --> 23:35.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican county, Delaware
County, which
is just north of Columbus.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He had not done well there.

23:36.949 --> 23:39.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a county that he
really, I think,
was hoping to get.

23:39.918 --> 23:43.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think it's a little
early to really
figure out what the impact of
those tapes

23:43.589 --> 23:45.424 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
will be.

23:45.457 --> 23:48.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have got the Ohio
Republican chair,
Matt Borges, again saying that
he has talked

23:48.294 --> 23:52.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Donald Trump personally, and
that Trump
has assured him that there will
be no other

23:52.398 --> 23:56.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incidents, no other tapes, no
other things
like this coming out that could
be problematic.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he says he's talking him at
his word.

23:59.138 --> 24:02.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think there are a lot
of Republicans
who are questioning that right
now.

24:02.308 --> 24:06.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, you have got
three major Republican
officeholders in Ohio, Governor
John Kasich,

24:06.578 --> 24:10.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Senator Rob Portman and
state auditor
Dave Yost, who, over the
weekend, came out

24:10.482 --> 24:12.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and said they would no longer
vote for Donald
Trump.

24:12.985 --> 24:16.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a year where endorsements
haven't mattered
a whole lot, I'm wondering what
the impact

24:16.221 --> 24:17.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of that will be.

24:18.023 --> 24:21.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Christopher, in
Arizona, of
course, Senator John McCain over
the weekend

24:21.126 --> 24:25.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said he would no longer -- would
split from
Donald Trump.

24:25.197 --> 24:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But is it -- can you tell yet
what the impact
is among voters of that
videotape?

24:29.835 --> 24:32.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER CONOVER: We really
can't tell
yet.

24:32.805 --> 24:37.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you said, Senator McCain, who
has had a
rocky relationship with Donald
Trump, officially

24:38.010 --> 24:40.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
split from him this weekend.

24:40.312 --> 24:45.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have had others, like the
current governor,
Doug Ducey, repudiate the
statements, say

24:45.651 --> 24:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were terrible things, but
didn't pull
his support away.

24:49.388 --> 24:55.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And former Governor Jan Brewer,
who has campaigned
with Donald Trump in Arizona,
was at the debates

24:55.427 --> 25:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this weekend, also had nothing
good to say
about the tapes, but is still
very openly

25:01.734 --> 25:03.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
supporting Donald Trump.

25:03.402 --> 25:07.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's a little early to say
how it will
all play out here in Arizona
also.

25:07.339 --> 25:12.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Christopher,
Arizona, about
30 percent, I think the -- of
the voting public

25:12.878 --> 25:14.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is Hispanic.

25:14.780 --> 25:19.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A lot of rhetoric about
Hispanics and immigration,
illegal immigration in this
campaign, how

25:19.818 --> 25:21.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has that affected that voting
bloc?

25:21.954 --> 25:27.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER CONOVER: As you
said, about 30
percent of the state is
Hispanic.

25:27.459 --> 25:32.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's interesting is, we don't
know how they're
going to vote because Arizona on
its voter

25:32.364 --> 25:36.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
registration form doesn't ask
anything about
race.

25:36.935 --> 25:43.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we only have to guess how
they are registered
to vote, that group is
registered to vote.

25:43.542 --> 25:51.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nationally, we know that about
69 percent
of Hispanics will vote in this
election -- that's

25:51.683 --> 25:56.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what they're saying -- and that
the majority
of them skew towards the
Democratic Party.

25:57.022 --> 26:02.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, in Arizona, we have
some very high-profile
Republican Hispanics.

26:02.795 --> 26:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it will be very interesting
to see how
that Hispanic vote comes down,
especially

26:07.866 --> 26:11.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with so much that goes on with
immigration
in this campaign.

26:11.770 --> 26:16.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Arizona, immigration isn't
necessarily
something we talk about,
especially in Southern

26:16.241 --> 26:17.209 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Arizona.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just part of life.

26:19.077 --> 26:24.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Karen, in Ohio,
with the close
poll, the voter turnout, getting
out the vote

26:24.149 --> 26:25.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is going to be so important.

26:25.851 --> 26:30.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's the ground game look like
in Ohio,
especially since, as you pointed
out, Donald

26:30.622 --> 26:35.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has been denied in a way
that great
ground organization that John
Kasich, the

26:36.028 --> 26:36.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
governor, has put together?

26:37.029 --> 26:38.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAREN KASLER: Yes.

26:38.831 --> 26:42.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one thing that's interesting
here, first
of all, the Hillary Clinton
campaign and the

26:42.901 --> 26:44.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats have said their ground
game is excellent.

26:44.736 --> 26:49.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the same kind of ground
game they had
in 2008 and 2012, when Barack
Obama won Ohio.

26:49.775 --> 26:52.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you also have an interesting
thing that
happened in the primary, when
John Kasich

26:52.611 --> 26:53.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was still on the ballot.

26:53.879 --> 26:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You had a lot of people who
voted Republican
in that primary.

26:57.149 --> 27:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we end up now at this
point where there
are 1.9 million people in Ohio
who are affiliated

27:02.521 --> 27:06.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Republican Party, 1.1
million people
in Ohio who are affiliated with
the Democratic

27:06.225 --> 27:07.793 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party.

27:07.826 --> 27:10.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's potentially more people
that the Republican
Party could reach out to.

27:10.896 --> 27:14.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether those people will come
back and vote
Republican again remains to be
seen.

27:14.066 --> 27:20.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think the idea that the
Republican Party
that is not necessarily united
behind Donald

27:20.472 --> 27:24.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, even though the Ohio
Republican Party
chair says he's still going to
be working

27:24.376 --> 27:28.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Trump at least, at this
point in time
-- others are saying they're
not.

27:28.814 --> 27:33.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Without that organization and
that unification,
will they be able to reach all
those voters

27:33.051 --> 27:37.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and get those people out to come
out over
Hillary Clinton and her ground
game?

27:37.956 --> 27:42.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Karen Kasler in
Columbus, Ohio,
Christopher Conover in Tucson,
Arizona, thanks

27:42.561 --> 27:43.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so much for joining us.

27:43.562 --> 27:44.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAREN KASLER: Thanks.

27:44.563 --> 27:46.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER CONOVER: Thank you.

27:46.198 --> 27:49.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On our Web
site: What does
weather have to do with
democracy?

27:49.201 --> 27:54.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A Making Sense columnist
examines how rain
and, yes, hurricane damage and
flooding can

27:54.506 --> 27:56.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
affect elections.

27:56.108 --> 28:01.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

28:01.179 --> 28:11.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

28:11.790 --> 28:16.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
for-profit colleges
under fire from the federal
government; and

28:16.695 --> 28:20.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the French composer who
transformed animals
into a musical masterpiece.

28:20.899 --> 28:26.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: The Greek government
has begun
a pilot program to educate
refugee children

28:27.005 --> 28:31.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stranded in the country, because
nations along
the migrant trail to Northern
Europe have

28:31.743 --> 28:33.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
closed their borders.

28:33.412 --> 28:37.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is estimated there are more
than 20,000
children in refugee camps in
Greece.

28:37.916 --> 28:42.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The plan is being resisted by
some Greeks,
who say they worry about
refugees carrying

28:42.654 --> 28:46.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
infections and also about the
cultural change
the plan might bring.

28:46.858 --> 28:50.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There have been protests in a
number of towns.

28:50.062 --> 28:53.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant has
been looking at the issue, and
starts his

28:53.398 --> 28:56.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

Western Greece.

28:56.201 --> 28:57.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: What's your
name?

28:57.402 --> 28:58.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOHAMMED ZAITOON, Refugee: My
name's Mohammed.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Where are you
from?

29:00.372 --> 29:01.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOHAMMED ZAITOON: I'm from
Syria.

29:01.373 --> 29:02.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Yes.

29:02.441 --> 29:03.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And whereabouts in Syria are you
from?

29:03.508 --> 29:05.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOHAMMED ZAITOON: I'm from -- I
live in Damascus.

29:05.243 --> 29:07.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: What's your

29:07.079 --> 29:09.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SELMA ZAITOON, Refugee: My name
is Selma.

29:09.681 --> 29:16.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ZAITOON: I'm sad
because I don't
have school now.

29:16.188 --> 29:17.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I want to go to school,
actually.

29:17.723 --> 29:21.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SELMA ZAITOON: I would like now
to go to school.

29:21.259 --> 29:22.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But I can't.

29:22.694 --> 29:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, here, I don't have school,
but I want
to go to school.

29:27.899 --> 29:33.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The children's
formal education
ended 15 months ago, when they
left Syria.

29:33.639 --> 29:34.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Their father is Ammar Zaitoon.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMMAR ZAITOON, Refugee: I have
three children.

29:36.842 --> 29:40.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Two of them were in school.

29:40.512 --> 29:43.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they always get top marks.

29:43.081 --> 29:47.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Like tens of
thousands of
other refugees, the Zaitoons
wanted to settle

29:47.953 --> 29:52.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elsewhere, but are now stuck in
Greece, where
anti-migrant sentiment is
significant, especially

29:52.991 --> 29:54.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over the issue of education.

29:54.693 --> 29:58.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMMAR ZAITOON: We were
disappointed for that.

29:58.330 --> 30:04.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to know, why do they
don't want our
children to go to school?

30:04.736 --> 30:13.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We'd like something like to
speak with them
just in order to knowing us more
and more,

30:13.311 --> 30:15.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that we are simple people.

30:15.280 --> 30:18.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have the right to teach our
children.

30:18.450 --> 30:19.418 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We like life.

30:19.451 --> 30:20.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We like education.

30:20.986 --> 30:23.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syrian people are very good
workers.

30:23.689 --> 30:26.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when they study, they will
be good in
school.

30:26.892 --> 30:31.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The family
lives in Filippiada,
a small town in Western Greece.

30:31.163 --> 30:36.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The parent-teacher association
told the Education
Ministry that under no
circumstances would

30:36.234 --> 30:42.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they accept children from a
nearby camp, citing
fears about cultural differences
and infectious

30:42.407 --> 30:43.909 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
diseases.

30:43.942 --> 30:46.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They claimed their presence
would alter the
Greek character of the schools.

30:46.978 --> 30:50.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most parents we approached
refused to talk.

30:50.315 --> 30:52.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But Christos Gartzis spoke up.

30:52.317 --> 30:57.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHRISTOS GARTZIS, Greece
(through translator):
The education issue is not a
problem for us,

30:57.289 --> 31:02.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as all these children have the
right to education,
but, first of all, the
government have to

31:02.160 --> 31:03.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
solve their housing problems.

31:03.995 --> 31:07.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They must be relocated to more
modern facilities.

31:07.432 --> 31:12.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These children are going to be
permanently
ill during the winter, with
colds and coughs,

31:12.137 --> 31:14.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
viruses and maybe even
pneumonia.

31:14.506 --> 31:17.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What kind of schooling will we
be able to
offer them then?

31:17.843 --> 31:22.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Several hundred
refugees,
mainly from Syria and
Afghanistan, live in

31:22.414 --> 31:26.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tents in a former army base on
the outskirts
of Filippiada.

31:27.018 --> 31:31.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are about 150 children who
do have the
occasional lesson from
volunteers.

31:31.623 --> 31:36.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, mostly, they while away the
hours playing.

31:36.394 --> 31:40.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Filippiada's rejection of
refugee children
has put it beneath an
unfavorable spotlight,

31:40.766 --> 31:45.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the conservative mayor,
Nikolaos Kalantzis,
has been trying to limit the
damage to the

31:45.504 --> 31:47.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
town's reputation.

31:47.405 --> 31:52.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIKOLAOS KALANTZIS, Mayor of
Filippiada, Greece
(through translator): This is a
rather unique

31:52.711 --> 31:55.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue, in that the people who
have come here
don't actually want to stay
here.

31:55.847 --> 31:58.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want to move on and are
seeking ways
to do so.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a matter of trying to
manage an interim
period for these people.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At least that's the way I see
it.

32:03.355 --> 32:07.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, this is not just
a problem
for Filippiada, but also for
Greece itself

32:07.092 --> 32:11.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, in general, Europe, too,
since extreme
racist and nationalist feelings
are on the

32:11.763 --> 32:13.231 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rise.

32:13.265 --> 32:16.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in no way whatsoever could
Filippiada
be considered as a racist town.

32:16.835 --> 32:22.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Like every
aspect of life
in Greece, education has been
hit by the country's

32:22.340 --> 32:24.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
six-year-long financial crisis.

32:24.943 --> 32:28.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government has been forced
to lay off
teachers, and schools like this
are being

32:28.713 --> 32:34.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
run on half the budget
previously available
before the country went
bankrupt.

32:34.352 --> 32:40.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But headmaster George Gioldasis
is a strong
believer in the universal right
of children

32:40.525 --> 32:42.527 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to an education.

32:42.561 --> 32:46.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE GIOLDASIS, Headmaster
(through translator):
Problems definitely exist, but
we, the teachers,

32:46.231 --> 32:50.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together with the parents and
parent-teacher's
association, as well as the
citizens of this

32:50.836 --> 32:55.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town, are trying to solve them
with the limited
resources we have from the
municipality for

32:55.407 --> 32:57.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
education.

32:57.342 --> 33:01.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're trying to at least solve
the basic problems
at the moment, but, in my
opinion, much more

33:01.046 --> 33:05.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
funding is going to be required
in order to
be able to provide the
infrastructure and

33:05.584 --> 33:10.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prerequisites necessary for the
integration
of refugee children into our
schools.

33:10.155 --> 33:15.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Greece's
education minister
says that the country has an
obligation to

33:15.594 --> 33:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
provide schooling for refugee
children.

33:18.263 --> 33:22.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's announced a program
where six schools
will open up in Athens, and
there'll be three

33:22.300 --> 33:24.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
others in towns around the
country.

33:24.436 --> 33:29.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the minister says that this
initiative
will spread throughout Greece
through October.

33:29.774 --> 33:35.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The money to pay for it is
supposed to be
coming from a $1 billion fund
provided to

33:35.747 --> 33:40.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Greece by the European Union,
which is supposed
to help during the refugee
crisis.

33:40.852 --> 33:46.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But there's been strong
resistance from nationalists
in the northern town of
Oraiokastro.

33:46.791 --> 33:50.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rally organizers insisted
they were just
concerned citizens.

33:50.161 --> 33:55.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some rhetoric sounded
similar to that
of the ultra-right Golden Dawn
Party.

33:55.500 --> 34:02.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A riot police cordon prevented
clashes with
about 200 left-wing protesters.

34:02.107 --> 34:07.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The demonstrators emphasized
their orthodox
Christian heritage and
abhorrence of Islam.

34:07.712 --> 34:14.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Organizer Spiros Haravopoulos
says his ancestors
were victims of a Turkish
genocide on the

34:14.419 --> 34:18.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Black Sea nearly a century ago.

34:18.523 --> 34:20.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"We are the Greeks.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's who we are," he shouts.

34:22.661 --> 34:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a place where history is
never forgotten,
especially Greece's 400 years
under the Islamic

34:28.867 --> 34:30.869 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ottoman Empire.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPIROS HARAVOPOULOS, Protester
Organizer (through
translator): Of course we care
about the refugees,

34:33.972 --> 34:37.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but let them go to other
countries, where
their own religion is widely
practiced, such

34:37.542 --> 34:40.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the
United Arab Emirates.

34:40.345 --> 34:43.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have nothing against the
refugees, but
they have been brought here
without anyone

34:43.682 --> 34:46.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
having asked us if we want them
here.

34:46.184 --> 34:50.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other people can't be allowed to
decide what
we want without us being asked
first, and

34:50.755 --> 34:52.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's why we're protesting here
tonight.

34:52.724 --> 34:56.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Apart from the fact that they
have been terrifying
the people here, members of the
same government

34:56.528 --> 35:01.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that was voted into power by
citizens of this
place are calling us Nazis.

35:01.433 --> 35:09.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Greece belongs
to the Greeks,
bellowed lawyer Dimitris
Mihakis, as he whipped

35:09.541 --> 35:11.409 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up the crowd.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIMITRIS MIHAKIS, Attorney
(through translator):
Are we supposed to allow this
and make our

35:12.610 --> 35:14.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
schools just for the minority?

35:14.079 --> 35:16.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do they want a Greek minority
here in Greece?

35:16.147 --> 35:19.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will not permit Greek schools
to be turned
into minority schools.

35:19.484 --> 35:23.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The plan is obviously to cause
problems and
unrest in this country in order
to satisfy

35:23.355 --> 35:27.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some other fanciful geostrategic
plans which
they have in mind for us.

35:27.125 --> 35:32.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Despite being
the object
of fear, suspicion and hate,
Ammar Zaitoon

35:32.364 --> 35:35.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is remaining calm.

35:35.033 --> 35:43.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMMAR ZAITOON: We know that the
Greek people
were living the same situation
in the past.

35:44.009 --> 35:48.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, actually, they are good
people.

35:48.146 --> 35:54.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know, sometimes, sometimes,
you don't want
to see other people in your
country.

35:54.352 --> 35:58.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, you don't want to see
another -- refugees
in your country.

35:58.823 --> 36:00.692 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We respect that.

36:00.725 --> 36:03.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, even so, they are very good
with us.

36:03.528 --> 36:10.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They receive us, and they are
trying to help
us as best as they can.

36:10.335 --> 36:16.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: As the rally
organizers danced
in the rain, they were condemned
as fascists

36:16.307 --> 36:21.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the left-wing protesters, who
chanted slogans
in support of the refugees.

36:21.079 --> 36:24.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"Fatherland, faith, and family.

36:24.416 --> 36:28.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Long live Greece," he cried.

36:28.586 --> 36:36.461 align:left position:37.5%,start line:80% size:62.5%
The
government's determination to
provide classes

36:36.494 --> 36:39.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nationwide will be severely
tested.

36:39.064 --> 36:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A new battleground awaits the
war children.

36:42.133 --> 36:54.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Northern Greece.

36:54.813 --> 37:01.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This has been
a tough fall
in the world of for-profit
colleges, and for

37:01.419 --> 37:03.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of the students who attend
them.

37:03.254 --> 37:08.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The latest case, the bankruptcy
and abrupt
shutdown of ITT, one of the
largest for-profit

37:08.593 --> 37:10.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
technical schools.

37:10.295 --> 37:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its 130 campuses were closed
last month after
the Department of Education said
it could

37:15.166 --> 37:20.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no longer enroll new students
who relied on
federal loans and grants to
attend.

37:20.705 --> 37:24.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration cited
problems with
its accreditation and concerns
that it was

37:24.642 --> 37:26.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
misleading students.

37:26.544 --> 37:31.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That has left about 35,000
students up in
the air over their future.

37:31.516 --> 37:35.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is the subject of our
weekly segment
on education, Making the Grade.

37:35.620 --> 37:38.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Fain of the news site
Inside Higher Ed
joins me now.

37:38.389 --> 37:43.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, tell us, first of all, why
is ITT shutting
down?

37:43.294 --> 37:46.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How important are they in the
pantheon of
the for-profit school system?

37:46.464 --> 37:49.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL FAIN, Inside Higher Ed:
They're one of
the biggest, one of the oldest,
most-established

37:49.934 --> 37:53.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for-profit companies, with
campuses in 38
states.

37:53.838 --> 37:59.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They used to have campuses in 38
states, so
definitely one of the most
important players.

37:59.477 --> 38:04.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Year -- several tough years,
hemorrhaging
students and revenue.

38:05.016 --> 38:11.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they got hit with
several investigations
and lawsuits, federal and state,
some serious

38:11.256 --> 38:18.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charges, the Consumer Financial
Protection
Bureau, the SEC both pursuing
them legally.

38:18.163 --> 38:23.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you had an accreditor
raising questions
about their record-keeping, and
the Fed finally

38:23.701 --> 38:26.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, too much risk for those
students and
taxpayers.

38:26.204 --> 38:30.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there were just several
sanctions that
were really the end for the
company.

38:30.575 --> 38:31.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But what about
those 35,000
students?

38:31.910 --> 38:32.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do they do?

38:32.977 --> 38:35.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL FAIN: They are in a real
tough bind.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have two major choices.

38:37.382 --> 38:41.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, they can elect to have
their debt forgiven.

38:41.786 --> 38:47.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They can -- all the aid that
they had received,
the loans, they can have
forgiven by the federal

38:47.892 --> 38:49.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

38:49.093 --> 38:50.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, if they do that, their
credits don't
transfer.

38:51.029 --> 38:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they seek to continue their
program somewhere
else, which might be tough as
is, they might

38:55.066 --> 39:00.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not be able to find an option or
a similar
program nearby, those credits
won't count,

39:00.605 --> 39:02.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if they take the payoff.

39:02.106 --> 39:05.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And who is the
demographic
that goes to these schools?

39:05.109 --> 39:09.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL FAIN: Well, you're looking
at working
adults, basically, often the
first in their

39:09.214 --> 39:14.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family to go to college, many
veterans at
ITT and some other for-profits,
and really

39:14.619 --> 39:20.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just working adults looking to
advance themselves,
maybe to break into a career,
maybe to get

39:20.058 --> 39:25.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a credential, so they can get
out of a low-pay
job, folks who are working at
night, weekends

39:25.630 --> 39:27.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to try to really advance
themselves.

39:27.131 --> 39:29.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, it wasn't
easy for them
to try to get this route.

39:29.634 --> 39:31.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now they have put in all
this time.

39:31.169 --> 39:34.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And if the credits don't
transfer, they might
be back at square one.

39:34.272 --> 39:35.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL FAIN: Absolutely.

39:36.007 --> 39:39.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No matter what you think of ITT,
you have
to feel sorry or really
concerned about these

39:39.344 --> 39:43.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students, because a lot of them
are really
just trying to get ahead to
really advance

39:43.248 --> 39:44.215 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
themselves.

39:44.249 --> 39:45.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And put this in context.

39:46.251 --> 39:47.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This isn't the first school.

39:47.819 --> 39:49.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is just the latest school
in the for-profit
world that's had problems.

39:49.887 --> 39:52.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We heard about Corinthian a
while back.

39:52.323 --> 39:53.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's been other schools
as well.

39:53.491 --> 39:54.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL FAIN: Correct.

39:54.492 --> 39:57.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Corinthian was even larger,
72,000 students.

39:57.328 --> 39:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A couple years ago, it shut
down.

39:59.097 --> 40:04.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now what remains of it in a
different owner's
hands is only about 10,000
students.

40:04.502 --> 40:10.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A few years ago, about one in 10
students
in America were at for-profit
institutions.

40:10.875 --> 40:16.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's declined to about 6
percent of the
total, so really an existential
crisis for

40:16.281 --> 40:17.248 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these companies.

40:17.282 --> 40:19.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's a lot of reasons for
that.

40:19.050 --> 40:22.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's not clear what the
future is for
for-profit higher education.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is it the
business model?

40:23.688 --> 40:24.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that working anymore?

40:24.989 --> 40:28.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You see -- you used to see ads
nonstop on
TV at late night.

40:28.393 --> 40:29.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it was competitive.

40:29.727 --> 40:31.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was DeVry and ITT and Phoenix
Online.

40:31.696 --> 40:33.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL FAIN: Right.

40:33.064 --> 40:34.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And there were
so many different
opportunities.

40:34.732 --> 40:36.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL FAIN: And they were
booming.

40:36.668 --> 40:42.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had massive growth coming
right after
the recession, as folks dropped
out of the

40:42.640 --> 40:48.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economy and were really trying
to retool themselves,
and these schools reached out to
them.

40:48.079 --> 40:51.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They tended to be better than
their competitors
when it comes to advertising,
because they

40:51.649 --> 40:53.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had the money to do that.

40:53.551 --> 40:55.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But several factors have hit
them.

40:55.353 --> 40:57.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, first of all, the
recovery has recovered
a little bit.

40:57.989 --> 41:02.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you have fewer folks looking
to go back
to school to try to find a job.

41:02.827 --> 41:11.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have just waves of bad
publicity, investigations,
criticism by the media, by
lawmakers, primarily

41:11.936 --> 41:13.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats, which I think has
taken a toll.

41:13.738 --> 41:16.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the word for-profit has
a bit of a
stigma.

41:16.541 --> 41:19.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's the companies
themselves who will
say that.

41:19.277 --> 41:22.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I just think it's a harder
sell.

41:22.914 --> 41:26.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of them are a little bit
more expensive
than community colleges.

41:26.217 --> 41:30.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They say they offer more
services to help
students, but it's a little
harder to get

41:30.922 --> 41:34.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
someone to pay $15,000 or more
to go to one
of these programs.

41:34.092 --> 41:37.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But what do
the executives
at these companies say about
their plight

41:37.795 --> 41:39.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and how the environment has
changed?

41:39.764 --> 41:43.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL FAIN: Well, first of all,
they say they
have been treated unfairly, that
this administration

41:43.735 --> 41:48.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Senate Democrats have
cracked down on
them more than the rest of
higher education.

41:48.973 --> 41:54.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are questions about all of
higher education's
return on investment, the value
of a degree.

41:54.178 --> 41:58.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's quite clear that
the best way
to get a job is to get a degree.

41:58.950 --> 42:02.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But people are concerned about
student debt
on the whole.

42:02.320 --> 42:08.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for-profit higher education
has really
received, I think, the first
wave of aggressive

42:08.426 --> 42:12.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
federal policy to try to make
sure students
are getting what they pay for.

42:12.930 --> 42:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Paul Fain of
the news site
Inside Higher Ed, thanks for
joining us.

42:15.967 --> 42:17.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL FAIN: Thanks for having me.

42:17.702 --> 42:20.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And speaking
of student
debt, college affordability has
become an

42:20.772 --> 42:22.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
issue in the election.

42:22.607 --> 42:27.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been taking a look at
what's behind
the growth of that debt and just
how big a

42:27.044 --> 42:28.780 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
problem it is.

42:28.813 --> 42:33.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of our year-long
series How the
Deck Is Stacked, funded by the
Corporation

42:33.317 --> 42:35.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for Public Broadcasting.

42:35.119 --> 42:38.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our partners at "Frontline" and
Marketplace
put together a video explainer
that's been

42:38.656 --> 42:43.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drawing some attention for
laying out the
landscape of student debt.

42:43.327 --> 42:45.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marketplace host Kai Ryssdal is
our guide.

42:45.430 --> 42:51.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL, Marketplace: Today,
student debt
is a staggering $1.3 trillion.

42:51.202 --> 42:56.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But how bad is that for the
economy and for
the people holding all that
debt?

42:56.274 --> 43:00.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a debate going on right
now, and some
experts argue, maybe it's not as
bad as we

43:00.244 --> 43:01.412 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
think.

43:01.446 --> 43:09.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm Kai Ryssdal, and this is How
the Deck
Is Stacked.

43:09.387 --> 43:11.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One-point-three trillion
dollars.

43:11.222 --> 43:13.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, how did we get here?

43:13.191 --> 43:16.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One reason for the growth is
simply because
many more people have been going
to college.

43:16.928 --> 43:20.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the great recession, when
the economy
tanked, a lot of people couldn't
get a job,

43:20.932 --> 43:25.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so they decided to go back to
school, and
most people can't pay for school
without taking

43:25.102 --> 43:26.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out some student loans.

43:26.404 --> 43:30.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2008, about 29 million people
held student
debt.

43:30.441 --> 43:33.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
By 2015, that was up to 40
million people.

43:34.011 --> 43:36.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More people in school equals
more overall
debt.

43:36.047 --> 43:42.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, the cost of
college also
went up, while state funding for
higher education

43:42.053 --> 43:43.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
went down.

43:43.888 --> 43:49.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, despite the rise in debt,
some experts
say that this idea of a crisis
is overblown.

43:49.460 --> 43:53.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Student debt is much smaller
than mortgage
debt, and so they say that
shouldn't tank

43:53.264 --> 43:55.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the economy.

43:55.099 --> 43:58.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also argue that, for most
of those 40
million people, taking on the
debt is going

43:58.903 --> 44:00.304 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be OK.

44:00.338 --> 44:04.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reality is, only 8 percent
of debt holders
owe more than $75,000.

44:04.709 --> 44:08.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many of those people went to
graduate
school, which should increase
their earning

44:08.646 --> 44:10.414 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
potential.

44:10.448 --> 44:14.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then there are the majority of
borrowers,
almost 70 percent, who owe less
than $25,000.

44:14.552 --> 44:18.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that still is a whole lot
of money for
most of us.

44:18.322 --> 44:23.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, on average, people with a
bachelor's
degree make around $20,000 more
a year than

44:23.227 --> 44:24.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those with only a high school
diploma.

44:25.029 --> 44:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, while it may be a struggle
in the short
term, chances are, most will be
able to pay

44:29.500 --> 44:31.502 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it off.

44:31.536 --> 44:35.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then there are the people
who are really
hurting, people who took out
loans, but didn't

44:35.172 --> 44:36.874 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
finish school.

44:36.908 --> 44:40.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of them owe less than
$10,000, which
might seem small, but they won't
be getting

44:40.811 --> 44:44.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the pay boost from a degree, and
yet still
have to pay back that debt.

44:44.515 --> 44:50.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with bills to pay, interest
accruing,
and fees, they can get behind
pretty quickly.

44:50.621 --> 44:54.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For this group, the risk of
taking on the
debt might not have been worth
it.

44:54.559 --> 44:58.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for the majority of us, the
investment
might be.

44:58.362 --> 45:00.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yet many of us don't feel that
way.

45:00.665 --> 45:04.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know that because you told
us.

45:04.235 --> 45:08.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In our Marketplace/Edison
Research Poll, nearly
40 percent of you said the
education wasn't

45:08.105 --> 45:10.608 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
worth the debt.

45:10.641 --> 45:11.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why is this?

45:11.876 --> 45:14.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, we're not anxious about
college debt
in a vacuum.

45:14.378 --> 45:15.580 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

45:15.613 --> 45:17.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got a lot of other
economic worries
on our minds.

45:17.582 --> 45:21.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That video
actually was
produced for the Web in 360
degrees, where

45:21.752 --> 45:25.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can point your phone in any
direction
to look around the story.

45:25.056 --> 45:35.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can see the full story by

going to "Frontline"'s
Facebook page.

45:40.371 --> 45:45.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now "The Carnival of Animals"
and a famous
composer who felt he was
celebrated for the

45:45.843 --> 45:47.445 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wrong thing.

45:47.478 --> 45:52.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Camille Saint Saens would have
celebrated
his 181st birthday this past
weekend.

45:52.850 --> 45:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once again, pianist Rob Kapilow
joins Jeffrey
Brown to explore what makes
great music.

45:57.321 --> 45:59.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Rob Kapilow,
welcome.

45:59.090 --> 46:00.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW, Composer: Thanks
for having me.

46:00.625 --> 46:03.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, today, we're
marking the
birthday of Camille Saint Saens.

46:03.961 --> 46:08.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a story of a great
composer who didn't
quite get the legacy that he
wanted.

46:08.165 --> 46:11.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROB KAPILOW: During his
lifetime, I mean,
he was a famous composer, one of
the most

46:11.535 --> 46:14.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
famous composers in the world,
writing serious
operas, serious symphonies.

46:15.006 --> 46:17.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Tell us a little
bit about
him, for those who don't know.

46:17.108 --> 46:19.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Well, you know, he
was also one
of the world's greatest musical
prodigies.

46:19.577 --> 46:23.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, many people think he
was even more
of a prodigy than Mozart or
Mendelssohn.

46:23.547 --> 46:25.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He started piano at
two-and-a-half.

46:25.650 --> 46:30.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wrote his first piece at
four-and-a-half,
made a public debut at 10, in
which not only

46:30.621 --> 46:34.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did he play two concertos and
write his own
cadenza, but, for an encore, he
offered to

46:34.492 --> 46:38.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
play any Beethoven sonata from
memory that
the audience wanted.

46:38.362 --> 46:44.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's 32 sonatas at the age of
10, one of
the great musical proteges,
utterly famous,

46:44.135 --> 46:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yet then, for a joke, he writes
this piece
that literally became his
legacy.

46:48.272 --> 46:51.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, "Carnival of
the Animals,"
written for a friend, becomes
this famous

46:51.876 --> 46:52.843 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
piece.

46:52.877 --> 46:54.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us about it.

46:54.779 --> 46:57.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Yes, it was a
little party piece,
and, in it, he took 14 animals
in this grand

46:57.181 --> 47:04.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
zoological fantasy, is what he
called it.

47:04.088 --> 47:08.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And each movement turns an
animal somehow
into music.

47:08.993 --> 47:13.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the simplest way is to take
the sound
of the actual animal, and, in
the first movement,

47:13.397 --> 47:14.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's what happens.

47:14.398 --> 47:20.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lion's roar is turned into
music.

47:20.471 --> 47:34.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, sometimes, for example, in
"Hemiones,"
which is a wild Tibetan donkey
famous for

47:34.051 --> 47:39.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
running at blinding speed up and
down rough
mountains, he turns the idea of
the animal

47:39.056 --> 47:44.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into music, and turns that into
two pianists
running up and down the keyboard
at blinding

47:44.361 --> 47:47.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
speed in unison.

47:47.798 --> 47:56.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He also has this
movement called
"The Pianists."

47:56.073 --> 47:57.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROB KAPILOW: Yes.

47:57.374 --> 47:58.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's sort of a
joke, pianist
as an animal.

47:58.743 --> 47:59.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROB KAPILOW: Yes.

47:59.744 --> 48:00.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just a joke.

48:00.745 --> 48:01.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, it's like based on the
scale.

48:01.979 --> 48:05.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's based on these ridiculous
scales that
pianists do.

48:05.182 --> 48:10.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe that's the animal that
annoys the neighbors
when the pianists are actually
playing.

48:10.387 --> 48:15.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Pianists as
animals in a sense.

48:15.292 --> 48:16.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROB KAPILOW: Pianists as
animals.

48:16.527 --> 48:17.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Anybody can be a joke.

48:17.528 --> 48:19.463 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

48:19.497 --> 48:23.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One movement,
"The Swan," next-to-last
movement, did become hugely --
maybe the most

48:23.400 --> 48:24.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
famous part.

48:24.668 --> 48:26.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: It became the most
famous piece
he ever wrote.

48:26.036 --> 48:27.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's interesting.

48:27.772 --> 48:30.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the only movement that he
actually allowed
to be published during his
lifetime.

48:30.641 --> 48:35.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I visited with
Yo-Yo Ma last
year for a piece for the
"NewsHour," and he

48:35.112 --> 48:46.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
played "The Swan" for us.

48:47.024 --> 49:00.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what makes "The Swan" work
so well?

49:00.404 --> 49:03.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Well, I think
writing the piece
so quickly gave him access to
one of the most

49:03.941 --> 49:05.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
beautiful, simple melodies he
ever wrote.

49:05.709 --> 49:11.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it starts off with
nothing but the
two pianos being the rippling
waters, and

49:11.615 --> 49:14.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a little crest of a wave.

49:14.552 --> 49:15.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then everything focuses on the
cello.

49:16.020 --> 49:17.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There were only three ideas.

49:17.488 --> 49:23.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A swan's neck dips, the same
idea lower.

49:23.561 --> 49:30.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then the swan's neck rises
gracefully on a
long note, and then a simple
scale.

49:30.334 --> 49:33.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But one note makes it great.

49:33.404 --> 49:38.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We stretch it out.

49:38.209 --> 49:47.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead of this, we get this
beautiful high
note on the cello.

49:47.418 --> 49:56.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We go on a journey with this, we
come back,
we repeat the whole thing a
second time, and

49:56.427 --> 49:59.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's a beautiful epilogue at
the end telling
us the message.

50:00.030 --> 50:05.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, for the first time, all of
a sudden,
the rippling waters stop.

50:05.636 --> 50:08.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know something important is
being shared
with us now.

50:08.739 --> 50:14.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We journey with the piece's
three ideas, and
we finish with a simple scale
stretched out

50:14.378 --> 50:23.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like this.

50:23.220 --> 50:26.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The rippling waters stop.

50:26.891 --> 50:30.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been wanting to resolve
not up here,
but down here.

50:30.160 --> 50:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for the first time, we
resolve the piece
on a single cello note without
accompaniment.

50:36.267 --> 50:39.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The accompaniment has always
been in the middle
register, not noticeable at all.

50:39.904 --> 50:45.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, after this resolution of
the cello, suddenly,
from the heavens, up here, in a
brand-new

50:45.643 --> 50:59.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
register, the pianos take over,
those rippling
waters become the topic.

50:59.790 --> 51:02.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we finish with one last
wave.

51:02.426 --> 51:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, "The Swan" is
the only
part that he did allow to be
published, but

51:09.400 --> 51:10.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the rest of it, he didn't
want...

51:10.401 --> 51:11.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: The rest of it is
banished.

51:11.402 --> 51:12.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He wanted it to
go away?

51:12.403 --> 51:13.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: He wanted it to go
away.

51:13.404 --> 51:15.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said it could be published
after he died.

51:15.606 --> 51:16.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But he was really worried.

51:17.007 --> 51:18.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Legacy was an important issue.

51:18.475 --> 51:20.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he was a serious French
composer.

51:20.110 --> 51:22.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that wasn't what he wanted
to be known
for.

51:22.513 --> 51:27.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, somehow, what snuck into
this piece was
the most exquisite, pure,
simple, beautiful

51:27.618 --> 51:30.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
melody that he ever wrote, "The
Swan."

51:30.287 --> 51:32.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Rob Kapilow,
thank you very
much.

51:32.289 --> 51:43.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Thanks so much,
Jeff.

51:43.901 --> 51:58.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And later
tonight on "Frontline":
a deep look into one of the
United States'

51:58.749 --> 52:02.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
biggest foreign policy
challenges, confronting
ISIS.

52:02.586 --> 52:06.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The film uses on-the-ground
reporting and
interviews with key leaders to
try to unravel

52:06.757 --> 52:13.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the multidimensional war that
has the U.S.
and Russia competing on the
Mideast battlefield,

52:13.163 --> 52:14.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
particularly in Syria.

52:14.732 --> 52:20.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Suddenly, boom, the
Russians are bombing.

52:20.270 --> 52:25.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Russian airstrikes have
killed hundreds
of civilians and caused massive
destruction

52:25.876 --> 52:27.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to residential areas.

52:27.044 --> 52:30.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: But the Russians were
not bombing
ISIS.

52:30.114 --> 52:33.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: The question of exactly,
who is Russia
targeting?

52:33.050 --> 52:39.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: What
they said they were going to do
was come in

52:39.790 --> 52:45.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and fight ISIL and use their
influence to
move Assad aside and thereby end
the civil

52:45.062 --> 52:51.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
war in Syria, which has been one
of the causes
of the whole fertile ground for
ISIL.

52:51.535 --> 52:53.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They didn't do either of those
things.

52:53.137 --> 52:54.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: So they lied to you?

52:54.872 --> 52:59.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER: Well, they
certainly had a
very different interpretation of
combating

52:59.143 --> 53:00.511 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ISIL.

53:00.544 --> 53:05.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: "Frontline"
airs tonight
on most PBS stations.

53:05.682 --> 53:10.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: Some years,
it's bittersweet, some years,
it's just bitter,

53:10.521 --> 53:14.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but loving the Cubs has been a
pastime for
the "NewsHour"'s Murrey Jacobson
since he

53:14.224 --> 53:15.492 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was a boy.

53:15.526 --> 53:18.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, with sons of his own, he
has a new feeling
this year.

53:18.262 --> 53:23.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Read all about it on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:23.400 --> 53:25.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:25.302 --> 53:29.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wednesday, our Leading Edge
series explores
the surprising way Portland,
Oregon, discovered

53:29.406 --> 53:31.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shocking levels of air
pollution.

53:31.608 --> 53:32.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

53:32.676 --> 53:34.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

53:34.845 --> 53:41.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

53:41.085 --> 53:44.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
