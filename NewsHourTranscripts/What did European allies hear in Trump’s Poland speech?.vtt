WOODRUFF: As we've heard,
President Trump has voiced,
at times, contradictory views

00:05.200 --> 00:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the U.S.'s relationship
with its European
allies and with Russia.

00:09.766 --> 00:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To parse out where things stand
after the first full day of
the president's trip abroad

00:14.733 --> 00:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the road ahead, we
turn to Paula Dobriansky.

00:18.433 --> 00:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was under secretary
of state for democracy
and global affairs
during the George W. Bush

00:24.033 --> 00:26.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

00:26.166 --> 00:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's now a senior fellow
at Harvard University and
she joins us from Warsaw.

00:31.866 --> 00:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Karen Donfried was special
assistant to the president and
senior director for European

00:37.466 --> 00:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
affairs on the National
Security Council during
the Obama administration.

00:40.900 --> 00:45.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She's now the president
of the German Marshall
Fund in the U.S., an
organization which seeks

00:47.000 --> 00:49.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to straighten
relations with Europe.

00:49.100 --> 00:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we welcome both
of you to the program.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Paula Dobriansky, to
you first in Warsaw.

00:54.366 --> 00:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Overall, what would you say
the message is from President
Trump that's come across to

01:00.200 --> 01:02.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his European listeners?

01:02.700 --> 01:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL DOBRIANSKY, FORMER
GEORGE W. BUSH STATE
DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:
Well, the primary message

01:08.366 --> 01:11.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was that European security
matters to us greatly,
that towards that end that
the forward deployment

01:13.866 --> 01:17.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of our troops on the
border matter greatly.

01:17.133 --> 01:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They reassure not just the
Poles but the neighborhood.

01:21.033 --> 01:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And also the important of the
alliance, that Article 5, our
collective defense is crucial

01:27.966 --> 01:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and toward that end, that
alliance has played an
important role in the past.

01:31.433 --> 01:33.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It does now and it
will in the future.

01:33.900 --> 01:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And let me just add, combined
with that, it was very clear
that, related, the president

01:41.000 --> 01:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also made it very clear that he
was very concerned about Russian
aggression and the need to have

01:47.000 --> 01:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a cessation of the violence
and the conflict in Ukraine,
as well as in Syria.

01:53.300 --> 01:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He talked about Islamic radical
terrorism, and then he also
talked about energy security,

01:58.533 --> 02:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which hasn't gotten a lot of
attention and it's behind me
here at the royal castle where

02:03.366 --> 02:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he gave a speech actually before
what's called the Three Seas
Summit, an initiative paid

02:10.433 --> 02:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the Poles, the Croats and
there were 12 countries from
Central Europe that spoke to

02:13.366 --> 02:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this issue about the need
for energy dependents,
energy security and
energy efficiency and

02:19.966 --> 02:22.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the establishment
of an infrastructure
in Central Europe.

02:22.200 --> 02:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Karen Donfried, are
those the main messages that
to you have come across from

02:26.533 --> 02:28.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this trip?

02:28.500 --> 02:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN DONFRIED, FORMER OBAMA
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL STAFF:
There were two things that

02:30.000 --> 02:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
struck me about President
Trump's stop in Poland.

02:31.733 --> 02:36.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
One was what a big boost
this was to the current
Polish government.

02:38.733 --> 02:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Poland is an overwhelmingly
pro-American country and that's
significant in the context of a

02:44.433 --> 02:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
European Union that's been
quite critical of democratic
backsliding in Poland.

02:51.466 --> 02:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the European Commission
has been looking at whether
Poland is staying true to rule

02:54.933 --> 02:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of law, independent judiciary,
freedom of the press.

02:57.933 --> 03:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it was very significant
for this Polish government.

03:01.500 --> 03:05.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second thing that struck
me was the speech he gave
that Paula just referred to.

03:05.866 --> 03:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the one hand, had
many elements of the
traditional transatlantic
speech, reaffirming

03:13.400 --> 03:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. commitment to the
Article 5, the collective
defense piece of the NATO
alliance, his support

03:18.800 --> 03:21.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for strong transatlantic
relationship.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then on the other hand,
you had a dark view of a clash
of civilizations and you had

03:27.966 --> 03:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it on your opening clip, the
president's comment about the
West and our ability to stand up

03:32.400 --> 03:34.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to this challenge.

03:34.500 --> 03:38.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think some people
are wondering how we in
the U.S. under President
Trump are defining

03:39.700 --> 03:41.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that West.

03:41.333 --> 03:43.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Well, how do
you respond to that,
Paula Dobriansky?

03:43.800 --> 03:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because it did raise, I think,
questions in people's minds
about what is this conflict

03:48.466 --> 03:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as the president sees it?

03:51.733 --> 03:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOBRIANSKY: Well, first, I
think that Karen was right,
the president did highlight the

03:58.733 --> 04:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
importance over decades of the
Polish relationship with the
United States and even cited the

04:04.566 --> 04:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
roles of such generals,
Kosciuszko and Pilsudski.

04:08.333 --> 04:11.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, our relationship
has mattered greatly.

04:11.466 --> 04:15.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I saw it in a broader
context, though, than
Karen had expressed.

04:15.433 --> 04:17.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I saw it as a bond.

04:17.500 --> 04:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on the other issue,
I saw and looked at the
words that he enunciated.

04:24.033 --> 04:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He really spoke a great deal
to freedom, to liberty, to
captive nations, he referred to

04:29.166 --> 04:31.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in his remarks.

04:31.200 --> 04:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He did talk about the importance
of values and even towards the
end of the speech expressed

04:37.300 --> 04:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how it's not just only about
military might, but it is also
about the will -- the will

04:42.400 --> 04:46.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the people and,
towards that end, I did
not see that as a dark.

04:48.733 --> 04:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I saw that as underscoring
the kind of values that
we do hold very dearly.

04:54.500 --> 04:58.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: So, if he was
stressing the common
values, Karen Donfried,
how then do you read

05:01.166 --> 05:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what the president has said?

05:03.233 --> 05:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because we know it was on his
other trip to Europe where
he withheld a statement about

05:09.600 --> 05:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so-called Article 5, the mutual
commitment to defense among
the NATO countries, but this

05:14.200 --> 05:15.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
time he did.

05:15.133 --> 05:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, how do you square that?

05:17.200 --> 05:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONFRIED: So, on the one hand,
I don't think we would have
been so focused on the more

05:20.633 --> 05:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
traditional aspects of
the speech were it not
to the earlier trip
to Europe for a NATO

05:25.433 --> 05:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaders meeting where the
president did not affirm
U.S. support for Article 5.

05:30.333 --> 05:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's why it was significant.

05:32.266 --> 05:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in that transatlantic
context, it was also significant
that he didn't mention the

05:36.433 --> 05:41.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
European Union because
typically, the U.S. has
defined its relationship
with Europe both

05:43.400 --> 05:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through NATO, but also through
U.S. cooperation with this body
that emphasizes cooperation

05:48.600 --> 05:50.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
among Europeans.

05:50.566 --> 05:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second piece I would
mention is, I was struck by the
focus on values but I actually

05:57.000 --> 06:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
searched the speech for the
word democracy, and it didn't
appear and that was striking

06:00.833 --> 06:02.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to me.

06:02.900 --> 06:05.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And though he did talk about
the importance of rule of law
and freedom of press in the

06:05.566 --> 06:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speech, when you looked at the
press conference he gave with
President Duda, he was asked

06:12.933 --> 06:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the issue of the
press and said -- expressed
his concern about fake
news and the dishonest

06:17.866 --> 06:19.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
media.

06:19.966 --> 06:23.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, it was a bit of a
mixed message I thought
on those issues around
democratic principles.

06:23.566 --> 06:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Paula Dobriansky,
what about that?

06:25.566 --> 06:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, we know the president's
view toward the press in the
United States has certainly

06:32.333 --> 06:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been a subject of controversy
and a lot of discussion
and debate recently.

06:38.133 --> 06:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOBRIANSKY: Well, I think,
in the speech, which was his
primary platform, in my view,

06:47.166 --> 06:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not the press conference but the
primary platform where he had
an opportunity not just to speak

06:54.200 --> 06:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Poland but, as I mentioned,
to the region at large, and
also to set the foundation for

07:00.833 --> 07:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his meetings coming up in
Hamburg and particularly
with President Putin
where he did underscore

07:06.266 --> 07:09.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this importance, as
I said, of communism.

07:09.766 --> 07:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He talked about it, about the
freedoms that were deprived,
the kind of oppression that

07:14.666 --> 07:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this region was under and how,
in terms of the present time,
this is a different period.

07:22.233 --> 07:26.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is a period where
we do have to reaffirm
these kinds of values.

07:26.766 --> 07:31.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I saw it in a
broader strategic sense
of setting a foundation
that has applicability

07:33.700 --> 07:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a number of the issues
that we've just mentioned,
not just Poland, the region at

07:37.833 --> 07:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
large, but also for Russia.

07:40.300 --> 07:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Karen Donfried,
just about 30 seconds here.

07:43.133 --> 07:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But how does all this play
into expectation for tomorrow's
meeting between President Trump

07:48.866 --> 07:50.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and President Putin?

07:50.966 --> 07:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONFRIED: So, it becomes much
more complicated for President
Trump when he gets -- well,

07:53.000 --> 07:55.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he is now in
Germany for the G20.

07:55.100 --> 08:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Germany context is more
complicated, because you have a
German chancellor who's facing

08:01.233 --> 08:03.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reelection campaign
in September.

08:03.133 --> 08:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has a public that
is not supportive of
President Trump's policies.

08:06.633 --> 08:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She very much values the
relationship with the U.S., so
she wants to try to reach an

08:10.833 --> 08:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agreement with President Trump
while also staying true to her
principle stands on climate

08:16.500 --> 08:17.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and trade.

08:17.766 --> 08:19.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it will become
very challenging.

08:19.900 --> 08:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The meeting with President Putin
will be something everyone will
be watching and it sounds, based

08:24.500 --> 08:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on his comments to the press
conference today, that he won't
be raising the issue of Russian

08:28.200 --> 08:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meddling in U.S. elections.

08:29.566 --> 08:31.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOODRUFF: Yes.

08:31.566 --> 08:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He certainly -- he said,
yes, it may have happened
but it may not have.

08:36.766 --> 08:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He said nobody knows for
sure who was behind it.

08:38.733 --> 08:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONFRIED: Which was
also a rebuke of U.S.
intelligence, I would say.

08:41.733 --> 08:45.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Karen Donfried, Paula
Dobriansky, we thank you both.

08:45.166 --> 08:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONFRIED: Thank you so much.
