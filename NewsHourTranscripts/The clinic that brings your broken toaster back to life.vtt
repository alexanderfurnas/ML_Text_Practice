JUDY WOODRUFF: And now
to a "NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught
our eye that might be

00:04.333 --> 00:06.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you.

00:06.466 --> 00:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a growing movement to
fix items, instead of throwing
them out and buying new ones.

00:10.900 --> 00:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At MIT, a graduate started
Fixit Clinics eight years ago,
and now they're held all across

00:17.733 --> 00:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the country to teach people
how to do repairs themselves.

00:20.633 --> 00:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From PBS station WGBH in
Boston, Tina Martin reports.

00:25.100 --> 00:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: A toaster, a
tripod and a kettle, all
broken and in need of some TLC.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're in the right place.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER MUI, MIT Grad: This
is Fixit Clinic number 207.

00:35.333 --> 00:38.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have had a bunch of
Fixit Clinics all across
the United States.

00:38.500 --> 00:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: MIT grad Peter
Mui started the clinics in 2009
to help people learn to help

00:44.833 --> 00:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
themselves and the
environment in the process.

00:46.500 --> 00:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER MUI: And 52 tons of
e-waste diverted from landfill.

00:50.900 --> 00:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, not even just diverted, not
upcycled or not recycled, but
actually returned to service

00:57.433 --> 00:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for their originally
intended use.

00:59.566 --> 01:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a sense that they
don't have a choice when
it goes -- when it breaks.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is no repair people
left anymore to do this stuff.

01:04.700 --> 01:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: The clinics are
free and held three to four
times a month at libraries and

01:08.900 --> 01:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
community centers
across the country.

01:11.166 --> 01:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Peter Mui and his team of
volunteer coaches train people
like Abby Fox (ph), whose kettle

01:16.900 --> 01:18.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is out of commission.

01:18.433 --> 01:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Under normal conditions,
you go like this, it goes click.

01:20.933 --> 01:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it also turns blue and
then it should boil the water.

01:23.533 --> 01:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: She and I put on
goggles to learn about how to
get it back up and running.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Part of getting the kettle
back together is pulling it
apart and testing electricity.

01:32.733 --> 01:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER MUI: But you understand
that anything we do here
could make it worse.

01:36.033 --> 01:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: That warning aside,
the process is time-consuming,
and there's a chance nothing

01:40.233 --> 01:42.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can be done.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Fixit team prides
itself in resurrecting
even the toughest
electronics, like Jeannie

01:47.733 --> 01:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fink's (ph) classic radio,
which belonged to her father.

01:49.733 --> 01:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: His initials are
actually still on the back
of the part that we took off.

01:57.633 --> 02:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he has since passed away,
but it had been sitting on a
shelf in my home for the longest

02:01.433 --> 02:02.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

02:02.933 --> 02:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: The bell sounds,
and the music is playing again.

02:09.400 --> 02:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took about an hour
for Jeannie and her Fixit
coach to make it happen.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: So you think you
can fix something in your
house by yourself now?

02:15.666 --> 02:17.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:17.300 --> 02:19.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: I think I'm more
confident to at least
try to troubleshoot.

02:19.533 --> 02:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Abby Fox's
kettle was a different story.

02:22.500 --> 02:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The repair took all day, but,
in the end, it was another
Fixit Clinic success story.

02:28.933 --> 02:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Tina Martin in Boston.

02:32.266 --> 02:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I could
spend a couple of weeks there.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have got a lot of things
at home that need fixing.
