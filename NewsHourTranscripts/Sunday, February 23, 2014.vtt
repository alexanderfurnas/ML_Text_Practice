05:11.600 --> 05:13.633
BERNANKE SAYS IN THIS MEETING,

05:13.633 --> 05:14.833
MAYBE MONETARY POLICY, THE LEVEL

05:14.833 --> 05:16.433
OF INTEREST RATES, IS IN THE

05:16.433 --> 05:17.000
RIGHT PLACE.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.833
THEY HAD KEPT THEM AT 2%

05:18.833 --> 05:19.867
WITHIN A MATTER OF DAY

05:19.867 --> 05:21.267
EVERYTHING CHANGES

05:21.267 --> 05:22.200
THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS O

05:22.200 --> 05:25.367
BAILING OUT AIG.

36 HOURS LATER, BEN BERNANKE AND

05:27.733 --> 05:30.033
HANK PAULSON GO TO CONGRESS AN

05:30.033 --> 05:31.167
THEY SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS

HE'S MOVING TO SLASH INTERES

05:38.100 --> 05:38.600

05:38.600 --> 05:41.067
SO, YOU KNOW, BERNANKE -- THAT

05:41.067 --> 05:43.167
SEPTEMBER MEETING WAS REALLY A

05:43.167 --> 05:45.633
GREAT EXAMPLE OF HIM PLAYING

05:45.633 --> 05:46.867
CATCH-UP AND NOT IMMEDIATELY

05:46.867 --> 05:48.167
RECOGNIZING THE GRAVITY OF

05:48.167 --> 05:49.133
EVENTS THAT WERE IN FRONT OF

05:49.133 --> 05:49.400
HIM.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.600

WHAT WERE HIS POSITIONS AT THE

05:55.667 --> 05:55.967
TIME

05:55.967 --> 05:57.633
>> TIM GEITHNER'S A VERY

05:57.633 --> 05:58.533
INTERESTING CHARACTER HERE

05:58.533 --> 06:00.467
HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME IN THESE

MEETINGS SPARRING AND JOUSTING

06:02.667 --> 06:04.967
WITH THE FED'S POLICY HAWKS.

06:04.967 --> 06:06.733
OFFICIALS FROM REGIONAL FEDERA

06:06.733 --> 06:09.867
RESERVE BANKS WHO ARE MORE

06:09.867 --> 06:10.433
WORRIED ABOUT INFLATION THAN

06:10.433 --> 06:12.567
WITH THE FINANCIAL SYSTE

06:12.567 --> 06:12.800
STABILITY.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.733
AND GEITHNER SPENDS A LOT OF

06:14.733 --> 06:16.767
TIME JOUSTING WITH THEM.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.200
FRANKLY, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOM

06:18.200 --> 06:19.667
MOMENTS HERE WHERE HE LOOKS LIKE

06:19.667 --> 06:21.233
HE'S BEHIND THE CURVE.

06:21.233 --> 06:25.000
THERE'S A JANUARY 2008 MEETING

06:25.000 --> 06:26.500
WHERE GEITHNER GIVES HIS

06:26.500 --> 06:27.433
ASSESSMENT OF THE FINANCIA

06:27.433 --> 06:28.567
SYSTEM, AND HE SAYS IT LOOKS

06:28.567 --> 06:30.867
LIKE THE PROCESS OF HEALING HA

06:30.867 --> 06:31.633
ALREADY STARTED.

06:31.633 --> 06:33.200
HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG

06:33.200 --> 06:34.333
IN THAT CASE

06:34.333 --> 06:40.800
>> LET'S TALK ALSO ABOUT JANET

06:40.800 --> 06:42.000
YELLEN, FED CHAIRMAN NOW

06:42.000 --> 06:44.033
WHAT WAS HER BEHAVIOR THEN, WHAT

06:44.033 --> 06:45.000
CAN WE GLEAN FROM THAT

06:45.000 --> 06:46.067
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GO

06:46.067 --> 06:48.200
YELLEN THIS JOB WAS A SENSE SH

06:48.200 --> 06:50.133
HAD VERY GOOD JUDGMENT, THAT I

06:50.133 --> 06:52.333
2007 WHEN WE LOOKED AT EARLIER

06:52.333 --> 06:54.067

06:54.067 --> 06:55.533
FIRST PEOPLE TO SAY, HEY, WE

HAVE REAL PROBLEMS IN THIS

06:56.767 --> 06:58.867
HOUSING MARKET

06:58.867 --> 07:00.567
WE KNOW FROM THEIR DECISIO

07:00.567 --> 07:02.867
SINCE 2008 SHE'S PUSHED VERY

07:02.867 --> 07:06.433
HARD TO KEEP INTEREST RATES LOW.

07:06.433 --> 07:07.233
AND HASN'T BEEN TOO WORRIE

07:07.233 --> 07:10.133
ABOUT INFLATION.

07:10.133 --> 07:12.167
THESE 2008 TRANSCRIPTS I THINK

07:12.167 --> 07:14.533
CONFIRM THIS SENSE THAT THE LADY

07:14.533 --> 07:15.567
HAS PRETTY GOOD JUDGMENT

07:15.567 --> 07:16.933
SHE WAS USUALLY ONE OF THE

07:16.933 --> 07:18.300
PEOPLE IN THE ROOM SAYING THAT

07:18.300 --> 07:19.433
SHE WAS CONCERNED THAT THE

07:19.433 --> 07:20.900
FINANCIAL SYSTEM WAS IN GRAV

07:20.900 --> 07:21.433
DANGER

FOR THIS REVIEW.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.133
BUILT ON SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED

LAST YEAR.

18:39.633 --> 18:42.133
THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE HA

18:42.133 --> 18:43.767
COMPLETED A FOUR-YEAR REVIEW O

18:43.767 --> 18:45.367
JUST HOW PREVALENT THE PROBLEM

18:45.367 --> 18:45.633
WAS.

18:45.633 --> 18:47.367
AND THEY FOUND THAT THE NUMBER

18:47.367 --> 18:49.700
OF FOLKS WHO WERE ILL WERE

18:49.700 --> 18:56.167
REALLY KIND OF GETTING SO LARG

18:56.167 --> 18:56.700
THAT BOTH THE PENTAGON AND V

18:56.700 --> 18:57.200
WERE HAVING TROUBLE STAYIN

18:57.200 --> 18:57.967
AHEAD OF IT.

REPORT

18:59.967 --> 19:00.833
WE'VE GOT PREVENTION PROGRAM

19:00.833 --> 19:02.833
OUT THERE, WHY AREN'T THEY

19:02.833 --> 19:03.567
WORKING?

19:03.567 --> 19:05.200
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS PANEL AT

19:05.200 --> 19:07.000
INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE FOUND WA

19:07.000 --> 19:08.600
THAT WHILE SOME OF THESE IDEAS

19:08.600 --> 19:10.533
IN THEORY MADE A LOT OF SENSE,

19:10.533 --> 19:11.467
WHEN THEY WERE INTRODUCE

19:11.467 --> 19:14.500
EARLIER IN THE WAR, THAT THERE

19:14.500 --> 19:15.567
REALLY HADN'T BEEN A STRON

19:15.567 --> 19:16.533
EFFORT BY THE PENTAGON AND SOM

19:16.533 --> 19:19.067
OF THE BRANCHES TO TRY T

19:19.067 --> 19:20.733
UNDERSTAND WHETHER TO DO SOM

19:20.733 --> 19:23.133
REAL STRONG SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH,

19:23.133 --> 19:24.867
WHETHER THE PROGRAMS WORKED.

19:24.867 --> 19:25.933
THEY FOUND THAT IN FACT THEY

19:25.933 --> 19:26.333
HADN'T

19:26.333 --> 19:28.333
>> WHICH IDEAS WERE THEY

19:28.333 --> 19:29.467
FOCUSING ON IN THEIR REPORT?

19:29.467 --> 19:31.967
>> THEY LOOKED AT KIND OF --

19:31.967 --> 19:35.767
THEY BUILT ON A RAND STUDY THA

19:35.767 --> 19:37.567
IDENTIFIED ABOUT 94 OF THESE

19:37.567 --> 19:39.333
PROGRAMS OUT THERE, AND THEY -

19:39.333 --> 19:40.967
FROM THAT THEY KIND OF FOCUSED

19:40.967 --> 19:43.167
ON SOME OF THE KEY ONES.

19:43.167 --> 19:45.333
AND I THINK AT THE TOP OF TH

19:45.333 --> 19:46.667
LIST WAS REALLY KIND OF TH

19:46.667 --> 19:48.167
GRANDDADDY OF ALL THE PROGRAMS

19:48.167 --> 19:50.000
THAT'S AN ARMY ONE CALLE

19:50.000 --> 19:50.967
COMPREHENSIVE SOLDIER FITNESS.

19:50.967 --> 19:52.967
IT'S NOW CALLED COMPREHENSIV

19:52.967 --> 19:54.300
SOLDIER AND FAMILY FITNESS

19:54.300 --> 19:56.033
IT COSTS QUITE A LOT OF MONEY.

19:56.033 --> 19:57.867
IT REACHES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

19:57.867 --> 19:58.767
OF SOLDIERS.

19:58.767 --> 20:00.100
AND THEY FOUND THAT THEY DIDN'

20:00.100 --> 20:01.600
THINK IT REALLY WORKED

20:01.600 --> 20:03.267
>> AND SO WHAT'S THE ARMY'

20:03.267 --> 20:04.833
RESPONSE TO THIS WHEN THEY SAY

20:04.833 --> 20:05.967
THAT THIS ISN'T WORKING?

20:05.967 --> 20:08.000
IF IT'S BEEN USED ON A MILLION

20:08.000 --> 20:09.133
DIFFERENT SOLDIERS NOW

20:09.133 --> 20:11.967
>> WELL, THEY'RE VERY DEFENSIV

20:11.967 --> 20:12.867
ABOUT IT

20:12.867 --> 20:14.833
THEY IN FACT THINK THAT IT DOE

20:14.833 --> 20:15.333
WORK

20:15.333 --> 20:17.233
THEY SAY THEIR INTERNAL SCORIN

20:17.233 --> 20:19.967
SHOWS THAT IT IMPROVES POSITIV

20:19.967 --> 20:21.400
THINKING, IT KIND OF HELPS

20:21.400 --> 20:23.433
SOLDIERS LEARN TO THRIVE, HELP

20:23.433 --> 20:25.867
THEM DEAL WITH ADVERSITY

20:25.867 --> 20:27.633
THEY DO ADMIT, THE ARMY DOES

20:27.633 --> 20:30.500
WHEN THEY CREATED THE PROGRAM IN

20:30.500 --> 20:32.933
2009, AS THE NUMBERS OF PTSD AND

20:32.933 --> 20:34.067
SUICIDE WERE BEGINNING TO RISE

20:34.067 --> 20:35.500
THEY WERE TRYING TO DEAL WIT

20:35.500 --> 20:36.633
PREVENTION AT THAT POINT

20:36.633 --> 20:37.900
AND THEY MODIFIED THE PROGRA

20:37.900 --> 20:38.667
SINCE THEN

20:38.667 --> 20:40.433
IT REALLY ISN'T SO MUCH

20:40.433 --> 20:42.600
PREVENTION PROGRAM, THEY SAY

20:42.600 --> 20:43.733
NOW THEY SAY IT'S MORE T

20:43.733 --> 20:46.067
IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF SOLDIERS'

20:46.067 --> 20:46.967
LIVES, HELP THEM DEAL WITH

20:46.967 --> 20:47.400
ADVERSITY.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.033
>> SO WHAT IS WORKING?

20:49.033 --> 20:50.333
HAVE SUICIDES GONE DOWN?

20:50.333 --> 20:51.067
>> NO.

20:51.067 --> 20:52.200
WELL, ACTUALLY IN THIS LAST YEAR

20:52.200 --> 20:53.133
THERE WAS A REDUCTION FOR TH

20:53.133 --> 20:55.367
FIRST TIME AMONG ACTIVE-DUTY

20:55.367 --> 20:55.633
TROOPS

20:55.633 --> 20:59.633
THOSE WHO ARE NOT GUARD,

20:59.633 --> 21:01.100
RESERVE, ON INACTIVE STATUS.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.233
THEY FOUND THE NUMBERS HAD

21:02.233 --> 21:04.067
DROPPED FOR THE FIRST TIME I

21:04.067 --> 21:05.633
ALMOST TEN YEARS

21:05.633 --> 21:08.133
BY ABOUT 20% WIND THE ARMY

21:08.133 --> 21:09.300
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THEY WERE

21:09.300 --> 21:11.000
VERY HAPPY ABOUT

21:11.000 --> 21:13.167
BUT IT WAS A MODEST DECLINE.

21:13.167 --> 21:14.633
IT ISN'T CLEAR WHETHER THEY'VE

21:14.633 --> 21:15.533
ACTUALLY TURNED THE CORNER

21:15.533 --> 21:16.867
THE ARMY WILL SAY THAT

21:16.867 --> 21:17.167
THEMSELVES

21:17.167 --> 21:18.767
THEY STILL HAVE LARGE NUMBERS AS

21:18.767 --> 21:20.567

21:23.733 --> 21:25.433
SHOW PROMISE

21:25.433 --> 21:26.833
THERE WAS ONE SMALL PROGRAM TH

21:26.833 --> 21:28.300

21:33.433 --> 21:35.567
WHAT THEY GO THROUGH IN COMBAT

21:35.567 --> 21:37.133

21:37.133 --> 21:38.567
TO NORMALIZE THOSE FEELINGS.
