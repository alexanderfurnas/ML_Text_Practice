JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.906 --> 00:07.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.808 --> 00:14.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
Trump administration
takes on the government of
Syria, ordering

00:14.348 --> 00:18.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
airstrikes in retaliation for
chemical weapons
attacks.

00:18.385 --> 00:20.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We look at the decision and what
could come
next.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.856 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Then:

00:22.890 --> 00:27.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
We have made tremendous progress
in our relationship

00:27.628 --> 00:29.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with China.

00:29.463 --> 00:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
touts deepening
relations with China after his
first summit

00:33.567 --> 00:36.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the leader of the world's
other economic
powerhouse.

00:36.970 --> 00:43.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: With Passover just around
the corner,
we join celebrated chef Joan
Nathan in her

00:43.143 --> 00:48.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kitchen to talk about her new
cookbook exploring
Jewish food from around the
world.

00:48.315 --> 00:53.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAN NATHAN, Chef: You can't mix
milk and
meat, you can't eat certain
shellfish, so

00:53.587 --> 00:57.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that what happens is, Jewish
people think
about their food a lot.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

00:59.259 --> 01:03.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
take on this
week's news, including what a
rule change

01:04.031 --> 01:08.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Senate means for the
ability of the
two parties to work together.

01:09.002 --> 01:15.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:15.742 --> 01:18.478 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:18.512 --> 01:28.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House
says President
Trump has sent a strong signal
to the world

01:28.155 --> 01:31.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with last night's cruise missile
strike on
Syria.

01:31.124 --> 01:36.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attack drew widespread
support today from
American allies, and
condemnation from the

01:36.530 --> 01:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Syrians and their allies.

01:39.666 --> 01:46.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A flash of light and the roar of
jet engines
lit up the predawn in the
eastern Mediterranean.

01:46.807 --> 01:54.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two U.S. Navy destroyers fired
off 59 Tomahawk
cruise missiles.

01:54.147 --> 02:00.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amateur video broadcast on
Syrian state TV
appeared to show the missiles
striking home,

02:00.621 --> 02:04.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the target, the Syrian
military's Shayrat
air base.

02:04.458 --> 02:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. officials say it was the
launching pad
for a chemical attack that
killed more than

02:09.296 --> 02:12.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
80 people in Idlib province.

02:12.332 --> 02:17.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saleh Hawa, an opposition
activist in Idlib,
spoke to us via Skype.

02:17.104 --> 02:19.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALEH HAWA, Syrian Opposition
Activist: There
is a kind of comfort among
people that, at

02:19.873 --> 02:21.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the end, after -- maybe after
seven years
of suffering and pain, at the
end, we have

02:21.541 --> 02:23.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
got a kind of ally.

02:23.777 --> 02:35.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have got a kind of protector,
you can say.

02:35.322 --> 02:40.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: News of the U.S.
missile strike
broke as President Trump was
meeting last

02:40.694 --> 02:43.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
night at his resort in Florida
with the president
of China.

02:43.964 --> 02:49.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
It is in this vital national
security interest

02:49.803 --> 02:57.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the United States to prevent
and deter
the spread and use of deadly
chemical weapons.

02:57.577 --> 03:03.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Both Russia and
Syria claim
rebel groups were responsible
for Tuesday's

03:03.116 --> 03:08.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
chemical attack, and the
Russians quickly
condemned the U.S. missile
strike.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
spoke in Uzbekistan.

03:11.258 --> 03:14.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign
Minister (through
translator): Of course this is
an act of aggression,

03:14.661 --> 03:17.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
committed on an absolutely
made-up pretext.

03:17.064 --> 03:21.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope these provocations will
not lead to
some kind of irreversible
consequences.

03:21.068 --> 03:26.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Russian
Defense Ministry
announced that the U.S. attack
caused only

03:26.173 --> 03:32.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minimal damage to the Syrian air
base, and
that most of the cruise missiles
fell short.

03:32.279 --> 03:38.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Indeed, opposition activists
reported seeing
Syrian jets take off from the
base today,

03:38.752 --> 03:40.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
heading for rebel-held areas.

03:40.787 --> 03:47.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But White House Press Secretary
Sean Spicer
said all 59 missiles hit their
targets, from

03:47.427 --> 03:49.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fighter jets to radar sites.

03:49.996 --> 03:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Western allies backed
the U.S.
move.

03:53.200 --> 03:59.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In a statement, NATO
Secretary-General Jens
Stoltenberg said: "The Syrian
regime bears

03:59.106 --> 04:02.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the full responsibility for this
development."

04:02.309 --> 04:07.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
German Chancellor Angela Merkel
also defended
the U.S. action, but urged
caution.

04:07.814 --> 04:12.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through
translator): The attack of the
United States

04:12.586 --> 04:15.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is understandable, given the
dimension of
the war crimes.

04:15.956 --> 04:22.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the same time, and I
underline, more and
more, it remains important and
right to focus

04:22.496 --> 04:25.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all the attention on political
talks.

04:25.198 --> 04:30.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Turkey's
President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan said the missile strike
was fully

04:30.937 --> 04:33.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
warranted, but may not be
enough.

04:33.974 --> 04:38.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Syrian rebel groups also
called for even
stronger action against the
Assad regime.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Again, Saleh Hawa:

04:39.446 --> 04:41.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SALEH HAWA: Right now, things
are different.

04:41.381 --> 04:47.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, from now on, Russian
and Bashar al-Assad
and Iran and all those, you
know, naughty

04:47.053 --> 05:00.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries around the world will
understand
that, look, this is America.

05:00.567 --> 05:01.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
America today is different from
before.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
America is now ready to act.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The strike was in
stark contrast
to President Obama's policy.

05:04.871 --> 05:09.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had warned of a red line
against the use
of chemical weapons, but backed
away from

05:09.876 --> 05:16.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military action after a chemical
attack in
August 2013 killed more than
1,000 Syrians.

05:16.983 --> 05:24.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the campaign, Mr. Trump
also advocated
against military intervention in
Syria.

05:24.391 --> 05:31.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, he said the chemical
attack changed
his view of the Syrian war and
of Assad.

05:31.731 --> 05:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump had nothing to further
add today,
but at a U.N. Security Council
meeting, U.S.

05:38.004 --> 05:41.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ambassador Nikki Haley didn't
rule out further
action.

05:41.408 --> 05:44.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIKKI HALEY, U.S. Ambassador to
the United
Nations: The United States took
a very measured

05:44.578 --> 05:46.613 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
step last night.

05:46.646 --> 05:51.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are prepared to do more, but
we hope that
will not be necessary.

05:51.518 --> 05:57.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the diplomatic
front, the
issue is likely to top the
agenda, as Secretary

05:57.123 --> 06:01.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of State Rex Tillerson visits
Moscow next
Wednesday.

06:01.828 --> 06:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Congress, Democrats urged the
president
to seek congressional approval
for future

06:06.600 --> 06:09.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
moves, while Republicans
generally applauded
his action.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.504 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona: This
was a response
that was required in response to
the commission

06:14.908 --> 06:16.076 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of war crimes.

06:16.109 --> 06:19.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to emphasize, this is the
beginning,
not the end.

06:19.412 --> 06:21.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the signal that was sent
around the world
is very important.

06:21.748 --> 06:23.583 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:23.617 --> 06:28.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EDWARD MARKEY (D),
Massachusetts: The president
has made a 180-degree pivot in
one week on

06:28.722 --> 06:33.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the United States' role
should be in
Syria.

06:33.426 --> 06:38.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that, as a result,
the United
States Congress should be fully
involved.

06:38.298 --> 06:42.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will get a
deeper assessment
of the U.S. strike, and its
implications,

06:42.802 --> 06:44.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right after the news summary.

06:44.738 --> 06:48.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
long fight to
fill the vacancy on the U.S.
Supreme Court

06:48.942 --> 06:50.677 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is over.

06:50.710 --> 06:54.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Senate today confirmed
President
Trump's nominee, Neil Gorsuch,
by a vote of

06:54.881 --> 06:56.783 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
54-45.

06:56.816 --> 07:00.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will fill the seat of the
late Justice
Antonin Scalia.

07:00.387 --> 07:02.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has our report.

07:02.355 --> 07:07.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
The nomination of Neil M.
Gorsuch of Colorado

07:07.460 --> 07:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be an associate justice of
the Supreme
Court of the United States is
confirmed.

07:14.134 --> 07:19.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The final vote
was almost
anticlimactic, after Republicans
triggering

07:19.472 --> 07:22.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the so-called nuclear option on
Thursday.

07:22.609 --> 07:28.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That change in Senate procedure
meant a simple
majority could break the
Democratic filibuster

07:28.148 --> 07:29.649 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against Gorsuch.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell:

07:31.117 --> 07:32.886 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:32.919 --> 07:33.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: Of
course, I wish that important
aspects of this

07:33.753 --> 07:35.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
process had played out
differently.

07:35.689 --> 07:39.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It didn't have to be this way.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But today is a new day.

07:41.094 --> 07:45.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In the end,
three Democrats,
Joe Manchin, Heidi Heitkamp, and
Joe Donnelly,

07:45.365 --> 07:47.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
joined Republicans in supporting
Gorsuch.

07:47.867 --> 07:51.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But most Democrats, like Dick
Durbin, lamented
how it came to be.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:53.239 --> 07:55.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL), Minority
Whip: When
the rule was changed, some
senators were engaged

07:55.909 --> 07:59.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in high-fives on the other side
of aisle.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm not sure why.

08:01.214 --> 08:04.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think it was a time for
any winning
celebration.

08:04.651 --> 08:09.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it was an unfortunate
moment, and
the question is, where will we
go from here?

08:09.589 --> 08:12.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Not all
Republicans were
celebrating the rule revision.

08:12.726 --> 08:13.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Arizona's John McCain:

08:13.727 --> 08:15.462 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:15.495 --> 08:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN: I am very concerned
about the
future, which will then, with
only 51-vote

08:21.301 --> 08:29.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
majority required, will lead to
polarization
of the nominees as far as their
philosophies

08:29.943 --> 08:31.811 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are concerned.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Minority
Leader Chuck
Schumer promised to protect the
60-vote threshold

08:35.482 --> 08:37.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for ending filibusters on
legislation.

SEN.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: I hope
the Republican leader and I can,
in the coming

08:41.154 --> 08:46.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months, find a way to build a
firewall around
the legislative filibuster,
which is the most

08:46.926 --> 08:49.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important distinction between
the Senate and
the House.

08:49.896 --> 08:52.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: On that at
least, Schumer
and McConnell agreed.

08:52.632 --> 08:54.434 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:54.467 --> 08:57.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL: This notion
that this somehow
bleeds over into the legislative
filibuster

08:57.036 --> 08:58.004 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is untrue.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm opposed to it.

08:59.806 --> 09:03.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As for Judge
Gorsuch, his
swearing-in as the 101st
associate justice

09:03.309 --> 09:06.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the U.S. Supreme Court is set
for Monday.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

09:08.982 --> 09:14.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
wound up his
Florida summit with Chinese
President Xi Jinping

09:14.654 --> 09:16.423 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

09:16.456 --> 09:20.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both men spoke highly of their
first-ever
meeting, despite tensions over
trade and North

09:20.894 --> 09:22.228 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

09:22.262 --> 09:25.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chinese reports said Mr. Trump
will visit
China later this year.

09:25.565 --> 09:29.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will have the full story
later in the program.

09:29.169 --> 09:34.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Sweden, at least four people
were killed
today when a hijacked beer truck
crashed into

09:34.240 --> 09:36.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a department store in Stockholm.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Fifteen others were hurt.

09:38.478 --> 09:43.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Witnesses said the truck plowed
into a crowd
of people before smashing into
the store.

09:43.249 --> 09:46.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Swedish prime minister
called it an act
of terror.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was the latest such incident
across Europe.

09:48.988 --> 09:51.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police said they are looking for
the truck
driver.

09:51.758 --> 09:57.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 50,000 people marched
in cities
across South Africa today to
protest government

09:57.697 --> 09:59.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
corruption.

09:59.599 --> 10:04.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They carried signs and shouted
slogans demanding
the removal of President Jacob
Zuma, after

10:04.437 --> 10:08.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
he fired the country's
anti-corruption finance
minister.

10:08.274 --> 10:15.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I am marching because I
have a 4-year-old
daughter, and I feel if I don't
do something

10:15.048 --> 10:17.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the future of the country,
nobody is
going to anything.

10:17.750 --> 10:22.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I'm here to fight, to
show my support
for this country, for the beauty
and the future

10:22.789 --> 10:28.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that this country has, instead
of the uprising
of one greedy, corrupt man.

10:28.862 --> 10:35.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The ailing Nobel
peace laureate
Desmond Tutu, now 85, also made
a rare public

10:35.768 --> 10:38.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
appearance in support of the
demonstrations.

10:38.271 --> 10:43.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His foundation tweeted on his
behalf, "We
will pray for the downfall of a
government

10:43.576 --> 10:45.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that misrepresents us."

10:45.778 --> 10:50.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, a federal
judge approved
the agreement between Baltimore
and the U.S.

10:50.049 --> 10:53.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Department of Justice on
reforming that city's
police department.

10:53.586 --> 10:58.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The judge said -- quote -- "It
is in the public
interest to approve it," despite
the Justice

10:58.124 --> 11:00.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Department request for a delay.

11:00.260 --> 11:05.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Attorney General Jeff Sessions
said he still
has grave concerns about the
agreement, and

11:05.632 --> 11:08.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it may hinder the fight
against crime.

11:08.568 --> 11:12.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The long-running drought in
California is
finally over.

11:12.038 --> 11:17.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor Jerry Brown today
lifted emergency
conservation for nearly all of
the state.

11:17.610 --> 11:22.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He acted after a series of major
winter storms
brought heavy snow and rain.

11:23.016 --> 11:28.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. job growth dropped sharply
in March,
to its worst showing in nearly a
year.

11:28.421 --> 11:31.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Labor Department reported
that today in
its monthly summary.

11:32.025 --> 11:38.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It said U.S. employers added a
net of 98,000
jobs, despite the fact that
economists expected

11:38.464 --> 11:40.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nearly twice that many.

11:40.300 --> 11:46.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The unemployment rate fell to
4.5 percent,
which is the lowest in almost a
decade.

11:46.606 --> 11:51.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That jobs report, and the
tensions over Syria,
dampened the mood on Wall
Street.

11:51.244 --> 11:55.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost about
seven points to close at 20656.

11:55.648 --> 12:01.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell one point, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped two.

12:01.287 --> 12:05.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, all three indexes
were down
a fraction of 1 percent.

12:05.425 --> 12:11.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the road
ahead following the U.S. strikes
on Syria;

12:11.664 --> 12:17.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump and Xi lay the
groundwork
for future negotiations; Mark
Shields and

12:17.136 --> 12:27.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Brooks weigh in on Syria;
the Supreme
Court battle; and much more.

12:27.180 --> 12:33.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Brooks weigh in on Syria;
the Supreme
Court battle; and much more.

12:33.052 --> 12:37.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We return now to our top story,
the U.S. attack
on a Syrian airfield.

12:37.090 --> 12:42.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late today, administration
officials said
they'd seek new sanctions
against the regime

12:42.695 --> 12:44.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Bashar al-Assad.

12:44.697 --> 12:49.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the airstrikes and
their effects,
I'm joined by retired General
John Allen.

12:49.702 --> 12:57.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was the top commander in
Afghanistan from
2011 to 2013, and, in 2014, he
became the

12:57.043 --> 13:02.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
special presidential envoy for
the Global
Coalition Against ISIS.

13:02.048 --> 13:07.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Sarah Sewall served as
undersecretary of state
for civilian security, democracy
and human

13:07.820 --> 13:10.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rights during the Obama
administration.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's now at Johns Hopkins
University.

13:12.892 --> 13:18.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Retired Army Colonel Andrew
Bacevich,
professor emeritus of
international relations

13:18.297 --> 13:21.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and history at Boston
University.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all three of you
to the program.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
General Allen, I'm going to
start with you.

13:25.204 --> 13:27.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Was this a smart move by
President Trump,
his administration?

13:27.940 --> 13:29.676 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

13:29.709 --> 13:30.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN ALLEN (RET.), Former
International Coalition
Coordinator: Judy, I think it
was.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it was warranted.

13:33.446 --> 13:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The crime of attacking innocent
civilians
with a nerve agent puts the
Assad regime in

13:41.020 --> 13:44.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a position where this kind of an
action is
absolutely justified.

13:44.457 --> 13:49.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been calling for this
kind of an action
for a long time, and I believe
it was justified.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it wasn't just a message to
Bashar al-Assad.

13:52.865 --> 13:58.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a message to his Russian
patrons that
the United States is just not
going to tolerate

13:58.404 --> 14:01.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this kind of action from him any
longer.

14:01.207 --> 14:03.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Colonel Bacevich,
your view?

14:03.276 --> 14:04.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Was this the right thing?

14:04.243 --> 14:05.645 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW J. BACEVICH (RET.),
Boston University:
Well, what is the thing?

14:06.846 --> 14:08.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is the action?

14:08.681 --> 14:13.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If indeed, as some people
suggest, this is
a one-off event, then my guess
is, a week

14:13.553 --> 14:17.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from now, we won't even be
talking abut it,
and it will quickly be
forgotten.

14:17.623 --> 14:24.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If, as some people suggest, this
shows a more
assertive Trump administration,
that somehow

14:24.297 --> 14:31.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're going to ratchet up the
pressure on
the Assad regime, trying to
produce regime

14:31.037 --> 14:36.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change, then I would be very
much interested
in hearing more about how that
is going to

14:36.676 --> 14:44.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
occur and, beyond that, if and
when it occurs,
if Assad is forced out, then
what?

14:44.317 --> 14:49.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do we think the United
States will inherit,
and what will the United States
do with that

14:50.022 --> 14:51.824 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inheritance?

14:51.858 --> 14:57.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Recalling the situation after
regime change
in Iraq and Libya, you know,
those seem to

14:57.597 --> 14:59.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be the reasonable questions.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sarah Sewall, how
do you gauge
what happened?

15:01.801 --> 15:04.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH SEWALL, Former State
Department Official:
Well, it's very difficult to
know right now,

15:04.303 --> 15:06.038 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Judy.

15:06.072 --> 15:09.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't know whether this will
fall into
the category of a symbolic,
pinprick strike

15:09.742 --> 15:14.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that had no marginal -- had no
meaningful
effect, or whether this could be
the beginning

15:14.647 --> 15:19.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of something that gets us much
more deeply
embroiled, whether it's similar
to the no-fly

15:19.385 --> 15:26.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
zones that we created in
Southern and Northern
Iraq after the first Desert
Storm war, or

15:26.926 --> 15:31.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether it's like the Kosovo
campaign that
was designed to produce a
negotiated solution

15:31.631 --> 15:35.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we thought would take days,
and instead
took weeks, or whether it could
be like the

15:35.935 --> 15:39.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Libya intervention, where we
were nominally
protecting citizens, but we
ended up creating

15:39.939 --> 15:43.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a much more difficult terrorist
threat throughout
the region.

15:43.309 --> 15:47.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, General
Allen, it is the
case that we don't know yet how
effective

15:47.713 --> 15:49.849 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this is, do we?

15:49.882 --> 15:50.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're waiting to find out.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.585 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN ALLEN: Well, I would say a
couple of
things, Judy, to the other
points that have

15:55.388 --> 15:57.023 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been made.

15:57.056 --> 16:00.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The administration is going to
have to give
us a sense of what their policy
is.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is obviously a change from
the previous
administration.

16:03.963 --> 16:09.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And military action without
political context
is often just ineffectual,
there's no purpose

16:09.869 --> 16:11.437 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for it.

16:11.470 --> 16:15.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's a dangerous road to get
on, as the
other commentators have
indicated.

16:15.308 --> 16:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it would be very helpful for
us to understand
what policy changes have created
this strategy

16:22.148 --> 16:24.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
within which military action
like this can
occur.

16:24.584 --> 16:30.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I think it's been an
important event,
because it's not just a very
important signal

16:30.189 --> 16:32.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Bashar al-Assad and to
President Putin.

16:32.758 --> 16:37.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are others around the
world who should
have taken very significant
attention or made

16:37.096 --> 16:43.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
significant points of paying
attention to
this strike, Kim Jong-un, for
example.

16:43.436 --> 16:48.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the president just
completed, by all accounts,
a successful summit with
President Xi Jinping

16:49.008 --> 16:53.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of China, and we don't -- we
find ourselves
in an environment where there's
a similar

16:53.279 --> 16:56.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relationship there, where there
is a patron
and there is a client.

16:56.816 --> 17:03.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know it has not escaped
the attention
of President Xi that the nuclear
saber-rattling

17:03.990 --> 17:08.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Kim Jong-un has attracted the
attention
of President Trump.

17:08.761 --> 17:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, having held Bashar
al-Assad accountable
for this, we need to pay
attention to Northeast

17:13.532 --> 17:16.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Asia about a more activist
United States in
this regard.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Colonel Bacevich,
what about
that?

17:18.537 --> 17:21.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, this does send a signal
to the rest
of the world that this president
is prepared

17:21.607 --> 17:22.575 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to act.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.443 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

17:24.477 --> 17:29.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW J. BACEVICH: Well, I
think it's important
to reflect on how this decision
came to be

17:29.081 --> 17:32.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made, at least how we understand
that it came
to be made.

17:32.118 --> 17:37.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A week ago, the president was
largely indifferent
to events in Syria.

17:37.890 --> 17:45.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It appears that, when he saw the
videotapes
of the aftermath of the Syrian
chemical weapons

17:45.765 --> 17:51.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack, he was outraged, and
then basically,
in about a 48-hour period, he
went from being

17:51.470 --> 17:55.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
indifferent to deciding we had
to attack Syria.

17:55.207 --> 18:02.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have to say that strikes
me as not so
much a change in policy, but
really a change

18:02.348 --> 18:03.649 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in impulses.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have an impulsive president.

18:05.818 --> 18:12.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We see little in our president
that suggests
that he acts after serious
reflection.

18:12.692 --> 18:19.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, yes, indeed, if somebody
like Kim
Jong-un in North Korea is
reflecting on the

18:19.765 --> 18:26.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
implications of the Syrian
attack, are the
implications one that would
cause Kim Jong-un

18:26.839 --> 18:33.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be more prudent, or does he
say, holy cow,
holy cow, we got a crazy guy on
the other

18:33.079 --> 18:34.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
end of this relationship?

18:34.880 --> 18:38.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sarah Sewall, how
much does
it matter whether there was a
thought-through

18:38.951 --> 18:40.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
policy that went into that?

18:40.386 --> 18:41.354 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

18:41.387 --> 18:43.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SARAH SEWALL: It matters
enormously.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It really does, Judy, because if
they don't
know what their endgame is, if
they don't

18:45.458 --> 18:48.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know what their goals are, then
they don't
know what their next steps are.

18:48.361 --> 18:51.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, let's look at the
situation from a
couple of different angles.

18:51.797 --> 18:56.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, if all we're doing
is a red
line on chemical weapons, that's
not immaterial,

18:56.402 --> 18:57.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but it's really not the point.

18:57.436 --> 18:59.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The point is that Assad is a
butcher.

18:59.438 --> 19:02.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the question becomes for
the civilians,
do I care if I'm being gassed or
I'm being

19:02.975 --> 19:03.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hit by barrel bombs?

19:03.976 --> 19:06.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The problem is still there.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Second, look at the Russian
issue.

19:07.913 --> 19:12.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we have got a much more
commingled battlefield
with higher risk of actual
escalation.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do we really want that?

19:14.286 --> 19:15.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that a smart move?

19:15.588 --> 19:18.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What happens if something does
escalate?

19:18.657 --> 19:22.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Third, look at the order of
battle on the
ground.

19:22.461 --> 19:26.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talk about whether or not you
can use force
to get a political settlement.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who are the biggest, most
powerful actors
among the rebels?

19:29.869 --> 19:31.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're al-Qaida and ISIS.

19:31.904 --> 19:38.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, even if we're willing to
commit to try
to use enough force to get a
negotiated settlement,

19:38.944 --> 19:43.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're actually at risk of
strengthening the
hand of the rebels that we have
nominally

19:43.916 --> 19:45.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vowed to fight in the war on
terror.

19:45.751 --> 19:48.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: General John
Allen, this sounds
-- what Sarah is saying sounds
like a lot

19:48.954 --> 19:55.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the arguments that we --
President Obama
perhaps used in the decision not
to go in

19:55.661 --> 19:58.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and attack after that chemical
incident in
2013.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.331 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN ALLEN: Well, Sarah is
right.

20:00.499 --> 20:02.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's good to see Sarah
again.

20:02.401 --> 20:05.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was terrific at State while
she was there.

20:05.905 --> 20:09.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, the environment was very
different in
2013.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we'd be in a very
different world
today if we had struck them.

20:12.278 --> 20:14.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Russians weren't on the
ground.

20:14.113 --> 20:19.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The moderate Syrian opposition
could have
made significant -- could have
had significant

20:19.685 --> 20:21.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
value out of that strike.

20:21.620 --> 20:27.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would have changed Bashar
al-Assad's calculus
with respect to what he could
do, and it would

20:27.993 --> 20:33.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have set, I think, the
conditions for a more
fruitful discussion about the
political transition

20:33.566 --> 20:35.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that would have removed him from
power.

20:35.668 --> 20:41.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Obama administration and
the Trump
administration, I believe, are
not intent,

20:41.240 --> 20:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ultimately, on regime collapse,
but simply
the removal of Bashar al-Assad
and remaining

20:46.879 --> 20:52.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and having much of that regime
remain intact,
which could, in fact, continue
to govern in

20:52.751 --> 20:54.553 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some manner.

20:54.587 --> 20:58.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we have got to be very
careful about
is looking for all the reasons
why the United

20:58.090 --> 20:59.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
States shouldn't act.

20:59.692 --> 21:00.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And there are plenty.

21:00.726 --> 21:02.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have heard them tonight.

21:02.361 --> 21:06.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at some point, the United
States, I believe,
has a moral obligation to act.

21:06.866 --> 21:13.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And selling short the decision
to make this
attack, I think, in some
respects, doesn't

21:13.639 --> 21:18.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take into account some very,
very serious
strategic minds that are at work
right now.

21:18.144 --> 21:22.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a secretary of defense,
we have a
chairman of the Joint Chiefs,
and we have

21:22.681 --> 21:28.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a national security adviser and
a secretary
of state who are very serious
thinkers and

21:28.454 --> 21:30.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
strategic leaders.

21:30.356 --> 21:34.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that they are
advising the president
about this strike, but I think
there's much

21:34.560 --> 21:39.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more behind this in the context
of a strategy
that emerges ultimately from a
policy.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well...

21:40.466 --> 21:42.201 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

21:42.234 --> 21:45.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN ALLEN: And I think we need
to take a
moment and look for that
articulation by the

21:45.171 --> 21:48.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House of what our policy
is going to
be and what that strategy will
be.

21:48.440 --> 21:54.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as we wait
for that, Andrew
Bacevich, what do you see as the
next step

21:54.413 --> 21:56.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here, whether this was the right
or the wrong
move?

21:56.515 --> 21:57.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What happens now?

21:57.850 --> 21:59.151 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

21:59.185 --> 22:05.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW J. BACEVICH: Well, I
think the point's
been well made.

22:05.157 --> 22:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have not heard anything that
remotely resembles
a strategy from this president
or from this

22:13.599 --> 22:15.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

22:15.467 --> 22:21.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We now have the president's
response to the
first crisis that he has faced.

22:21.073 --> 22:27.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the response is one to opt
for military
force, which, of course, has
become exceedingly

22:27.246 --> 22:30.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
routine in the way we approach
the world.

22:30.316 --> 22:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this conversation, I think,
reveals the
difficulty.

22:33.552 --> 22:38.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't know what is the
context in which
this decision was made.

22:38.857 --> 22:43.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we desperately need
to hear that
context, to hear some vision, to
get a sense

22:43.829 --> 22:45.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of strategy.

22:45.698 --> 22:49.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not particularly encouraged
by the fact
that three out of the four
people that General

22:49.635 --> 22:52.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Allen just ticked off are
generals.

22:53.005 --> 23:00.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It strikes me that that is
suggestive of a
mind-set that is likely to opt
for force as

23:00.212 --> 23:03.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the preferred response to almost
any situation.

23:03.282 --> 23:06.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sarah Sewall, I'm
going to
ask you to comment on that, if
you want to,

23:06.552 --> 23:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but also to share with us, what
do you think
happens next?

23:11.290 --> 23:16.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, do we just wait and see
whether Assad
attacks again with chemical
weapons?

23:16.629 --> 23:22.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that there was a report
today that
jets -- his jets took off and
attacked a rebel

23:22.801 --> 23:25.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
base in Homs today.

23:25.371 --> 23:30.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH SEWALL: Here's my concern,
Judy, that,
in the absence of a clear world
view and an

23:30.209 --> 23:36.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
articulated strategy, it's very
easy for individual
uses of force and for
high-minded rhetoric

23:36.749 --> 23:41.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to begin to just escalate within
its own echo
chamber.

23:41.320 --> 23:44.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think it's really hard
to predict
where we're going to go from
here.

23:45.024 --> 23:50.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not comforting to me that
this feels
reflexive and improvisational,
rather than

23:50.429 --> 23:52.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really thought out and
strategic.

23:52.197 --> 23:55.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since I don't know what the goal
is, I don't
know where we're likely to go
next.

23:55.634 --> 24:00.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In just a few
seconds, what
about Colonel Bacevich's point
that this is

24:00.072 --> 24:02.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mostly generals advising the
president, retired
generals?

24:02.708 --> 24:09.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH SEWALL: I do think that,
as a matter
of foreign policy, it is
essential that civilian

24:09.882 --> 24:13.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leadership and diplomats balance
the advice
from military officials.

24:13.585 --> 24:15.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in five
seconds, General
Allen, on that point?

24:15.721 --> 24:16.689 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

24:16.722 --> 24:17.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOHN ALLEN: Yes.

24:17.723 --> 24:18.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I got to -- I got something to
say on this.

24:18.724 --> 24:20.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Generals know an awful lot about
fighting.

24:20.492 --> 24:23.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also know a lot about the
consequences
of war.

24:23.562 --> 24:24.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I know these generals.

24:24.963 --> 24:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're going to give the
president their
best advice.

24:28.267 --> 24:31.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they understand American
power.

24:31.503 --> 24:35.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we chose to use military
force, it
wasn't because former generals
forced the

24:35.841 --> 24:37.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president into that option.

24:37.409 --> 24:42.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are great strategic
thinkers who understand
all about American power.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they fully understand the
consequences
of the use of military force.

24:45.017 --> 24:50.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I would be careful about
assuming, because
they are former generals, that
they immediately

24:50.089 --> 24:52.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
went to a reflex to use military
force.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're going to
have to leave
it there.

24:54.293 --> 24:59.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
General John Allen, Colonel
Andrew Bacevich,
Sarah Sewall, we thank you.

24:59.665 --> 25:00.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

25:00.799 --> 25:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN ALLEN: Thanks, Judy.

25:05.404 --> 25:06.505 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

25:06.538 --> 25:12.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDREW J. BACEVICH: Thank you.

25:12.177 --> 25:18.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: These American
strikes in Syria
came as President Trump, as we
have reported,

25:18.484 --> 25:23.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was hosting the president of
China for their
first summit -- the chief
issues, North Korea's

25:23.589 --> 25:29.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nuclear and missile programs and
trade between
the world's top two economies.

25:29.461 --> 25:31.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has a report.

25:31.296 --> 25:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
The relationship developed by
President Xi

25:34.433 --> 25:37.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and myself, I think, is
outstanding.

25:37.236 --> 25:41.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: After his first
encounter with
the man leading the nation he
once criticized

25:41.907 --> 25:45.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as a menace, President Trump was
full of praise.

25:45.544 --> 25:55.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: President Xi and
all of his
representatives have been really
interesting

25:55.621 --> 25:57.089 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be with.

25:57.122 --> 26:02.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we have made tremendous
progress in
our relationship with China.

26:02.561 --> 26:06.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: White House officials
said the
goal of the seaside summit was
to establish

26:06.832 --> 26:08.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a basis for future relations.

26:08.967 --> 26:13.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
XI JINPING, Chinese President
(through translator):
This bilateral meeting is a
thoughtful and

26:13.038 --> 26:14.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ingenious arrangement.

26:14.606 --> 26:17.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It is an important and
meaningful development
in the U.S.-China relationship.

26:17.810 --> 26:21.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe that, with the passage
of time,
we will make efforts to create
prosperity

26:21.814 --> 26:25.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for both countries and their
people and to
uphold global peace and
stability.

26:25.918 --> 26:31.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The plush setting of
Mr. Trump's
Mar-a-Lago resort didn't mask
the urgency

26:31.290 --> 26:36.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of their discussions, especially
the U.S.
hope that China will exert more
economic pressure

26:36.829 --> 26:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on North Korea to halt its
nuclear and missile
testing programs.

26:41.467 --> 26:45.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pyongyang test-fired yet another
missile this
week.

26:45.370 --> 26:52.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump told The Financial
Times: "If China
is not going to solve North
Korea, we will."

26:52.144 --> 26:56.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That message may have been
underscored by
the U.S. missile attack on Syria
that took

26:56.882 --> 26:58.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
place as the two leaders had
dinner.

26:58.984 --> 27:02.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAX BAUCUS (D), Former U.S.
Senator: I suspect,
frankly, that one of the reasons
the president

27:02.921 --> 27:08.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decided to strike Syria was to
try to put
President Xi and the Chinese a
little off-balance.

27:08.327 --> 27:13.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Former U.S. Envoy to
China Max
Baucus says the moment of truth
on North Korea

27:13.232 --> 27:14.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is drawing near.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAX BAUCUS: That's going to put
pressure on
Xi to try to find a solution
himself.

27:17.302 --> 27:22.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They haven't done a lot so far
because they'd
rather have stability on the
peninsula than

27:22.341 --> 27:25.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
try to get him to stop doing
what he's doing.

27:25.644 --> 27:30.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We, as Americans, I think have
no choice but
to try to find a solution with
China.

27:30.616 --> 27:32.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We cannot do this unilaterally.

27:32.351 --> 27:37.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trade is another
flash point between
the world's two largest
economies.

27:37.523 --> 27:44.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China accounted for almost 70
percent of last
year's $500 billion U.S. trade
deficit.

27:44.162 --> 27:50.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
During the campaign,
denunciations of China
were a constant refrain in Mr.
Trump's stump

27:50.102 --> 27:51.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
speeches.

27:51.236 --> 27:52.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Don't forget,
we're the piggy
bank.

27:52.971 --> 27:54.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have rebuilt China.

27:54.072 --> 27:55.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have taken so much money
out of our country.

27:56.008 --> 28:00.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We can't continue to allow China
to rape our
country.

28:00.746 --> 28:02.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's what they're doing.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Last week, the
president signed
a pair of executive orders aimed
at combating

28:05.751 --> 28:11.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreign trade abuses, but he has
yet to carry
out his campaign promise to
formally label

28:11.323 --> 28:13.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
China a currency manipulator.

28:13.458 --> 28:19.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a February interview with
Reuters, he said:
"I think they're grand champions
at manipulation

28:19.531 --> 28:20.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of currency.

28:20.599 --> 28:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So I haven't held back.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will see what happens."

28:25.003 --> 28:27.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats say the president's
all talk and
no action.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.474 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: One
of the few hopes we had with
President Trump

28:31.877 --> 28:39.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that he'd finally stand up to
China, but,
up to now, when it comes to
China, he looks

28:39.418 --> 28:40.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like a 98-pound weakling.

28:40.786 --> 28:43.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Former Ambassador
Baucus.

28:43.322 --> 28:47.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How tough can the United States
be on China
on trade?

28:47.326 --> 28:49.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAX BAUCUS: You have to stand up
to them.

28:49.127 --> 28:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my view is, we should stand
up to them
more than we have, precisely,
targeted, not

28:54.099 --> 28:59.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big blunderbuss, you know, a
huge, big tariff
and all that, but, rather,
selected industries

28:59.171 --> 29:00.939 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and sectors.

29:00.973 --> 29:04.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, Mr. Trump said
he's looking
forward to frequent meetings
with President

29:04.176 --> 29:05.978 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Xi.

29:06.011 --> 29:07.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We look forward to
being together
many times in the future, and I
believe lots

29:07.813 --> 29:13.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of very potentially bad problems
will be going
away.

29:13.318 --> 29:19.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: U.S. officials say
Mr. Trump has
accepted an invitation to visit
China in the

29:19.124 --> 29:20.092 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

29:20.125 --> 29:26.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

29:26.798 --> 29:36.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

29:36.775 --> 29:42.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
ahead of Passover,
an exploration of Jewish cooking
from around

29:42.080 --> 29:48.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world; and a Syrian-American
ponders what
separates her from today's
refugees.

29:48.520 --> 29:52.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, to the analysis of
Shields and
Brooks.

29:53.025 --> 29:57.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks, who

29:57.629 --> 29:59.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
joins us from New York.

29:59.965 --> 30:00.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome, gentlemen.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy.

30:02.668 --> 30:06.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mark, let's
start out by
talking about the attack
launched against

30:06.371 --> 30:07.339 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

30:07.372 --> 30:09.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Was this -- what do you make of
it?

30:09.207 --> 30:14.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, first of
all, the previous
discussion is well worth
listening to again

30:14.946 --> 30:16.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and again.

30:16.381 --> 30:20.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Each of them was -- made, I
thought, incredibly
perceptive points.

30:20.752 --> 30:25.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The thing that amazes me is the
president's
transformation is kind of, what
moves this

30:25.857 --> 30:27.626 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president?

30:27.659 --> 30:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This president, who had his
United Nations
ambassador, Nikki Haley, as
recently as last

30:35.000 --> 30:43.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week say that this was no longer
a priority,
removing -- we're living with
Bashar al-Assad

30:44.009 --> 30:50.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Syria, and to have the
secretary of state
say it's up to the people of
Syria.

30:50.849 --> 30:56.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Is that the five million
refugees to vote
absentee, to vote to remove him
from office?

30:56.955 --> 31:04.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But -- and he's unmoved, Judy --
he's been
unmoved by the unforgettable
image of Omran

31:04.796 --> 31:11.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Daqneesh, the little 5-year-old
boy who was
covered with dust and blood and
debris after

31:11.303 --> 31:15.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
an Aleppo bombing by the
Russians that killed
his 10-year-old brother.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Years of killing.

31:17.142 --> 31:23.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And unmoved by the
3-year-old
Alan Kurdi on the beach drowned
as a refugee.

31:23.315 --> 31:26.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he obviously was moved by
this, or appeared
to be.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It seemed to be an epiphany of
sorts.

31:28.987 --> 31:33.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think Colonel Bacevich
asked the penetrating
question.

31:33.658 --> 31:35.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that is, what's next?

31:35.927 --> 31:37.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is this just an impulse?

31:37.429 --> 31:40.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this just a reaction, an
altogether legitimate
reaction?

31:40.966 --> 31:44.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But is it part of a strategy?

31:44.503 --> 31:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because military action, absent
strategy,
we have seen it, we have paid
for it, the

31:49.541 --> 31:53.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world has paid for it, and human
beings have
paid the ultimate sacrifice for
it.

31:53.211 --> 31:55.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is your take
on the Syria
strike, David?

31:55.981 --> 31:59.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The question
what's next strikes
me as a secondary question.

31:59.317 --> 32:02.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The primary question is, what
are we going
to do about chemical warfare?

32:02.087 --> 32:06.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A hundred years ago, right now,
World War
I was going on, and there people
were being

32:06.725 --> 32:08.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gassed in the trenches.

32:08.527 --> 32:12.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that the world
community has
basically tried to eliminate
chemical weapons

32:12.397 --> 32:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
since that time strikes me as a
great achievement.

32:15.267 --> 32:19.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to go back on that would be
a great step
backward for civilization.

32:19.437 --> 32:22.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Barack Obama, unfortunately,
didn't do
anything when chemical weapons
were used.

32:22.240 --> 32:25.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it was incumbent
upon the U.S.
to do something when chemical
weapons were

32:25.744 --> 32:27.145 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
used.

32:27.179 --> 32:29.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does this signal some grand
change of strategy
in the Middle East?

32:29.514 --> 32:31.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I sort of doubt it.

32:31.283 --> 32:34.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But at least we set this
precedent on this
particular issue.

32:34.119 --> 32:39.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, question, I think it was
probably totally
impulsive of President Trump to
do this.

32:39.057 --> 32:40.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's an impulsive person.

32:40.926 --> 32:43.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're stuck the downsides of
his impulsivity.

32:43.762 --> 32:47.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are upsides to having
an impulsive
president, because nobody in the
world, especially

32:47.132 --> 32:50.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in places like North Korea,
quite knows what's
going to happen.

32:50.402 --> 32:52.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, frankly, there are some
advantages
to that.

32:52.437 --> 32:54.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I could not
disagree more.

32:54.339 --> 32:58.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had an impulsive president in
George W.
Bush.

32:58.043 --> 33:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last time the Congress of
the United States,
15 years ago, recognized and
accepted its

33:05.083 --> 33:10.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
constitutional responsibility,
its sole authority
to take the United States into
war, their

33:10.856 --> 33:15.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
capacity to declare war, the
power to declare
war and send Americans, they did
it on the

33:15.393 --> 33:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eve of the election of 2002,
when it was to
their political advantage, and
not once since,

33:21.499 --> 33:28.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
despite the best efforts of
Republican Senator
Jeff Flake of Arizona, and Tim
Kaine of Virginia

33:28.206 --> 33:30.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to step up to that
responsibility.

33:30.542 --> 33:31.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can't -- I'm sorry.

33:31.910 --> 33:33.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't celebrate impulse.

33:33.879 --> 33:37.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that he keeps other people
off-balance
is not a strategy.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a rational process.

33:39.351 --> 33:40.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David?

33:40.518 --> 33:42.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it's not my
preferred
strategy.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would rather have a strategy,
obviously.

33:44.456 --> 33:49.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I am just pointing out there
is some upside
to having somebody who's a
little unpredictable.

33:49.661 --> 33:53.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, one of the questions is,
does this
lead to a more normal Trump
administration,

33:53.999 --> 33:58.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a more normal Republican foreign
policy administration,
where you have the U.S. saying,
yes, we're

33:58.937 --> 34:01.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to guarantee some sort of
world order?

34:01.706 --> 34:05.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump so far has been so
far away from
that, any step in that direction
would be

34:05.644 --> 34:07.445 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
welcome.

34:07.479 --> 34:10.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we see in the White House
over the last
week is the rise of General
Mattis, the rise

34:10.081 --> 34:15.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of National Security Adviser
McMaster, maybe
the rise, a little influence of
Rex Tillerson,

34:15.687 --> 34:18.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and possibly the banishment of
Steve Bannon.

34:18.556 --> 34:23.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if that's happening, then we
are heading
toward a more normal Republican
administration.

34:23.194 --> 34:25.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's too early to say
that's happening.

34:25.864 --> 34:30.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I still think we have a
president who is not
strategically minded, doesn't
have a long

34:30.468 --> 34:32.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attention span, and does react.

34:32.370 --> 34:36.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in this particular case --
and I suspect
it was a one-off case that, as
Andy Bacevich

34:36.975 --> 34:40.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, we will have forgotten in
a week, but
I think it was the right one-off
thing to

34:40.478 --> 34:41.446 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

34:41.479 --> 34:43.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that,
Mark?

34:43.315 --> 34:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been changes in the
White House,
including Steve Bannon coming
off the National

34:46.318 --> 34:48.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Security Council.

34:48.086 --> 34:54.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're reading that Bannon's
cache may
be dropping, as the president's
son-in-law,

34:54.492 --> 34:59.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jared Kushner, and Gary Cohn,
who runs the
Economic Council, that their
stock rises.

34:59.998 --> 35:04.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, Judy, just
one point that
David made I agree completely
with him.

35:04.869 --> 35:14.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The military, the defense --
General Mattis
certainly has -- you can see his
influence.

35:14.145 --> 35:15.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And let's be very blunt about
it.

35:15.981 --> 35:20.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only people in this Cabinet
who know what
they're doing, who have any
experience are

35:20.518 --> 35:24.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the military people.

35:24.222 --> 35:26.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're the ones that
understand.

35:26.091 --> 35:31.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's understandable that
General Mattis
rejected and resisted and fought
against the

35:31.262 --> 35:33.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
policy of Barack Obama,
President Obama.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He did push for more military.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, he is filling this void.

35:38.770 --> 35:42.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that that is a --
that's a plus
for the country.

35:42.607 --> 35:46.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As far as what's going on in the
White House,
I can't believe this disarray in
the White

35:46.344 --> 35:51.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House or these tensions, because
the president
told us it had been the most
successful 13

35:51.449 --> 35:54.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weeks of any president in U.S.
history.

35:54.185 --> 35:55.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it seems a funny way to
celebrate that.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's a pretty good rule of
thumb, Judy.

35:57.856 --> 36:01.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Steve Bannon is the only person
that has had
a worse week than Bill O'Reilly.

36:01.893 --> 36:07.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's a pretty good rule of
thumb that,
when you start talking personnel
changes in

36:07.532 --> 36:13.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any administration, whether it's
Jimmy Carter
in 1979 firing Joe Califano, or
Jerry Ford

36:13.338 --> 36:19.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cashiering Nelson Rockefeller in
1975, George
H.W. Bush getting rid of John
Sununu as chief

36:19.310 --> 36:22.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of staff, it's a pretty good
indication you're
in political trouble.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.448 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All three lost.

36:23.481 --> 36:24.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I would point that out.

36:24.549 --> 36:26.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that's going on
right now.

36:26.785 --> 36:31.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know -- Steve Bannon
made an incredibly
dumb move.

36:31.156 --> 36:36.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, you don't put the
boss in the
position of trying to -- being
forced to choose

36:36.394 --> 36:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between your daughter, your
favorite child's
spouse, Jared Kushner, and him.

36:42.634 --> 36:45.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it looks like that's what
Bannon has done,
and he's coming up short.

36:45.236 --> 36:47.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that,
David?

36:47.772 --> 36:48.740 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's going on?

36:48.773 --> 36:50.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, from what we can tell,
there are two
things going on.

36:51.409 --> 36:53.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One, they have had a series of
failures.

36:53.411 --> 36:56.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I hope they recognize them
as failures,
the health care failures, the
budget failures,

36:56.748 --> 36:58.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a series of other things.

36:58.149 --> 37:01.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, second, the poisonous
atmosphere within
the administration.

37:02.020 --> 37:05.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you talk to people who are
working with
the administration from outside
or those within,

37:05.723 --> 37:09.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they all describe a
scorpions-in-the-bottle-type
atmosphere.

37:09.427 --> 37:13.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that's something the
president has engineered
himself by deciding who's going
to be with

37:13.064 --> 37:17.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him one second, who's not going
to be with
him one second, who he favors
one second,

37:17.302 --> 37:19.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who he disfavors another second.

37:19.237 --> 37:24.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he has set an atmosphere
primarily
concerned to tear his staff
apart.

37:24.042 --> 37:26.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's hired people who are
apt at that.

37:26.878 --> 37:30.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so the atmosphere is
extremely unhappy.

37:30.048 --> 37:33.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so those -- both those
things are happening,
which, in a normal
administration, would recommend

37:33.551 --> 37:34.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a change.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is still -- it should be
said, still in
the realm of rumor.

37:37.856 --> 37:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the acidity of life in the
White House,
that seems to be pretty
well-established.

37:41.526 --> 37:42.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Acidity?

37:42.627 --> 37:43.595 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

37:43.628 --> 37:44.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Acidity.

37:44.629 --> 37:45.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Acidity is good.

37:45.630 --> 37:46.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As David said.

37:46.631 --> 37:48.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

37:48.466 --> 37:51.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every White House, Judy, is
ultimately and
inevitably a mirror reflection
of the person

37:51.569 --> 37:53.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the top.

37:53.505 --> 37:57.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the self-righteousness
of Jimmy Carter's,
the insular -- the paranoia of
Richard Nixon's,

37:57.242 --> 38:02.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the detachment of Barack
Obama's, it all reflects
the person at the top.

38:02.347 --> 38:09.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The chaos and the civil war in
the leper colony
going on now reflects Donald
Trump's style

38:09.454 --> 38:11.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and preferred modus.

38:11.156 --> 38:14.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm sure none
of these
presidents take what you said
personally.

38:14.626 --> 38:15.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: No.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.729 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:17.762 --> 38:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David, we do
have now a
new Supreme Court justice to
fill the Antonin

38:22.033 --> 38:23.835 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Scalia slot.

38:23.868 --> 38:27.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the meantime, what we
have seen is
the Republican leadership in the
Senate change

38:27.972 --> 38:31.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rules in order to get Neil
Gorsuch over
the line.

38:31.809 --> 38:37.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is some -- there is a lot
of talk right
now about, what does that mean
for the future?

38:37.048 --> 38:41.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We already have a very polarized
country,
House of Representatives.

38:41.352 --> 38:45.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The feeling was, the Senate
maybe wasn't quite
so polarized.

38:45.790 --> 38:51.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does this mean going
forward, that they
now are going to make it so much
easier for

38:51.396 --> 38:56.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- it appears, for nominees from
the far left
or the far right to be
confirmed?

38:56.234 --> 38:57.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

38:57.468 --> 39:00.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, it's the 967th nail in the
coffin of
bipartisanship.

39:00.538 --> 39:01.673 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:01.706 --> 39:04.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so it's the
end of a long
process.

39:04.475 --> 39:05.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It may be the end.

39:05.476 --> 39:06.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe things will get even
worse.

39:06.544 --> 39:09.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, Democrats took a big step
in lower judges.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We can go back to the Bork
hearings.

39:11.216 --> 39:13.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We can go back to a million
different hearings.

39:13.885 --> 39:17.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the Senate has become
gradually to look
more like the House.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so I think it's a sad day.

39:19.390 --> 39:21.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a pretty inevitable day.

39:21.259 --> 39:24.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, if the Democrats had
won this election,
they would have done exactly the
same thing

39:24.362 --> 39:26.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if they were in the similar
circumstance.

39:26.264 --> 39:27.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The precedent was set.

39:28.032 --> 39:32.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the sad part going
forward is,
it used to be, if you were
president, you

39:32.804 --> 39:38.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had some incentive to try to
nominate a judge
who could maybe get 60 votes,
who could appeal

39:38.576 --> 39:40.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to some people in the other
party.

39:40.278 --> 39:43.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now you have zero incentive as
long as you
can control the Senate.

39:43.781 --> 39:47.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we will see more -- even
more partisan
judges than we do now.

39:47.452 --> 39:51.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only thing I would say to
mitigate, which
I think is a decline and a
degradation and

39:51.222 --> 39:55.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a sadness, is that I have a
feeling that something
is about to happen with the
Trump administration.

39:55.493 --> 39:59.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Either it will shift, or
something bad will
happen, a scandal or something,
and that we're

39:59.731 --> 40:04.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in sort of a pre-apocalypse
phase, or maybe
that's putting it strongly.

40:04.435 --> 40:08.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But history is about to change,
because I
don't think the status quo can
maintain.

40:08.773 --> 40:13.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so if we have something, an
administration
that really suffers some
grievous blow, then

40:13.344 --> 40:16.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Washington culture will have
an opportunity
to change for the better.

40:16.814 --> 40:19.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, as of now, it's a long,
slow slide.

40:19.450 --> 40:22.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do I hear you
forecasting an
apocalypse of some sort?

40:22.654 --> 40:23.621 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:23.655 --> 40:24.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, that word
came out.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I should have stuck with
acidity.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was a better word.

40:27.492 --> 40:29.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:29.260 --> 40:31.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But I do think
Washington -- it
doesn't feel like this
administration can

40:31.396 --> 40:33.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
maintain the current state.

40:33.331 --> 40:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Something is going to happen,
and then we
will be in a different world,
with the possibility

40:36.501 --> 40:38.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of bipartisanship.

40:38.303 --> 40:41.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some senators, like Senator
Collins and
Coons and others, are still
hungering for

40:41.506 --> 40:42.707 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

40:42.740 --> 40:44.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you see
coming out
of the Senate?

40:44.309 --> 40:48.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: John McCain is
fond of quoting
Chairman Mao.

40:48.046 --> 40:51.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And David brings that to mind,
which is, it's
always darkest just before
everything goes

40:51.316 --> 40:52.283 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
black.

40:52.317 --> 40:53.284 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:53.318 --> 40:55.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And that is what
strikes me.

40:55.153 --> 40:59.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I join him, I join David in
commending Susan
Collins of Maine, the
Republican, and Chris

40:59.724 --> 41:08.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coons of Delaware, the Democrat,
for trying
to keep alive a sense of comity
and -- I-T-Y

41:08.266 --> 41:10.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
-- and rapprochement and
bipartisanship.

41:10.902 --> 41:18.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're sponsoring a resolution
that 61, or
at least a letter that 61
senators have signed

41:18.076 --> 41:26.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they will not have the
nuclear option
on just legislative -- domestic
legislation,

41:26.217 --> 41:30.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that that would keep at
least some hope
alive that there would be a
chance of moving

41:30.822 --> 41:33.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
across the aisle, working across
the aisle.

41:33.458 --> 41:37.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think one of the saddest
moments for me
of the year 2016, Judy, was when
John McCain,

41:37.829 --> 41:42.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who had been the apostle of
bipartisanship,
announced before the election
that he wouldn't

41:42.867 --> 41:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote for any Supreme Court
nominee whom Hillary
Clinton -- President Hillary
Clinton nominated.

41:48.272 --> 41:49.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's contagious.

41:49.707 --> 41:53.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Slings and arrows
coming from
both sides.

41:53.277 --> 41:56.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We wish you both a wonderful
weekend.

41:56.047 --> 42:00.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you.

42:00.618 --> 42:10.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields and
David Brooks,
thank you.

42:10.962 --> 42:16.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, as we approach the Jewish
holiday of
Passover, we have a new addition
to the "NewsHour"

42:16.734 --> 42:17.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bookshelf.

42:17.735 --> 42:19.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a celebration of cooking
and tradition.

42:19.704 --> 42:24.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAN NATHAN, Chef: When I
started the book,
I decided I really wanted to go
to India,

42:24.041 --> 42:25.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because I knew there was a
Jewish community
there.

42:25.943 --> 42:32.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I got to the synagogue
in Cochin,
it said that Jews had been
coming from the

42:32.083 --> 42:33.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time of King Solomon.

42:33.618 --> 42:35.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I thought, wow.

42:35.553 --> 42:41.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And with that,
celebrated food
authority Joan Nathan started
her 11th cookbook,

42:41.459 --> 42:48.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"King Solomon's Table: A
Culinary Exploration
of Jewish Cooking From Around
the World,"

42:48.366 --> 42:51.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with recipes handed down from
generation to
generation.

42:52.003 --> 42:56.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you have done in this book
is, you take
us to different parts of the
world.

42:56.307 --> 43:00.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then you show us these
incredible dishes.

43:00.344 --> 43:02.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How in the world did you pull
all this together?

43:02.313 --> 43:06.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAN NATHAN: I went to a lot of
places in
the world, but I could find
these immigrants

43:06.784 --> 43:13.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan
in Brooklyn,
or Iranian Jews in L.A.

43:13.558 --> 43:16.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then I found pockets like in
El Salvador,
in Cuba.

43:16.894 --> 43:21.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I found people that told me
about stories
that I had never heard before.

43:21.265 --> 43:26.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How did you
decide which foods
to choose?

43:26.504 --> 43:27.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOAN NATHAN: You know what?

43:27.772 --> 43:30.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I find a really wonderful dish.

43:30.741 --> 43:33.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Then I go with it.

43:33.544 --> 43:39.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, I went to an
Ethiopian Jewish
dinner in California.

43:40.017 --> 43:42.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was in San Diego.

43:42.553 --> 43:44.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I went to a Shabbat dinner.

43:44.856 --> 43:52.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they had this dabos, which is
an Ethiopian
Shabbat bread, adapted, of
course, from an

43:52.730 --> 43:54.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ethiopian bread.

43:54.232 --> 43:57.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was so delicious, I thought,
I have got
to put that in the book.

43:57.301 --> 44:00.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the other
thing that we're
standing in front of is this
flourless chocolate

44:01.005 --> 44:04.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cake, which came out of someone
who came from
Egypt.

44:04.408 --> 44:05.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOAN NATHAN: From Egypt.

44:05.910 --> 44:10.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, you know, flourless
chocolate cake is
part of our seder every year.

44:10.848 --> 44:18.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't have wheat, or flour
in -- unless
its specially watched flour, in
your desserts.

44:18.222 --> 44:22.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I always liked having a
flourless chocolate
cake.

44:22.293 --> 44:24.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I thought maybe you would
help me decorate
it.

44:24.195 --> 44:25.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good.

44:25.329 --> 44:26.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm going to do a little of this
while you're
talking.

44:26.731 --> 44:27.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOAN NATHAN: That's right.

44:27.732 --> 44:29.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That looks beautiful.

44:29.600 --> 44:34.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been very lucky through
the years that
people have opened up to me all
over the world.

44:34.539 --> 44:39.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And like, for example, I wanted
to get Iraqi
recipes, but I couldn't go to
Iraq.

44:39.043 --> 44:41.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I was told that the best
Iraqi cooks live
in London.

44:41.979 --> 44:47.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I went to London, and I got
a wonderful
Passover macaroon.

44:47.385 --> 44:50.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then somebody told me about
a recipe called
shritzla (ph).

44:50.354 --> 44:55.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was a blueberry bun that
people in
Toronto ate.

44:55.660 --> 44:58.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I learned that it came from
Southwest
Poland.

44:58.062 --> 45:04.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the woman that made it, if
she hadn't
come over very early, my guess
is that that

45:04.068 --> 45:05.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
recipe would have been lost.

45:05.870 --> 45:11.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Southwest Poland, the
religious Jews, when
the Nazis came in, they just
took them out.

45:11.342 --> 45:17.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this recipe, I saved a
recipe for other
people, because most people we
killed.

45:17.381 --> 45:20.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, these are stories that
are quite amazing.

45:20.585 --> 45:21.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you have kept
them alive.

45:22.019 --> 45:24.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOAN NATHAN: Well, I have tried
to keep them
alive.

45:24.221 --> 45:28.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have often thought, what's
the difference
between Jewish cooking and other
cooking?

45:28.292 --> 45:31.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, this could be any
immigrant food
in many ways.

45:31.829 --> 45:36.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's Jewish immigrants for,
I think, three
reasons.

45:36.701 --> 45:39.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One is because of the dietary
laws.

45:39.170 --> 45:41.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, you can't mix milk and
meat.

45:41.672 --> 45:47.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't eat certain shellfish,
so that what
happens is, Jewish people think
about their

45:47.078 --> 45:48.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
food a lot.

45:48.279 --> 45:49.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they like to eat.

45:49.280 --> 45:50.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're obsessed about it.

45:50.748 --> 45:53.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And most food is connected to a
holiday.

45:53.784 --> 45:55.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, that's one point.

45:55.820 --> 46:00.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second is that Jews have
always been merchants,
since the time of King Solomon,
going out

46:00.891 --> 46:02.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
looking for the new.

46:02.960 --> 46:07.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the third is that Jews have
been expelled
from so many places, like so
many people today.

46:08.032 --> 46:11.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they keep -- wherever you
go, you have
to adapt to new food.

46:11.302 --> 46:13.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And they have
kept their traditions
as they have moved.

46:13.671 --> 46:15.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOAN NATHAN: Yes, exactly.

46:15.039 --> 46:17.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's look
at one of
those traditions now.

46:17.174 --> 46:18.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOAN NATHAN: OK.

46:18.175 --> 46:19.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's go into my dining room.

46:19.477 --> 46:22.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Joan, now we
are at a table
set for seder.

46:22.647 --> 46:24.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOAN NATHAN: Right.

46:24.415 --> 46:28.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which, of course,
is all around
the Jewish observance of the
Passover.

46:28.085 --> 46:33.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is one of those traditions
where food
is of enormous importance.

46:34.025 --> 46:35.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOAN NATHAN: Right.

46:35.092 --> 46:36.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is the seder plate.

46:36.160 --> 46:40.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the first thing is the
shankbone.

46:40.398 --> 46:46.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is symbolic of the
destruction of
the First and Second Temple, as
is the egg,

46:46.170 --> 46:52.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is also symbolic of
rebirth and general
sorrow.

46:52.743 --> 47:01.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parsley is the spring, but you
dip it in saltwater
to remember your enemies, even
when you have

47:01.152 --> 47:03.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conquered them, because they
have suffered.

47:03.988 --> 47:07.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other two are the matzah and
the bitter
herbs.

47:07.458 --> 47:09.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This story, it
goes back to
Abraham.

47:09.860 --> 47:11.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOAN NATHAN: It goes back to
Abraham.

47:11.629 --> 47:18.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But these three symbols, the
bitter herbs,
lamb, and the matzah, were
mentioned in the

47:18.235 --> 47:19.270 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Bible.

47:19.303 --> 47:21.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those were -- the only thing
that was necessary.

47:21.672 --> 47:26.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it wasn't until after the
destruction
of the Second Temple that
Passover became

47:26.977 --> 47:32.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a home festival around a table,
because there
was no longer a temple in
Jerusalem.

47:32.616 --> 47:34.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have made
some sweet jam.

47:34.819 --> 47:36.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOAN NATHAN: Right, this is a
sweet blend.

47:36.887 --> 47:43.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is symbolic of the mortar
when the Jews
were slaves in Egypt.

47:43.127 --> 47:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's all slavery to freedom.

47:46.731 --> 47:49.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the original one was a date
jam.

47:49.767 --> 47:51.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is this.

47:51.268 --> 47:53.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOAN NATHAN: The biblical honey.

47:53.971 --> 47:57.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that was the one in Babylon.

47:57.608 --> 48:04.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then there is -- this one
actually is from
Maine, blueberries, very modern.

48:04.148 --> 48:07.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This one is from Persia or Iran.

48:07.752 --> 48:09.386 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it has nuts.

48:09.420 --> 48:10.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's got pistachios.

48:10.454 --> 48:12.089 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It has pears.

48:12.123 --> 48:14.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's got dates, all kinds of
good things.

48:14.725 --> 48:19.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Judaism, food
is an integral
part of telling the story.

48:19.130 --> 48:20.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOAN NATHAN: Absolutely.

48:21.031 --> 48:26.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why is it so
important to remember
these stories and to remember, I
mean, down

48:26.871 --> 48:30.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the recipes that you have
preserved in
this book?

48:30.441 --> 48:36.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAN NATHAN: Well, I think, in
the Bible,
it says you must relate this
story to your

48:36.213 --> 48:42.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children, so they know that
they're free men
and that they are Jews, and that
you don't

48:42.920 --> 48:47.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to be in slavery, and you
don't want
to treat people like slaves.

48:47.892 --> 48:51.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just something that we must
preserve
throughout history.

48:51.095 --> 48:54.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the hardest meal for me to
prepare.

48:54.598 --> 49:00.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's the most wonderful, the
most meaningful,
because I do think that it's
important for

49:00.204 --> 49:07.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
families today to take those
traditions from
their past and cling to them.

49:07.211 --> 49:14.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I really get totally moved
when I think
about the seder, with Jews all
over the world

49:14.718 --> 49:22.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the same time reading this
ancient text
and enjoying foods from all over
the world.

49:22.159 --> 49:28.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Joan Nathan, food
writer, extraordinary
cook, author now of your 11th
book, thank

49:28.199 --> 49:29.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you very much.

49:29.200 --> 49:31.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOAN NATHAN: Thank you, Judy.

49:31.202 --> 49:37.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can get
Joan Nathan's
recipe for flourless cake,
chocolate cake,

49:37.708 --> 49:40.978 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

49:41.011 --> 49:53.023 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's delicious.

49:53.057 --> 49:57.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally tonight: reflections on
coming to
the United States from author
Alia Malek,

49:57.428 --> 50:02.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who considers the various
journeys Syrian
refugees take on their many
roads from Damascus.

50:02.900 --> 50:09.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALIA MALEK, Author: In September
2015, I felt
I had to drop everything and go
to Turkey

50:09.340 --> 50:13.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to report on Syrians as they
hurriedly made
their way to Europe, trying to
beat the rapidly

50:13.344 --> 50:14.912 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
closing borders.

50:14.945 --> 50:19.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a Syrian-American, their fate
was one I
had only accidentally been
spared.

50:19.717 --> 50:24.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I accompanied them on this
journey, I couldn't
help thinking of how different
their circumstances

50:24.521 --> 50:29.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were from how my own Syrian
family had ended
up in the diaspora, of how my
mother, pregnant

50:29.894 --> 50:32.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with me, herself had left
Damascus.

50:32.796 --> 50:36.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Unlike the dangerous
Mediterranean Sea crossings
and the trek through the
Balkans, her trip

50:36.967 --> 50:39.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
itself wasn't treacherous, and
it wasn't undignified.

50:39.470 --> 50:44.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was traveling to Baltimore
to join my
father, a medical resident at
the University

50:44.108 --> 50:45.442 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Maryland.

50:45.476 --> 50:48.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While emotionally painful, her
journey couldn't
have been easier.

50:48.245 --> 50:52.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She wasn't facing imminent death
or displacement,
as people are today.

50:52.650 --> 50:56.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, both my parents meant
to eventually
return to their homeland.

50:56.487 --> 50:59.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when it became clear what
life would be
like under the Assad regime,
they gave up

51:00.024 --> 51:01.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their dream to return.

51:01.992 --> 51:06.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Years after all their children
were born American,
they too finally became
naturalized Americans.

51:06.730 --> 51:12.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When my family arrived here in
the '70s, being
Syrian wasn't a barrier to
becoming American.

51:12.770 --> 51:17.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Even if Arabs weren't
well-perceived generally,
Syrians specifically didn't hold
much of a

51:17.308 --> 51:19.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
place in the American
imagination or consciousness.

51:19.677 --> 51:24.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, I remember the best a
schoolyard
bully could do was tell me that,
as a Syrian,

51:24.648 --> 51:26.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I ate too much cereal.

51:26.884 --> 51:29.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oh, for those days.

51:29.353 --> 51:34.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In these past six years, as
Syria has disintegrated,
taken over the headlines, and as
Syrians have

51:34.491 --> 51:39.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
become the foreign menace of the
day, I have
often thought about the vagaries
of fate,

51:39.129 --> 51:44.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of how accidental and unintended
occurrences
are what separate me from the
Syrians unfairly

51:44.268 --> 51:50.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maligned, banned, and banished
today, how
our lot depends on when we
decided to leave,

51:50.307 --> 51:54.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where we landed, and how we got
there, whether
we boarded flights with regular
tickets and

51:54.878 --> 51:59.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
visas, or were piled on top of
each other
on flimsy rafts and left to
drift across the

51:59.416 --> 52:05.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sea unguided, how our future
depends on what
suffix happens to follow Syrian
on arrival.

52:05.656 --> 52:06.824 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it refugee?

52:06.857 --> 52:08.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it immigrant?

52:08.625 --> 52:10.127 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it American?

52:10.160 --> 52:12.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm lucky to be that last one.

52:12.262 --> 52:16.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Syrian mother I was traveling
with across
Europe worried at each new
border, what would

52:16.967 --> 52:18.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happen to her children?

52:18.869 --> 52:21.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In Syria, they had been
comfortably working
class.

52:21.905 --> 52:24.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her husband was a baker, and she
was a stay-at-home
mom.

52:24.675 --> 52:28.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the beginning of the trip,
her children
were horrified to have to
relieve themselves

52:28.512 --> 52:30.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
outdoors and in public.

52:30.614 --> 52:34.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Within days, though, she was
pained to see
how they had quickly adjusted to
their new

52:34.485 --> 52:36.353 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reality.

52:36.387 --> 52:39.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I instead approached each
crossing with a
guilty confidence of a
passport-carrying American.

52:40.024 --> 52:45.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was completely aware that my
fortune was
in large part by chance and
circumstance.

52:45.462 --> 52:50.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, rather than make me unique,
I imagine
that makes me like many other
Americans whose

52:50.868 --> 52:56.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
families were also once upon the
time among
the lucky, favored by fate to
have made it

52:56.607 --> 52:59.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to these shores when and how we
did.

52:59.643 --> 53:05.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's a
perspective we
need to hear, Alia Malek.

53:05.883 --> 53:10.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: As we
go into the weekend, we asked
for reading

53:10.454 --> 53:14.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suggestions from an independent
bookstore
in Lahore, Pakistan.

53:14.224 --> 53:19.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You can see their
recommendations on topics
from hip-hop to Persian cooking.

53:19.396 --> 53:24.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:24.134 --> 53:28.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later tonight on "Washington
Week": A reporters
roundtable further explores
President Trump's

53:28.572 --> 53:30.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
decision to strike Syria.

53:30.541 --> 53:34.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What led to the dramatic shift
in his national
security priorities?

53:34.845 --> 53:39.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what do the missile strikes
in Syria signal
to U.S. allies?

53:39.183 --> 53:41.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And join us tomorrow on "PBS
NewsHour Weekend."

53:41.919 --> 53:48.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We hear from a charity in Africa
that gives
cash to those in need, no
strings attached.

53:48.826 --> 53:53.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will be back right here
on Monday with
a story about the end of an era,
as the curtain

53:53.397 --> 53:57.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comes down for the last time on
the Ringling
Brothers Circus.

53:57.201 --> 53:59.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:59.236 --> 54:00.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:00.237 --> 54:01.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

54:01.472 --> 54:09.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and good night.
