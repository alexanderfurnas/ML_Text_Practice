MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY IN

00:52.019 --> 00:53.654
CONGRESS, PRESIDENT OBAMA TODAY

01:05.699 --> 01:07.000
SMART NEW TRADE DEALS WERE THE

01:07.000 --> 01:07.935
RIGHT THING TO DO FOR THE

THOSE WHO BROKE WITH THE

01:15.943 --> 01:16.843
PRESIDENT DURING A VOTE

01:16.843 --> 01:17.778
YESTERDAY.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.279
SHE AND OTHER DEMOCRATS FEAR THE

01:19.279 --> 01:21.748
DEAL COULD COST AMERICANS JOBS.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.850
THE HOUSE COULD VOTE AGAIN EARLY

01:23.850 --> 01:24.985
NEXT WEEK.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.053
AFTER TWO MONTHS OF QUIET

01:26.053 --> 01:27.688
CAMPAIGNING, IN NEW YORK TODAY,

01:33.794 --> 01:36.730

01:36.730 --> 01:38.899
>> WHILE MANY OF YOU ARE WORKING

01:38.899 --> 01:42.169

01:51.411 --> 01:54.181
COMBINED AND OFTEN PAYING A

01:54.181 --> 01:58.352
LOWER TAX RATE.

01:58.352 --> 02:02.556

116 PRISONERS ARE STILL BEHIND

03:23.870 --> 03:25.038
BARS.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.907
A LEGAL VICTORY FOR CONSUMERS.

A FEDERAL APPEALS COURT IN

OTHER CONTACT LENS

03:39.820 --> 03:40.887
MANUFACTURERS.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.089
THE COMPANIES WANTED THE COURT

03:42.089 --> 03:43.990
TO IMPOSE MINIMUM PRICES ON

03:43.990 --> 03:45.192
THEIR PRODUCTS.

03:45.192 --> 03:46.693
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT 38 MILLION

03:46.693 --> 03:48.295
AMERICANS WEAR CONTACT LENSES.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.763
IT IS A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR

03:49.763 --> 03:51.198
MARKET ANNUALLY.

03:51.198 --> 03:52.365
SMART-PHONE THEFTS ARE

03:52.365 --> 03:53.967
APPARENTLY DECLINING.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.302
CONSUMER REPORTS SAYS JUST MORE

03:55.302 --> 03:56.636
THAN 2 MILLION PHONES WERE

03:56.636 --> 03:57.804
STOLEN LAST YEAR, COMPARED TO

03:57.804 --> 03:59.139
MORE THAN THREE MILLION THE YEAR

03:59.139 --> 04:00.006
BEFORE.

04:00.006 --> 04:01.241
THE MAGAZINE SAYS THIEVES MIGHT

04:01.241 --> 04:02.542
BE LESS LIKELY TO SNATCH THE

04:02.542 --> 04:04.044
PHONES BECAUSE MANY ARE NOW

04:04.044 --> 04:05.445
EQUIPPED WITH WHAT ARE KNOWN AS

04:05.445 --> 04:06.713
KILL SWITCHES, REMOVING

04:06.713 --> 04:07.914
SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND

04:07.914 --> 04:09.316
DISABLING THE PHONES AFTER THEY

04:09.316 --> 04:10.650
ARE STOLEN.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.652
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WAS THE

04:12.652 --> 04:14.354
HOTTEST MAY ON RECORD IN

04:14.354 --> 04:15.188
ALASKA.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.156
THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE THERE

04:16.156 --> 04:17.958
WAS JUST BELOW 45 DEGREES.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.392
THAT IS MORE THAN SEVEN DEGREES

04:19.392 --> 04:21.094
ABOVE AVERAGE, ACCORDING TO THE

04:21.094 --> 04:22.395
NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC

04:22.395 --> 04:23.363
ADMINISTRATION.

04:23.363 --> 04:24.831
IT WAS ALSO ONE OF THE DRIEST

04:24.831 --> 04:27.868
MAYS ON RECORD THERE AS WELL.

04:36.109 --> 04:36.977
>> Sreenivasan: NOW, MORE ABOUT

04:36.977 --> 04:38.178
HILLARY CLINTON'S MAJOR ADDRESS

04:38.178 --> 04:39.913
TODAY, AND THE STATE OF THE 2016

04:39.913 --> 04:41.047
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

04:41.047 --> 04:42.149
JOINING ME TO HELP ANALYZE

04:42.149 --> 04:43.750
CLINTON'S APPEARANCE TODAY IS

04:43.750 --> 04:45.051
LISA DEJARDINS, THE NEWSHOUR'S

04:45.051 --> 04:46.887
POLITICAL DIRECTOR.

04:46.887 --> 04:47.821
>> CANDIDATES MAKE A LOT OF

04:47.821 --> 04:49.055
SPEECHES.

04:49.055 --> 04:51.091
WHY DID THIS ONE -- WHY WAS THIS

04:51.091 --> 04:52.325
ONE SO IMPORTANT FOR THE CLINTON

04:52.325 --> 04:53.894
FOLKS TO HAVE THIS KIND OF

04:53.894 --> 04:54.795
VISIBILITY?

04:54.795 --> 04:55.862
>> THIS WAS HILLARY CLINTON

04:55.862 --> 04:57.430
ANSWERING THE WHY ISSUE RUNNING

04:57.430 --> 04:58.598
QUESTION.

04:58.598 --> 04:59.699
UP TO NOW SHE TRIED TO PROVE TO

04:59.699 --> 05:02.335
PEOPLE I'M ACCESSIBLE, WARM,

05:02.335 --> 05:03.603
RELATABLE, AND HAS TON SMALL

05:03.603 --> 05:05.071
EVENTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WITH

05:05.071 --> 05:06.706
A FEW PEOPLE.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.108
NOW SHE THAT IS TO PROVE THERE'S

05:08.108 --> 05:09.609
A REASON FOR HER TO RUN.

05:09.609 --> 05:10.810
THIS IS WHAT SHE'S TRYING TO DO

05:10.810 --> 05:11.711
TODAY.

05:11.711 --> 05:13.180
AND IT WAS A BROAD PHILOSOPHICAL

05:13.180 --> 05:14.848
SPEECH BUT SHE ALSO HAD A LOT OF

05:14.848 --> 05:15.782
SPECIFICS.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.417
REALLY HER CAMPAIGN THREW

05:17.417 --> 05:18.585
EVERYTHING THEY HAD, I THINK,

05:18.585 --> 05:19.986
INTO THIS SPEECH.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.087
>> SHE ALSO TALKED A BY THE

05:21.087 --> 05:22.789
ABOUT HER MOM, MORE THAN WE

05:22.789 --> 05:24.257
REMEMBER ABOUT DURING THE LAST

05:24.257 --> 05:25.058
CAMPAIGN.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.126
>> IT IS INTERESTING.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.427
I THINK SHE'S TRYING TO BRING IN

05:27.427 --> 05:29.129
A HUMAN FACTOR AND TRYING TO SAY

05:29.129 --> 05:31.798
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT YOU

05:31.798 --> 05:32.632
CAN LOOK TO AS A MODEL.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.000
I LOOK TO MY OWN MOTHER.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.969
AND SHE USED HER MOTHER'S STORY.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.737
HER MOTHER WAS FORCED OUT OF HER

05:37.737 --> 05:38.538
HOUSE.

05:38.538 --> 05:39.606
SHE DIDN'T GO INTO DETAILS

05:39.606 --> 05:40.740
THERE, WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG, 14

05:40.740 --> 05:42.142
YEARS OLD, MADE HER WAY AS A

05:42.142 --> 05:44.744
MAID, EDUCATED AND AS SECRETARY

05:44.744 --> 05:47.047
CLINTON SAID TODAY IN HER

05:47.047 --> 05:48.648
SPEECH, HER MOM RAISED HER TO

05:48.648 --> 05:51.151
SAY SOMEONE SHOULD BELIEVE IN

05:51.151 --> 05:52.085
YOU.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.753
YOU GET YOUR OWN CHANCES BUT IT

05:53.753 --> 05:55.188
HELPS WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT

05:55.188 --> 05:56.323
BELIEVES IN YOU AND WHEN HILLARY

05:56.323 --> 05:57.424
CLINTON WAS USING THAT AS A

05:57.424 --> 05:58.825
DEVICE TODAY WAS TO SAY I

05:58.825 --> 06:00.293
BELIEVE IN AMERICA AND I BELIEVE

06:00.293 --> 06:02.495
ESPECIALLY IN WORKERS, LOW-PAID

06:02.495 --> 06:03.830
WORKERS AND I BELIEVE IN WOMEN'S

06:03.830 --> 06:05.398
RIGHTS AND USING IT AS METAPHOR

06:05.398 --> 06:07.000
FOR WHAT SHE THINKS A LEADERSHIP

06:07.000 --> 06:07.934
ROLE SHOULD BE.

06:07.934 --> 06:08.768
>> Sreenivasan: A COUPLE OF NEW

06:08.768 --> 06:10.337
POLES WERE OUT AND REPUBLICANS

06:10.337 --> 06:12.372
WERE SAYING FEWER THAN HALF OF

06:12.372 --> 06:13.873
THE AMERICANS BELIEVE HILLARY

06:13.873 --> 06:15.242
CLINTON TO BE TRUSTWORTHY OR

06:15.242 --> 06:16.276
HONEST.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.011
HOW DOES THAT PLAY INTO THE NEW

06:18.011 --> 06:19.779
CHAPTER HER PRESENTATION.

06:19.779 --> 06:20.914
>> IT WAS INTERESTING.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.016
I DIDN'T HEAR HER DIRECTLY HEAD

06:23.016 --> 06:25.118
ON ADDRESS THE TRUST ISSUE.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.420
NED INSTEAD THEY TRIED TO PLAY

06:27.420 --> 06:28.521
TO HER STRONG POINTS WHICH WAS

06:28.521 --> 06:31.791
HER DECISIVENESS, AND THREE

06:31.791 --> 06:34.394
TIMES SHE CAME TO HER BIO AND

06:34.394 --> 06:36.730
WHAT SHE HAS DONE TO PROVE THIS

06:36.730 --> 06:38.465
IS HER TIME.

06:38.465 --> 06:39.699
AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, SHE

06:39.699 --> 06:41.134
DID NOT TRY TO SEPARATE HERSELF

06:41.134 --> 06:43.069
FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA, HE HIMSELF

06:43.069 --> 06:44.437
NOT DOING SO WELL IN THE POLLS

06:44.437 --> 06:46.706
OVER THE LAST YEAR BUT TWO

06:46.706 --> 06:48.408
DIFFERENT TIMES SHE TIED HERSELF

06:48.408 --> 06:49.876
TO PRESIDENT OBAMA.

06:49.876 --> 06:51.745
MY ISSUE IS THAT SHE'S GOING FOR

06:51.745 --> 06:53.847
THE OBAMA VOTERS, FOR THE CORE

06:53.847 --> 06:55.782
DEMOCRATIC VOTER WHO LOVED HER

06:55.782 --> 06:57.817
HUSBAND, LIKES HER, AND ALSO THE

06:57.817 --> 06:58.818
PRESIDENT.

06:58.818 --> 06:59.686
>> THERE'S A LOT OF CORE

06:59.686 --> 07:02.522
DEMOCRATIC VOTERS WHO ARE IN

07:02.522 --> 07:04.691
SORT OF BERNIE SANDERS ELIZABETH

07:04.691 --> 07:06.259
WARREN WING OF THE PARTY.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.827
HOW MUCH IS THAT INFLUENCING

07:07.827 --> 07:08.995
WHAT SHE IS SAYING?

07:08.995 --> 07:09.963
>> YOU COULD HEAR IT TODAY FOR

07:09.963 --> 07:10.964
SURE.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.165
BUT HER MAIN THEME, IF YOU HAD

07:12.165 --> 07:14.234
TO PICK JUST ONE, WAS THE IDEA

07:14.234 --> 07:15.769
OF INEQUALITY, ESPECIALLY

07:15.769 --> 07:17.370
INEQUALITY IN WAGES AND TO SOME

07:17.370 --> 07:18.772
DEGREE INEQUALITY IN WOMEN'S

07:18.772 --> 07:20.874
RIGHTS BUT MOSTLY ABOUT WAGES.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.475
SHE MENTIONED MANY SPECIFIC

07:22.475 --> 07:23.543
TIMES OF WORKERS.

07:23.543 --> 07:24.944
TALKED ABOUT NURSES WORKING

07:24.944 --> 07:25.812
OVERNIGHT.

07:25.812 --> 07:28.081
TALK ABOUT LOW-PAID TEACHERS.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.449
TALKED ABOUT WAITRESSES.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.817
SHE IS HITTING THESE SORTS OF

07:30.817 --> 07:32.852
GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT FEEL

07:32.852 --> 07:34.120
THEY'RE NOT GETTING MAYBE A FAIR

07:34.120 --> 07:35.689
SHARE.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.090
AND ALSO WENT AFTER REPUBLICANS

07:37.090 --> 07:39.125
FOR, IN HER WORDS, HELPING THE

07:39.125 --> 07:40.960
FAT CATS IN WALL STREET AND ALSO

07:40.960 --> 07:41.928
SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THE

07:41.928 --> 07:42.962
SUPREME COURT.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.064
THERE WAS A GOOD MENTION THAT IS

07:44.064 --> 07:45.165
A SHE WANTS TO OVERTURN CITIZENS

07:45.165 --> 07:46.766
UNITED AND SAID THAT'S A WAY THE

07:46.766 --> 07:48.134
RICH ARE GETTING RICHER.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.469
>> THAT'S JUST THE STRUGGLE IN

07:49.469 --> 07:51.171
HER OWN PARTY AND THERE'S THE

07:51.171 --> 07:52.939
OTHER PARTY, THE REPUBLICANS AND

07:52.939 --> 07:54.474
I THINK JEB BUSH IS SET TO

07:54.474 --> 07:56.276
ANNOUNCE ON MONDAY.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.511
SO THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY CROWDED

07:58.511 --> 08:00.347
FIELD ALREADY.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.681
SO SHE IS REALLY GOING UP

08:01.681 --> 08:03.116
AGAINST AN ENTIRE GANG OF

08:03.116 --> 08:04.084
OPPONENTS.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.452
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

08:05.452 --> 08:06.619
I THINK WHAT SHE'S TRYING TO DO

08:06.619 --> 08:08.555
TODAY IS COVER A LOT OF BASES.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.223
SHE DIDN'T JUST TALK ABOUT

08:10.223 --> 08:11.157
INEQUALITY.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.425
THAT KIND OF STUCK OUT TO ME.

08:12.425 --> 08:13.893
BUT SHE HIT ON CLIMATE CHANGE

08:13.893 --> 08:15.528
AND A HUGE NUMBER OF ISSUES

08:15.528 --> 08:16.563
TODAY.

08:16.563 --> 08:18.098
I THINK THE DANGER HILLARY

08:18.098 --> 08:20.166
CLINTON HAS SUPER-THE SPEECH,

08:20.166 --> 08:21.668
INASMUCH AS THERE'S A BROAD

08:21.668 --> 08:23.470
PHILOSOPHY IS THAT SHE TRIED TO

08:23.470 --> 08:25.572
DO SO MANY THINGS THAT WALKING

08:25.572 --> 08:27.040
AWAY I ASKED PEOPLE WHAT WAS THE

08:27.040 --> 08:28.575
MAIN MESSAGE THAT YOU HEARD

08:28.575 --> 08:30.677
TODAY AND NONE OF THE VOTERS

08:30.677 --> 08:31.611
COULD PICK ONE THING.

08:31.611 --> 08:32.645
>> WHERE DOES THE REPUBLICAN

08:32.645 --> 08:34.214
FIELD STAND NOW?

08:34.214 --> 08:36.082
>> I THINK JEB BUSH HAS HAD A

08:36.082 --> 08:37.183
ROUGH COUPLE OF WEEKS WITH THE

08:37.183 --> 08:39.152
SHAKE UP IN HIS CAMPAIGN STAFF.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.454
BUT TO BE HONEST, I THINK ALL OF

08:41.454 --> 08:44.090
THIS IS IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND WE

08:44.090 --> 08:46.259
DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW WHERE THE

08:46.259 --> 08:47.427
REPUBLICAN VOTERS ARE.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.129
I THINK SCOTT WALKER IS STILL

08:49.129 --> 08:50.597
RISING VERY STRONG.

08:50.597 --> 08:52.232
MARCO RUBIO VERY STRONG AMONG

08:52.232 --> 08:53.900
THE REPUBLICAN VOTERS AND

08:53.900 --> 08:55.068
THERE'S SO MUCH TO BE SHAKEN OUT

08:55.068 --> 08:56.803
AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR JEB

08:56.803 --> 08:58.905
BUSH TO BE STRONG ON MONDAY.

08:58.905 --> 09:01.074
FRANKLY HIS APPEARANCES AND

09:01.074 --> 09:03.042
SPEECHES AS HE HAS HAD THIS ROLL

09:04.310 --> 09:05.945
STRONG AND THE FACT HIS CAMPAIGN

09:05.945 --> 09:07.447
IS LOOKING TO HAVE A BIG MOMENT

09:07.447 --> 09:08.348
ON MONDAY.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.350

09:32.639 --> 09:33.573
THAT'S ACTUALLY A MAJOR

09:33.573 --> 09:35.041
IMPROVEMENT FROM A DECADE AGO.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.409
BUT GETTING RID OF THE PROBLEM

09:36.409 --> 09:38.344
ALTOGETHER HAS PROVEN DIFFICULT,

09:38.344 --> 09:40.246
IN PART BECAUSE VETERANS SUFFER

09:40.246 --> 09:41.781
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AT A

09:41.781 --> 09:43.049
HIGHER RATE THAN THOSE WHO HAVE

09:43.049 --> 09:44.150

09:44.150 --> 09:45.251

14:07.313 --> 14:08.548
SHE SAYS HOUSING FOR THE

14:08.548 --> 14:10.650
HOMELESS, INCLUDING VETERANS, IS

14:10.650 --> 14:12.151
LESS EXPENSIVE THAN TRYING TO

14:12.151 --> 14:13.820
CARE FOR PEOPLE ON THE STREET,

14:13.820 --> 14:15.688
WHICH COSTS NEARLY $1 BILLION

OUR STREETS.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.801
WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT PERMANENT

14:28.801 --> 14:29.969
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS ACTUALLY

14:29.969 --> 14:32.538
40% CHEAPER THAN LEAVING SOMEONE

14:32.538 --> 14:34.140
ON THE STREETS AND, IN OUR

MINDS, DOING NOTHING.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.559
CAN I ASK YOU HOW LONG YOU'VE

14:53.559 --> 14:54.594
BEEN ON THE STREETS?

14:54.594 --> 14:57.130
>> HOW LONG?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.966
RIGHT NOW, IT'S-- IT'S-- SINCE

14:59.966 --> 15:02.602
I'VE BEEN OUT OF PRISON?

1974.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.178
BUT HE TOLD US THAT HE'D ALSO

15:12.178 --> 15:14.046
SPENT TIME IN PRISON.

15:14.046 --> 15:15.148
SINCE HE'D BEEN OUT, HE'D BEEN

15:15.148 --> 15:17.116
STAYING IN SKID ROW SHELTERS.

15:17.116 --> 15:18.151
HE SHOWED US THE FEW ESSENTIAL

15:18.151 --> 15:19.519
ITEMS THAT HE KEEPS WITH HIM.

15:19.519 --> 15:20.686

FIND A PERMANENT HOUSE.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.932

16:07.300 --> 16:09.969
ARE STILL ON L.A. STREETS.

16:09.969 --> 16:10.770
I WAS ON THE STREET THIS

16:10.770 --> 16:11.804
MORNING.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.506
AND WE RAN INTO SOME VETERANS.

16:13.506 --> 16:14.340
>> YEAH.

16:14.340 --> 16:15.308
>> Reporter: FROM MY EYES, IT

16:15.308 --> 16:16.809

STRAITS.

HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT

16:25.785 --> 16:27.153
ACHIEVE THAT GOAL.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.321
BECAUSE TOWARDS THE END, IT IS

16:28.321 --> 16:30.022
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE MOST

SERVICE-RESISTANT WHO MOST

EACH OTHER.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.169
SOME WILL TAKE MORE TIME, BUT

16:43.169 --> 16:44.770
I'M CONFIDENT WE CAN MAKE SURE

16:44.770 --> 16:46.105
THAT EACH ONE OF THEM HAS A

16:46.105 --> 16:47.907
PATHWAY OFF OUR STREETS.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.512

WITH PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

16:57.683 --> 16:59.218

PLANT THE FLAG AND SAY, "WE'VE

17:18.437 --> 17:19.472
DONE IT."

SOMETHING ELSE.

17:22.575 --> 17:23.676
WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING THIS FOR

17:23.676 --> 17:24.777
YEARS BECAUSE THERE ARE GOING TO

17:24.777 --> 17:25.778
BE VETERANS FALLING TOWARD

HOMELESSNESS FOR YEARS AND YEARS

PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

17:33.152 --> 17:34.520
PROVIDED WITH ALMOST NO

17:34.520 --> 17:36.155
PRECONDITIONS, AN APPROACH KNOWN

17:36.155 --> 17:38.257
AS HOUSING FIRST, LEAVES MANY

17:38.257 --> 17:40.660
VETS OUT, INCLUDING THOSE WHO

17:40.660 --> 17:41.827
MAY SIMPLY NEED SOME HELP

17:41.827 --> 17:43.095
GETTING BACK ON THEIR FEET.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.764
>> I THINK THE TRAP THAT PEOPLE

17:44.764 --> 17:47.166
GET INTO IS THAT THEY HEAR ABOUT

17:47.166 --> 17:49.769
SOMETHING LIKE HOUSING FIRST AND

17:49.769 --> 17:50.803
SAY, "THAT'S THE ANSWER."

17:50.803 --> 17:51.804
THEY FOCUS ON THAT AS THE ONE

17:51.804 --> 17:53.139
ANSWER.

17:53.139 --> 17:54.707
AND IT'S A VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.108
ALL VETERANS ARE DIFFERENT.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.043
THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.210
WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT HERE.

17:59.478 --> 18:00.579
CONCERN THAT THE FOCUS ON

18:02.014 --> 18:03.783
EXPENSE OF THE BROADER PROBLEM.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.752
IN FACT, OVERALL HOMELESSNESS IN

CONFIDENCE THAT IF WE CAN END

ATTACK CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS,

GENERAL AND AFGHANISTAN'S FUTURE

20:12.945 --> 20:15.414
LOOKING MORE UNCERTAIN NOW THAN

20:15.414 --> 20:17.149
IT HAS FOR A LONG TIME, IT

20:17.149 --> 20:18.884
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HAVE THE

20:18.884 --> 20:21.020
INFLUENCE OF ALL KEY ACTORS AND

20:21.020 --> 20:22.888
THAT NOW INCLUDES THE TALIBAN.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.223
>> AND THEY'RE INVOLVED IN

20:24.223 --> 20:25.791
SEVERAL OTHER PARTS IN THIS

20:25.791 --> 20:27.760
FIGHT AGAINST SEAR GRA.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.894
I MEAN THEY'RE SUPPORTING ALL

20:28.894 --> 20:29.862
KINDS OF ACTORS IN DIFFERENT

20:29.862 --> 20:31.330
PLACES.

20:31.330 --> 20:32.264
YEAH.

20:32.264 --> 20:34.467
THEY PURSUE A VERY ACTIVIST

20:34.467 --> 20:37.303
FOREIGN POLICY IN THE REGION.

20:37.303 --> 20:38.537
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THE FIRES

20:38.537 --> 20:40.206
TIME THEY HAVE RECRUITED AFGHAN

20:40.206 --> 20:41.440
FIGHTERS.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.342
THEY HAVE ALSO RECRUITED AFGHANS

20:43.342 --> 20:48.180
FIGHTING SYRIA WITH THE REGION

20:48.180 --> 20:51.083
BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT FOCUS

20:51.083 --> 20:54.019
BECAUSE HERE THEY'RE SIDING WITH

20:54.019 --> 20:55.521
THE TALIBAN AND THAT'S NOT AN

20:55.521 --> 20:57.523
OBVIOUS ALLIANCE.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.792
IRAN IS A THEOCRACY AND IN THE

20:59.792 --> 21:00.993
PAST THEY NEARLY WENT TO WAR

21:00.993 --> 21:03.462
WITH IRAN BUT OVER THE PAST 13

21:03.462 --> 21:06.732
YEARS THEY BEGAN REACHING OUT TO

21:06.732 --> 21:08.601
THE TALIBAN AS WELL BECAUSE THEY

21:08.601 --> 21:10.035
HAVE AN ENEMY IN COMMON AND THAT

21:10.035 --> 21:11.370
WAS THE UNITED STATES.

21:11.370 --> 21:14.440
THEN MORE RECENTLY WHAT BROUGHT

21:14.440 --> 21:16.976
IRAN CLOSE TO THE TALIBAN HAS

21:16.976 --> 21:18.110
BEEN THE EMERGENCE OF THE

21:18.110 --> 21:20.346
ISLAMIC STATE WITHIN THE AFGHAN

21:20.346 --> 21:21.380
TERRITORY AS WELL.

21:21.380 --> 21:22.548
>> Sreenivasan: NONE OF THIS

21:22.548 --> 21:23.816
HAPPENS IN A VACUUM.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.251
DOES THIS INFORMATION HAVE AN

21:25.251 --> 21:28.387
IMPACT ON THE ONGOING NUCLEAR

21:28.387 --> 21:30.356
NEGOTIATIONS?

21:30.356 --> 21:31.991
>> IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.527
BUT IT COULD DEFINITELY ADD

21:34.527 --> 21:37.229
FUTURE TO CREDIT INCOMPETENCE

21:37.229 --> 21:39.498
WHO SAY A POSSIBLE DEAL WOULD

21:39.498 --> 21:41.000
GIVE MORE FREEDOM TO IRAN TO

21:41.000 --> 21:42.535
PURSUE ITS POLICY AND THAT'S

21:42.535 --> 21:45.571
DEFINITELY HOW -- SOME OF THE

21:45.571 --> 21:46.539
RESPONSES THAT WE HAVE BEEN

21:46.539 --> 21:48.140
GETTING FROM THE U.S.

21:48.140 --> 21:48.974
>> Sreenivasan: SO IF THE

21:48.974 --> 21:50.809
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS WERE LIFTED

21:50.809 --> 21:52.444
AND ALLOWS IRAN TO PURSUE THIS

21:52.444 --> 21:55.414
POLICY OF THEIR MORE FREELY.

21:55.414 --> 21:57.082
>> THAT'S THE FEAR AND THAT'S

21:57.082 --> 21:59.885
WHAT CRITICS HAVE PUT UP AND

21:59.885 --> 22:01.720
MANY OF THE CRITICS HAVE LOOKED

22:01.720 --> 22:03.756
AT THIS EXAMPLE OF IRAN

22:03.756 --> 22:05.424
SUPPORTING THE TALIBAN IN

22:05.424 --> 22:06.825
AFGHANISTAN AS AN EXAMPLE OF

22:06.825 --> 22:07.993
THAT.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.028
>> MARGHERITA STANCATI OF "THE

22:09.028 --> 22:10.062

22:17.336 --> 22:18.904
SATURDAY.

22:22.107 --> 22:23.209
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO

22:23.209 --> 22:24.610
VIEWERS LIKE YOU, YOUR CHANCE TO

22:24.610 --> 22:25.911
COMMENT ON SOME OF OUR RECENT

22:25.911 --> 22:26.946
WORK.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.681
MANY OF YOU WROTE US ABOUT LAST

22:28.681 --> 22:29.982
WEEKEND'S UPDATED SIGNATURE

22:29.982 --> 22:31.350
STORY FROM OHIO ON THE

22:31.350 --> 22:32.885
CONTROVERSIAL USE OF TRAFFIC

22:32.885 --> 22:35.087
CAMERAS TO TICKET MOTORISTS FOR

22:35.087 --> 22:36.655
TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS.

22:36.655 --> 22:37.690
SOME OF THE VIEWERS WE HEARD

22:37.690 --> 22:39.558
FROM DEFENDED THE PRACTICE.

22:39.558 --> 22:40.926
PATRICK DEVINE SAID:

22:40.926 --> 22:41.927
"LOVE THEM.

22:41.927 --> 22:42.995
REDUCES THE NUMBER OF POLICE

22:42.995 --> 22:44.096
OFFICERS NEEDED FOR TRAFFIC

22:44.096 --> 22:45.297
CONTROL SO THEY CAN ENFORCE

22:45.297 --> 22:46.732
OTHER AREA.

22:46.732 --> 22:48.000
RED LIGHT CAMERAS HAVE BEEN

22:48.000 --> 22:49.735
PROVEN TO SAVE LIVES."

22:49.735 --> 22:50.769
THOMAS LANGR ADDED:

22:50.769 --> 22:52.104
"I'LL BE IN THE MINORITY HERE,

22:52.104 --> 22:53.138
BUT AFTER SEEING ALL THE

22:53.138 --> 22:54.773
ACCIDENTS CAUSED BY MOTORISTS

22:54.773 --> 22:56.242
BREAKING THE RULES, AND SO MANY

22:56.242 --> 22:58.143
CLOSE CALLS MYSELF, I SEE A

22:58.143 --> 22:59.278
PLACE FOR THEM."

22:59.278 --> 23:00.412
MARTIN WROTE:

23:00.412 --> 23:01.280
"WE'VE HAD THEM IN SOUTH

23:01.280 --> 23:02.815
AUSTRALIA FOR YEARS.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.116
THESE CAMERAS WILL ALWAYS BE

23:04.116 --> 23:05.517
REGARDED AS REVENUE-RAISERS

23:05.517 --> 23:07.386
UNTIL THE MONEY FROM FINES IS

23:07.386 --> 23:09.388
USED FOR ROAD SAFETY NOT GENERAL

23:09.388 --> 23:10.589
REVENUE."

23:10.589 --> 23:11.991
THERE WAS ALSO THIS FROM NATHAN

23:11.991 --> 23:12.958
ENGLE:

23:12.958 --> 23:14.560
"I DEFINITELY SEE THE ARGUMENT

23:14.560 --> 23:16.061
THAT IT'S TOXIC TO TURN

23:16.061 --> 23:17.630
MUNICIPAL FINES INTO A FOR-

23:17.630 --> 23:19.598
PROFIT VENTURE, BUT I'M NOT AT

23:19.598 --> 23:21.100
ALL COMFORTABLE STANDING ON THE

23:21.100 --> 23:22.468
SIDE OF PEOPLE TRYING TO ARGUE

23:22.468 --> 23:24.303
THAT IT WAS NO BIG DEAL THAT

23:24.303 --> 23:26.205
THEY BLEW THROUGH A RED LIGHT."

23:26.205 --> 23:27.940
BUT OTHERS FELT THERE WAS NO

23:27.940 --> 23:29.708
NEED FOR TRAFFIC CAMERAS, AND

23:29.708 --> 23:31.243
THAT THEY DO NOTHING STOP

23:31.243 --> 23:32.678
TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS.

23:32.678 --> 23:33.779
MIKE MILLAN SAID:

23:33.779 --> 23:35.481
"THESE ARE JUST REVENUE

23:35.481 --> 23:36.749
GENERATING MACHINES THAT DO

23:36.749 --> 23:37.850
NOTHING TO DECREASE TRAFFIC

23:37.850 --> 23:38.717
PROBLEMS.

23:38.717 --> 23:39.885
THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN DOWN AND

23:39.885 --> 23:41.086
OUTLAWED."

23:41.086 --> 23:42.921
MIKEMANN MCMAHON WROTE:

23:42.921 --> 23:44.189
"OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THEM IN

23:44.189 --> 23:46.191
MINNEAPOLIS WAS DUBIOUS, AND WAS

23:46.191 --> 23:48.060
DETERMINED UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY

23:48.060 --> 23:49.595
THE STATE SUPREME COURT."

23:49.595 --> 23:51.063
SEAN BURNS HAD THIS TO SAY:

23:51.063 --> 23:52.564
"JUST ANOTHER WAY TO TURN 'LAW

23:52.564 --> 23:55.034
ENFORCEMENT' INTO A CASH MACHINE

23:55.034 --> 23:56.235
FOR THE CITY."

23:56.235 --> 23:58.170
AND FINALLY THERE WAS THIS FROM

23:58.170 --> 23:59.438
HKRIEGER:

23:59.438 --> 24:00.339
"I ONCE WORKED AS A

24:00.339 --> 24:01.807
PHOTOGRAPHER, BUT THIS SEEMS

24:01.807 --> 24:03.342
LIKE A MORE PROFITABLE WAY TO

24:03.342 --> 24:04.943
MAKE MONEY WITH A CAMERA."

THE "NEW YORK TIMES."

24:33.172 --> 24:34.340
