JUDY WOODRUFF: As Republicans
in Congress struggle to reach
agreement on a plan to replace

00:04.633 --> 00:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Affordable Care Act, we
have heard from a variety of
interested parties in recent

00:09.500 --> 00:11.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
weeks and months.

00:11.800 --> 00:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have included
hospitals, the pharmaceutical
industry, advocates for
the homeless and those

00:17.100 --> 00:20.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with disabilities, as
well as lawmakers from
both political parties.

00:20.133 --> 00:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we turn to the
March of Dimes and its
president, Stacey Stewart.

00:24.900 --> 00:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a nonprofit that focuses
on the health needs of mothers
and babies, especially with

00:31.666 --> 00:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regard to preventing
premature birth, birth
defects and infant mortality.

00:36.666 --> 00:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Stacey Stewart, thank you
very much for being here.

00:38.800 --> 00:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what is your main concern
with the Senate version of
this health care reform plan?

00:43.466 --> 00:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STACEY STEWART, President,
March of Dimes: Well, the March
of Dimes, as you mentioned,

00:45.733 --> 00:49.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
what we care about is
the health of pregnant
women and their babies.

00:49.266 --> 00:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And our main concern with the
Senate bill, as it's proposed,
is that it would put at

00:53.633 --> 00:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
risk the health of many of
those women and their babies.

00:57.166 --> 01:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid today covers about half
of all pregnancies in the United
States and there are about 30

01:01.766 --> 01:04.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
million children that
are covered by Medicaid.

01:04.466 --> 01:08.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Under what the Senate
has proposed, about
6.5 million low-income
women of child-bearing

01:08.600 --> 01:11.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
age would lose their
coverage under Medicaid.

01:11.966 --> 01:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we think that that puts
at risk those women in terms
of them being able to access

01:16.800 --> 01:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prenatal care and all the
things they need to do to have
a healthy baby, have a healthy

01:19.966 --> 01:22.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pregnancy.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, about half
of pregnant women in this
country depend on government

01:25.733 --> 01:27.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
help in order to have
a healthy pregnancy?

01:27.466 --> 01:30.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STACEY STEWART: Right.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what Medicaid covers
is -- it generally covers
a lot of low-income
women who are pregnant

01:32.466 --> 01:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and making sure they have the
help they need in prenatal
care and also in delivering the

01:38.166 --> 01:40.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
baby.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what it also covers, and
what a lot of people don't
understand, is that, if a baby

01:42.400 --> 01:46.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is born too soon, born
premature, if a baby
is born with low birth
weight or a baby has

01:46.500 --> 01:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
defects, Medicaid also covers
many of those babies as well.

01:49.966 --> 01:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it ends up covering a lot
of the babies and providing
the support that many women

01:54.066 --> 01:57.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and families need to
make sure they can have
a healthy pregnancy and
have the support that

01:57.533 --> 01:59.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
babies need if there
are complications.

01:59.633 --> 02:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think there
hasn't been a great deal of
talk about prevention, but you

02:03.533 --> 02:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
were telling us that
prevention is a very -
- is a big part of this.

02:06.933 --> 02:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STACEY STEWART: Well, I think
one of the big conversations
that is going on right now is,

02:10.366 --> 02:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how do we stabilize
the health market?

02:12.466 --> 02:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think -- how do
we stabilize Medicaid
and I think stabilize
health care in general?

02:16.433 --> 02:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think one of the
conversations we really
need to have as a country
is, how do we begin

02:20.633 --> 02:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do even more, to put more
of the emphasis on prevention
and care earlier on, vs. having

02:27.233 --> 02:29.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a system that really is
funding a lot of chronic
disease and illness?

02:29.500 --> 02:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, one of the reasons we focus
so much on maternity coverage
and prenatal care is because

02:34.000 --> 02:37.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that's what happens to
enable those women to
have healthy babies.

02:37.866 --> 02:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they get the help they
need, and certainly even before
they get pregnant, if they are

02:41.633 --> 02:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
healthy before they even get
pregnant, that is going to be
what creates the best outcome

02:46.333 --> 02:47.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for that baby.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so healthy women
equals healthy babies.

02:50.533 --> 02:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The more and more we
can put more emphasis
on early prevention
efforts and fund a system

02:55.200 --> 03:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that actually focuses on that,
we think will improve health
outcomes, reduce cost, reduce

03:00.000 --> 03:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
premiums, which is what
I think everybody wants.

03:02.233 --> 03:07.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Isn't it
the case, though, Stacey
Stewart, that, under
traditional Medicaid,

03:09.200 --> 03:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
states are required to cover
pregnancy, to cover prenatal
care, to cover babies?

03:15.233 --> 03:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, even if Medicaid is scaled
back, which looks like would
be the case under the Senate

03:21.566 --> 03:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan, the Republican plan, they
would still be required to cover
women in these circumstances,

03:25.566 --> 03:27.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wouldn't they?

03:27.633 --> 03:29.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STACEY STEWART: Well,
the problem is, is
that with reductions as
they're proposed, we're

03:29.666 --> 03:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not exactly sure if -- how much
of the need would be covered.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's always a question.

03:36.233 --> 03:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And with women coming off of
Medicaid coverage as a result
of the pullback of the expansion

03:40.433 --> 03:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Medicaid, I think there is
a real concern that we have.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, of course, the
concern isn't just in
the Medicaid market.

03:45.966 --> 03:48.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The concern is also
in the private market.

03:48.033 --> 03:52.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, what a lot of people
don't realize is, before
the Affordable Care
Act, private health

03:54.900 --> 03:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care plans didn't necessarily
include maternity coverage
as a requirement, as
did employer-based

03:58.666 --> 04:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
plans or Medicaid.

04:00.733 --> 04:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we have got to look
at the totality of the health
care system in making sure that

04:03.333 --> 04:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all women, irrespective of
them being in a private plan or
Medicaid, have access to those

04:07.666 --> 04:09.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
resources they need.

04:09.700 --> 04:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we believe that much
of the support that women
need could be at risk.

04:12.966 --> 04:15.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's what our
primary concern is.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you answer
the argument from conservatives
that, look, something has

04:19.166 --> 04:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got to be done, that Medicaid
has grown at a rate that's
just out of control, cannot

04:23.733 --> 04:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be sustained, and unless some
methods are found to scale
that back, Medicaid is not

04:30.166 --> 04:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be there in the long
term for people who need it?

04:32.300 --> 04:34.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STACEY STEWART: Well,
we share that concern.

04:34.566 --> 04:38.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Obviously, the costs of
Medicaid are exorbitant
and they're growing.

04:38.900 --> 04:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But let's look at what's really
going on in the Medicaid market.

04:45.300 --> 04:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have got a lot of low-income
women, many women of color.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what we see are health
outcomes not improving.

04:50.633 --> 04:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the big concerns that
we have at the March of Dimes
is we just -- the government

04:53.733 --> 04:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just issued some statistics
showing that pre-term
birth rates have now
increased for the second

05:00.700 --> 05:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time in the past two years,
after some decline over
the past seven years.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Health outcomes are not
improving for pregnant
mothers and babies.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's actually going down.

05:11.800 --> 05:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, one of the things that
we can do to control the costs
of Medicaid and health care

05:15.866 --> 05:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in general, again, is to focus
on what all early interventions
can be put in place, what

05:22.866 --> 05:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prevention methods could be
put in place to educate and
inform and provide the support

05:28.400 --> 05:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the health care coverage
that women need, so that both
kind of health outcomes can be

05:30.900 --> 05:32.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
avoided.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we can avoid those health
outcomes, then we can avoid the
cost in the system, and then

05:35.433 --> 05:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we can keep those costs under
control, so that we have a
much more manageable system

05:38.866 --> 05:40.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over time.

05:40.933 --> 05:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have heard
on occasion from Republicans
the argument, why should men,

05:46.766 --> 05:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
especially single men, be
required to buy - - to have
coverage that includes maternity

05:52.033 --> 05:54.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and birth costs?

05:54.100 --> 05:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STACEY STEWART: Well, that
argument just goes against
what insurance is all about.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We all buy insurance
for things we -- that
may never happen to us.

06:00.466 --> 06:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We all buy insurance for a lot
of things, including health
insurance for health outcomes

06:04.600 --> 06:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that we may never suffer from.

06:07.066 --> 06:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that women
are responsible for
child-bearing does not mean
that they're responsible

06:13.466 --> 06:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for creating the baby in the
first place by themselves.

06:15.733 --> 06:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It takes men and women
together to create babies.

06:19.666 --> 06:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we believe it's very
important that the insurance
market cover those things that

06:26.533 --> 06:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are risks that each one of us
individually may not experience,
but they are risks and

06:32.900 --> 06:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are costs that are in
the system that are important
to make sure get covered.

06:38.033 --> 06:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think it's really important
to say, look, when we buy
insurance, we buy it for a lot

06:40.066 --> 06:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of things that we personally may
not experience or be impacted
by, but that's the point of

06:46.833 --> 06:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
having insurance and that's the
point of having a larger pool
of risk included in insurance,

06:49.300 --> 06:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so that it reduces the cost
for everyone to participate.

06:51.500 --> 06:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stacey Stewart,
the president of the March
of Dimes, and the debate goes

06:55.433 --> 06:56.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

06:56.433 --> 06:57.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

06:57.633 --> 06:57.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STACEY STEWART: Thank
you so much, Judy.
