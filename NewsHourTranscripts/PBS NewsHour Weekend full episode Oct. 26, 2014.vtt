00:17.050 --> 00:18.352
GOVERNORS TO QUARANTINE DOCTORS

00:18.352 --> 00:19.553
WHO TREATED EBOLA COULD ACTUALLY

00:19.553 --> 00:20.520
HURT EFFORTS TO CURB THE

00:20.520 --> 00:23.523
DISEASE.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.325
AFTER SEVERAL RECENT INCIDENTS

00:25.325 --> 00:27.094
IN CANADA AND IN NEW YORK, WE'LL

00:27.094 --> 00:28.128

00:33.700 --> 00:34.501
GRAPPLING WITH A DEADLY DISEASE

00:34.501 --> 00:36.503
THAT IS WIPING OUT STARFISH.

00:36.503 --> 00:37.504
>> I'M EXPECTING THAT IN THE

THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.121
THE WHITE HOUSE IS REPORTEDLY

00:54.121 --> 00:55.522
PRESSING GOVERNORS TO REVERSE

00:55.522 --> 00:56.623
COURSE AND NOT REQUIRE DOCTORS

00:56.623 --> 00:57.991
WHO TREAT EBOLA PATIENTS IN

00:57.991 --> 01:00.060
AFRICA TO BE QUARANTINED.

01:07.501 --> 01:08.635
JERSEY, ILLINOIS AND FLORIDA

01:08.635 --> 01:09.503
COULD ACTUALLY DAMAGE EFFORTS TO

01:09.503 --> 01:11.305
CONTAIN THE DISEASE.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.506
>> WELL, AS A SCIENTIST AND AS A

01:12.506 --> 01:14.608
HEALTH PERSON, IF I WERE ASKED,

01:14.608 --> 01:15.776
I WOULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED

01:15.776 --> 01:16.910
THAT.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.111
IF YOU PUT EVERYONE IN ONE

01:18.111 --> 01:19.413
BASKET, EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:19.413 --> 01:21.448
CLEARLY NO THREAT, THEN WE HAVE

01:21.448 --> 01:23.550
THE PROBLEM OF THE DISINCENTIVE

01:23.550 --> 01:25.552
OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE NEED.

01:25.552 --> 01:27.521
LET'S NOT FORGET THE BEST WAY TO

02:47.300 --> 02:48.602
ISIS EXTREMISTS HAD SEIZED IT IN

02:48.602 --> 02:50.137
JULY.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.005
THE EXTREMISTS REMAIN IN CONTROL

02:52.005 --> 02:53.340

03:21.635 --> 03:22.736
HAVE SAID THEY WILL NOT PAY

03:22.736 --> 03:23.837
RANSOM BECAUSE, THEY SAY, IT

03:23.837 --> 03:24.838
WOULD ONLY ENCOURAGE MORE

03:24.838 --> 03:26.173
KIDNAPPINGS.

ANOTHER SIGN TODAY OF EUROPE'S

03:33.346 --> 03:34.281
THE EVENT OF ANOTHER FINANCIAL

03:34.281 --> 03:35.282
CRISIS.

03:35.282 --> 03:36.049
COLLECTIVELY, THOSE BANKS

03:36.049 --> 03:38.685

FACTORS, INCLUDING INCREASED

04:02.175 --> 04:03.110

04:03.110 --> 04:04.211
ALSO SAY MORE PEOPLE ARE TURNING

04:04.211 --> 04:04.911
THEMSELVES IN AT THE BORDER

04:04.911 --> 04:05.679
RATHER THAN RISK GETTING INJURED

04:05.679 --> 04:08.148
OR KILLED.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.516
A NATIONWIDE RECALL OF MORE THAN

THIRTY ONE THOUSAND POUNDS OF

04:26.032 --> 04:27.734
THE U.S.D.A. SAYS THE BACTERIA

04:27.734 --> 04:28.902
CAN LEAD TO FOOD POISONING

04:28.902 --> 04:29.603
WITHIN THIRTY MINUTES.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.437
NO CASES OF ILLNESS HAVE BEEN

04:30.437 --> 04:33.406
REPORTED SO FAR.

04:33.406 --> 04:34.941
AND OFFICIALS IN HAWAII SAY LAVA

04:34.941 --> 04:36.576
FLOWING FROM A VOLCANO IS MOVING

04:36.576 --> 04:37.911
TOWARDS A RURAL AREA ON THE BIG

04:37.911 --> 04:39.379
ISLAND AND THAT AN EVACUATION

04:39.379 --> 04:41.848
MIGHT BE NECESSARY LATER THIS

04:41.848 --> 04:43.016
WEEK.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.518
THE LAVA HAS BEEN CREEPING

04:44.518 --> 04:46.052
TOWARD THE TOWN OF PAHOA SINCE

04:46.052 --> 04:46.920
JULY.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.522
IT ONLY MOVES TEN YARDS AN HOUR,

04:48.522 --> 04:49.823
BUT IT'S NOW CLOSE ENOUGH TO

04:49.823 --> 04:50.757
POSE A THREAT.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.025
THE LAVA REPORTEDLY IS MORE THAN

04:52.025 --> 05:03.303
1,000 DEGREES.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.005
>> Sreenivasan: DURING THE PAST

05:05.005 --> 05:06.439
WEEK, THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST

05:06.439 --> 05:07.974
THREE SEPARATE ATTACKS LAUNCHED

05:07.974 --> 05:09.309
BY WHAT ARE REFERRED TO AS LONE

05:09.309 --> 05:10.577
WOLF TERRORISTS WHO ARE OFTEN

05:10.577 --> 05:11.745
INSPIRED BY PROPAGANDA FROM

05:11.745 --> 05:13.413
GROUPS LIKE ISIS.

05:13.413 --> 05:14.915
LAST MONDAY IN QUEBEC, A MAN,

05:14.915 --> 05:16.116
WHO HAD CONVERTED TO ISLAM AND

05:16.116 --> 05:17.584
HAD BECOME RADICALIZED,

05:17.584 --> 05:18.919
PURPOSELY CRASHED HIS CAR INTO

05:18.919 --> 05:20.353
TWO SOLDIERS, KILLING ONE OF

05:20.353 --> 05:23.390
THEM, BEFORE HE WAS SHOT DEAD.

05:23.390 --> 05:25.392
TWO DAYS LATER, ANOTHER GUNMAN

05:54.054 --> 05:57.524
COMMENTED ON THE ATTACKS.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.391
>> WHAT KIND OF THREAT DOES THAT

05:58.391 --> 05:59.292
POSE TO OUR OWN NATIONAL

05:59.292 --> 06:00.260
SECURITY?

06:00.260 --> 06:01.928
>> HUGE, AND GETTING WORSE.

06:01.928 --> 06:02.963
>> THESE ATTACKS AND THE

06:02.963 --> 06:04.164
MULTIPLICITY OF ATTACKS IN 2014

06:04.164 --> 06:05.265
SHOW THAT THEIR PROPAGANDA IS

06:05.265 --> 06:07.234
HAVING SOME EFFECT.

06:07.234 --> 06:08.635
>> Sreenivasan: FOR MORE ABOUT

06:08.635 --> 06:09.836
ALL THIS, WE ARE JOINED NOW FROM

06:09.836 --> 06:11.104
BOSTON BY JYTTE KLAUSEN.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.372

06:12.372 --> 06:14.074
UNIVERSITY AND THE FOUNDER OF

06:14.074 --> 06:15.508
THE WESTERN JIHADISM PROJECT,

06:15.508 --> 06:17.377
WHICH TRACKS THE ACTIVITY OF

06:17.377 --> 06:24.551
ISLAMIST EXTREMISTS IN THE WEST.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.119
BEHIND THESE LONE WOLF ATTACKS?

06:26.119 --> 06:27.988
>> WELL, THE, THEY CALL THEM

06:27.988 --> 06:29.356
LONE WOLVES BUT IN MOST CASES

06:29.356 --> 06:31.224
THEY HAVE BEEN CONNECTED TO

06:31.224 --> 06:33.293
NETWORKS AND PIER GROUPS AND

06:33.293 --> 06:34.628
MILITANTS FOR SOME TIME AND THEY

06:34.628 --> 06:36.830
CARRY OUT THE ATTACKS BY

06:36.830 --> 06:38.965
THEMSELVES, BUT THEY ARE NOT ..

06:38.965 --> 06:39.699
ACTUALLY LONE WOLVES IN THE

06:39.699 --> 06:42.402
SENSE THAT THEY HAD JUST BECOME

06:42.402 --> 06:43.536
RADICALIZED OFF THE INTERNET OR

06:43.536 --> 06:44.571
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.339
OF COURSE, THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS

06:46.339 --> 06:50.343
TO THIS GENERAL RULE, BUT RIGHT

06:50.343 --> 06:53.113
NOW, THERE IS A CALLOUT FROM THE

06:53.113 --> 06:55.482
ISLAMIC STATE GROUP, SOMETIMES

06:55.482 --> 06:58.218
REFERRED TO AS ISIL, TO CARRY

06:58.218 --> 07:01.388
OUT ATTACKS ON PEOPLE WHO

07:01.388 --> 07:02.289
REPRESENT THE WESTERN STATES.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.156
>> OKAY.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.859
SO WE ARE ALSO HEARING MORE

07:05.859 --> 07:06.993
FREQUENTLY ABOUT THE

07:06.993 --> 07:09.095
SYMPATHIZERS IN THE WEST WHO ARE

07:09.095 --> 07:11.898
LURED TO GO AND FIGHT FOR ISIS.

07:11.898 --> 07:15.702
WHAT ARE THE REASONS FOR THAT?

07:15.702 --> 07:17.304
>> WELL, THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN

07:17.304 --> 07:20.273
ABLE TO GO, ISIS OR ISIL HAVE

07:20.273 --> 07:21.875
INVITED THEM, THERE WERE MANY

07:21.875 --> 07:23.243
WESTERNERS WHO TRIED TO GO AND

07:23.243 --> 07:26.413
FIGHT FOR AL QAEDA IN IRAQ IN

07:26.413 --> 07:28.348
THE PREVIOUS INSURGENCY IN IRAQ

07:28.348 --> 07:32.118
AND THEY WEREN'T WELCOME, BUT

07:32.118 --> 07:34.721
ISIL HAS BEEN PURSUING A

07:34.721 --> 07:36.222
STRATEGY IN SYRIA FOR SOME TIME,

07:36.222 --> 07:39.793
AND SO IN THE COURSE OF 2013

07:39.793 --> 07:42.028
THEY STARTED ENLIGHTENING THEM

07:42.028 --> 07:43.897
TO COME AND MANY WESTERNERS WHO

07:43.897 --> 07:45.932
THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY ATTRACTIVE

07:45.932 --> 07:48.034
POSITION TO WALK AROUND THE

07:48.034 --> 07:50.403
STREETS OF THE SYRIAN CITIES

07:50.403 --> 07:54.307
THAT THEY REFER TO AS LIBERATED

07:54.307 --> 07:56.209
ZONE AND POLICE THE LOCAL MUSLIM

07:56.209 --> 07:57.544
POPULATION IN THOSE PLACES, SO

07:57.544 --> 07:59.179
THEY WERE VERY ATTRACTED TO THE

07:59.179 --> 08:02.115
IDEA OF GETTING CONTROL AND

08:02.115 --> 08:03.550
BEING THE BIG MAN OR BIG WOMAN

08:03.550 --> 08:04.351
ON THE BLOCK.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.018
>> OKAY.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.820
ONCE THEY GET THERE, THEIR STORY

08:06.820 --> 08:08.154
MIGHT CHANGE A BIT AS YOUR

08:08.154 --> 08:08.955
RESEARCH TRACKS, THERE IS

08:08.955 --> 08:11.391
ACTUALLY A MUCH HIGHER MORTALITY

08:11.391 --> 08:13.593
RATIO OF THE WESTERNERS WHO GO

08:13.593 --> 08:15.261
IN THERE, OFTENTIMES THEY ARE

08:15.261 --> 08:16.763
USED AS SUICIDE BOMBERS BECAUSE

08:16.763 --> 08:18.365
THEY ARE NOT REALLY MUCH MORE

08:18.365 --> 08:20.033
GOOD TO ISIL OR ISIS?

08:20.033 --> 08:20.934
>> YES.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.269
THAT IS CORRECT.

08:23.269 --> 08:25.238
BUT IN 2013, THE MORTALITY RATES

08:25.238 --> 08:27.006
WEREN'T SO HIGH, THEY REALLY

08:27.006 --> 08:28.108
HAVE PICKED UP SINCE THE START

08:28.108 --> 08:30.543
OF THIS YEAR, AND THEY ARE NOW

08:30.543 --> 08:31.945
PICKING UP EVIDENCE OF PEOPLE

08:31.945 --> 08:34.314
WHO WANT TO COME HOME AND HAVE

08:34.314 --> 08:36.249
HAD REGRETS, BUT AT THE SAME

08:36.249 --> 08:37.784
TIME, EVEN AS THAT IS HAPPENING

08:37.784 --> 08:39.285
THERE ARE ALSO NEW PEOPLE WHO

08:39.285 --> 08:42.956
ARE LEAVING, SO THERE ARE -- BY

08:42.956 --> 08:44.758
MY COUNT, BASED ON ESTIMATES

08:44.758 --> 08:47.861
FROM THE DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS

08:47.861 --> 08:49.429
THERE HAVE BEEN AROUND 3,000

08:49.429 --> 08:50.864
WESTERN WHORES HAVE AT ONE POINT

08:50.864 --> 08:55.602
IN TIME GONE OFF AND JOINED THE

08:55.602 --> 08:56.636
EXTREMIST JIHADIST GROUPS.

08:56.636 --> 08:58.505
>> WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY COME

08:58.505 --> 09:00.440
BACK? IS THERE EVIDENCE TO SHOW

09:00.440 --> 09:01.875
THAT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO

09:01.875 --> 09:03.243
LAUNCH AN ATTACK AT THEIR HOME

09:03.243 --> 09:04.778
IN THE WEST?

09:04.778 --> 09:07.247
>> THERE IS EVIDENCE OF THAT,

09:07.247 --> 09:10.316
BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME COMING

09:10.316 --> 09:13.019
BACK WHO ARE EXHIBITING SIGNS OF

09:13.019 --> 09:14.854
HAVING HAD REGRETS, PARTICULARLY

09:14.854 --> 09:16.122
AMONGST SOME OF THE YOUNGER

09:16.122 --> 09:17.991
GROUPS, THE WOMEN, SOME OF THE

09:17.991 --> 09:19.793
TEENAGERS WHO HAD TAKEN OFF, BUT

09:19.793 --> 09:23.029
THEY ARE BY NO MEANS THE ONLY

09:23.029 --> 09:24.697
STREAM THAT HAS GONE OFF, THERE

09:24.697 --> 09:26.533
ARE HARDENED FOLKS WHO HAVE GONE

09:26.533 --> 09:28.368
OFF WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE FROM

09:28.368 --> 09:31.404
PREVIOUS INSURGENCIES, A BOSTON

09:31.404 --> 09:34.808
MAN NAMED AHMED WHO GOES TO

09:34.808 --> 09:38.311
PAKISTAN AND TO YEMEN AND TOOK

09:38.311 --> 09:43.149
OFF TO SYRIA IN 2006 IS NOW

09:43.149 --> 09:45.452
BELIEVED TO BE IN CHARGE OF THE

09:45.452 --> 09:47.053
SOCIAL MEDIA OPERATIONS ON

09:47.053 --> 09:50.457
BEHALF OF ISIL, AND SO WE SHOULD

09:50.457 --> 09:53.760
BE CAREFUL NOT TO DRAW FAST

09:53.760 --> 09:55.361
CONCLUSIONS OF WHAT SORT OF

09:55.361 --> 09:57.897
THREAT THESE PEOPLE PRESENT WHEN

09:57.897 --> 10:00.700
THEY COME BACK, AND SO SURE,

10:00.700 --> 10:03.236
FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES

10:03.236 --> 10:04.871
INSURGENCIES AND WESTERNERS

10:04.871 --> 10:08.575
GOING OFF, THAT HAVING HAD THE

10:08.575 --> 10:10.477
EXPERIENCE OF LEARNING HOW TO

10:10.477 --> 10:11.811
CARRY OUT VIOLENCE, SHOOTING A

10:11.811 --> 10:14.814
GUN AND PUTTING TOGETHER A BOMB,

10:14.814 --> 10:16.649
THEY WILL COME BACK AND THEY

10:16.649 --> 10:19.319
WILL TRY TO CARRY OUT VIOLENCE

10:19.319 --> 10:20.320
HERE, AND THERE HAVE BEEN

10:20.320 --> 10:23.523
INCIDENT ALREADY THAT HAVE

10:26.192 --> 10:27.460
INCIDENT IN BRUSSELS AT THE

10:27.460 --> 10:28.194

OUT STARFISH ALONG THE WEST

10:49.682 --> 10:51.718
COAST FOR MORE THAN A YEAR NOW.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.152
IT'S CALLED SEA STAR WASTING

10:53.152 --> 10:54.187
SYNDROME AND IT CAUSES THE

10:54.187 --> 10:55.522
MARINE ANIMALS TO DIE IN A

10:55.522 --> 10:56.890
PARTICULARLY GRUESOME WAY.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.591
UNTIL RECENTLY, THE CREATURES

10:58.591 --> 11:01.094
SEEMED TO BE FARING BETTER IN

11:16.776 --> 11:18.611
IN SITKA, ALASKA.

11:18.611 --> 11:19.946
THE STARS HAVE YET TO FADE FROM

11:19.946 --> 11:24.217
THE NIGHT SKY.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.653
A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS IS

11:26.653 --> 11:28.187
SETTING OUT IN SEARCH OF A

11:28.187 --> 11:30.423
DIFFERENT KIND OF STAR.

11:30.423 --> 11:31.824
SEA STARS, COMMONLY KNOWN AS

11:31.824 --> 11:33.459
STARFISH, HAVE BEEN VANISHING

11:33.459 --> 11:35.495
FROM ALASKA'S SHORELINE.

11:35.495 --> 11:36.863
>> Reporter: PETER RAIMONDI IS

11:36.863 --> 11:38.031
ONE OF THE LEAD SCIENTISTS

11:38.031 --> 11:39.465
STUDYING AN ALARMING EPIDEMIC

11:39.465 --> 11:40.800
THAT'S BEEN KILLING STARFISH BY

11:40.800 --> 11:42.335
THE MILLIONS.

11:42.335 --> 11:43.503
>> THESE CRACKS IN THE PREVIOUS

11:43.503 --> 11:44.837
YEARS WOULD HAVE BEEN FULL

11:44.837 --> 11:45.738
THEM.

11:45.738 --> 11:46.940
YOU GUYS DIDN'T GET ANY LAST

11:46.940 --> 11:48.341
TIME, DID YOU?

11:48.341 --> 11:49.442
BACK IN JUNE?

11:49.442 --> 11:50.677
>> Reporter: RAIMONDI AND

11:50.677 --> 11:51.711
RESEARCHER MELISSA MINER HAVE

11:51.711 --> 11:52.679
BEEN CONDUCTING INTENSIVE

11:52.679 --> 11:54.147
SURVEYS OF PACIFIC COASTAL

11:54.147 --> 11:56.149
AREAS, TRACKING THE SPREAD OF

11:56.149 --> 11:58.484
THE DISEASE.

11:58.484 --> 11:59.786

11:59.786 --> 12:01.020
LOOKED IN THE LAST YEAR WE'VE

12:01.020 --> 12:02.622
SEEN CATASTROPHIC LOSSES OF SEA

12:02.622 --> 12:06.693
STARS.

12:06.693 --> 12:07.794
>> Reporter: RAIMONDI POUNDS

12:07.794 --> 12:08.895
BOLTS IN THE ROCKS SO THAT YEAR

12:08.895 --> 12:10.229
AFTER YEAR, THEY CAN FIND AND

12:10.229 --> 12:12.432
SURVEY THE SAME AREAS.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.666
ONCE THEY'VE ROPED OFF A PATCH

12:13.666 --> 12:14.701
OF SHORELINE, THEIR TEAM COUNTS

12:14.701 --> 12:15.702
AND MEASURES THE CREATURES THAT

12:15.702 --> 12:19.339
LIVE HERE.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.974
SITKA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST

12:20.974 --> 12:22.542
PLACES THEY NOTICED SIGNS OF THE

12:22.542 --> 12:26.646
DISEASE LAST YEAR.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.081
NOW THE TEAM IS BACK TO CHECK ON

12:28.081 --> 12:30.249
THE STARS.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.751
THE QUESTION IS, WILL STARFISH

12:31.751 --> 12:33.186
IN THE COOL WATERS OF ALASKA

12:33.186 --> 12:34.988
SURVIVE THIS OUTBREAK?

12:34.988 --> 12:42.228
OR WILL THEY, TOO, SUCCUMB?

12:42.228 --> 12:43.429
>> IT'S DEFINITELY NOT SEVERELY

12:43.429 --> 12:47.033
WASTED, BUT THOSE ARE WHAT WE'RE

12:47.033 --> 12:48.234
CALLING EARLY WARNING SIGNS OF

12:48.234 --> 12:49.802
WASTING.

12:49.802 --> 12:51.104
THIS IS THE BEGINNINGS OF TWO

12:51.104 --> 12:52.372
SEPARATE LESIONS, AND SOMETIMES

12:52.372 --> 12:53.740
WHAT WE SEE IS THAT THIS WILL

12:53.740 --> 12:58.378
GROW TOGETHER AND ACTUALLY, THE

12:58.378 --> 13:00.246
WHOLE TISSUE WILL KIND OF

13:00.246 --> 13:02.115
DEGRADE.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.049
>> Reporter: THE SYMPTOMS VARY

13:03.049 --> 13:04.150
DEPENDING ON THE SPECIES OF

13:04.150 --> 13:06.185
STARFISH, BUT IT USUALLY STARTS

13:06.185 --> 13:07.754
THE SAME WAY.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.355
>> THEY GET WHITE LESIONS.

13:09.355 --> 13:10.523
THEY BECOME NECROTIC, THAT MEANS

13:10.523 --> 13:11.991
THE TISSUE DIES.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.226
AND AS THE TISSUE DIES, THEY

13:13.226 --> 13:14.961
OFTEN TIMES WILL LOSE ARMS AND

13:14.961 --> 13:16.696
THEN WASTE AWAY.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.765
THEY DISINTEGRATE.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.366
>> SOMETIMES THEY GET LESIONS

13:20.366 --> 13:22.001
AND THEIR INTERNAL ORGANS START

13:22.001 --> 13:24.804
TO SPILL OUT OF THESE LESIONS.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.574
AND THAT CAN HAPPEN WITHIN 24 TO

13:28.574 --> 13:31.077
48 HOURS.

13:31.077 --> 13:32.245
>> Reporter: STARFISH DEATHS

13:32.245 --> 13:33.312
WERE FIRST REPORTED IN THE

13:33.312 --> 13:35.415
SUMMER OF 2013 ON WASHINGTON'S

13:35.415 --> 13:37.150

13:45.525 --> 13:47.393
WEST COAST STARFISH.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.095
THE PLAGUE HAS HIT SO HARD OVER

13:49.095 --> 13:51.164
THE PAST YEAR THAT BIOLOGISTS

13:51.164 --> 13:52.465
FEAR THAT SOME SPECIES COULD

13:52.465 --> 13:54.200
EVEN GO EXTINCT.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.635
SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN SCRAMBLING

13:55.635 --> 14:02.542
TO FIND ANSWERS.

14:02.542 --> 14:03.910
DREW HARVELL IS COORDINATING

14:25.765 --> 14:27.100
COUNTLESS SAMPLES IN THE LAB,

14:27.100 --> 14:28.768
HARVELL'S TEAM BELIEVES THAT AN

14:28.768 --> 14:29.969
INFECTIOUS PATHOGEN-- LIKE A

14:29.969 --> 14:32.472
BACTERIA OR VIRUS-- MAY BE THE

14:32.472 --> 14:34.340
ROOT OF THE PROBLEM.

14:34.340 --> 14:35.808
>> THIS IS WHAT WE CALL A WIDE

14:35.808 --> 14:37.477
HOST RANGE PATHOGEN.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.078
IT MEANS THAT IT AFFECTS MANY

14:39.078 --> 14:40.780
DIFFERENT SPECIES.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.615
AND THOSE ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS

14:42.615 --> 14:44.283
IN WILDLIFE DISEASE IN TERMS OF

14:44.283 --> 14:45.718
A POTENTIAL RISK OF EXTINCTION.

14:51.924 --> 14:55.328
WATER AND PHYSICAL CONTACT.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.930
AND THEY'RE TESTING A HYPOTHESIS

14:57.930 --> 15:00.233
THAT THE PATHOGEN MAY BE

15:00.233 --> 15:01.934
TRANSFERRED THROUGH SHELLFISH,

15:01.934 --> 15:03.936
WHICH STARFISH LIKE TO EAT.

15:03.936 --> 15:06.706
EXACTLY WHAT TRIGGERS THESE

15:06.706 --> 15:08.808
OUTBREAKS IS STILL UNKNOWN, BUT

15:08.808 --> 15:11.010
SCIENTISTS THINK THE DISEASE

15:11.010 --> 15:13.279
COULD BE COMPOUNDED BY WARMING

15:13.279 --> 15:15.348
WATERS.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.050
STARFISH ARE STRESSED BY HIGHER

15:18.050 --> 15:19.986
TEMPERATURES, WHICH MAKE THEM

15:19.986 --> 15:21.087
MORE VULNERABLE TO INFECTION.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.288
HARVELL HAS BEEN KEEPING AN EYE

15:22.288 --> 15:23.156
ON THE ONCE ABUNDANT STARFISH

15:23.156 --> 15:24.490
POPULATIONS AROUND WASHINGTON'S

15:24.490 --> 15:25.958
SAN JUAN ISLANDS.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.126
COLD WATER HERE MAY HAVE HELPED

15:27.126 --> 15:28.494
STARFISH WITHSTAND THE FIRST

15:28.494 --> 15:29.695
WAVE OF THE DISEASE.

15:29.695 --> 15:30.897
BUT SUMMERTIME BROUGHT WARMER

GONE.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.211
AS OUTBREAKS CONTINUE IN PUGET

15:45.211 --> 15:46.345
SOUND, SCIENTISTS ARE LOOKING

15:46.345 --> 15:49.315
NORTH FOR A SIGN OF HOPE.

15:49.315 --> 15:51.684
>> THE HOPE IS THAT THE WATERS

15:51.684 --> 15:53.186
ARE COLD ENOUGH IN ALASKA, THE

15:53.186 --> 15:54.687
NORTHERN PART OF THEIR RANGE FOR

15:54.687 --> 15:56.022
MANY OF THESE SPECIES, THAT

15:56.022 --> 15:59.392
THEY'LL PERSIST THERE.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.093
>> Reporter: THIS SUMMER,

16:01.093 --> 16:02.428
MELISSA MINER WAS HOPEFUL THAT

16:02.428 --> 16:04.130
WOULD BE THE CASE.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.265
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES

16:06.265 --> 16:07.967
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE A

16:07.967 --> 16:09.435
SOURCE OF REPLENISHMENT FOR SOME

16:09.435 --> 16:10.770
OF THESE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN

16:10.770 --> 16:12.438
HIT REALLY HARD.

16:12.438 --> 16:13.906
>> Reporter: BACK IN SITKA,

16:13.906 --> 16:15.174
TROUBLE IS ON THE HORIZON.

16:15.174 --> 16:16.275
IN RECENT MONTHS WATER

16:16.275 --> 16:17.710
TEMPERATURES HERE HAVE BEEN

16:17.710 --> 16:18.911
HIGHER THAN NORMAL, AND THIS

16:18.911 --> 16:20.780
FALL A BAND OF WARM PACIFIC

16:20.780 --> 16:21.948
WATER IS EXPECTED TO TRAVEL

16:21.948 --> 16:23.149
FARTHER NORTH HEATING UP THE

16:23.149 --> 16:24.450
WATERS HERE EVEN MORE.

16:24.450 --> 16:25.885
TO PREPARE, RAIMONDI IS IN

16:25.885 --> 16:27.153
INSTALLING SENSORS WILL MEASURE

16:27.153 --> 16:31.123
THE WATER TEMPERATURE.

16:31.123 --> 16:36.395
>> SO WE'LL GET REALLY GOOD

16:36.395 --> 16:37.830
RECORDS OVER THE NEXT YEAR OF

16:37.830 --> 16:39.632
TEMPERATURE.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.601
THEN WE CAN SEE WHETHER THAT

16:41.601 --> 16:42.935
RELATES TO ANY CHANGE IN THE

16:42.935 --> 16:43.970
DISEASE THAT WE SEE AT THIS

16:43.970 --> 16:49.141
PARTICULAR SITE.

16:49.141 --> 16:50.476
>> Reporter: THAT WAY IF A MASS

16:50.476 --> 16:52.245
DIE-OFF OCCURS, THEY'LL KNOW THE

16:52.245 --> 16:54.580
EXACT OCEAN CONDITIONS.

16:54.580 --> 17:00.086
THERE'S NOTHING THE RESEARCHERS

17:00.086 --> 17:04.223
CAN DO TO PREVENT AN OUTBREAK.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.758
BUT THEY CAN COUNT AND MEASURE

17:05.758 --> 17:07.994
WHAT'S HERE NOW.

17:07.994 --> 17:09.328
THEIR DATA WILL PROVIDE A

17:09.328 --> 17:12.231
CRITICAL POINT OF COMPARISON FOR

17:12.231 --> 17:13.466
WHAT NORMAL STARFISH POPULATIONS

17:13.466 --> 17:14.500
SHOULD BE.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.501
>> IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

17:15.501 --> 17:16.736
THERE, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

17:16.736 --> 17:19.405
LOST.

17:19.405 --> 17:23.109
>> Reporter: THE RESULTS OF THE

17:23.109 --> 17:24.677
ALASKA INTERTIDAL SURVEYS ARE

17:24.677 --> 17:30.149
MIXED.

17:30.149 --> 17:31.784
>> THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST

17:31.784 --> 17:34.520
ONE THAT WE'VE SEEN HERE TODAY.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.389
YOU CAN SEE HERE THE WHOLE AREA

17:36.389 --> 17:38.524
THAT'S DISEASED.

17:38.524 --> 17:40.660
BUT THE GOOD THING IS THAT

17:40.660 --> 17:43.696
THERE'S NOT A REALLY HIGH

17:43.696 --> 17:44.797
PERCENTAGE OF DISEASED ANIMALS.

17:44.797 --> 17:45.765
>> Reporter: WITHOUT KNOWING THE

17:45.765 --> 17:47.033
CAUSE OF THESE OUTBREAKS, IT'S

17:47.033 --> 17:48.301
IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHETHER THE

17:48.301 --> 17:51.203
EPIDEMIC IS NEARLY FINISHED OR

17:51.203 --> 17:53.205
WHETHER ANOTHER MASS DIE-OFF IS

17:53.205 --> 17:55.308
JUST GETTING STARTED.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.208
>> IF WE KNEW WHAT WAS CAUSING

17:56.208 --> 17:57.443
IT, WE WOULD HAVE A MUCH BETTER

17:57.443 --> 17:58.444
UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE WE ARE,

17:58.444 --> 18:01.480
BUT NOT KNOWING WHERE WE ARE IN

18:01.480 --> 18:03.616
THE CHRONOLOGY OF THIS EVENT IS

18:03.616 --> 18:04.951
REALLY FRUSTRATING AND KINDA

18:04.951 --> 18:07.186
SCARY.

18:07.186 --> 18:08.721

18:14.894 --> 18:16.629
CAREFULLY COUNTED JUST DAYS

18:16.629 --> 18:18.798

18:18.798 --> 18:21.100
AND WASTING AWAY.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.668
TIME WILL TELL WHETHER ALASKA

18:22.668 --> 18:24.770
WILL BE A STARFISH GRAVEYARD OR

18:24.770 --> 18:26.939
A REFUGE.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.244
WHY SCIENTISTS THINK ALASKA MAY

18:32.244 --> 18:34.246
HOLD THE KEY TO REPLENISHING

18:34.246 --> 18:35.748

18:42.388 --> 18:43.622
NOW, WE'VE BEEN HEARING REPORTS

18:43.622 --> 18:45.358
FROM AFRICA THAT THOSE HUNDREDS

18:45.358 --> 18:46.425
OF SCHOOLGIRLS WHO WERE

18:46.425 --> 18:48.027
ABDUCTED BY BOKO HARAM

18:48.027 --> 18:49.228
EXTREMISTS LAST SPRING WERE

18:49.228 --> 18:50.596
ABOUT TO BE RELEASED.

18:50.596 --> 18:52.031
BUT SO FAR, AT LEAST, IT HASN'T

18:52.031 --> 18:53.065
HAPPENED.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.266
AND, ACCORDING TO REPORTS,

18:54.266 --> 18:55.468
ANOTHER 30 ADOLESCENTS WERE

18:55.468 --> 18:57.470
ABDUCTED IN NIGERIA TODAY.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.838
FOR THE LATEST, WE ARE JOINED

18:58.838 --> 19:00.706
NOW VIA SKYPE FROM LAGOS,

19:00.706 --> 19:01.774
NIGERIA, BY TIM COCKS OF

19:02.608 --> 19:04.377
ABOUT THE DEAL, WHERE DOES IT

19:04.377 --> 19:05.811
STAND?

19:05.811 --> 19:07.546
>> WELL, THEY ARE STILL IN TALKS

19:07.546 --> 19:09.882
IN CHAD.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.018
IT WAS TO BE EXPECTED I THINK

19:12.018 --> 19:14.286
EVERYONE FELT THE GOVERNMENT WAS

19:14.286 --> 19:16.922
BEING WILDLY OVER OPTIMISTIC IN

19:16.922 --> 19:18.257
SAYING WE WOULD HAVE THE GIRLS

19:18.257 --> 19:20.793
OUT BY LAST MONDAY.

19:20.793 --> 19:24.296
THE -- IT IS EXTREMELY

19:24.296 --> 19:26.999
COMPLICATED SYSTEMS THE WAY

19:26.999 --> 19:28.200
BOKO HARAM WORKS.

19:28.200 --> 19:32.605
THEY HAVE MULTIPLE FACTIONS, IT

19:32.605 --> 19:35.341
IS DIFFICULT TO GET THEM ALL TO

19:35.341 --> 19:36.709
DO WHAT ONE PARTICULAR FACTION

19:36.709 --> 19:38.110
WANTS THEM TO DO.

19:38.110 --> 19:39.578
THE GOVERNMENTS SAY THEY

19:39.578 --> 19:42.014
ARE NEGOTIATING WITH BONA FIDE

19:42.014 --> 19:44.417
BOKO HARAM MILITANTS AND THAT

19:44.417 --> 19:46.252
THEY SHOW WILLINGNESS TO RELEASE

19:46.252 --> 19:48.654
THE GIRLS BUT IT IS STILL NOT

19:48.654 --> 19:50.122
CLEAR WHETHER THAT FACTION HAS

19:50.122 --> 19:51.424
ALL OF THE GIRLS OR HAVE SOME OF

19:51.424 --> 19:52.725
THE GIRLS OR WHETHER IT HAS

19:52.725 --> 19:53.926
ACCESS TO ANOTHER FACTION THAT

19:53.926 --> 19:54.860
IS HOLDING THEM.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.695
THERE IS SO MUCH MYSTERY

19:56.695 --> 19:57.830
SURROUNDING THIS WHOLE THING

19:57.830 --> 19:59.999
THAT IT IS ACTUALLY VERY

19:59.999 --> 20:01.400
DIFFICULT TO SAY WHETHER OR NOT

20:01.400 --> 20:03.002
THE GIRLS WILL BE OUT IN A WEEK

20:03.002 --> 20:04.837
OR WHETHER THIS WHOLE THING

20:04.837 --> 20:05.638
COULD JUST FALL APART.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.673
>> SO WHILE THEY TALK ABOUT

20:07.673 --> 20:09.675
NEGOTIATING THE RELEASE OF THESE

20:09.675 --> 20:10.976
200 THAT THE WORLD PAID

20:10.976 --> 20:12.778
ATTENTION TO, THERE HAVE BEEN

20:12.778 --> 20:14.780
SUBSEQUENT KIDNAPPINGS?

20:14.780 --> 20:16.215
>> THERE HAVE BEEN, YES.

20:16.215 --> 20:19.685
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT THE

20:19.685 --> 20:20.719
KIDNAPPINGS OF THE, ARE THE

20:20.719 --> 20:22.321
WORKS OF CRIMINAL GROUPS WHICH

20:22.321 --> 20:24.223
MAY BE TRUE BECAUSE OF COURSE IN

20:24.223 --> 20:26.492
THIS AREA, WHICH HAS NOW BECOME

20:26.492 --> 20:28.794
SO FLAW LESS, THE AREA BETWEEN

20:28.794 --> 20:30.663
CHAD, CAMEROON AND NIGERIA, UP

20:30.663 --> 20:33.599
IN THE NORTHEAST NIGERIA ARE SO

20:33.599 --> 20:35.167
LAWLESS THERE IS A LOT OF

20:35.167 --> 20:37.870
ASSOCIATED CRIMINALITY WHICH THE

20:37.870 --> 20:39.972
BOKO HARAM MILITANTS USE TO FUND

20:39.972 --> 20:41.874
THEIR OPERATION.

20:41.874 --> 20:42.875
IT PROBABLY WASN'T THAT

20:42.875 --> 20:45.077
SURPRISING THAT THE GOVERNMENT

20:45.077 --> 20:46.378
ANNOUNCE ADD CEASE-FIRE THAT

20:46.378 --> 20:47.613
SOME GROUP OR ANOTHER WOULD GO

20:47.613 --> 20:49.181
ON THE RAMPAGE AND SAY NO WE ARE

20:49.181 --> 20:50.349
NOT AGREEING TO THIS.

20:50.349 --> 20:51.517
BUT WHAT MATTERS TO THESE FOLKS

20:51.517 --> 20:53.719
IS WHETHER THOSE GIRLS ARE BEING

20:53.719 --> 20:55.921
HELD BY THE FACTION THAT ARE IN

20:55.921 --> 20:56.822
CHAD, IN TALKS WITH THE

20:56.822 --> 20:58.257
GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT

20:58.257 --> 20:59.925
SAYS WE WOULDN'T BE HERE IF WE

20:59.925 --> 21:01.193
WEREN'T PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT IS

21:01.193 --> 21:02.261
THE CASE.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.429
>> AT THESE NEGOTIATIONS WHO

21:03.429 --> 21:04.263
REPRESENTS WHO HERE?

21:04.263 --> 21:05.464
I MEAN, IS GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY

21:05.464 --> 21:07.066
SIT ACROSS THE TABLE FROM

21:07.066 --> 21:08.534
BOKO HARAM?

21:08.534 --> 21:11.203
>> WELL, THERE IS A GUY WHO

21:11.203 --> 21:15.107
CLAIMS THAT HE IS THE GENERAL OF

21:15.107 --> 21:18.244
BOKO HARAM, THIS IS, QUITE A FEW

21:18.244 --> 21:19.945
ALARM BELLS, HIS NAME HAS NEVER

21:19.945 --> 21:21.580
BEEN HEARD OF BEFORE.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.015
WHAT REALLY MATTERS TO THESE

21:23.015 --> 21:26.318
TALKS IS WHETHER THIS MAN CAN

21:26.318 --> 21:29.622
ACTUALLY GET THOSE GIRLS FREED,

21:29.622 --> 21:31.524
AND THE FEELING IS THAT IT IS

21:31.524 --> 21:32.424
STILL VERY MUCH A LONG SHOT.

21:32.424 --> 21:33.826
>> AND WHO REPRESENTS THE

21:33.826 --> 21:34.994
GOVERNMENT IN THIS CONVERSATION?

21:34.994 --> 21:36.629
>> IT IS ALL VERY HUSH, HUSH

21:36.629 --> 21:37.630
ACTUALLY.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.098
THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WANT TO

21:39.098 --> 21:41.033
GIVE A WHOLE LOT AWAY, WHICH IS

21:41.033 --> 21:42.701
WHY IT WAS ACTUALLY CONSIDERED

21:42.701 --> 21:43.936
TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A

21:43.936 --> 21:45.671
MISTAKE IN ANNOUNCING THE

21:45.671 --> 21:47.873
CEASE-FIRE BECAUSE BEFORE THEY

21:47.873 --> 21:49.842
DID THAT, IT HAD BEEN QUIET FOR

21:49.842 --> 21:50.643
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND SUDDENLY

21:50.643 --> 21:52.611
THE VIOLENCE STARTS UP AGAIN SO

21:52.611 --> 21:53.779
I THINK THE THING IS VERY MUCH

21:53.779 --> 21:56.682
SHROUDED IN MYSTERY, WE HAVE AT

21:56.682 --> 21:58.050
THE MOMENT TRYING TO COVER

21:58.050 --> 22:00.686
THEM, BUT THEY ARE VERY MUCH

22:00.686 --> 22:03.956
LIMITING ACCESS TO JOURNALISTS,

22:03.956 --> 22:05.257
THE INFORMATION, UNTIL THEY

22:05.257 --> 22:07.126
HAVE SOMETHING SOLID THEY CAN

22:07.126 --> 22:08.460
PRESENT AND SAY, YES, WE HAVE

22:08.460 --> 22:10.496
MADE -- WE HAVE HAD SUCCESS.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.932
>> ALL RIGHT, TIM COCKS OF

23:33.746 --> 23:35.481
CONCUSSIONS."

23:35.481 --> 23:37.750
CANNW ADDED THIS: "THERE ARE SO

23:37.750 --> 23:39.385
MANY OTHER WAYS TO LEARN THE

23:39.385 --> 23:41.920
VALUE OF HARD WORK AND TEAMWORK.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.088
ANOTHER THOUGHT, HOW MUCH OF

23:43.088 --> 23:44.423
PLAYING SPORTS IS ACTUALLY

23:44.423 --> 23:45.924
DRIVEN BY THE PARENT RATHER THAN

23:45.924 --> 23:47.726
THE CHILD?"

23:47.726 --> 23:49.528
STINGER SUGGESTED THIS: "FOR

23:49.528 --> 23:50.796
STARTERS, BAN HEADING THE

23:50.796 --> 23:52.498
BALL WHEN THE GOALIE PUNTS IT.

23:52.498 --> 23:53.799
THE BALL IS TRAVELING FAST, AND

23:53.799 --> 23:55.167
IT'S A USELESS HEADER ANYWAY,

23:55.167 --> 23:56.268
RARELY DOES SOMEONE ACTUALLY

23:56.268 --> 23:57.436
HEAD IT TO A TEAMMATE

23:57.436 --> 23:58.570
INTENTIONALLY.

23:58.570 --> 23:59.738
EVENTUALLY I THINK ALL HEADING

23:59.738 --> 24:01.407
WILL HAVE TO BE BANNED."

24:01.407 --> 24:03.175
FINALLY, CANDID ONE SAID THIS:

24:03.175 --> 24:04.443
"AS THIS SEGMENT SO FAIRLY

24:04.443 --> 24:06.078
DEPICTS, THERE WON'T BE AN EASY

24:06.078 --> 24:07.246
ANSWER TO THESE KINDS OF

24:07.246 --> 24:08.681
QUANDARIES AS WE ENCOUNTER THEM

24:08.681 --> 24:10.249
DURING PARENTHOOD."

24:29.835 --> 24:31.737
UKRAINE, A PRO-RUSSIAN PARTY GOT

24:31.737 --> 24:33.772
SEVEN PERCENT OF THE VOTE.

24:33.772 --> 24:35.341
AT LEAST TWO ROCKETS WERE FIRED

24:35.341 --> 24:36.575
INTO THE HEAVILY PROTECTED GREEN

24:36.575 --> 24:39.578
ZONE IN KABUL, AFGHANISTAN, THEY

24:39.578 --> 24:40.346
LANDED NEAR THE U.S. EMBASSY

24:40.346 --> 24:41.780

24:41.780 --> 24:43.382
CONSUMING LARGE AMOUNTS OF
