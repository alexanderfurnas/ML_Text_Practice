THE REASON WHY HE WAS HARASSED  

11:57.001 --> 11:59.630
CONFUSION CAUSE AND EFFECT.     
THE REASON WHY HE WAS HARASSED  
BY THE SECURITY SERVICES IS     

11:59.632 --> 12:03.092
THE REASON WHY HE WAS HARASSED  
BY THE SECURITY SERVICES IS     
BECAUSE EVEN BEFORE THE CONFLICT

12:03.095 --> 12:04.892
BY THE SECURITY SERVICES IS     
BECAUSE EVEN BEFORE THE CONFLICT
STARTED, HE TRIED TO GO TO EAST
