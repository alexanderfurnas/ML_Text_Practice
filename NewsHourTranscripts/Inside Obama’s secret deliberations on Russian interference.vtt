HARI SREENIVASAN: There are
new revelations today about
how President Obama learned of

00:04.566 --> 00:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia's efforts to tip
the 2016 election in
Donald Trump's favor, and
how his administration

00:09.433 --> 00:11.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
responded.

00:11.466 --> 00:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke a short time ago to
Greg Miller, national security
correspondent for The Washington

00:14.333 --> 00:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Post, who co-authored a lengthy
investigation that the paper
published today on this topic.

00:19.066 --> 00:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I began by asking about
the role Putin played.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG MILLER, National Security
Correspondent, The Washington
Post: In early August, the

00:24.566 --> 00:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CIA comes to the White House
with a really remarkable
piece of intelligence.

00:29.066 --> 00:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's drawn on sourcing deep
inside the Russian government.

00:32.400 --> 00:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It establishes that Putin
himself is directing
this operation, this
election interference

00:37.366 --> 00:41.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that is just unfolding
in the United States.

00:41.966 --> 00:44.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But it goes one step
farther than that.

00:44.300 --> 00:47.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's what's
most interesting and
extraordinary to me.

00:47.733 --> 00:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It also captures
Putin's instructions
on what the objectives
of this operation are.

00:54.966 --> 00:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He identifies those objectives
as denigrating, damaging Hillary
Clinton, trying to help defeat

01:01.166 --> 01:04.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
her, and trying to help
elect Donald Trump.

01:04.366 --> 01:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You also
point out the levels of
secrecy and precaution
taken by the administration

01:11.333 --> 01:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the intelligence agencies
in how this information gets
to the president and even

01:14.166 --> 01:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how people need to talk about
it and share information.

01:17.633 --> 01:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG MILLER: Yes, it's really
remarkable, the precautions
that the administration was

01:23.500 --> 01:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
taking with this information.

01:25.500 --> 01:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This intel, when it's delivered
to the White House, is brought
by courier in an envelope

01:31.466 --> 01:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with restricted markings on it.

01:33.500 --> 01:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's eyes only, which means
it can only be shared with
the four people who are named

01:39.933 --> 01:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the envelope, President Obama
and three of his senior aides.

01:42.533 --> 01:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They then they have,
when they're done reading
this thing, put it back
in the envelope, send

01:46.700 --> 01:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it straight back to the CIA.

01:48.833 --> 01:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It sets in motion a series of
meetings, high-level meetings at
the White House in the Situation

01:54.466 --> 01:57.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Room.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only four senior officials
are initially allowed
to participate, although
that circle begins

02:00.300 --> 02:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to widen in the ensuing weeks.

02:02.300 --> 02:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even there, there are things
that I didn't know about how
the White House works that,

02:09.266 --> 02:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
apparently, in the Situation
Room, there are video cameras
that send feeds to other offices

02:15.333 --> 02:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the White House, so that
others sitting at their desks
can monitor what's happening

02:18.500 --> 02:20.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in that room.

02:20.033 --> 02:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All those feeds were shut off
for all of these discussions.

02:22.966 --> 02:27.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The only time that had
ever happened before
was in the run-up to
the bin Laden operation

02:27.433 --> 02:29.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2011.

02:29.533 --> 02:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk
a little bit about what the
Obama administration tried

02:31.000 --> 02:32.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do about it.

02:32.700 --> 02:37.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They debated a menu of
options, so to speak,
for quite some time.

02:37.733 --> 02:39.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GREG MILLER: Right.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, they debated and
debated and debated.

02:40.933 --> 02:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That went on for months after
this bombshell intelligence
report from the CIA.

02:47.533 --> 02:49.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They got off to a fast.

02:49.466 --> 02:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are groups, NSC,
interagency groups that are
convening at the White House and

02:56.300 --> 02:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kicking around ideas that are
really aggressive, sector-wide
economic sanctions that could

03:01.700 --> 03:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put a dent in Russia's economy,
cyber-retaliation that could
take portions of Russia's power

03:07.166 --> 03:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grid or other targets
offline for short
periods, even releasing
embarrassing information on

03:12.733 --> 03:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Putin, the way he was sort
of accused of orchestrating
embarrassing leaks
about Hillary Clinton.

03:19.466 --> 03:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
None of those end up surviving
this debate process that goes
well past the election deep

03:26.866 --> 03:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into November and December.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You
also highlight kind of
bureaucratic hurdles.

03:31.100 --> 03:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Department of Homeland
Security goes out to
states that could be
affected by this hacking

03:35.233 --> 03:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and says, we would like to help,
but the voting infrastructure in
America is not deemed critical

03:41.833 --> 03:43.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
enough?

03:43.866 --> 03:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG MILLER: Yes, and this
is one of those cases where
the hyper-partisanship of our

03:47.033 --> 03:52.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
country now really works
against our security
interests in many ways.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So this is a case where
the Obama administration
is just trying to reach
out to state officials,

03:59.866 --> 04:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying Russia's attacking
us, we are worried about what
might happen on Election Day.

04:05.500 --> 04:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to try to help
make sure that all of our
voting systems are secure.

04:09.433 --> 04:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can run scans.

04:10.633 --> 04:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We can try to be
of assistance here.

04:12.933 --> 04:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Republicans in particular,
state officials, resist this and
see it as sort of an overreach,

04:21.433 --> 04:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an attempted federal takeover
of state authorities,
and argue against it.

04:28.466 --> 04:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You know,
you point out that this is
in the backdrop of a climate

04:34.266 --> 04:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where there is an underlying
assumption that Hillary Clinton
is going to win, where Donald

04:37.200 --> 04:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump has gone out and
said the election is
going to be rigged anyway.

04:40.566 --> 04:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And really not until after
the election does the Obama
administration start to put all

04:46.300 --> 04:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these pieces together.

04:48.933 --> 04:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG MILLER: Yes, I don't
think you can overestimate
the importance of that,
because the assumption

04:53.766 --> 04:56.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the White House and
as well as across media
organizations like ours
and across the country,

04:58.933 --> 05:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
frankly, there was just an
assumption that we were looking
at a Clinton -- a coming Clinton

05:02.566 --> 05:05.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

05:05.066 --> 05:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, inside the White
House, their deliberations
are, well, this is all
important, but we have

05:08.266 --> 05:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
got to -- we're going to
have time to deal with
this after the election.

05:11.533 --> 05:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, if we don't finish
dealing with it, well, the
Clinton administration certainly

05:15.700 --> 05:18.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
can.

05:18.300 --> 05:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, they don't
want to take any action
leading up to the election
that would be perceived

05:21.600 --> 05:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as interfering politically
to help Hillary Clinton.

05:25.266 --> 05:28.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're worried that
that would contaminate
her expected triumph.

05:28.866 --> 05:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Greg Miller,
the reporting is fantastic,
you and your colleagues, Adam

05:32.400 --> 05:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Entous and Ellen Nakashima.

05:33.966 --> 05:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thanks so much for joining us.

05:34.966 --> 05:35.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GREG MILLER: Thank you.
