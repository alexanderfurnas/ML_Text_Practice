UDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:07.541 --> 00:11.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
on to New Hampshire.
Presidential candidates

00:11.478 --> 00:18.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
face high stakes in next week's
primary after
Iowa voters hand a surprising
victory to Ted

00:18.585 --> 00:21.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cruz and a slim win to Hillary
Clinton.

00:21.822 --> 00:27.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Wednesday: Is
Oklahoma's free pre-kindergarten
program worth

00:27.461 --> 00:29.229 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the cost?

00:29.329 --> 00:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM GORMLEY, Georgetown
University: In
Tulsa, the single best predictor
of a child's

00:33.233 --> 00:40.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
verbal test skills is not race,
or income,
but whether that child was in
pre-K the previous

00:40.474 --> 00:42.242 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

00:42.342 --> 00:45.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And looking into
The New York
Times' archives of
never-before-published

00:45.913 --> 00:47.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
photographs in black history.

00:47.881 --> 00:55.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:55.956 --> 00:58.725 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:58.825 --> 01:09.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Results from the
2016 Iowa caucuses
are finally official.
Republicans wrapped

01:10.003 --> 01:15.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up their race last night. And,
today, Democrat
Hillary Clinton finally squeaked
out a win

01:15.375 --> 01:21.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of less than three-tenths of a
percent. By
then, the candidates had lit out
for New England.

01:21.114 --> 01:29.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New day, new battleground. The
candidates
have already moved on to the
Granite State.

01:29.222 --> 01:34.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a rally today in Keene,
Democrat Bernie
Sanders declared his strong
showing at the

01:34.661 --> 01:37.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Iowa caucuses was a clear
turning point.

01:37.731 --> 01:42.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Last night, we began the
political revolution,

01:42.402 --> 01:47.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not just in Iowa, not just in
New Hampshire,
but all over this country.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:49.142 --> 01:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But although the
latest polls
show the Vermont senator well
ahead, it was

01:52.980 --> 01:59.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton who won the
state in 2008.
Today, in Nashua, she kicked off
her effort

01:59.252 --> 02:01.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to score a repeat victory.

02:01.321 --> 02:04.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
It is great to be here with all
of you, and

02:05.025 --> 02:11.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am so thrilled that I am
coming to New Hampshire
after winning Iowa.

02:11.198 --> 02:12.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:13.066 --> 02:19.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: With last night's
razor-thin Iowa
win made official only at
midday, Clinton

02:19.673 --> 02:24.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
made her case to loyal
supporters and cable
news audiences.

02:24.411 --> 02:29.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The top three finishers in
Iowa's Republican
caucuses also returned to New
Hampshire today.

02:29.449 --> 02:32.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
God bless the great state of New
Hampshire.

02:32.152 --> 02:37.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Ted Cruz, who swept
past both
Donald Trump and Marco Rubio,
said he is convinced

02:37.557 --> 02:39.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he can duplicate his Iowa
success in New Hampshire.

02:39.926 --> 02:46.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: Both states take
your responsibility
seriously. There are millions of
Americans

02:46.400 --> 02:51.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are counting on each and
every one of
you to vet the candidates, not
to listen to

02:51.772 --> 02:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the empty talk, not to listen to
the campaign
promises, but instead to look us
in the eye,

02:59.780 --> 03:02.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and determine who's telling
truth and who's
blowing smoke.

03:02.983 --> 03:08.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Second-place Donald
Trump said
in tweets he had not been given
credit for

03:08.188 --> 03:14.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what he accomplished in Iowa. He
begins his
swing in New Hampshire with a
rally this evening.

03:14.161 --> 03:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marco Rubio, whose strong third
exceeded expectations,
hit the ground this morning,
trying to turn

03:20.100 --> 03:25.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these Manchester breakfast
diners into supporters.
He told reporters, last night
was proof that

03:26.073 --> 03:27.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his message had appeal.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
I can grow the conservative
movement. I can

03:30.343 --> 03:34.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take our message to people who
have not voted
for us before, and bring them on
and into

03:34.314 --> 03:36.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the conservative movement, and
that means
we win the election and we win
the future.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEN. TIM SCOTT (R), South
Carolina: Join me.
Vote for Marco Rubio.

03:39.753 --> 03:44.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Florida senator
also rolled
out the endorsement of South
Carolina Senator

03:44.124 --> 03:51.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tim Scott, whose state holds the
third GOP
nominating contest two Saturdays
from now.

03:51.198 --> 03:56.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Three other so-called
establishment candidates
got a head start stumping in the
state. John

03:56.369 --> 04:01.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kasich has been there since the
weekend, and
Jeb Bush made the trip even
before Iowans

04:01.208 --> 04:02.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
started caucusing.

04:03.009 --> 04:07.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So did Chris Christie. At a town
hall today,
he took aim at both Cruz and
Rubio.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ),
Presidential Candidate:
Worse yet, what if we won with
someone who

04:10.951 --> 04:12.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wasn't ready to be president?

04:13.019 --> 04:16.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's a sign that,
for those candidates
who've staked their campaigns on
the New Hampshire

04:16.623 --> 04:21.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
primary, this could be yet
another make-or-break
week.

04:21.361 --> 04:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will have a full analysis of
where the
presidential race stands now
after the news

04:27.200 --> 04:29.002 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

04:29.102 --> 04:33.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street took
another beating
today as oil fell back below $30
a barrel,

04:33.607 --> 04:39.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Chevron and ExxonMobil
turned in their
worst quarters since 2002. The
Dow Jones industrial

04:39.980 --> 04:48.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average lost 295 points to close
at 16153.
The Nasdaq fell more than 100
points, and

04:48.822 --> 04:50.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the S&amp;P 500 dropped 36.

04:50.957 --> 04:55.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: President Obama held
a relatively
rare meeting with the top House
and Senate

04:55.795 --> 05:00.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans today, but it's not
clear they
accomplished much. The White
House hoped to

05:00.734 --> 05:03.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lay out a bipartisan agenda.

05:03.103 --> 05:09.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, beforehand, even as he
spoke of cooperation,
House Speaker Paul Ryan said
he's glad that

05:09.209 --> 05:13.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- quote -- "The days of Barack
Obama's presidency
are numbered."

05:13.380 --> 05:15.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
We get along with each other
personally. We

05:15.949 --> 05:20.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agree to disagree on these
things, and so
we will put those disagreements
in check,

05:20.320 --> 05:24.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see where the common ground is,
go act on
that common ground to get some
things done.

05:24.591 --> 05:30.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then on the big issues that
we don't agree,
we believe we have an obligation
to our constituents

05:30.230 --> 05:32.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and our fellow citizens to offer
alternatives,
and that's what we're going to
be doing this

05:32.933 --> 05:34.834 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

05:34.935 --> 05:38.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell
said the two sides can work on
stopping the

05:38.438 --> 05:41.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heroin epidemic and containing
the Zika virus.

05:41.541 --> 05:47.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Iraq, there's
word that
thousands of civilians trapped
inside Fallujah

05:47.147 --> 05:52.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are running out of food and
basic medicine.
The governor of Anbar province
appealed today

05:52.619 --> 05:58.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for the U.S. coalition to
airdrop humanitarian
aid into the city. Security
forces are trying

05:58.725 --> 06:01.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to retake Fallujah from Islamic
State militants.

06:02.028 --> 06:08.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Talks aimed at
ending Syria's
civil war appeared to sputter in
Geneva today.

06:08.134 --> 06:12.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Syrian government refused to
meet with
the opposition, and the rebels
condemned a

06:12.272 --> 06:17.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
government offensive near
Aleppo, Syria's
largest city. The assault, aided
by Russian

06:17.577 --> 06:22.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airstrikes, captured a village
north of Aleppo.
Advances by government troops
are now threatening

06:22.916 --> 06:24.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rebel supply lines there.

06:24.784 --> 06:29.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The top American
commander
in Afghanistan is warning the
U.S. needs to

06:29.456 --> 06:34.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make a longer-term commitment.
At a House
hearing today, Army General John
Campbell

06:35.061 --> 06:38.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said that Afghan forces are
plagued by poor
leadership.

06:38.298 --> 06:41.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEN. JOHN CAMPBELL, Commander of
U.S. Forces
in Afghanistan: Now more than
ever, the United

06:41.534 --> 06:48.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
States shouldn't waver on
Afghanistan. Afghanistan
is at an inflection point. I
believe, if we

06:48.742 --> 06:56.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do not make deliberate, measured
adjustments,
2016 is at risk of being no
better and possibly

06:56.583 --> 06:58.485 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
worse than 2015.

06:58.585 --> 07:04.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama's
current plan
calls for cutting U.S. troop
numbers in Afghanistan

07:04.124 --> 07:08.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from 9,800 to 5,500 before he
leaves office.

07:08.862 --> 07:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The top Marine and
Army generals
called today for women to
register for the

07:13.933 --> 07:18.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
draft. The secretaries of the
Navy and the
Air Force declined to go that
far. All four

07:18.705 --> 07:23.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spoke at a Senate hearing on the
Pentagon
decision to open all combat
roles to women.

07:23.810 --> 07:29.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nine more
migrants have drowned
off Western Turkey, in rough
winter seas as

07:29.282 --> 07:34.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they tried to reach Greece. And
the International
Organization for Migration
announced today

07:34.554 --> 07:41.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that more than 360 people died
in the attempt
last month. The IOM also
reported more than

07:42.028 --> 07:48.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
62,000 migrants managed to make
it to Europe
in January. About one-third were
children

07:48.535 --> 07:50.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
traveling alone.

07:50.403 --> 07:55.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A winter storm
brought here new
dangers across much of the U.S.
today, from

07:55.141 --> 08:00.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New Mexico to Michigan, with
blizzard warnings,
tornado alerts and more. In
Iowa, the snow

08:00.347 --> 08:06.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came a day after the Democratic
and Republican
caucuses. Roads were so slick in
some places

08:06.319 --> 08:09.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that even the snowplows had
trouble making
their way.

08:09.422 --> 08:14.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There might be
some good news
for the winter-weary on this
Groundhog Day.

08:14.327 --> 08:20.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The human handlers of
Punxsutawney Phil say
that Pennsylvania's most famous
furry rodent

08:20.233 --> 08:25.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
failed to see his shadow this
morning. That's
supposed to mean an early
spring. Groundhogs

08:25.905 --> 08:32.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in New York, Georgia and
Wisconsin agreed,
but two in Michigan and Ohio
forecast six

08:32.345 --> 08:33.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more weeks of winter.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, who do we believe?

08:35.014 --> 08:37.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We don't believe any
of them.
I'm very skeptical about this.

08:38.051 --> 08:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
high stakes
get higher ahead of New
Hampshire's primary;

08:43.089 --> 08:49.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. moves to squash a
growing Isis threat
in Libya; another major city's
police force

08:49.362 --> 08:59.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
goes under review; and much
more.

08:59.639 --> 09:08.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Iowa caucuses
are now part
of history, and the eyes of the
political

09:08.448 --> 09:10.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
world turn to the Granite State.

09:10.984 --> 09:16.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Susan Page is Washington bureau
chief for
USA Today, and she joins us from
Manchester,

09:16.189 --> 09:21.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New Hampshire. And Reid Wilson
is chief political
correspondent for the politics
and polling

09:21.628 --> 09:24.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Web site Morning Consult.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome you both to the
program.

09:26.666 --> 09:31.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's talk about how this
race changes
now that Iowa's behind us,
Democrats first.

09:31.838 --> 09:34.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, Susan, let me start with
you.

09:34.707 --> 09:39.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Who -- does anybody have an
advantage coming
out of Iowa, because you have
got this virtual

09:39.479 --> 09:42.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tie between Hillary Clinton and
Bernie Sanders?

09:42.248 --> 09:44.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
Yes, you know, you do have a
virtual tie,

09:45.084 --> 09:49.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but at her very first event in
New Hampshire
this morning, Hillary Clinton
described herself

09:49.289 --> 09:52.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a winner, said she had won
there and lost
there, and it was better to win.

09:52.992 --> 09:56.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you may just win by one
point, but in
the Clinton campaign's view, a
win is a win

09:56.529 --> 10:01.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a win. And I suppose that's
helpful. On
the other hand, also a boost for
Sanders supporters.

10:01.534 --> 10:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, as Senator Sanders
pointed out, a
couple weeks ago, you could not
have predicted

10:06.206 --> 10:10.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he would basically have
gone head to
head with Hillary Clinton and
tied her in

10:10.210 --> 10:11.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iowa.

10:11.744 --> 10:13.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think both campaigns came
out of Iowa
with some bragging rights.

10:13.813 --> 10:15.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Would you see
that the same
way, Reid?

10:15.748 --> 10:18.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON, Morning Consult: I
do. I think
both campaigns had a relatively
good night.

10:18.718 --> 10:23.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the results we saw forecast
some challenges
in the future.

10:23.122 --> 10:26.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders is going to have
to branch
out and expand his base,
especially among

10:27.060 --> 10:30.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more traditional Democrats.
Hillary Clinton
is going to have to find a way
to tap into

10:30.830 --> 10:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the youthful excitement
that Sanders
is generating.

10:33.466 --> 10:37.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk,
Reid, about
Bernie Sanders. And you're
saying he's got

10:37.103 --> 10:41.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to branch out, but right now he
has got a
lead in New Hampshire. So, how
does that translate

10:41.608 --> 10:43.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there and then on into South
Carolina?

10:43.610 --> 10:46.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Neighbors of New
Hampshire, whether
they're from Massachusetts or
Vermont, have

10:46.813 --> 10:49.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
traditionally done very well in
New Hampshire
primaries.

10:49.616 --> 10:54.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, beyond that, we have
essentially dealt
with the two states in the early
nominating

10:54.954 --> 11:00.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contests that are the whitest,
that are the
most likely to vote for Sanders.
And then

11:00.627 --> 11:05.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down the road, we get into
populations in
South Carolina and Nevada,
heavily Hispanic,

11:05.665 --> 11:10.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heavily African-American, both
of whom are
groups among whom Hillary
Clinton does exceedingly

11:10.370 --> 11:12.105 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, how do you
see the challenges
that Bernie Sanders now
confronts?

11:14.908 --> 11:20.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Well, Bernie Sanders
would like
to win big in New Hampshire next
week. There's

11:20.980 --> 11:22.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nothing like a victory to put
wind in your
sails.

11:23.049 --> 11:27.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I totally agree with Reid.
He then faces
a big problem when he goes to
Nevada, with

11:27.954 --> 11:32.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its big Hispanic population,
South Carolina,
with its big African-American
population,

11:33.026 --> 11:36.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
groups with whom the Clintons
have a long
history and a lot of support.

11:36.329 --> 11:41.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Clinton campaign thinks,
even if they
lose in New Hampshire, which is
the most likely

11:41.434 --> 11:45.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scenario, she can go to South
Carolina and
then into the Southern states on
Super Tuesday

11:46.072 --> 11:50.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and have a kind of firewall,
where she's guaranteed
to beat Bernie Sanders, because
he has not

11:50.577 --> 11:53.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yet managed no get significant
support among
African-Americans.

11:53.947 --> 11:58.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Susan, how
do you see
Hillary Clinton's principal
challenge right

11:58.217 --> 11:59.986 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now?

12:00.086 --> 12:03.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Well, here's the
questions that
I think some Democrats have
about Hillary

12:04.057 --> 12:08.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton: Was this just kind of a
little glitch,
that a combination of
circumstances that made

12:08.695 --> 12:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iowa so close, or is there
something flawed
about her as a candidate that is
going to

12:13.433 --> 12:17.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
create problems down the road in
other states
where she ought to do well?

12:17.103 --> 12:21.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think we can know
that for sure
until she faces those contests
in other states.

12:22.008 --> 12:25.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It may just be that first two
states are really
hard for Hillary Clinton. It may
be that they're

12:25.645 --> 12:29.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seeing signs that she's not a
great candidate.
And how do they fix that when
they're down

12:29.515 --> 12:35.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to two candidates and the other
one is a candidate
who is basically not as
acceptable to the

12:35.154 --> 12:36.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Democratic establishment?

12:36.189 --> 12:38.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's turn to the
Republicans.

12:38.424 --> 12:43.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reid Wilson, Ted Cruz clearly
got a lift coming
out of Iowa. Where does that
take him? What

12:44.063 --> 12:45.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
does that mean for him?

12:45.932 --> 12:51.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: That puts him on a
relatively
sound path to the nomination. It
is a better

12:51.337 --> 12:55.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
path than, I think, a lot of
other candidates
have. Ted Cruz really needed to
win Iowa.

12:55.942 --> 13:01.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he hadn't won, his campaign
likely would
have collapsed, because he's
going to face

13:01.114 --> 13:04.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some serious challenges in New
Hampshire,
where voters are a lot more
centrist.

13:04.884 --> 13:09.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then moving forward,
assuming that New
Hampshire condenses the rest of
the Republican

13:09.589 --> 13:14.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
field, it will essentially be a
three-way
race between whatever
establishment candidate

13:14.994 --> 13:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes out of New Hampshire,
Donald Trump,
and Ted Cruz. He's going to need
as much momentum

13:20.166 --> 13:24.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as he can possibly get. And he
got a big lift
by beating expectations on
Monday.

13:24.103 --> 13:25.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

13:26.005 --> 13:30.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Susan, how do you see the job
that Ted Cruz
has now, and who, what -- and
what is his

13:30.209 --> 13:32.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
big competition now?

13:32.111 --> 13:35.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: You know what's
amazing is, we're
talking about Ted Cruz, and we
didn't first

13:35.248 --> 13:38.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talk about Donald Trump. I don't
think that's
happened in the past six months
when we have

13:38.685 --> 13:40.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talked about the Republican
field.

13:40.553 --> 13:44.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that tells you what a big
victory that
was for Ted Cruz last night.
Really, he was

13:44.891 --> 13:52.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- he had been criticized by the
popular Republican
governor of Iowa, Terry
Branstad. He had come

13:52.465 --> 13:56.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out against ethanol subsidies.
That's like
sacred ground when it comes to
Iowa. And he

13:56.869 --> 14:00.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still managed to win there, big
victory.

14:00.139 --> 14:04.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he still faces Donald Trump,
and we don't
know yet whether Donald Trump
can take a punch.

14:04.444 --> 14:09.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump has had this
phenomenal rise
since he announced his
candidacy, rising in

14:09.115 --> 14:12.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the polls, becoming more and
more acceptable
to more and more Republicans.
The question

14:12.885 --> 14:16.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was, could he deliver when
people actually
had to go and vote? And he
didn't do that

14:16.556 --> 14:18.224 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last night.

14:18.324 --> 14:22.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will he pick himself up and go
on in states
like New Hampshire to come back?
That, we

14:22.328 --> 14:23.796 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
don't know yet.

14:23.896 --> 14:26.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
what Donald
Trump needs to do now, Reid?

14:26.199 --> 14:30.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REID WILSON: The aura of
inevitability is
no longer with Donald Trump. His
whole brand

14:30.269 --> 14:32.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is about winning and success.

14:32.138 --> 14:35.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as Susan mentioned, the
first time he
had an opportunity to actually
convert, he

14:35.975 --> 14:41.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't. So, Trump really needs
some kind of
rebound, whether it's in New
Hampshire or

14:41.481 --> 14:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Carolina, but he needs to
get back on
the horse, and quickly.
Otherwise, his -- this

14:46.819 --> 14:52.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of notion that he is the
inevitable candidate,
if that's not sustainable, then
he's not going

14:52.291 --> 14:54.093 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to go anywhere.

14:54.193 --> 14:57.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, quickly,
Susan, to Marco
Rubio, who came in a really
strong third,

14:58.030 --> 15:00.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but there are a lot of -- and
there are a
lot of other candidates who
would love to

15:00.399 --> 15:02.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trade places with his being
third.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Yes, that's right.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was a strong finish, and he
actually
handled it pretty masterfully
when you think

15:08.508 --> 15:12.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about a third-place finish as
being a victory,
but I think it was for Marco
Rubio, because,

15:12.345 --> 15:16.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going into New Hampshire, it
puts him a bit
above those three governors. All
of the -- all

15:16.716 --> 15:21.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four of those candidates are
trying to get
the mantle of the mainstream
Republican, the

15:21.120 --> 15:24.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
alternative to Donald Trump and
Ted Cruz.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iowa gave Marco Rubio a big
boost to that
status.

15:26.959 --> 15:31.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Reid, we
see, picking
up on what Susan just said,
these other Republican,

15:31.430 --> 15:36.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
so-called establishment
Republicans are already
going after him today. Chris
Christie said

15:36.702 --> 15:38.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's like the boy in the plastic
bubble?

15:38.971 --> 15:42.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Yes, and we have
seen a lot of
different candidates go after
Marco Rubio,

15:42.809 --> 15:47.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether it's Jeb Bush or John
Kasich or today
Chris Christie.

15:47.580 --> 15:51.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's because of this sort
of traffic
jam that we're seeing in New
Hampshire. New

15:51.551 --> 15:56.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hampshire is the state where the
establishment
Republicans tend to dominate
Republican politics

15:56.455 --> 16:00.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the Republican primaries.
But you have
got about five candidates who
have a legitimate

16:00.993 --> 16:03.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shot and are really trying to
compete in New
Hampshire.

16:03.763 --> 16:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That sort of gives me the sense
that someone
like a Donald Trump or maybe
even a Ted Cruz

16:08.067 --> 16:12.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could sneak out a win, because
their slice
of the Republican pie isn't as
divided as

16:12.638 --> 16:14.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that establishment lane.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we have a
little bit
of clarification, but there is a
whole long

16:17.443 --> 16:18.744 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
way to go.

16:18.845 --> 16:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reid Wilson, Susan Page, great
to see both
of you. Thank you.

16:21.581 --> 16:22.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Thanks a lot.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

16:24.650 --> 16:28.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And so we turn now
to two top
advisers to last night's
winners.

16:28.688 --> 16:32.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
First up, Cruz campaign
spokesman Rick Tyler.
He joins us from New Hampshire.

16:33.092 --> 16:38.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Rick, in a nutshell, you
managed to turn
around expectations, as we just
heard them

16:38.130 --> 16:42.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say, and come out with a big
victory in Iowa
last night. How did that happen?

16:42.935 --> 16:49.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK TYLER, Spokesman, Ted Cruz
Campaign:
It took a lot of hard work and a
lot of time,

16:49.108 --> 16:53.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a great team in Iowa that put
together a -- what
really was a traditional ground
game, but

16:53.379 --> 16:55.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it was driven by data.

16:55.214 --> 16:58.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just had an exceptional
candidate who has
an exceptional message, and that
people are

16:58.284 --> 17:02.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sick and tired of Washington and
they want
a change. And Ted Cruz is the
only candidate

17:02.688 --> 17:06.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has shown that he's willing
to go to Washington
and stand up to the
establishment, and even

17:06.425 --> 17:10.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stand up to members of his own
party, and
he's built a reputation on that.

17:10.129 --> 17:15.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we have seen everybody
has -- all the
Americans are really looking
toward the outsiders,

17:15.635 --> 17:19.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but Ted Cruz is really the
original outsider,
the proven outsider. And so when
we went to

17:19.772 --> 17:25.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
look for supporters and
volunteers to help,
it was like they were waiting to
be found.

17:25.678 --> 17:30.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we ended up with 12,000
volunteers in Iowa,
and we had them doing stuff
every day. We

17:31.050 --> 17:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were knocking on 2,000 doors a
day, making
over 20,000 phone calls a day.
And people

17:36.022 --> 17:37.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were really excited to be part
of it.

17:37.990 --> 17:43.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And many of them
were evangelicals,
who obviously make up a big part
of the caucusing

17:43.162 --> 17:49.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote in Iowa. But you don't have
that same
demographic in New Hampshire.
How do you plan

17:49.669 --> 17:51.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to pull the rabbit out of the
hat a second
time?

17:52.038 --> 17:57.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK TYLER: You know, I think
one of the best
headlines I read was actually
here in New

17:57.376 --> 18:02.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hampshire that said, "Ted Cruz
brings religious
message to secular New
Hampshire, and it's

18:02.248 --> 18:04.016 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
working."

18:04.116 --> 18:06.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's part of what I heard
Reid say, is
that there's five people
basically competing

18:06.986 --> 18:12.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the moderate vote, and Ted
Cruz has a
real opportunity with the
conservatives here,

18:12.224 --> 18:17.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and not just evangelicals, but
the pro-life
conservatives, pro-family
conservatives, pro-gun

18:17.263 --> 18:19.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conservatives, and pro-growth
conservatives.

18:19.165 --> 18:21.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have all formed something
called the
603 Alliance. And they have all
gotten behind

18:21.567 --> 18:27.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz. And when conservatives
come together
and the rest of the field is
fractured -- and,

18:27.473 --> 18:30.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the way, it's usually the
other way around.
The establishment has one
well-funded candidate,

18:30.876 --> 18:33.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the conservative has a lot
with no money.

18:33.112 --> 18:38.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This time, we're the well-funded
candidate,
and the establishment, there's a
lot of them,

18:38.184 --> 18:41.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they don't have the money.
So, we're very
well-positioned. I'm not
predicting a win

18:41.754 --> 18:43.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here in New Hampshire, but we're
going to
fight hard here.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I didn't expect you
would.

18:45.825 --> 18:52.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you're saying that if, say,
John Kasich,
Chris Christie and Jeb Bush
divide the establishment

18:52.164 --> 18:55.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support, and maybe a little bit
of Donald
Trump as well, that allows you
to sneak in

18:55.468 --> 18:56.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through the middle?

18:57.003 --> 19:00.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICK TYLER: I think that's
right.

19:00.706 --> 19:05.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we saw today, even today, as
you saw with
Chris Christie, who is calling
Marco Rubio

19:05.177 --> 19:10.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the boy in the bubble because he
doesn't often
take press questions and is a
little bit standoffish

19:10.549 --> 19:12.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with the press.

19:12.418 --> 19:16.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, look, they can --
they're -- for most
of them, it's do-or-die. Our
expectations

19:17.023 --> 19:20.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here are rather low. And we will
go on the
South Carolina. And then you
have the SEC

19:21.060 --> 19:29.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primary, where you have all
these states from
South Carolina to Georgia to
Tennessee, Oklahoma,

19:29.201 --> 19:35.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,
and Texas.
These are all 50-percent-plus
evangelical

19:35.307 --> 19:37.043 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
states.

19:37.143 --> 19:41.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you have 11 of them total
that will go
before March 15. And they favor
Ted Cruz.

19:41.480 --> 19:45.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so if you're running against
Ted Cruz,
it's going to be a gauntlet to
go through

19:45.518 --> 19:47.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with all that support that we
have now proven
we can get.

19:47.453 --> 19:50.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, it sounds, to
you, it's OK
if you come in second or third
in New Hampshire,

19:50.990 --> 19:55.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as long as you have that long
game headed
toward the South in mind?

19:55.995 --> 20:01.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK TYLER: I would be thrilled
with second
place in New Hampshire. And I
would -- and

20:01.367 --> 20:03.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
third would certainly be
acceptable.

20:03.269 --> 20:07.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: OK, Rick, I just
helped you set
your expectations lower. So, you
can say thank

20:07.106 --> 20:07.440 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

20:08.841 --> 20:10.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you so much
for joining
us tonight.

20:10.709 --> 20:13.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICK TYLER: Appreciate it, Gwen.
Thanks.

20:13.646 --> 20:18.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now turning to the
Democrats'
side, we're joined by Joel
Benenson, chief

20:18.117 --> 20:20.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
strategist for the Hillary
Clinton campaign.

20:20.386 --> 20:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joel, I'm going to ask you the
same question
I just asked Rick Tyler, which
is, in a nutshell,

20:24.790 --> 20:28.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how did you pull it out, very
narrow win in
Iowa?

20:28.227 --> 20:31.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL BENENSON, Chief Strategist,
Hillary Clinton
Campaign: Well, I think we
pulled it out with

20:31.330 --> 20:33.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a really strong message.

20:33.232 --> 20:37.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Hillary Clinton was
really closing
very strongly talking about the
need and the

20:37.837 --> 20:42.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
choice to elect a president who
can make real
progress, who can make a real
difference in

20:42.942 --> 20:45.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their lives and get things done.

20:45.244 --> 20:50.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think then we had a ground
game that
was great. You know, all going
into this caucus

20:50.349 --> 20:54.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Iowa, the Sanders campaign
had predicted
they were going to win. They
said if the turnout

20:55.020 --> 21:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was higher than 170,000, that
would be their
turnout. And they got that
turnout. And it

21:00.960 --> 21:03.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turned out that that was good
for Hillary
Clinton.

21:03.829 --> 21:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of talk about enthusiasm
and energy
on the Sanders side of things,
but what we

21:07.900 --> 21:13.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learned last night is that there
was a lot
of enthusiasm and energy for
Hillary Clinton

21:13.172 --> 21:18.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and her candidacy and her
message of being
the progressive who likes to get
things done

21:18.410 --> 21:20.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and who will make a real
difference in people's
lives.

21:20.346 --> 21:24.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it was close, but a win
is a win, and
we take it. And we're here in
New Hampshire

21:25.050 --> 21:30.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now ready for another contest in
just a few
days with a debate coming up.
And we're looking

21:30.656 --> 21:32.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forward to it. We have been to
New Hampshire
before.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:34.860 --> 21:37.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: When you worked for
Barack Obama
in a similar role in 2008, you
went through

21:37.863 --> 21:44.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a slightly different outcome. He
won in Iowa,
but then he lost in New
Hampshire to Hillary

21:44.870 --> 21:46.338 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

21:46.438 --> 21:48.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What did you learn from that
which informs
what you will do this time?

21:48.807 --> 21:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL BENENSON: Well, I think,
you know what,
you learn is that -- and this is
the case

21:54.280 --> 21:59.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as you go through most of these
states -- is
that no two states are exactly
alike.

21:59.318 --> 22:05.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have to really focus in
on what's
unique in each state. New
Hampshire is a fiercely

22:06.025 --> 22:11.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
independent state. You know, the
state's motto
is live free or die, very strong
anti-tax

22:11.764 --> 22:15.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sentiment, a wide-open primary
here. You know,
independents can walk in and
vote in either

22:15.401 --> 22:18.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Democrat or the Republican
primary on
either day.

22:19.004 --> 22:22.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's very different than that
caucus environment
on the Democratic side, where
you have to

22:22.942 --> 22:28.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show up at a specific time, you
caucus right
on the floor, and you're
competing for delegates

22:28.380 --> 22:30.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the convention.

22:30.182 --> 22:36.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's true here, though, is
folks are very
focused on their economic lives.
This is a

22:36.121 --> 22:41.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state that really appreciates
and values small
businesses and entrepreneurs.
And I think

22:41.360 --> 22:45.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's why having a president
who can do all
parts of the job is going to be
important

22:45.564 --> 22:49.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to them. That's part of the
message that Hillary
Clinton is going to bring here,
because I

22:49.802 --> 22:54.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think folks in New Hampshire
know that that's
how you create good-paying jobs,
is investing

22:54.139 --> 22:58.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in small business, giving those
folks a chance
to export their goods, get the
loans they

22:58.811 --> 23:00.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
need from the Export-Import
Bank.

23:00.246 --> 23:00.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:00.980 --> 23:02.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Pardon me, Joel.

23:02.848 --> 23:05.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you're running against
someone who is
leading way ahead of you in the
polls in New

23:05.884 --> 23:09.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hampshire, in part by saying
he's the true
progressive. And she's lately
been saying,

23:09.655 --> 23:12.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm a progressive who can get
things done.

23:12.191 --> 23:15.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you really -- I just asked
about setting
expectations with Rick Tyler --
are you really

23:15.961 --> 23:20.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thinking it's possible to break
through that
bulwark which Bernie Sanders
seems to have

23:20.799 --> 23:22.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
built for himself in New
Hampshire?

23:22.701 --> 23:30.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL BENENSON: Well, you know,
he may have
mentioned it on their side of
the race, but

23:30.809 --> 23:35.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what we know historically is New
Englanders
do very, very well here. They
almost always

23:35.281 --> 23:40.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
win when there isn't an
incumbent president
or vice president. I think there
is only one

23:40.653 --> 23:43.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time in about 40 years where
that didn't happen.

23:44.089 --> 23:48.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, we know we're
playing in his
backyard. He's from a state
right next door

23:48.727 --> 23:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
west of New Hampshire, obviously
borders Vermont.
And he is showing that kind of
hometown strength.

23:54.900 --> 24:00.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're playing on his home
field. We got
to win a road game here. We have
got a week

24:00.539 --> 24:06.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go, and she's out campaigning
hard every
day. She's been all over the
state. Hillary

24:06.278 --> 24:06.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Clinton...

24:06.745 --> 24:07.379 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:07.479 --> 24:08.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOEL BENENSON: ... debates.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Pardon me.

24:09.715 --> 24:12.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Will she be in South Carolina
between now
and New Hampshire primary night?

24:12.284 --> 24:14.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOEL BENENSON: No.

24:14.353 --> 24:20.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, right now, we have got
a lot coming
up. We have a town hall
scheduled for tomorrow

24:20.125 --> 24:26.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night. We have got a debate on
Thursday. So
we're going to be focusing right
here, come

24:26.665 --> 24:32.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of New Hampshire after the
primary. And
then we look forward to a period
after New

24:32.638 --> 24:35.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hampshire to the end of March
where there
are more than 1,000 delegates
that are going

24:35.507 --> 24:37.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be contested.

24:37.376 --> 24:41.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you just mentioned, Gwen, you
go to Nevada,
South Carolina, then Super
Tuesday. So, you

24:41.480 --> 24:46.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will have over 1,000 delegates
that are going
to be decided in about a
six-week period.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's really going to be
kind of the
heart of the contest, I think.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And we will be
following along
with you.

24:51.390 --> 24:55.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joel Benenson, chief strategist
for Hillary
Clinton, thank you very much.

24:55.994 --> 25:06.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOEL BENENSON: Thank you, Gwen.

25:06.472 --> 25:15.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the past year,
ISIS has
gained a foothold in Libya,
expanding its

25:15.147 --> 25:20.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reach beyond its Middle Eastern
base, and
that's now a growing concern for
the U.S.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.521 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and its allies.

25:22.621 --> 25:26.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We begin with some background
from chief foreign
affairs correspondent, Margaret
Warner.

25:26.725 --> 25:36.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The coalition
fighting ISIS
can claim some progress in both
Iraq and Syria.

25:36.201 --> 25:42.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now Libya, just 300 miles
from Italy,
has become a new magnet for the
militant group.

25:42.775 --> 25:48.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The threat was very much on the
minds of Secretary
of State John Kerry and
officials of 22 other

25:48.680 --> 25:50.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
countries in Rome today.

25:50.582 --> 25:53.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: That
country has resources. The last
thing in the

25:53.585 --> 25:59.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
world you want is a false
caliphate with access
to billions of dollars in oil
revenue.

25:59.324 --> 26:03.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Yet the
conference agreed
only to monitor developments.

26:03.729 --> 26:09.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. military officials say some
3,000 ISIS
fighters have carved out
territory around

26:09.435 --> 26:15.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the coastal town of Sirte,
birthplace of the
late dictator Moammar Gadhafi.
From there,

26:15.607 --> 26:20.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the group mounts attacks on
civilian targets
and the country's oil
facilities. The U.S.

26:21.013 --> 26:26.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
has already carried out
airstrikes in Libya,
killing a top ISIS commander
last November,

26:26.685 --> 26:29.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and ramped up reconnaissance
missions.

26:29.254 --> 26:34.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in Washington today,
Secretary of Defense
Ash Carter called for a 50
percent spending

26:34.426 --> 26:37.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
increase on the broader
anti-ISIS campaign.

26:37.229 --> 26:39.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: We
must also take into account in
our budget

26:39.898 --> 26:45.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, as destructive power of
greater and
greater magnitude falls into the
hands of

26:45.170 --> 26:52.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smaller and smaller and more
aberrant groups
of people, countering terrorists
will likely

26:52.377 --> 26:55.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be a continuing part of the
future responsibilities.

26:55.747 --> 26:59.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Last month, the
chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
General Joseph

26:59.618 --> 27:05.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dunford, said a decision on how
to expand
the U.S. role in Libya is
coming. The New

27:05.123 --> 27:09.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York Times quoted him as saying:
"It's fair
to say that we're looking to
take decisive

27:09.661 --> 27:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
military actions In conjunction
with the political
process."

27:14.433 --> 27:20.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For now, Libya's political
process remains
in disarray. Since NATO
airstrikes helped

27:20.739 --> 27:26.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
oust Gadhafi in 2011, the
country has been
torn by violence between warring
factions.

27:26.812 --> 27:32.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In December, the United Nations
helped broker
a new unity government between
the two main

27:32.384 --> 27:36.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rival groups. But they have
refused to carry
it out.

27:36.221 --> 27:39.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Washington, I'm Margaret
Warner for the
"PBS NewsHour."

27:39.591 --> 27:44.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're joined now
by Frederic
Wehrey of the Middle East
Program at the Carnegie

27:44.363 --> 27:50.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Endowment for International
Peace. He was
most recently in Libya late last
year.

27:50.202 --> 27:51.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome back to the program,
Fred Wehrey.

27:52.004 --> 27:55.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Remind us, why is Libya
important to the United
States?

27:55.307 --> 27:59.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FREDERIC WEHREY, Carnegie
Endowment for International
Peace: Well, its strategic
location. It sits

27:59.211 --> 28:04.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the top of Africa. It has
access to the
Mediterranean and Europe. It has
oil reserves.

28:04.483 --> 28:10.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, right now, it's perhaps a
fallback option
for the Islamic State. It's a
lawless place

28:10.622 --> 28:13.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where terrorists and smugglers
can take advantage.

28:13.125 --> 28:18.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this
political vacuum that's
happened there, how did that
come about, very

28:18.664 --> 28:23.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quickly? I know there is a long
history there.
And what state is it in? I mean,
it sounds

28:23.802 --> 28:25.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pretty chaotic still.

28:25.604 --> 28:29.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Well, this is
really the
legacy partly of 42 years of
misrule from

28:29.107 --> 28:33.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Gadhafi. There were no
institutions. There
was no army, no police.

28:33.312 --> 28:36.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since the fall of Gadhafi, you
have had a
political vacuum. You don't have
an army.

28:36.748 --> 28:42.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't have police. You have
militias,
basically, ruling the country.
So it's really

28:42.120 --> 28:45.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ripe -- a ripe environment for
ISIS to exploit.

28:45.290 --> 28:47.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just how much
strength
do they have there?

28:48.060 --> 28:52.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: They have got
anywhere from
about 3,000 to 5,000 fighters,
especially

28:53.031 --> 28:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in that crucial central city of
Sirte.

28:55.968 --> 29:00.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the real fear is that more
fighters from
abroad could come in and bolster
their ranks

29:00.672 --> 29:02.374 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what is the
U.S. goal?
What would the U.S. like to
accomplish?

29:04.876 --> 29:09.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Well, I think
they want to
prevent this from becoming a new
haven for

29:09.114 --> 29:13.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Islamic State, to prevent
the Islamic
State from accessing oil
reserves, from disrupting

29:13.619 --> 29:16.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the formation of a new
government.

29:16.622 --> 29:21.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they're going to try to
assist Libyan forces
on the ground. But the problem
is that there's

29:21.226 --> 29:24.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no central army. There is no
partner to work
with in that country.

29:24.296 --> 29:27.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what are the
options, the
real options? Because we know
the U.S. has

29:27.366 --> 29:29.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
been talking about doing
something. But nothing's
happened yet.

29:30.002 --> 29:33.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Well, they're
waiting for
this government to get its act
together, to

29:33.705 --> 29:38.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unify itself, so that there is a
central channel
to push aid and assistance
through.

29:39.011 --> 29:43.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If that doesn't happen, you can
expect the
U.S. and the Europeans to start
working with

29:43.615 --> 29:49.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
these -- perhaps these
individual militias,
using special operations forces
and airstrikes.

29:49.121 --> 29:54.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is there a
will on the
part of the Europeans to join in
with the

29:54.559 --> 29:56.395 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.S. to do that?

29:56.495 --> 29:58.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: We have seen
statements from
especially the British and the
French that

29:59.031 --> 30:02.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are increasingly concerned
about the
Islamic State. Also, the
Italians have an

30:02.834 --> 30:05.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
historic presence there. So,
they're gearing
up.

30:05.137 --> 30:10.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was part of Secretary
Kerry's mission
in Rome, was to unify the
Europeans and get

30:10.142 --> 30:11.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them on board with the U.S.
strategy.

30:12.077 --> 30:15.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you mentioned
if the government
doesn't get its act together,
the U.S. can

30:15.213 --> 30:18.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work with some of the militias
on the ground.
But do you have a case like
Syria, where the

30:18.250 --> 30:20.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. may not know who to trust,
who they can
work with?

30:20.285 --> 30:24.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: This is a real
problem. And
this is why there are reports of
U.S. special

30:24.122 --> 30:27.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
operations forces already on the
ground trying
to assess, who is a credible
partner, who

30:27.993 --> 30:29.861 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can we work with?

30:29.961 --> 30:32.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is very problematic. And
I think we're
really walking on a mine field
here in terms

30:32.898 --> 30:37.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of who do we actually give
assistance to and
could that further destabilize
the country

30:37.536 --> 30:39.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
down the road?

30:39.604 --> 30:42.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you believe
the U.S. absolutely
has a commitment to go in there
and do something

30:43.008 --> 30:44.242 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about ISIS?

30:44.342 --> 30:46.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Well, we have
seen statements
like that.

30:46.211 --> 30:51.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they're poised to do
something. I
think first priority that they
see is resolving

30:51.450 --> 30:56.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the political impasse, resolving
these divisions,
because those divisions create
that vacuum

30:57.089 --> 30:58.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that ISIS is able to exploit.

30:59.024 --> 31:03.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But does the
U.S., does the
West have the leverage to make
happen something

31:03.395 --> 31:05.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that it wants to have happen?

31:05.163 --> 31:07.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: So, this is the
real problem.
The United Nations has been
involved.

31:07.733 --> 31:12.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you're seeing more and
more senior
level involvement from the
United States.

31:12.671 --> 31:17.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have these statements from
Secretary Kerry,
from President Obama that really
signal to

31:18.043 --> 31:20.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Libyans that we take this
very seriously.

31:20.178 --> 31:22.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what do you
expect in the
short term?

31:22.247 --> 31:24.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Well,
unfortunately, I'm
not optimistic.

31:24.683 --> 31:30.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I see more chaos. I see these
divisions. I
was just there. The divisions
are very stark.

31:30.388 --> 31:35.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They cannot agree on who is
going to command
the national level military. The
militias

31:35.360 --> 31:39.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still call the shots in the
streets. So it's
-- I think it's quite dire.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sounds grim.

31:42.000 --> 31:47.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Frederic Wehrey of the Carnegie
Endowment
for International Peace, we
thank you.

31:47.105 --> 31:57.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Yes. My
pleasure.

31:57.215 --> 32:02.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

32:02.120 --> 32:07.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
Oklahoma
became a national model for
early learning;

32:07.993 --> 32:13.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and previously unpublished
images documenting
black history are given new
life.

32:13.632 --> 32:18.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, first, more on the
continuing debate
over police departments and the
disputed use

32:18.436 --> 32:20.305 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of force.

32:20.405 --> 32:24.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, the Department of
Justice announced
it will review the conduct of
the San Francisco

32:24.376 --> 32:30.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police Department. It comes
after the fatal
shooting of Mario Woods, a
26-year-old African-American

32:30.415 --> 32:32.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
man, in December.

32:32.250 --> 32:36.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Police said Woods was
brandishing a knife
and less lethal methods had
failed to stop

32:36.822 --> 32:41.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him. But cell phone video has
cast doubt on
the police claims.

Our colleagues at public station
KQED cobbled
together two cell phone videos
taken of the

32:46.464 --> 32:50.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shooting, first in real time,
and then slowed
down.

32:50.168 --> 32:57.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A warning: This does contain
violent gunfire.

WOMAN: Oh, my God!

33:25.503 --> 33:41.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Hari Sreenivasan has
more from
New York on the efforts to
change police departments

33:41.186 --> 33:42.988 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and behavior.

33:43.088 --> 33:47.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In San
Francisco's case,
the city voluntarily asked the
federal government

33:47.225 --> 33:51.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do the review, but there have
been many
other investigations and
settlements with

33:51.897 --> 33:54.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the federal government that are
not undertaken
voluntarily.

33:54.900 --> 33:58.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Frontline," along with The
Washington Post,
have looked at how those have
worked in cities

33:59.037 --> 34:01.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like Los Angeles and Detroit.

34:01.139 --> 34:04.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sarah Childress is a digital
reporter for
"Frontline" who has worked on
this project,

34:04.442 --> 34:07.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
including an in-depth
interactive called Fixing
the Force.

34:07.846 --> 34:09.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She joins us now from Boston.

34:09.748 --> 34:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Sarah, San Francisco's case
is a little
abnormal, in considering the
investigations

34:14.319 --> 34:17.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you have launched, but --
because they're
doing this of their own accord.

34:17.355 --> 34:19.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH CHILDRESS, "Frontline":
That's right.

34:19.224 --> 34:23.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is actually a separate
process from what
the Justice Department calls its
pattern of

34:23.428 --> 34:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
practice of investigations,
where they investigate
a department and then compel
them to implement

34:28.733 --> 34:34.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reforms. This is what -- it's
under a separate
office in the Justice
Department, and it's

34:34.105 --> 34:36.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called their collaborative
review process.

34:36.174 --> 34:40.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they -- so the Justice
Department does
conduct investigation, a review,
but then

34:40.378 --> 34:45.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they recommend reforms, and it's
up to the
departments to decide whether or
how to implement

34:45.884 --> 34:48.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them. And that's what's
happening in San Francisco.

34:48.353 --> 34:53.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there will be no binding
agreement and
no -- the Justice Department
won't be able

34:53.158 --> 34:55.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to sue the department if they
don't actually
implement reforms.

34:55.927 --> 35:00.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, we hear
about these
investigations oftentimes
because of very

35:00.265 --> 35:04.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
high-profile abuse of force or
something that
kind of makes the news.

35:04.803 --> 35:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as you point out, these
investigations
have been going on for quite
some time.

35:08.039 --> 35:09.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SARAH CHILDRESS: That's right.

35:10.041 --> 35:14.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Justice Department has been
investigating
police departments since 1994,
when they first

35:14.245 --> 35:19.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got the authority to do so. So
there's been
about 68 investigations in that
time. This

35:19.751 --> 35:26.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
collaborative reform process,
though, is pretty
new. It's only been -- they
started it back

35:26.658 --> 35:30.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2011. And so there has only
been about
seven departments that have gone
through this

35:30.729 --> 35:32.564 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

35:32.664 --> 35:36.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's difficult to tell
how it works.
Actually, only one department,
the Las Vegas

35:37.035 --> 35:41.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Metropolitan Police Department,
has actually
finished the entire reform
process under this

35:41.873 --> 35:46.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
collaborative review process. So
it's difficult
to say how effective it will be.

35:46.678 --> 35:51.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Given the
amount of time
and money the Justice Department
along with

35:51.249 --> 35:56.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the local police agencies are
spending, are
these plans working?

35:56.154 --> 35:58.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH CHILDRESS: Well, it's a
great question.

35:58.423 --> 36:02.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's really hard to say. We
spent several
months investigating this with
The Washington

36:02.761 --> 36:09.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Post, and we found pretty mixed
results. In
a lot of cases, officers get
better training,

36:09.801 --> 36:15.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
better equipment, and certainly
they become
more professional, but in terms
of actually

36:15.440 --> 36:19.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
changing how those officers are
policing,
whether it's changing --
reducing use of force,

36:20.011 --> 36:23.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example, reducing the amount
of time citizens
are filing complaints, that was
much more

36:23.782 --> 36:25.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
difficult to tell.

36:25.784 --> 36:29.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of these agreements, when
they're court-enforced,
it's at least a five-year
process. I mean,

36:29.721 --> 36:34.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look, transforming a police
department takes
a lot of time. It's a lot of
money. And it's

36:34.492 --> 36:37.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of effort. So you can't
just do these
things overnight.

36:37.162 --> 36:42.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I know that activists,
when they talk
about reforms, they want to see
progress right

36:42.834 --> 36:49.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
away. And with these sorts of
long-term investigations
and reform process, that usually
isn't the

36:49.574 --> 36:51.276 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
case.

36:51.376 --> 36:53.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As you pointed
out, this
also not just takes time, but it
takes money.

36:53.978 --> 36:58.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of these things don't
exactly end
exactly at the end of year two
or year five.

36:59.084 --> 37:00.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So who foots the bill?

37:00.985 --> 37:04.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH CHILDRESS: Well, it's up
to the cities.
And they're responsible for
paying for all

37:04.656 --> 37:06.458 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of these reforms.

37:06.558 --> 37:09.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a process by which they
can apply
for grants, and sometimes the
Justice Department

37:09.694 --> 37:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
will provide technical
assistance or other
help, but it's really up to the
cities. You

37:14.933 --> 37:19.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, and, in some cases, these
can cost millions,
especially with larger
departments. If you're

37:20.004 --> 37:26.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
implementing new training, new
equipment,
hiring additional staffing, you
know, it's

37:26.344 --> 37:31.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- in the case of Los Angeles,
which was one
of the longest-running reform
process, over

37:31.316 --> 37:33.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a decade, it cost an estimated
$300 million.

37:33.818 --> 37:35.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know, that's a lot of money.

37:35.920 --> 37:41.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Are there any
metrics that
measure outcomes? Is there less
abuse of force

37:41.960 --> 37:43.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after one of these
interventions?

37:43.561 --> 37:46.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH CHILDRESS: Well, that's a
great question.

37:46.464 --> 37:50.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's one we actually tried
to answer
in our investigation with The
Washington Post.

37:50.635 --> 37:57.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we came up with mixed
results. In some
cases, departments definitely
were using less

37:57.308 --> 38:03.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force. Officers were better
trained. And they
were -- departments were better
able to investigate

38:03.481 --> 38:05.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
incidents, officer-involved
shootings.

38:05.717 --> 38:10.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in other cases, the data
was really mixed.
There isn't a national standard
on use of

38:10.755 --> 38:16.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force, so it's really difficult
to compare
a department to a department, or
even within

38:16.794 --> 38:20.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the department, once the Justice
Department
comes in and starts changing how
they report

38:20.965 --> 38:22.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
use of force.

38:22.433 --> 38:25.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the short answer is, it's
hard to say.
We really don't know yet.

38:25.236 --> 38:28.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Sarah Childress
from "Frontline," thanks so much
for joining

38:28.173 --> 38:29.607 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

38:29.707 --> 38:38.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH CHILDRESS: Thanks for
having me.

38:38.917 --> 38:45.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's growing
interest in
a number of cities and states to
try funding

38:45.823 --> 38:48.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
universal pre-kindergarten
programs.

38:48.626 --> 38:53.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Philadelphia is the latest city
that wants
to create one. Oklahoma has long
been home

38:53.765 --> 38:58.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to early childhood education
that's widely
cited as a model.

38:58.636 --> 39:04.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Cat Wise
reports on
how a liberal political priority
became popular

39:04.209 --> 39:06.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a conservative state.

39:06.110 --> 39:10.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our education
series on Tuesdays,
Making the Grade.

39:10.415 --> 39:13.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENTS: A is for apple, apple.

start before
kindergarten.

STUDENTS: D is for dog.

39:20.825 --> 39:26.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Children here begin
public education
at just 4 years of age, some as
young as 3.

39:27.031 --> 39:32.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's preschool for anyone who
wants it, and
it costs the state about $7,500
per child

39:32.837 --> 39:33.805 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
per year.

39:33.905 --> 39:35.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: I like all those colors
you're using.

39:35.907 --> 39:41.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The program is hailed
as a national
model by the Obama
administration and advocates

39:41.212 --> 39:43.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who believe early education
creates long-term
benefits.

39:44.048 --> 39:47.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: What color is that one?
Very good.

39:47.619 --> 39:53.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: It's a costly
government program
in one of the reddest of red
states, but it

39:53.324 --> 39:57.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appears both Democrats and
Republicans believe
it's working.

39:57.495 --> 40:01.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM GORMLEY, Georgetown
University: It's
not every day that a very
conservative state,

40:01.232 --> 40:08.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like Oklahoma, establishes a new
social program.
It's not every day that a very
poor state

40:08.439 --> 40:11.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like Oklahoma establishes a new
social program.

40:11.309 --> 40:16.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: William Gormley is a
professor of
public policy at Georgetown
University. He

40:16.214 --> 40:21.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
has studied Oklahoma's
pre-kindergarten program
in Tulsa for 15 years.

40:21.185 --> 40:25.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM GORMLEY: Students are
nine months
ahead of their peers in their
pre-reading

40:25.423 --> 40:29.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
skills, seven months ahead of
their peers
in their pre-writing skills, and
five months

40:29.694 --> 40:33.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ahead of their peers in their
pre-math skills.

40:33.464 --> 40:39.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Those differences were
obvious to
Lee Elementary School teacher
Patty Eaton

40:39.771 --> 40:41.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from the start.

40:41.673 --> 40:43.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PATTY EATON, Teacher, Lee
Elementary School:
Their skill level was quite a
bit above the

40:43.508 --> 40:48.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other children that were coming
in without
the pre-K program. It was pretty
incredible

40:48.279 --> 40:52.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to see the difference between
the two.

Tulsa resident Coral Renteria
(ph) says her
4-year-old daughter, Lindsey
(ph), is thriving.

40:57.155 --> 41:02.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: She's only been in pre-K
for about
two months, and she's singing
everything,

41:02.560 --> 41:03.494 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like her ABCs.

41:03.594 --> 41:06.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAT WISE: And what are the songs
you sing?

41:06.164 --> 41:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

WILLIAM GORMLEY: At kindergarten
entry in
Tulsa, the single best predictor
of a child's

41:14.138 --> 41:21.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
verbal test skills is not race,
or income,
but whether that child was in
pre-K the previous

41:21.245 --> 41:23.081 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

41:23.181 --> 41:29.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: While the research
shows early gains
for children here in Oklahoma,
the big question

41:29.654 --> 41:35.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, will those gains persist in
later years?
Critics of Oklahoma's program
say the costs

41:35.760 --> 41:39.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of pre-kindergarten outstrip
long-term benefits,
which remain unclear.

41:39.764 --> 41:43.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA SNELL, Reason Foundation:
There's some
positive outcomes for the kids,
but then,

41:43.968 --> 41:47.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by second grade, third grade,
those fade out.

41:47.105 --> 41:52.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Lisa Snell is an
education analyst
at the Reason Foundation, a
libertarian think

41:52.410 --> 41:54.212 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tank.

41:54.312 --> 41:57.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA SNELL: If you're talking
about things
like graduation rates, test
scores, college

41:57.348 --> 42:04.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
graduation, the economic future
of these kids,
I think we have a more difficult
time linking

42:04.122 --> 42:07.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the investment in early
education to long-term
outcomes.

42:07.625 --> 42:11.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: Snell points to
Oklahoma's fourth
grade reading scores, which have
remained

42:11.929 --> 42:14.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stagnant since universal pre-K
was introduced.

42:14.599 --> 42:21.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA SNELL: So far, they have
had a pretty
mediocre response at best in
terms of the

42:21.172 --> 42:23.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
progress that their kids are
making later
in school.

42:23.541 --> 42:32.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: But advocates for
Oklahoma's pre-K
program say looking at test
score trends can

42:33.017 --> 42:38.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be misleading, since Oklahoma
has seen a recent
influx of children who speak
English as a

42:38.189 --> 42:41.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
second language.

42:41.526 --> 42:46.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Principal Raye Nero of Tulsa's
Sequoyah Elementary
School says more students are
showing up at

42:46.264 --> 42:47.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
school less prepared.

42:48.099 --> 42:50.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAYE NERO, Principal, Sequoyah
Elementary
School: My demographics are very
challenging.

42:51.068 --> 42:57.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have parents who have an
elementary education
raising their kids. So, our kids
are not learning

42:58.075 --> 42:59.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at home like they should.

43:00.011 --> 43:04.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, not only are we teachers.
We're parents.
We're teaching social skills.
We're teaching

43:04.682 --> 43:09.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
emotional skills. We're teaching
academic
skills. So it's difficult.

43:09.887 --> 43:15.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: And those students who
are in pre-K,
they're seeing gains, but
there's a lot to

43:15.526 --> 43:17.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make up for, I guess.

43:17.395 --> 43:23.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAYE NERO: A lot, but I still
believe, the
earlier we get those kids, and
can put them

43:23.734 --> 43:28.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this kind of structure, will
help them
in the long run.

43:28.139 --> 43:35.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: It falls on pre-K
teachers like
Kegan Waters (ph) to bridge that
learning

43:35.112 --> 43:36.848 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gap.

43:36.948 --> 43:40.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Four kids in my class out
of 20 are
speaking only Spanish when they
walk in the

43:40.785 --> 43:42.019 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
door.

43:42.119 --> 43:43.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: Lindsey, Coral
Renteria's daughter,
was one of them.

43:44.021 --> 43:49.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Her first language is
Spanish. In two
months, she's caught up on her
English like

43:49.560 --> 43:50.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I couldn't imagine.

43:50.328 --> 43:51.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: In just two months?

43:51.796 --> 43:54.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: In just two months. I'm
very, very
happy.

43:54.232 --> 44:00.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Across the country, 44
states pay
for some version of pre-K
classes, but only

44:00.805 --> 44:06.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four states and the district of
Columbia offer
universal preschool. The fact
that all residents,

44:06.777 --> 44:11.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just families with low
income, can enroll
here could be why the program
receives wide

44:11.415 --> 44:13.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
political support in a
conservative state
like Oklahoma.

44:13.885 --> 44:15.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BLATT, Executive Director,
Oklahoma
Policy Institute: Whether you're
talking about

44:15.953 --> 44:20.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
urban areas or rural areas or
suburban areas
where you have middle-class
families that

44:20.825 --> 44:24.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tend to get out and vote, we
have come to
expect that there's going to be
a 4-year-old

44:24.829 --> 44:26.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
program there.

44:26.597 --> 44:29.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: David Blatt is the
executive director
of the Oklahoma Policy
Institute.

44:29.867 --> 44:35.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BLATT: Nobody has decided
to go out
to their constituents and say,
we're going

44:35.172 --> 44:41.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do away with this free early
childhood
program that you have been
counting on.

44:41.479 --> 44:46.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: Take Jennifer
Doverspike. She's
a Tulsa mother who entered her
4-year-old

44:46.918 --> 44:48.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
daughter Lucy (ph) in her
neighborhood pre-K
program.

44:49.086 --> 44:52.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER DOVERSPIKE, Mother: And
I'm very
proud of it, as a Tulsan and as
an Oklahoman,

44:52.790 --> 44:55.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have a program like this
that's so great.

44:55.159 --> 45:00.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Doverspike loves the
high-quality
instruction. Oklahoma pre-K
teachers must

45:00.331 --> 45:05.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a college degree, an early
education
certificate, and they are paid
the same salary

45:05.570 --> 45:07.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as all K-12 teachers.

45:07.471 --> 45:11.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JENNIFER DOVERSPIKE: As a
parent, I am thrilled
that this program exists, but a
preschool

45:11.509 --> 45:14.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is more beneficial to
disadvantaged children.

45:14.478 --> 45:17.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if it wasn't the amount of
money we're
spending on the program -- where
can that

45:17.815 --> 45:22.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money go to best serve our
citizens? And the
money is best served for
children who truly

45:22.587 --> 45:27.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need preschool. A parent like me
taking advantage
of the program is a parent that
could have

45:27.725 --> 45:31.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been sending her child to a
different preschool
and spending money on it, and is
now taking

45:31.162 --> 45:33.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
advantage of this because it's
free.

45:33.764 --> 45:39.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: For his part,
Professor Gormley
continues to compare outcomes of
the 2006

45:40.004 --> 45:44.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pre-K and non-pre-K students who
are now in
Tulsa's ninth grade.

45:44.842 --> 45:51.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM GORMLEY: Do they differ
in their letter
grades? Do they differ in their
standardized

45:51.449 --> 45:57.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
test scores? Do they differ in
their behavior?
Are there more suspensions if
the kids were

45:57.355 --> 46:01.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not in pre-K? Is there more
absenteeism if
the kids were not in pre-K?

46:01.425 --> 46:06.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of these factors have been
shown to be
really important in determining
future success

46:06.964 --> 46:11.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in school, future success at
work, and future
success in life.

46:11.302 --> 46:16.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Seventy-five percent
of families
here enroll their children in
pre-kindergarten.

46:16.507 --> 46:21.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some cities, including Denver,
Seattle, and
New York, have recently put in
place Oklahoma's

46:21.545 --> 46:26.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
universal model, while a number
of states
have chosen to increase funding
for low-income

46:26.717 --> 46:27.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pre-K.

46:36.427 --> 46:49.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now: digging through
an archive
of previously unpublished photos
that help

46:49.306 --> 46:52.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fill in a portrait of
African-American history.

46:52.710 --> 46:54.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Again to Hari in New York.

46:54.645 --> 46:58.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The archives
come from The
New York Times and include
hundreds of images

46:58.382 --> 47:00.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
taken from old negatives.

47:00.251 --> 47:05.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the pictures capture a
historic moment,
like this one taken inside
Malcolm X's house

47:05.322 --> 47:11.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in Queens after it was
firebombed. Some include
well-known figures like
Run-D.M.C., or this

47:11.262 --> 47:15.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of Lena Horne that was taken
inside her
apartment for a profile of her,
but it turned

47:15.433 --> 47:21.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out there was a backstory. As
famous as she
was at the time, she still could
not get anyone

47:21.238 --> 47:25.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to sell her a co-op without the
help of Harry
Belafonte.

47:25.176 --> 47:28.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Others feature important events
like school
integration.

47:28.879 --> 47:33.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rachel Swarns is part of the
team unpacking
the project and asking why they
went unestablished.

47:33.217 --> 47:35.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She joins me now from The New
York Times newsroom.

47:35.686 --> 47:39.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How did you embark on this? The
New York Times
archive must have hundreds of
thousands of

47:39.490 --> 47:41.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
photos that never made the cut.

47:41.392 --> 47:45.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL SWARNS, The New York
Times: It is,
as you can imagine, quite a dive
into history.

47:45.229 --> 47:52.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our archives, which is known as
the morgue,
has about five million pictures,
about 300

47:52.203 --> 47:57.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stacks of negatives. We truly
didn't know
what we were going to find when
we were going

47:57.742 --> 48:00.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in, but we thought it would be
pretty fascinating.

48:00.444 --> 48:05.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's this
-- most of
these photos that you're
publishing now never

48:05.182 --> 48:07.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have seen the light of day, so
to speak.

48:07.118 --> 48:13.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is one that almost anybody
will recognize.
It's the portrait of Dr. King.
But, really,

48:13.157 --> 48:16.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it wasn't just taken as a
portrait. Tell us
the story behind that.

48:16.193 --> 48:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL SWARNS: Well, what we
really wanted
to do was look at photos that
just had never

48:22.733 --> 48:24.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
appeared before.

48:24.735 --> 48:29.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the photo of Dr. King is
fascinating because
the one that our readers have
seen over and

48:29.106 --> 48:35.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over and over again looks like
it was shot
in a studio, but, really, it was
a roundtable.

48:35.646 --> 48:41.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He was doing a television
interview. And that
photo actually never even
appeared in The

48:41.218 --> 48:47.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York Times, because the
story that day
ended up being about protesters
throwing eggs

48:47.458 --> 48:50.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at Dr. King. And we didn't have
that photo.

48:51.061 --> 48:58.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, some time later, a photo
editor cropped
that photo and made the photo
that so many

48:58.335 --> 49:03.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our readers have seen over
the decades,
but it was never a formal studio
sitting.

49:03.140 --> 49:06.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
that photo is
probably something that I saw
from high school

49:06.710 --> 49:08.512 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
textbooks onward.

49:08.612 --> 49:13.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you have another photo that
you recently
published of Jackie Robinson
giving a talk.

49:13.284 --> 49:15.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's the story behind that?

49:15.286 --> 49:20.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL SWARNS: Part of the great
thing about
this project is that we are
unveiling unpublished

49:20.991 --> 49:25.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
photos, but we really want to
engage in a
conversation with our readers.

49:25.596 --> 49:32.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is a mystery. We had
this photo of
Jackie Robinson speaking at City
College,

49:33.003 --> 49:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but there was never a story, and
we have no
idea what exactly he was doing
or what exactly

49:38.309 --> 49:43.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was talking about. So, we
posted the photo,
which is a lovely photo, and
then we asked

49:43.514 --> 49:47.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our readers: Were you there? Do
you know someone
who was there? Is there anyone
who can tell

49:47.952 --> 49:52.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us about this story behind this
photo?

49:52.890 --> 49:58.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And within a couple of hours, we
actually
got a response. We were still
digging for

49:58.462 --> 50:04.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more anecdotes and for people
who are actually
in that photo. But, you know,
readers are

50:05.002 --> 50:06.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really responding.

50:06.937 --> 50:11.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what
happened? The readers
turn in there, are saying, hey,
this is a

50:11.642 --> 50:14.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
photo from this year? And then
you pick up
the story from there.

50:14.912 --> 50:18.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RACHEL SWARNS: That's exactly
right. It was
from 1949.

We shared what we knew. And,
almost immediately,
people started writing in. And
what we have

50:24.221 --> 50:31.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found so far is an article from
1949 from
the undergraduate newspaper at
City College,

50:31.896 --> 50:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it describes a little bit
about what Jackie
Robinson was doing. And he was
talking about

50:35.733 --> 50:39.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his work with underprivileged
kids at the
HARLEM YMCA.

50:39.303 --> 50:45.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What are the
reasons that
these published -- or these
photos went unpublished?

50:45.476 --> 50:49.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were great photographs in
some cases.
The photographers were sent out
there on assignments.

50:49.914 --> 50:54.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, someone commissioned
these to be
taken. Then why didn't they make
the papers?

50:54.118 --> 50:58.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL SWARNS: You know, there
are a number
of reasons why photos doesn't go
-- published.

50:59.056 --> 51:03.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the truth is, we won't know
the whole
story behind them. But, you
know, one of the

51:03.861 --> 51:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things we discovered as we were
digging through
the archives is that, as
powerful as the photos

51:09.667 --> 51:14.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're showing to readers, as
powerful as they
are, what is almost as powerful
is the photos

51:14.471 --> 51:16.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that we cannot find.

51:16.941 --> 51:22.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The whole question of who was
shot and who
was not is a real one. And the
photos that

51:22.212 --> 51:29.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are missing, that's a big
question. And there
are reasons why some of these
people are not

51:29.887 --> 51:38.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in our archives. And we didn't
have a whole
huge staff of photographers at
the time.

51:38.462 --> 51:44.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, the newspaper didn't
put a premium
on images, like it does today.
We were called

51:44.768 --> 51:50.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the gray lady because we put a
premium on
words, lots of them. But we have
also really

51:51.041 --> 51:57.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got to be frank and honest and
acknowledge
that this was a time period when
African-Americans

51:57.581 --> 52:00.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were marginalized in society and
in media.

52:00.818 --> 52:05.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of the holes that we
discovered,
we could not find a single staff
photograph

52:05.923 --> 52:13.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of WEB Du Bois, the scholar and
intellectual,
of Richard Wright, the writer,
Romare Bearden,

52:13.697 --> 52:19.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the painter, and we think that
some of those
holes likely have to do with the
biases of

52:19.370 --> 52:21.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some of our editors at the time.

52:21.138 --> 52:23.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Rachel Swarns
of The New York Times, thanks so
much.

RACHEL SWARNS: Thank you.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: Being
a morning person seems to come
naturally to

52:43.961 --> 52:50.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some, but why? A new study from
the genomics
company 23andMe attempts to
answer this through

52:50.634 --> 52:57.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a genetic survey of nearly
90,000 people.
