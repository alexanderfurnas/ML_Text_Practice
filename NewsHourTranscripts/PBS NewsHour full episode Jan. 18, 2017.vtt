JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.405 --> 00:06.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.406 --> 00:08.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.342 --> 00:10.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Commuting her sentence was
entirely appropriate.

00:10.978 --> 00:15.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In his final news
conference,
President Obama addresses the
controversial

00:15.349 --> 00:21.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decision to release Chelsea
Manning and his
role in a new era of politics.

00:21.388 --> 00:27.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: The Senate takes on a
whirlwind of confirmation
hearings, grilling the
president-elect's picks

00:27.527 --> 00:29.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the next Cabinet.

00:29.763 --> 00:35.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And building a greener form of
energy -- how
progress on fusion nuclear
technology could

00:35.769 --> 00:37.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be the future of our power.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHL BINDERBAUER, CTO, Tri
Alpha Energy:
Our great-great-great-grandkids
are going

00:40.173 --> 00:42.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to live in a world powered by
fusion almost
exclusively.

00:42.976 --> 00:49.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:49.116 --> 00:51.118 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:51.151 --> 01:03.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He has given his
final major
speech, and now President Obama
has also held

01:03.430 --> 01:05.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his final news conference.

01:05.265 --> 01:09.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spent an hour before the
White House press
corps today, two days before his
presidency

01:09.937 --> 01:11.171 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ends.

01:11.204 --> 01:12.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang was there.

01:13.006 --> 01:20.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In his 22nd and final
time facing
reporters in the White House
Briefing Room,

01:20.714 --> 01:25.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama today defended
his decision
to commute the sentence of
Chelsea Manning,

01:25.485 --> 01:31.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the former Army intelligence
analyst convicted
of leaking U.S. military and
diplomatic secrets.

01:31.191 --> 01:37.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Chelsea Manning has served a
tough prison

01:37.597 --> 01:39.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sentence.

01:39.399 --> 01:48.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the notion that the average
person who
was thinking about disclosing
vital classified

01:48.642 --> 01:58.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information would think that it
goes unpunished,
I don't think would get that
impression from

01:58.385 --> 02:01.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the sentence that Chelsea
Manning has served.

02:01.755 --> 02:06.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Most of the news
conference was
spent looking ahead to the fate
of his own

02:06.493 --> 02:09.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
accomplishments after
president-elect Trump
takes office.

02:09.596 --> 02:17.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BARACK OBAMA: My working
assumption is that,
having won an election, opposed
a number of

02:17.337 --> 02:25.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my initiatives and some aspects
of my vision
for where the country needs to
go, it's appropriate

02:25.078 --> 02:33.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for him to go forward with his
vision and
his values.

02:33.920 --> 02:40.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't expect that there's
going to be,
you know, enormous overlap.

02:40.160 --> 02:44.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He also shed light on
the counsel
he's offered Mr. Trump.

02:44.431 --> 02:51.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: This is a job of
such magnitude,
that you can't do it by
yourself.

02:51.271 --> 03:00.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You are enormously reliant on a
team, your
Cabinet, your senior White House
staff, all

03:00.847 --> 03:07.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the way to fairly junior folks
in their 20s
and 30s, but who are executing
on significant

03:07.454 --> 03:09.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
responsibilities.

03:09.189 --> 03:15.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's probably the most useful
advice and
most constructive advice that I
have been

03:15.328 --> 03:17.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
able to give him.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He said he hoped he
could take
a pause from politics, but made
clear he will

03:19.866 --> 03:22.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
speak out when he feels
compelled to.

03:22.436 --> 03:28.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Certain moments
where I think
our core values may be at stake.

03:28.875 --> 03:35.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I put in that category if I saw
systematic
discrimination being ratified in
some fashion.

03:35.849 --> 03:44.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Efforts to round up kids who
have grown up
here and, for all practical
purposes, are

03:44.257 --> 03:49.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American kids, and send them
someplace else,
I think, would be something that
would merit

03:49.596 --> 03:51.331 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
me speaking out.

03:51.364 --> 03:55.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And he weighed in one
last time
on an issue that has dogged
presidents for

03:55.769 --> 03:58.171 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
generations, the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

03:58.205 --> 04:05.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: If you do not have
two states,
then, in some form or fashion,
you are extending

04:05.545 --> 04:07.614 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an occupation.

04:07.647 --> 04:12.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have believed, consistent
with the positions
that have been taken with
previous U.S. administrations

04:12.519 --> 04:21.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for decades now, that it was
important for
us to send a signal, a wakeup
call, that this

04:21.261 --> 04:22.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
moment may be passing.

04:23.029 --> 04:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Obama also
reflected on how
America has changed during his
presidency,

04:27.334 --> 04:30.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on social issues, like attitudes
on LGBTQ
rights.

04:30.670 --> 04:39.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: I don't think it
is something
that will be reversible, because
American

04:39.713 --> 04:42.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
society has changed.

04:42.149 --> 04:46.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The attitudes of young people in
particular
have changed.

04:46.386 --> 04:54.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That doesn't mean there aren't
going to be
some fights that are important,
legal issues,

04:54.661 --> 04:58.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issues surrounding transgender
persons.

04:58.064 --> 05:01.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are still going to be some
battles that
need to take place.

05:01.134 --> 05:06.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: The president
lamented what he
sees as undue restrictions on
voting rights,

05:06.072 --> 05:09.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which he said was a lingering
vestige of slavery
and Jim Crow.

05:09.743 --> 05:16.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: This whole notion
of election
or voting fraud, this is
something that has

05:16.316 --> 05:18.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
constantly been disproved.

05:18.852 --> 05:24.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is fake news, the notion
that there are
a whole bunch of people out
there who are

05:24.724 --> 05:27.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going out there and are not
eligible to vote
and want to vote.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have the opposite problem.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a whole bunch of people
who are eligible
to vote who don't vote.

05:31.298 --> 05:35.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: As Mr. Obama, the
nation's first
black president, prepares to
leave office,

05:36.002 --> 05:40.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
after the first female
presidential nominee
was defeated, he expressed
confidence that

05:40.640 --> 05:43.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more barriers will be broken in
the future.

05:43.276 --> 05:47.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: If, in fact, we
continue to
keep opportunity open to
everybody, then,

05:47.681 --> 05:50.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yes, we're going to have a woman
president,
we're going to have a Latino
president, we

05:50.884 --> 05:54.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will have a Jewish president, a
Hindu president.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.723 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You know what?

05:56.756 --> 05:59.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Who knows who we're going to
have.

05:59.259 --> 06:04.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I suspect we will have a whole
bunch of mixed-up
presidents at some point that
nobody really

06:04.364 --> 06:06.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
knows what to call them.

06:06.333 --> 06:11.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Once he becomes a
former president,
Mr. Obama says he is looking
forward to writing,

06:11.304 --> 06:13.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being what he called quiet.

06:13.073 --> 06:17.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he doesn't want to hear
himself talk
quite so much in the future, and
also being

06:17.844 --> 06:21.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a consumer of news, rather than
the subject
of news -- Judy.

06:21.948 --> 06:25.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John, I also
thought it was
interesting that the president
acknowledged

06:25.452 --> 06:29.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the role that economic
inequality played in
the results of the election.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That's exactly right.

06:31.224 --> 06:35.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spoke about that in the
context of a question
about inclusion and diversity.

06:35.695 --> 06:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said it's important for all
Americans to
feel a part of the growing
economy.

06:40.533 --> 06:44.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he thought there were a
lot of people
who voted for Mr. Trump because
they felt

06:44.638 --> 06:48.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forgotten and disenfranchised
and looked down
upon.

06:48.141 --> 06:52.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, John, you
had a busy day,
because I know, before the
president's news

06:52.479 --> 06:58.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conference, you were -- you
attended a briefing
by the Trump transition team,
and they were

06:58.985 --> 07:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talking about getting ready for
the inauguration.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: That's right.

07:02.689 --> 07:07.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sean Spicer, who is going to be
the press
secretary here at the White
House on Friday,

07:07.794 --> 07:12.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
starting on Friday, said that
Mr. Trump has
been rehearsing his inaugural
address.

07:12.565 --> 07:17.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said that he wrote it himself
with some
input from policy adviser
Stephen Miller,

07:17.437 --> 07:22.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Kellyanne Conway, from
Reince Priebus,
who's going to be White House
chief of staff,

07:22.242 --> 07:26.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Steve Bannon, who's going
to be White
House counsel -- counselor,
rather.

07:26.613 --> 07:33.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said that it's going to talk
about common
goals that -- and Mr. Trump
himself said that

07:33.219 --> 07:35.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the theme is going to be America
first.

07:35.755 --> 07:39.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sean was asked -- Sean Spicer
was asked if
any part of the speech is going
to reach out

07:39.759 --> 07:42.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Americans who didn't vote for
Mr. Trump.

07:42.962 --> 07:49.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said that Mr. Trump doesn't
feel he should
be judged on his rhetoric or
symbolism, but

07:49.336 --> 07:52.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wants to be judged on his
actions and his
successes.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All really
interesting.

07:55.175 --> 07:59.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Yang, keep holding down the
fort for
us at the White House and with
the Trump transition

07:59.646 --> 08:00.680 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
team.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

08:02.515 --> 08:07.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, this was a day for team
Trump also to
talk health and environment at
two Senate

08:07.721 --> 08:09.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hearings.

08:09.489 --> 08:15.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The health secretary-designate,
Tom Price,
defended his investments in
medical stocks

08:15.128 --> 08:17.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and played down talk of
overhauling Medicare.

08:18.031 --> 08:21.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Scott Pruitt, nominated to
run to run
the Environmental Protection
Agency, said

08:21.968 --> 08:26.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he doesn't believe climate
change is
a hoax, as the president-elect
has suggested.

08:26.906 --> 08:30.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have full reports on all
that after
the news summary.

08:30.944 --> 08:36.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regarding climate change, there
is news that
global temperatures hit a record
high in 2016,

08:36.683 --> 08:38.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the third straight year.

08:38.485 --> 08:44.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The data is from NASA, the
National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration
and the British.

08:44.657 --> 08:51.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say the average last year
was more than
1.5 degrees higher than in the
mid-20th century.

08:51.264 --> 08:57.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say it was caused by
manmade greenhouse
gases and an El Nino event.

08:57.203 --> 09:04.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The nominee to be U.N.
ambassador says Russia
committed war crimes in Syria
and cannot be

09:04.411 --> 09:06.179 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trusted.

09:06.212 --> 09:10.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Carolina Governor Nikki
Haley offered
a harsher assessment today than
Mr. Trump

09:10.150 --> 09:11.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has at her own Senate hearing.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.386 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIKKI HALEY (R), South Carolina:
Russia is
trying to show their muscle
right now.

09:15.588 --> 09:16.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is what they do.

09:16.856 --> 09:19.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think we always have to be
cautious.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think that we can trust
them.

09:21.327 --> 09:26.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that we have to make
sure that we
try and see what we can get from
them before

09:26.132 --> 09:28.134 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we give to them.

09:28.168 --> 09:34.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Haley also
blasted a U.N. resolution
last month that condemned
Israeli settlements,

09:34.207 --> 09:39.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and she voiced support for
moving the U.S.
Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv
to Jerusalem.

09:39.813 --> 09:45.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the nominee to run
the Commerce
Department, Wilbur Ross, put
China on notice

09:45.151 --> 09:46.986 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

09:47.020 --> 09:50.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The billionaire investor told
his confirmation
hearing that the Chinese are --
quote -- "the

09:50.056 --> 09:53.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most protectionist country among
the major
economies."

09:53.393 --> 09:57.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILBUR ROSS, Commerce Secretary
Nominee: They
have both very high tariff
barriers and very

09:57.497 --> 10:02.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high non-tariff trade barriers
to commerce.

10:02.869 --> 10:10.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they talk much more about
free trade than
they actually practice.

10:10.910 --> 10:18.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We would like to levelize that
playing field
and bring the realities a bit
closer to the

10:18.418 --> 10:20.386 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rhetoric.

10:20.420 --> 10:23.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ross also said
the Trump administration
will focus on renegotiating the
North Atlantic

10:24.023 --> 10:26.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Free Trade Agreement very early
on.

10:26.893 --> 10:32.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Separately, the Senate Armed
Services Committee
easily approved the nomination
of James Mattis

10:32.298 --> 10:33.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for defense secretary.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It goes now to the full Senate.

10:36.269 --> 10:41.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In West Africa, a suicide
attacker drove a
car bomb into a camp in Northern
Mali, killing

10:41.774 --> 10:44.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at least 60 people and wounding
115.

10:45.011 --> 10:50.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attack struck a base in the
city of Gao,
where soldiers and former rebels
are trying

10:50.183 --> 10:52.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to enforce a 2015 peace treaty.

10:52.952 --> 10:58.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later, an Islamist group linked
to al-Qaida
claimed responsibility.

10:58.091 --> 11:03.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Nigeria, the International
Red Cross now
says that at least 70 refugees
and aid workers

11:04.030 --> 11:10.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
died Tuesday when the Nigerian
air force accidentally
bombed a U.N. camp.

11:10.436 --> 11:14.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Military officials say they
meant to hit the
militant Boko Haram group.

11:14.407 --> 11:20.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least 46 severely wounded
people remained
at the camp today, near the
border with Cameroon.

11:20.747 --> 11:23.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.N. officials have called for a
full investigation.

11:23.883 --> 11:28.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Iraqi government troops
announced today that
they have taken full control of
eastern half

11:28.955 --> 11:30.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the city of Mosul.

11:30.990 --> 11:36.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The military said it drove
Islamic State militants
out of the last neighborhoods
after a three-month

11:36.462 --> 11:37.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
operation.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, people cheered and took
pictures with
soldiers.

11:40.466 --> 11:45.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And commanders talked of the
coming operation
to liberate western Mosul.

GEN.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TALIB SHAGHATI, Iraqi Commander
(through translator):
In the last few days, our
forces' movements

11:49.542 --> 11:52.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
became quicker and the clearing
of districts
became faster.

11:52.645 --> 11:55.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reason is that, when they
were defeated,
they retreated.

11:55.448 --> 11:58.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the western side will be
easier to
liberate from the eastern side.

11:58.918 --> 12:03.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Despite the
military's announcement,
there were reports of continued
fighting in

12:03.489 --> 12:05.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mosul's eastern half.

12:05.725 --> 12:10.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the U.S.
Supreme Court
will decide whether barring
racially offensive

12:10.196 --> 12:13.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trademarks violates free speech.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The justices heard arguments
today over a
70-year-old law.

12:16.202 --> 12:21.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is being challenged by an
Asian-American
band named The Slants.

12:21.608 --> 12:26.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ultimate decision could also
affect the
National Football League's
Washington Redskins.

12:26.579 --> 12:32.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Secret Service has
agreed to pay
$24 million to settle a
long-running racial

12:32.952 --> 12:34.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
discrimination lawsuit.

12:34.821 --> 12:40.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 100 African-American
agents are
part of a suit filed back in
2000.

12:40.226 --> 12:45.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say the agency group
routinely promoted
whites over qualified blacks.

12:45.632 --> 12:50.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Under the settlement, the Secret
Service doesn't
admit any wrongdoing.

12:50.069 --> 12:55.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average
lost 22 points to close at
19804.

12:55.842 --> 13:01.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly 17
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added four.

13:01.848 --> 13:07.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And former President George H.W.
Bush and
his wife, Barbara, are both
hospitalized in

13:07.553 --> 13:09.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Houston this evening.

13:09.355 --> 13:13.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Bush was admitted Saturday
with pneumonia,
and he moved into the intensive
care unit

13:13.826 --> 13:14.794 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

13:14.827 --> 13:17.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A spokesman says he's stable.

13:17.096 --> 13:22.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mrs. Bush entered the same
hospital today,
as a precaution, they said, for
fatigue and

13:22.702 --> 13:24.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coughing.

13:24.537 --> 13:28.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
several Trump
Cabinet nominees face tough
questioning at

13:28.708 --> 13:37.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their confirmation hearings; the
exciting,
yet elusive possibilities of
nuclear fusion;

13:37.550 --> 13:47.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We turn now to the confirmation
hearings for
the president-elect's Cabinet.

13:50.830 --> 13:56.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of Mr. Trump's most repeated
pledges is
to repeal and replace Obamacare,
officially

13:56.936 --> 13:58.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
known as the Affordable Care
Act.

13:58.838 --> 14:04.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His nominee to head the Health

Department, Representative Tom
Price, faced

14:04.143 --> 14:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aggressive questioning today

before the Senate Committee on
Health, Education,

Labor and Pensions.

14:10.983 --> 14:12.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has our report.

14:12.919 --> 14:18.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: When Tom Price,

and hopeful health secretary,
today faced

14:18.257 --> 14:22.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Senate Health Committee, the
spotlight
fell equally on the fate of the

on Price's

I made, yes.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Price stressed
that other
health stocks he owned were
chosen by his

14:50.556 --> 14:52.558 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
broker.

14:52.592 --> 14:56.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The questions arise from his
financial disclosures,
showing Price invested in
health-related companies

14:56.929 --> 15:02.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

were consistent with what he's
done for years,

17:03.723 --> 17:05.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interest.

17:05.458 --> 17:09.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Office of Government Ethics
has looked
at our holdings and given advice
about what

17:09.662 --> 17:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would need to be done in terms
of divesting
from certain stock holdings.

17:12.965 --> 17:17.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As part of the
nomination
ethics process, Price has
pledged to divest

17:17.103 --> 17:23.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from 43 companies, including
those the Democrats
raised, within 90 days of his
confirmation.

REP.

17:24.844 --> 17:27.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM PRICE: I think some of the
things that
have occurred with the passage
of the ACA

17:27.046 --> 17:29.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have improved certain areas.

17:29.148 --> 17:31.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The coverage is certainly
improved.

17:31.183 --> 17:34.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the consequences of that, I
mean, that
many people, as I have mentioned
before, have

17:34.687 --> 17:36.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coverage, but they don't have
care.

17:36.589 --> 17:40.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think that the more
involvement that patients
and families and doctors can
have in medical

17:40.092 --> 17:41.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decisions, the higher-quality
care we will
have.

17:41.861 --> 17:46.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Mr. Price, who
practiced
as an orthopedic surgeon for
more than two

17:46.232 --> 17:51.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decades, proposed his own
detailed plan last
year, offering some tax credits
and repealing

17:51.837 --> 17:53.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Medicaid expansion.

17:53.673 --> 17:58.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To him, that means less
government interference,
but to Senator Elizabeth Warren,
a Democrat,

17:58.844 --> 18:00.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it means cuts to needy
populations.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.481 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM PRICE: What we believe is
appropriate
is to make certain that the
individuals receiving

18:04.684 --> 18:06.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the care are actually receiving
care.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.054 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WARREN (D),
Massachusetts: I understand
why you think you're right to
cut it.

18:09.221 --> 18:10.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm just asking the question.

18:11.023 --> 18:15.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did you propose to cut more than
a trillion
dollars out of Medicaid over the
next 10 years?

18:15.461 --> 18:16.429 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOM PRICE: You have the numbers
before you.

18:18.364 --> 18:22.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Mr. Price
insisted that a
Republican replacement plan
would ensure widespread

18:22.034 --> 18:23.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
access to care.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.037 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM PRICE: My role in Congress
was to always
make certain that individuals
had the opportunity

18:27.573 --> 18:31.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to gain access to the kind of
coverage that
they that they desired and that
they had the

18:31.644 --> 18:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
financial feasibility to do so.

18:33.612 --> 18:37.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But access,
Senator Bernie
Sanders said, is not the same as
coverage.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.318 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:39.352 --> 18:40.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS (I), Vermont: I
have access
to buying a $10 million home.

18:40.586 --> 18:42.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't have the money to do
that.

18:42.221 --> 18:45.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Price next goes
before the
Senate Finance Committee on
Tuesday.

18:45.825 --> 18:50.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Scott Pruitt also
took his
turn in the hot seat today.

18:50.663 --> 18:55.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If confirmed, he would be the
new head of
the Environmental Protection
Agency, and the

18:55.868 --> 19:01.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president-elect has said he
wants him to reverse
eight years of what he calls of
President

19:01.040 --> 19:03.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Obama's environmental policies.

19:03.275 --> 19:06.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats wanted to see just how
far he plans
to go.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has that story.

19:08.314 --> 19:13.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As the hearing
began, Democrats
focused on today's announcement
from NASA

19:13.819 --> 19:19.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scientists that the Earth had
seen record
temperatures for a third
straight year.

19:19.225 --> 19:20.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This exchange followed.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.194 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:22.228 --> 19:24.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EDWARD MARKEY (D),
Massachusetts: Donald Trump
has called global warming a hoax
caused by

19:24.230 --> 19:25.398 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Chinese.

19:25.431 --> 19:28.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you agree that global warming
is a hoax?

19:28.534 --> 19:29.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SCOTT PRUITT (R), EPA
Administrator Nominee:
I do not, Senator.

19:29.835 --> 19:30.803 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EDWARD MARKEY: So, Donald Trump
is wrong?

19:32.171 --> 19:34.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT PRUITT: I do not believe
that climate
change is a hoax.

19:34.040 --> 19:38.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But, in his
opening statement,
Scott Pruitt had an important
caveat.

19:38.544 --> 19:42.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT PRUITT: Science tells us
that the climate
is changing and that human
activity in some

19:42.515 --> 19:44.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
manner impacts that change.

19:44.617 --> 19:48.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ability to measure with
precision the
degree and extent of that impact
and what

19:48.354 --> 19:52.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do about it are subject to
continued debate
and dialogue, and well it should
be.

19:52.358 --> 19:56.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Pruitt made clear
he does believe
strongly in states' rights, and
said he'd

19:56.962 --> 20:01.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work to return the federal
watchdog to what
he considers its proper role.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SCOTT PRUITT: Federalism
matters.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It matters because Congress says
so.

20:05.471 --> 20:10.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because we need it to
achieve good outcomes
as a nation for air and water
quality, we

20:10.042 --> 20:12.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need the partnership of the
states to achieve
that.

20:12.778 --> 20:17.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is our state regulators who
oftentimes
best understand the local needs
and the uniqueness

20:17.616 --> 20:19.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of our environmental challenges.

20:19.452 --> 20:24.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As Oklahoma
attorney general,
Pruitt filed 14 lawsuits against
the EPA and

20:24.824 --> 20:28.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an array of Obama administration
environmental
rules.

20:28.294 --> 20:32.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in the past, he's said he
will work to
repeal the president's
centerpiece climate

20:32.565 --> 20:36.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regulation cutting carbon
emissions from power
plants.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, several Democrats raised
concerns over
the health ramifications.

20:39.705 --> 20:41.440 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D), New
York: We have
had children die in New York
City because

20:43.609 --> 20:47.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
none of their teachers, no
administrators
in the schools knew what to do
when a child

20:47.279 --> 20:48.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has an asthma attack.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a huge problem.

20:50.516 --> 20:55.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I need you to care about
human health
and really believe that the cost
when human

20:55.955 --> 21:02.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health is at risk, when people
are dying is
far higher than it is the cost
to that polluter

21:02.261 --> 21:04.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to clean up the air and change
their processes.

21:04.663 --> 21:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I need you to feel it as if your
children
sitting behind you are the ones
in the emergency

21:09.535 --> 21:10.503 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
room.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I need you to know it.

21:12.304 --> 21:13.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT PRUITT: And, Senator, I
would say to
you there are certain instances
where cost

21:13.906 --> 21:15.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can't even be considered, as you
know.

21:15.674 --> 21:18.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those criteria pollutants under
our NAAQS
program, cost is not even a
factor, because

21:18.777 --> 21:21.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
human health is the focus.

21:21.347 --> 21:27.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Environmental
protesters interrupted
the proceedings several times.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One was forcibly removed into
the hallway.

21:30.256 --> 21:35.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At various points, some
Democrats showed their
irritation at what they saw as
Pruitt's vague

21:35.995 --> 21:37.730 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
responses.

21:37.763 --> 21:42.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For their part, though,
Republicans praised
Pruitt for his work in Oklahoma,
including

21:42.101 --> 21:47.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his handling of a dispute
involving poultry
industry runoff into the
Illinois River.

21:48.007 --> 21:53.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pruitt negotiated a deal and
ordered further
study, ending the legal fight.

21:53.179 --> 21:58.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats pointed to campaign
contributions
Pruitt had received from poultry
company officials.

21:58.684 --> 22:04.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Republicans focused on what
they see as
economic harm and bureaucratic
barriers raised

22:04.323 --> 22:06.158 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by the EPA.

22:06.192 --> 22:07.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican Senator Deb Fischer
of Nebraska:

22:07.927 --> 22:09.695 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:09.728 --> 22:12.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEB FISCHER (R), Nebraska: As a
result of
the activist role the EPA has
played for the

22:12.198 --> 22:18.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
past eight years, families are
concerned about
the futures of their livelihood.

22:18.137 --> 22:25.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What steps will you take as the
EPA administrator
to provide relief for American
families that

22:25.110 --> 22:28.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are faced truly with an
onslaught of EPA rules?

22:28.681 --> 22:32.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT PRUITT: Well, it's very
important that
that process be adhered to, to
give voice

22:32.251 --> 22:37.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to all Americans in balancing
the environmental
objectives we have, but also the
economic

22:37.189 --> 22:38.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
harm that results.

22:38.657 --> 22:41.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Supreme Court has spoken
about that
rather consistently of late.

22:41.994 --> 22:46.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would seek to lead the EPA
in such a
way to ensure that openness and
transparency.

22:46.632 --> 22:51.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Scott Pruitt is
expected to
confirmed by the full Senate,
with support

22:51.103 --> 22:53.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from all 51 Senate Republicans.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown.

22:56.275 --> 23:01.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We also want to
follow up on
the confirmation hearing for the
president-elect's

23:01.280 --> 23:04.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pick for education secretary,
Betsy DeVos.

23:04.083 --> 23:09.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, we told you about
some of her
ideas, but after our broadcast,
we learned

23:09.521 --> 23:12.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more, as her hearing continued
into the evening.

23:12.424 --> 23:17.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When pressed, she said she
wouldn't rule out
using public funds for private
schools.

23:17.696 --> 23:21.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She also seemed opposed to free
tuition for
community college.

23:21.400 --> 23:27.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She was asked about her
commitment to civil
rights for students who are
LGBTQ and past

23:27.606 --> 23:31.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contributions to groups that are
opposed to
same-sex marriage.

23:31.744 --> 23:37.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She also faced a tough exchange
from Democratic
Senator Chris Murphy of
Connecticut on whether

23:37.249 --> 23:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guns should be carried on
schools campuses.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.553 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

23:41.587 --> 23:43.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS MURPHY (D), Connecticut:
One final question:
Do you think that guns have any
place in or

23:43.822 --> 23:45.557 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
around schools?

23:45.591 --> 23:48.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETSY DEVOS, Education Secretary
Nominee:
I think that's best left to
locales and states

23:48.294 --> 23:51.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to decide.

23:51.997 --> 23:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
If the underlying question is...

23:53.899 --> 23:55.634 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS MURPHY: You can't say that
-- you can't
say definitively today that guns
shouldn't

23:57.636 --> 23:59.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be in schools?

23:59.505 --> 24:05.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETSY DEVOS: Well, I will refer
back to Senator
Enzi and the school that he was
talking about

24:05.344 --> 24:07.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Wapiti, Wyoming.

24:07.246 --> 24:13.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think probably there, I would
imagine that
there's probably a gun in the
school to protect

24:13.452 --> 24:14.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from potential grizzlies.

24:14.586 --> 24:16.422 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

24:16.455 --> 24:20.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS MURPHY: If President Trump
moves forward
with his plan to ban gun-free
school zones,

24:20.326 --> 24:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will you support that proposal?

24:21.627 --> 24:25.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETSY DEVOS: I will support what
the president-elect
does.

24:25.798 --> 24:34.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Senator, if the question is
around gun
violence and the results of
that, please know

24:34.640 --> 24:45.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I -- my heart bleeds and is
broken for
those families that have lost
any individual

24:45.784 --> 24:46.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
due to gun violence.

24:46.785 --> 24:48.520 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

24:48.554 --> 24:49.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS MURPHY: I look forward to
working with
you, but I also look forward to
you coming

24:49.822 --> 24:52.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Connecticut and talking about
the role
of guns in schools.

24:52.057 --> 24:57.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: DeVos was also
asked repeatedly
about how she would enforce the
disabilities

24:57.429 --> 24:59.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
law for education.

24:59.098 --> 25:03.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At times, she didn't seem
certain about some
of the law's provisions.

25:03.202 --> 25:07.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, a
Democrat
and the former vice presidential
nominee,

25:07.573 --> 25:08.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
led off this exchange.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.309 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

25:10.342 --> 25:13.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE (D), Virginia: Should
all schools
that receive taxpayer funding be
required

25:13.512 --> 25:17.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to meet the requirements of the
Individuals
with Disabilities in Education
Act?

25:17.950 --> 25:20.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETSY DEVOS: I think that's a
matter that's
best left to the states.

25:20.819 --> 25:22.621 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

25:22.654 --> 25:25.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE: So, states might --
some states
might be good to kids with
disabilities, and

25:25.424 --> 25:28.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other states might not be so
good, and then,
what, people could just move
around the country

25:28.761 --> 25:30.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they don't like how their
kids are being
treated?

25:30.396 --> 25:33.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETSY DEVOS: I think that's an
issue that
is best left to the states.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE: Let me state this.

25:36.101 --> 25:38.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think all schools that receive
federal funding,
public, charter, or private,
should be required

25:38.637 --> 25:42.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to meet the conditions oft
Individuals With
Disabilities and Education Act.

25:42.408 --> 25:43.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you agree with me or not?

25:43.642 --> 25:47.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETSY DEVOS: I think that's
certainly worth
discussion.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.080 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I would look forward to...

25:48.113 --> 25:49.081 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

25:49.114 --> 25:50.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIM KAINE: So, you cannot yet
agree with me?

25:50.315 --> 25:52.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was at
DeVos' hearing
last night.

25:52.251 --> 25:55.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's wrap up all of this
with a look
at where things stand for the
Trump Cabinet.

25:55.721 --> 26:00.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, for that, we're joined once
again by
the "NewsHour"'s Lisa Desjardins
on Capitol

26:00.459 --> 26:02.594 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hill.

26:02.628 --> 26:06.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Lisa, there is also news
today about president-elect
Trump's pick to be head of the
Office of Management

26:06.899 --> 26:07.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Budget.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Someone not even with a hearing
today is making
the headlines.

26:10.636 --> 26:13.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's Representative Mick
Mulvaney of South
Carolina.

26:13.839 --> 26:19.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now know that Representative
Mulvaney in
the early 2000s failed to pay
taxes for one

26:19.178 --> 26:20.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of his household employees.

26:21.013 --> 26:26.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a baby-sitter, a child
care provider
for he and his wife's three
triplets at the

26:26.985 --> 26:28.687 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mulvaney disclosed this
information to the
Senate Budget Committee about a
month ago,

26:30.656 --> 26:31.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we are told.

26:31.790 --> 26:35.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he has then paid some back
taxes, about
$15,000.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's waiting for the bill from
his state as
well.

26:37.729 --> 26:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, I don't need to tell
our viewers
this is significant, because
issues like this

26:41.433 --> 26:46.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have completely scuttled
nominations for others,
including also another former
member of Congress,

26:46.939 --> 26:53.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tom Daschle, who was the nominee
for HHS secretary,
and also Zoe Baird, under
President Clinton,

26:53.245 --> 26:55.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who was the nominee for attorney
general.

26:55.814 --> 26:59.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are not hearing anything yet
from Senate
Republicans.

26:59.384 --> 27:02.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate Democrats are going after
this very
strongly.

27:02.354 --> 27:06.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I did talk to Senator John
McCain, who is
the chairman of the Armed
Services Committee.

27:06.725 --> 27:09.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He told me he thinks this is
fairly serious.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, one
other thing.

27:11.396 --> 27:15.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You were telling me earlier that
there are
some pretty serious negotiations
going on

27:15.400 --> 27:20.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now between the Democratic
and the Republican
leaders in the Senate over the
order that

27:20.339 --> 27:22.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these nominees will have a
confirmation vote.

27:22.774 --> 27:26.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right,
and specifically
how many of these Cabinet
secretaries are

27:26.211 --> 27:27.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
confirmed on day one.

27:27.779 --> 27:31.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that is something that
president-elect
Trump has been measuring.

27:31.116 --> 27:35.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know that he's been
looking at President
Obama's number, which was seven
confirmations

27:35.354 --> 27:36.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on day one.

27:36.722 --> 27:38.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, Judy, it doesn't look
like he will
come close to that.

27:38.924 --> 27:43.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In fact, Democrats are
negotiating over whether
they will allow any nominees to
be confirmed

27:43.161 --> 27:44.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on day one.

27:44.596 --> 27:49.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can hold up a nomination
over the course
of a single day or more.

27:49.334 --> 27:52.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're talking about the
doubts they
have and the problems they have
with what

27:52.237 --> 27:56.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they say the way these
confirmation hearings
have been rushed through.

27:56.275 --> 28:00.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans say that's not fair,
and they
want the same treatment the
Obama nominees

28:00.078 --> 28:01.914 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
received.

28:01.947 --> 28:04.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what's important to
watch for, Judy,
is especially the Defense on
Homeland Security

28:04.449 --> 28:05.417 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
positions.

28:05.450 --> 28:06.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those are the most important to
Republicans.

28:06.885 --> 28:09.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will see if any of those are
confirmed
on day one.

28:09.988 --> 28:14.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are all -- all of that is
in the air
even just two days out from
inauguration.

28:14.426 --> 28:17.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot to follow,
Lisa Desjardins.

28:17.329 --> 28:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Correct.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins,
thanks very
much.

28:24.136 --> 28:28.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

the United States, day one of a

28:50.662 --> 28:55.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": an
entirely new
level of gridlock in New York
City surrounding

28:55.968 --> 29:02.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump Tower; and the importance
of treating
health problems over long
periods of time.

29:02.307 --> 29:05.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But first: the hunt to create
fusion energy.

29:06.011 --> 29:10.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While many people remain worried
about pursuing
further development of nuclear
power, some

29:10.749 --> 29:16.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
researchers believe nuclear
fusion could hold
the key to clean and plentiful
energy.

29:16.088 --> 29:20.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been many false
starts before,
but some scientists see real
reason for hope

29:20.759 --> 29:23.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that this path will eventually
pay off.

29:23.729 --> 29:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien has a report for
our weekly
segment The Leading Edge, a
co-production

29:28.100 --> 29:32.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this case with "NOVA" and his
special "The
Nuclear Option."

29:32.170 --> 29:38.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In Southern
California, this
complex, power-hungry machine is
hard at work

29:38.944 --> 29:44.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a seemingly quixotic mission,
akin to catching
lightning in a bottle.

29:44.750 --> 29:47.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is a plasma generator.

29:47.119 --> 29:52.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its builders hope it's a key
step in the long
journey to the Holy Grail of
energy production:

29:52.157 --> 29:53.892 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fusion.

29:53.925 --> 29:56.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHL BINDERBAUER, CTO, Tri
Alpha Energy:
Fusion is nature's preferred way
of making

29:56.461 --> 29:58.096 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
power.

29:58.130 --> 30:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Michl Binderbauer
is chief
technology officer for a startup
called Tri

30:02.034 --> 30:06.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alpha Energy that is making a
$500 million
bet on fusion.

30:06.705 --> 30:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHL BINDERBAUER: Think of this
like a mini-sun,
a very hot mini-sun, and it
radiates.

30:10.709 --> 30:15.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's that radiation that is
intercepted
on the surface of the machine,
and then it

30:15.180 --> 30:18.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
becomes heat, and then you can
process that
into electricity.

30:18.050 --> 30:23.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The promise, no
less than limitless
power, with virtually no
greenhouse gases

30:23.689 --> 30:27.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or radioactive waste.

30:27.392 --> 30:31.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If that sounds too good to be
true, it is.

30:31.396 --> 30:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No one knows that better than
nuclear engineer
Steve Dean.

30:34.900 --> 30:37.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STEVE DEAN, Fusion Power
Associates: Fusion
is not low-tech.

30:37.536 --> 30:45.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not going to be easy to
prove that it's
reliable, maintainable,
cost-effective, because

30:45.310 --> 30:47.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it is complicated.

30:47.045 --> 30:51.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Dean is president
of Fusion
Power Associates, a foundation
focused on

30:51.717 --> 30:53.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
research and education.

30:53.618 --> 30:59.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He joined the fusion industry in
1962, working
for the U.S. Atomic Energy
Commission, which

30:59.491 --> 31:02.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coordinated and funded the U.S.
fusion effort.

31:02.761 --> 31:07.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE DEAN: To me, it seemed
like it was something
I could spend my career on, and
we would have

31:07.432 --> 31:10.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
electricity on the grid by the
time I retired.

31:10.535 --> 31:11.503 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:11.536 --> 31:13.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE DEAN: That's what I
thought.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it didn't happen that way.

31:14.906 --> 31:18.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Fusion is as old
as the cosmos.

31:18.543 --> 31:22.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is the nuclear reaction that
takes place
in our sun and all the other
stars in the

31:22.914 --> 31:24.850 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
universe.

31:24.883 --> 31:30.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a fusion reaction, hydrogen
atoms collide
at high speed, fusing together,
forming a

31:30.489 --> 31:33.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helium atom, releasing one
neutron.

31:33.592 --> 31:38.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since the mass of the helium
atom is less
than the combined mass of the
two atoms that

31:38.764 --> 31:42.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
collided in the first place,
energy is released.

31:42.934 --> 31:50.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The dawn of manmade fusion broke
over the
Pacific in 1952, with the first
explosion

31:50.609 --> 31:51.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a hydrogen bomb.

31:51.843 --> 31:54.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHL BINDERBAUER: The hydrogen
bomb was a
quick success.

31:54.346 --> 31:55.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so a derivative of that was
euphoria.

31:55.847 --> 31:59.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a few more years, we could do
civilian
energy production out of fusion.

31:59.184 --> 32:03.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while there were glimmers of
hope along
the way, we all now know,
painfully, that

32:03.288 --> 32:05.257 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hasn't happened.

32:05.290 --> 32:10.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In the 1950s and
'60s, researchers
looked for ways to control,
confine and sustain

32:10.729 --> 32:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fusion so that it could be used
as an energy
source.

32:15.033 --> 32:21.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They tried newly invented
lasers, a U.S. design
called stellarator, and then a
Russian design

32:21.239 --> 32:27.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called tokamak, a big circular
racetrack that
uses powerful electromagnets to
suspend and

32:27.946 --> 32:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accelerate particles, prompting
fusion-generating
collisions.

32:32.818 --> 32:35.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the years, they have
gradually answered
many of the questions.

32:35.854 --> 32:40.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE DEAN: Right now, there are
still physics
issues that have to be proven,
but the physics

32:40.625 --> 32:42.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is very well-known.

32:42.427 --> 32:46.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only thing that isn't known
is, when you
do something that's a little bit
more closer

32:46.998 --> 32:50.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a power plant, whether
something new will
show up in the physics.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can't really predict that.

32:52.237 --> 32:55.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: That's what this
huge project
is all about.

32:55.307 --> 33:01.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is the biggest tokamak ever
designed, under
construction in France, the
International

33:01.546 --> 33:08.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thermonuclear Experimental
Reactor, or ITER,
a joint project of 35 nations,
including the

33:08.186 --> 33:09.621 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
U.S.,

33:09.654 --> 33:13.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the first engineering test
of a fusion
power plant.

33:13.692 --> 33:20.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ITER is a $14 billion endeavor
that is six
years late and $10 billion over
budget.

33:20.765 --> 33:26.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is designed to one day use 50
megawatts
of electricity to generate 500
megawatts for

33:26.905 --> 33:28.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
15 minutes.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE DEAN: At some point, in
order to get
to a power plant, you have to
build what we

33:31.810 --> 33:36.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
call an engineering test
reactor, or something
that really works, that's
putting out lots

33:36.381 --> 33:40.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of fusion energy and has a lot
of the engineering
that's needed for a power plant.

33:40.418 --> 33:46.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And ITER and the tokamak are the
-- is the
only track that's at that stage.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Three, two, one, zero.

33:49.828 --> 33:56.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But there is a
lot of fusion
progress on a smaller scale.

33:56.334 --> 34:03.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Teams in Germany, China and
South Korea have
recently reported longer,
sustained fusion

34:03.875 --> 34:07.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reactions than ever before.

34:07.145 --> 34:11.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tri Alpha is the largest of
about a dozen
startups trying to make it work.

34:11.316 --> 34:14.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHL BINDERBAUER: We partner up
with some
of the best and brightest in the
field.

34:14.619 --> 34:18.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Michl Binderbauer
began his
work in academia, but believes
the private

34:18.924 --> 34:21.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sector might have a better
chance of success.

34:21.793 --> 34:22.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHL BINDERBAUER: It made us
lean.

34:23.028 --> 34:24.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It made us focused.

34:24.829 --> 34:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It made us an organization that
was nimble
to react to small changes
quickly and think

34:29.501 --> 34:31.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on our feet very quickly.

34:31.202 --> 34:34.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would attribute part of
our success
to exactly that.

34:34.306 --> 34:40.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE DEAN: And they're also
building on many
more years of physics
understanding and progress.

34:40.512 --> 34:46.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they can be smarter now,
whereas, in
the past, a lot of times, their
ideas were

34:46.251 --> 34:53.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interesting, but there wasn't
any physics
basis for having confidence.

34:53.491 --> 34:58.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The fundamental
fusion problem
is, it is not easy to get nuclei
to collide

34:59.030 --> 35:00.732 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and fuse.

35:00.765 --> 35:04.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are all positively charged,
so they naturally
repel each other, like two
magnets.

35:04.836 --> 35:09.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHL BINDERBAUER: So, we use
magnetic fields
to provide that magnetic bottle,
if you will,

35:09.607 --> 35:12.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into which you put the charged
clouds of particles.

35:12.877 --> 35:18.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The gas wants to escape and
distribute out,
and we're holding that in with
magnetic force.

35:18.583 --> 35:21.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is not like how it's done
in the sun,
where you have massive gravity,
it does the

35:21.586 --> 35:22.554 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
same job.

35:22.587 --> 35:24.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, here, it's all
electromagnetic fields.

35:24.089 --> 35:27.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It takes a lot of
energy to
create those magnetic fields.

35:27.826 --> 35:33.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the real challenge in
fusion is creating
plasma that generates more
energy than it

35:33.965 --> 35:36.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
takes to make it in the first
place.

35:36.968 --> 35:40.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Historically, scientists have
opted to go
big, like ITER.

35:40.805 --> 35:46.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE DEAN: One event makes a
very small amount
of practical energy.

35:46.444 --> 35:49.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to have billions of
these events.

35:49.147 --> 35:53.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means you have lots of
things -- these
things happening in a large
volume.

35:53.184 --> 35:58.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Tri Alpha is
taking a different
approach that wouldn't require
such a huge

35:58.456 --> 36:00.225 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
structure.

36:00.258 --> 36:07.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The idea is to fire two
football-shaped plasma
clouds at each other at
supersonic speeds.

36:07.432 --> 36:12.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the center of the chamber,
they collide
violently, fusing into a larger
football.

36:12.771 --> 36:19.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Additional particles are fired
at right angles,
making the plasma ball spin like
a well-thrown

36:19.310 --> 36:21.079 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pass.

36:21.112 --> 36:22.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHL BINDERBAUER: The particles
always come
in like this, and they go into
the rotation

36:23.014 --> 36:24.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the main object.

36:24.282 --> 36:26.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it feeds in like this to
maintain that
rotation rate.

36:26.718 --> 36:32.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The rotation
suspends the plasma
in place.

36:32.323 --> 36:36.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are testing constantly,
sometimes 50
times a day.

36:37.028 --> 36:47.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each shot requires about 20
megawatts of electricity,
enough to power all the lights
and appliances

36:47.072 --> 36:53.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in 5,000 homes, but for only a
few-thousandths-of-a-second.

36:53.912 --> 36:58.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gleaning data from a hot ball of
nothing that
lasts for much, much less than
the blink of

36:58.750 --> 37:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an eye requires a lot of clever
testing tools.

37:02.120 --> 37:05.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHL BINDERBAUER: Ultimately,
physics is
an experimental science, right?

37:05.390 --> 37:09.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as such, it relies on
hard-core evidence
coming out of an experiment.

37:09.060 --> 37:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the stage where we are at, we
are dabbling
a fine line between learning
what works and

37:13.698 --> 37:16.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tweaking that and advancing it
another step.

37:16.134 --> 37:20.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Binderbauer
believes a commercial
fusion system will be available
in a decade.

37:21.005 --> 37:25.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHL BINDERBAUER: Our
great-great-great-grandkids
are going to live in a world
powered by fusion

37:25.743 --> 37:27.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
almost exclusively.

37:27.712 --> 37:33.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But industry
graybeards like
Steve Dean are less willing to
make such predictions.

37:33.852 --> 37:39.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After all, fusion energy has
remained decades
away for many decades.

37:39.591 --> 37:40.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is it inevitable, in your view?

37:40.592 --> 37:41.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STEVE DEAN: Yes.

37:41.593 --> 37:42.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Just a matter of
time?

37:42.694 --> 37:43.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE DEAN: I think it's just a
matter of
time.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I used to say, in my lifetime.

37:45.563 --> 37:47.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then I started saying in my
children.

37:47.298 --> 37:53.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now I think, before it's of
wide-scale
use, it being at least my
grandchildren.

37:53.138 --> 37:54.105 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:54.139 --> 37:55.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVE DEAN: I can't predict.

37:55.974 --> 38:00.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Right now, we do
not have an
energy crisis to spur the
effort, but we do

38:00.879 --> 38:04.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have a climate crisis.

38:04.516 --> 38:10.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fusion remains an alluring, yet
still elusive
way to power the planet the same
way nature

38:10.488 --> 38:11.990 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
does.

JUDY WOODRUFF: With just a
couple days left
until the inauguration, much of
the nation's

38:32.443 --> 38:36.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attention is on president-elect
Trump's move
into the White House.

38:36.748 --> 38:42.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Midtown Manhattan residents
are still
focusing on the gold skyscraper
of Trump Tower,

38:42.887 --> 38:46.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which will continue to be a home

38:51.763 --> 38:53.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the financial fallout.

38:53.665 --> 39:01.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RHANA NATOUR: This is the new
reality along
the storied Fifth Avenue in
Midtown Manhattan,

39:01.105 --> 39:06.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dogs, chains, and intense
security.

39:06.077 --> 39:11.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect has used
Trump Tower as
a base for transition meetings
since the election,

39:11.216 --> 39:16.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and while he will relocate to

after the inaugural, his wife,
Melania, and

39:16.087 --> 39:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10-year-old son Barron plan to

39:36.241 --> 39:38.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is happening here?

39:38.076 --> 39:40.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVY POUMPOURAS, Former U.S.
Secret Service
Agent: So, we want to control
what's coming

39:40.078 --> 39:42.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into the area of Trump Tower.

39:42.447 --> 39:47.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the biggest issues
are large vehicles
that can actually have large
amounts of an

39:47.085 --> 39:48.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
explosive.

39:48.653 --> 39:51.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a truck would be a perfect
thing, a perfect
IED, a vehicle device, to use.

39:51.589 --> 39:54.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what they will do is, you
will typically
have the vehicle stopped.

39:54.826 --> 39:58.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will search the vehicle,
make sure there's
nothing inside the vehicle,
underneath the

39:59.030 --> 40:00.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
vehicle, make sure it's clean.

40:00.965 --> 40:07.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RHANA NATOUR: Trump Tower
stretches 57 stories,
with 26 floors of offices, three
retail stores

40:07.138 --> 40:08.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and hundreds of tenants.

40:08.773 --> 40:13.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is also surrounded by other
skyscrapers,
compounding the security
challenge.

40:13.578 --> 40:17.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVY POUMPOURAS: Right now,
planes aren't allowed
to fly over Trump Tower, same
thing that happens

40:17.582 --> 40:18.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over at the White House.

40:18.816 --> 40:20.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But then you have that variable.

40:20.518 --> 40:21.486 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's up top.

40:21.519 --> 40:22.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's high on the floor.

40:22.620 --> 40:24.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Planes are a concern.

40:24.055 --> 40:27.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RHANA NATOUR: And, as technology
evolves,
there are ever greater risks.

40:27.292 --> 40:29.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EVY POUMPOURAS: Drones.

40:29.093 --> 40:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can somebody use a drone, not
just to go up
there and, you know what, I want
to see the

40:32.930 --> 40:34.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
future president?

40:34.766 --> 40:38.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You can actually strap
explosives, weapons
to those drones, fly them up,
and then cause

40:38.970 --> 40:40.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
harm in that way.

40:40.772 --> 40:46.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then also even
cyber-security, radiation,
contamination in the air,
chemical -- any

40:46.444 --> 40:52.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
type of chemical airborne
attack, that's also
an issue.

40:52.850 --> 40:54.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The tower itself, one of the
things we look
at is what we call the HVAC
system, which

40:54.852 --> 40:56.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is where the air intake system
is.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's super dangerous as well.

40:58.690 --> 41:02.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RHANA NATOUR: While the Secret
Service is
working on threats from within
the tower,

41:03.027 --> 41:07.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the New York Police Department
guards the
exterior and directs traffic in
the four-block

41:07.465 --> 41:10.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
radius where the vehicles are
being limited.

41:10.034 --> 41:14.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The protective measures are
causing a dramatic
slowdown in business here, where
the rents

41:14.339 --> 41:17.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are among the highest in the
world.

41:17.041 --> 41:22.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tiffany and Company reporting
this week that
its Fifth Avenue store dropped
14 percent

41:22.213 --> 41:27.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the end of 2016, in part due
to the traffic
disruption.

41:27.819 --> 41:32.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Robert Smith runs operations for
Uncle Jack's
Steakhouse, which has developed
a faithful

41:32.323 --> 41:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
following for years on West 56th
Street, within
view of Trump Tower.

41:37.161 --> 41:41.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The owner was so excited by the
Trump win
that he named menu items after
him.

41:41.132 --> 41:43.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT SMITH, Uncle Jack's
Steakhouse: We
were down 20 percent right off
the bat, right

41:43.401 --> 41:45.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after the election.

41:45.169 --> 41:48.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once the security came in,
barricades went
up.

41:48.906 --> 41:51.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People weren't allowed to walk
into the restaurant
or even near the block.

41:51.743 --> 41:54.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RHANA NATOUR: What have you been
hearing from
your regular customers?

41:54.145 --> 41:58.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT SMITH: Obviously, my
regular clientele
isn't coming in as often as they
used to.

41:58.516 --> 42:02.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had bar clientele at lunch
that would come
every day, but that don't.

42:02.920 --> 42:08.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a lot of tourists that
come, very
tourist-central-located
neighborhood.

42:08.726 --> 42:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of them don't even
want to get anywhere
near barricades and dogs and
giant police

42:16.033 --> 42:17.201 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bomb trucks.

42:17.235 --> 42:19.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it doesn't make anybody want
to come near
the place.

42:19.404 --> 42:24.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RHANA NATOUR: A short distance
away, on Sixth
Avenue, Jimmie Tarzy at Allen M.
Jewelers

42:24.275 --> 42:28.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says he has been losing 30 to 50
percent on
any given week.

42:28.146 --> 42:32.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He worries about what will
happen to business
if Trump returns to his
penthouse residence

42:32.383 --> 42:33.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
each weekend.

42:33.885 --> 42:36.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIMMY TARZY, Allen M. Jewelers:
You have to
take precautionary measures.

42:36.287 --> 42:38.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I can understand that.

42:38.089 --> 42:39.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I really do.

42:39.924 --> 42:45.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But being the president, or
president-elect,
you have to say to yourself,
you're supposed

42:45.496 --> 42:46.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to do for the people.

42:46.864 --> 42:48.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Go live in Washington.

42:48.199 --> 42:52.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RHANA NATOUR: Some are calling
Trump Tower
White House North.

42:52.203 --> 42:57.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Exactly how security will be
transformed here
is still a work in progress.

42:57.041 --> 43:01.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a New York City Council
meeting last week,
questions on how to prepare and
who should

43:01.212 --> 43:03.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pay went unanswered by NYPD
officials.

43:03.881 --> 43:08.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Does the Secret Service
have the right
to close down a street on its
own?

43:08.186 --> 43:09.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: I'm not sure.

43:09.954 --> 43:18.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: If the NYPD were to decline
to provide
service in and around Trump
Tower because

43:18.229 --> 43:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of cost or lack of reimbursement
or whatever,
what would happen then?

43:22.767 --> 43:25.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: I'm unable to answer that
question.

43:25.336 --> 43:29.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We have to have some idea
of how much
is it going to cost, because,
right now, we

43:29.841 --> 43:35.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are just spending with an
unlimited credit,
really, and hoping that maybe
the federal

43:35.513 --> 43:37.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
government will pay, maybe not.

43:37.682 --> 43:42.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RHANA NATOUR: The NYPD estimates
that, for
every day the president resides
in Trump Tower,

43:42.386 --> 43:45.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it costs the city $500,000.

43:45.590 --> 43:51.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far, Congress has agreed to
reimburse New
York City $7 million for the
cost of providing

43:51.095 --> 43:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NYPD security to Trump Tower and
the surrounding
area.

43:55.299 --> 44:01.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is far less, however, than
the $35 million
the city initially requested.

44:01.272 --> 44:04.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Councilman Dan Garodnick, who
represents the
Trump Tower neighborhood,
objects.

44:04.475 --> 44:08.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN GARODNICK, New York City
Councilman: Why
is New York City bearing the
cost of security

44:08.813 --> 44:10.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the president-elect?

44:10.681 --> 44:16.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have some very significant
businesses on
Fifth Avenue that employ
hundreds of New Yorkers

44:16.888 --> 44:18.589 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
each.

44:18.623 --> 44:23.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we want to make sure that
these jobs and
these businesses do not become a
casualty

44:23.160 --> 44:24.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Trump presidency here.

44:24.996 --> 44:29.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RHANA NATOUR: It's a balancing
act between
keeping the legendary business
district humming

44:29.567 --> 44:33.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and protecting the first family
living at
the heart of it.

44:33.404 --> 44:41.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In New York City, I'm Rhana
Natour for the
"PBS NewsHour."

44:41.579 --> 44:50.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
a conversation
about changing the way we think
about health

44:50.888 --> 44:52.657 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

44:52.690 --> 44:56.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an article in the latest
issue of "The
New Yorker," Dr. Atul Gawande, a
surgeon and

44:56.961 --> 45:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
author, makes the case for the
value of what
he calls incremental medicine to
deal with

45:02.300 --> 45:03.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
chronic conditions.

45:04.001 --> 45:08.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the kind of medicine less
heralded than
that using heroic measures.

45:08.639 --> 45:12.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William Brangham spoke with Dr.
Gawande recently
and asked him how health care is
changing.

45:12.376 --> 45:14.145 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

45:14.178 --> 45:15.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ATUL GAWANDE, "The New Yorker":
When you think
about the future of health care
and where

45:15.980 --> 45:21.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're going at this moment of
debate, there's
a transformation going on that
involves a

45:21.085 --> 45:25.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recognition that our focus in
medicine has
been on heroic interventions,
like the kind

45:25.856 --> 45:28.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that I do now as a surgeon.

45:28.225 --> 45:33.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the biggest gains are coming
right now
from incremental medicine, from
a commitment

45:34.031 --> 45:39.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the kind of steady, overtime
management
of complex problems like chronic
illnesses

45:39.637 --> 45:42.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that can add years to people's
lives.

45:42.406 --> 45:47.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that's work done by some of
the people
with the least resources in our
health care

45:47.345 --> 45:49.213 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system.

45:49.246 --> 45:51.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, who
practices incremental
medicine in our health care
system today?

45:51.816 --> 45:53.551 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

45:53.584 --> 45:55.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ATUL GAWANDE: Well, good
examples, just look
at the list of who the
lowest-paid people

45:55.786 --> 45:56.754 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

45:56.787 --> 45:58.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Pediatricians are at the bottom.

45:58.923 --> 46:00.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You would also look at
internists.

46:00.925 --> 46:02.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You would look at psychiatrists.

46:02.760 --> 46:08.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You would look at family
physicians, HIV specialists.

46:08.599 --> 46:14.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People who take care of chronic
illnesses
by seeing people carefully over
time, those

46:14.538 --> 46:16.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are the people who get the least
money.

46:16.807 --> 46:23.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people who have the most are
people like
orthopedic surgeons,
interventional cardiologists.

46:23.948 --> 46:29.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my point isn't that -- you
know, that
we're -- that there is something
wrong with

46:29.553 --> 46:31.355 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
heroism.

46:31.389 --> 46:37.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My own son has a congenital
heart condition,
where his life was saved by a
cardiac surgeon

46:37.495 --> 46:41.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stepping in at 11 days of life
to save his
life.

46:41.165 --> 46:47.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he is now 21 years old
because of constant
monitoring and working with him
with a primary

46:47.872 --> 46:53.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care physician and people who
controlled his
blood pressure, recognized
problems before

46:53.244 --> 46:57.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they arose, dealt with learning
issues that
were related to his condition.

46:57.314 --> 47:01.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the only reason now
that he's getting
to live a long and healthy life.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's what we're not rewarding.

47:03.621 --> 47:08.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't have the kind of
resources and
commitment that we are giving to
people like

47:08.726 --> 47:10.761 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

47:10.795 --> 47:13.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have millions of dollars of
equipment available
to me when I go to work every
day in an operating

47:13.931 --> 47:15.399 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
room.

47:15.433 --> 47:19.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The clinicians who keep my son
going are lucky
if they can have a nurse.

47:19.437 --> 47:25.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, if that
care is so valuable,
why are the incentives seemingly
going in

47:25.176 --> 47:26.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the opposite direction?

47:26.177 --> 47:27.978 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

47:28.012 --> 47:30.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ATUL GAWANDE: It's mainly
because our health
system was built at a time when
we couldn't

47:30.581 --> 47:32.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really do this kind of work.

47:32.416 --> 47:38.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Go back to the '30s, '40s, '50s,
and it was
the discovery of heroic
interventions, the

47:38.255 --> 47:47.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ability to cure people with
penicillin or
do an operation to stop disease
that was what

47:47.398 --> 47:49.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
saved the day.

47:49.200 --> 47:54.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Primary care physicians couldn't
do all that
much that really demonstrated a
difference.

47:54.338 --> 47:59.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we have had the data to
track people for
a long time, the computational
power that

47:59.110 --> 48:05.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recognized, you know what, high
blood pressure,
which we didn't even know was a
huge problem,

48:05.349 --> 48:09.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we discovered that it afflicts a
third of
all Americans, and it's our
biggest killer,

48:09.954 --> 48:15.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that years down in the future,
that that is
our cause of everything from not
only heart

48:15.993 --> 48:20.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disease, but dementia and of
kidney disease.

48:20.231 --> 48:26.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, the people who
control and work
with you to control your blood
pressure, they're

48:26.670 --> 48:29.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not rewarded for doing that or
to be innovative
about doing that.

48:29.140 --> 48:36.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the result is half of
Americans have uncontrolled
high blood pressure, despite
seeing clinicians.

48:36.213 --> 48:41.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Affordable
Care Act
tried to move the needle in this
direction,

48:41.085 --> 48:45.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to put more incentives towards
the exact kind
of care that you're talking
about.

48:45.256 --> 48:47.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How successful has that been,
that effort
been?

48:48.025 --> 48:49.126 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

48:49.160 --> 48:51.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ATUL GAWANDE: Here's what I
would describe
it as.

48:51.095 --> 48:56.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now have 30 percent, for
example, of Medicare
patients who are seeing doctors
who are rewarded

48:56.834 --> 49:01.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for doing this kind of work,
which is a dramatic
change from six or seven years
ago.

49:01.238 --> 49:06.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the Affordable Care Act has
pushed this
direction down the road.

49:06.710 --> 49:14.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has also offered protections
that allow
for preexisting conditions, as
people know,

49:14.552 --> 49:19.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that if you have preexisting
conditions like
my son does, that you're
provided coverage

49:19.990 --> 49:22.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and you can maintain steady
coverage.

49:22.226 --> 49:28.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's an important part of
being able
to stay in care and do better
over the long

49:28.532 --> 49:30.334 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
run.

49:30.367 --> 49:32.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, do you
think -- if the
Republicans and president-elect
Trump go forward

49:32.837 --> 49:37.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and repeal this, do you think
that some of
these incentives will stay in
it?

49:37.341 --> 49:40.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Or what do you fear coming down
the road?

49:40.744 --> 49:42.446 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

49:42.479 --> 49:45.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ATUL GAWANDE: My biggest fear --
so, first
of all, where we are right now,
27 percent

49:45.349 --> 49:52.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Americans under 65 have an
existing health
condition that, without the
protections of

49:52.523 --> 49:57.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ACA, would mean they would
-- could be
automatically excluded from
insurance coverage.

49:57.561 --> 50:02.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before the ACA, they wouldn't
have been able
to get insurance coverage on the
individual

50:02.066 --> 50:06.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
market, you know, if you're a
freelancer or
if you had a small business or
the like.

50:06.370 --> 50:07.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Because of
preexisting conditions?

50:07.438 --> 50:08.739 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

50:08.772 --> 50:10.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ATUL GAWANDE: Now that --
because of preexisting
conditions.

50:11.008 --> 50:18.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the first thing is that the
ACA protections
have to be preserved, or those
people get

50:18.349 --> 50:20.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pitched out.

50:20.150 --> 50:25.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the big thing that's
happened is, in the
time since the ACA has been
going on, our

50:25.489 --> 50:27.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
medical science has been
advancing.

50:27.224 --> 50:29.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have now genomic data.

50:29.793 --> 50:36.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have the power of big data
about what your
living patterns are, what's
happening in your

50:36.300 --> 50:38.035 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
body.

50:38.068 --> 50:42.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even your smartphone can collect
data about
your walking or your pulse or
other things

50:42.039 --> 50:47.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that could be incredibly
meaningful in being
able to predict whether you have
disease coming

50:47.111 --> 50:50.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the future and help avert
those problems.

50:50.180 --> 50:52.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is the transformation
that's coming.

50:52.416 --> 50:58.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one of the consequences of
if the ACA
is repealed, is that all of us
now are at

50:58.889 --> 51:03.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
risk of being a preexisting --
of having a
preexisting condition waiting to
happen.

51:03.928 --> 51:08.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Life, increasingly, is a
preexisting condition
waiting to happen, now that we
have more and

51:08.899 --> 51:10.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more of this data available.

51:10.701 --> 51:13.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Dr.
Atul Gawande
of "The New Yorker" magazine,
thank you so

51:13.470 --> 51:14.905 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

51:14.939 --> 51:16.373 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

51:16.407 --> 51:22.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ATUL GAWANDE: Thank you.

51:22.212 --> 51:30.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: As many as 200,000 people
are expected

51:30.054 --> 51:35.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to attend the Women's March on
Washington
the day after president-elect
Donald Trump

51:35.359 --> 51:37.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
takes the oath of office.

51:37.094 --> 51:42.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Organizers say it's a
nonpartisan event aimed
at a specific policy agenda.

51:42.399 --> 51:45.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We delve into the issues driving
the movement.

51:45.202 --> 51:49.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:49.807 --> 51:54.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later tonight on "Charlie Rose,"
Charlie sits
down with House Speaker Paul
Ryan.

51:54.611 --> 51:58.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, finally, a member of the
"NewsHour" family
has died.

51:58.682 --> 52:04.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Filmmaker and cameraman John
Knoop passed
away last week in El Cerrito,
California.

52:04.755 --> 52:11.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the 1990s, working with
correspondent Elizabeth
Farnsworth, he helped produce
and shoot more

52:11.395 --> 52:18.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than 30 documentary reports for
"The MacNeil/Lehrer
NewsHour" in Cambodia, Peru and
Haiti, among

52:18.335 --> 52:19.670 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other countries.

52:19.703 --> 52:22.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Knoop was 77 years old.

52:22.906 --> 52:24.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

52:24.808 --> 52:29.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Thursday, a Making Sense
report about what
life is like for middle-income
people on the

52:29.980 --> 52:33.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
edge of financial ruin, and
their efforts
to grapple with it.

52:33.784 --> 52:34.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

52:34.852 --> 52:36.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

52:36.754 --> 52:42.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

52:42.993 --> 52:46.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
