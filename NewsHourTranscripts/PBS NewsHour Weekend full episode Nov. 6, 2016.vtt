PEOPLE, WE WERE TOLD, AND WAS

FILLED TO CAPACITY AND THERE ARE

05:26.433 --> 05:27.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY THOUSANDS BEYOND OUTSIDE.

05:27.967 --> 05:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS KIND OF A STANDARD SPEECH

05:30.200 --> 05:31.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THIS POINT, TO THE CORE, TO

05:31.867 --> 05:32.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BASE.

05:32.367 --> 05:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE A

05:35.500 --> 05:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOT-- A LOT OF THE TRUMP CASE

05:38.000 --> 05:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS.

05:39.333 --> 05:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS HAS BEEN PART OF THE PEOPLE

05:40.333 --> 05:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING HIM

05:41.400 --> 05:42.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE BEGINNING.

05:42.367 --> 05:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE JOKED WHEN HE GOT HERE THAT

05:44.100 --> 05:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT HE DIDN'T

05:45.533 --> 05:46.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN REALLY HAVE TO COME HERE

05:46.867 --> 05:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TODAY.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT HE SAID, OF COURSE, I WANTED

05:49.067 --> 05:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO COME HERE BECAUSE I WANT TO

05:50.433 --> 05:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE WITH THE PEOPLE IN IOWA.

05:52.133 --> 05:53.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OF COURSE THE REASON WHY

05:53.167 --> 05:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY FEEL SO OPTIMISTIC IS

05:55.200 --> 05:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE OF THIS POLL THAT CAME

05:57.433 --> 05:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT LAST NIGHT THAT SHOWED TRUMP

05:59.900 --> 06:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP SEVEN PERCENTAGE POINTS HERE

06:01.633 --> 06:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN IOWA AND I THINK THAT

06:03.400 --> 06:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOOK EVERYBODY BY A BIT OF

06:04.500 --> 06:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURPRISE.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> LET'S LOOK AT THE PAST 20

06:06.400 --> 06:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS IN IOWA.

06:07.233 --> 06:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU GO BACK FROM 1996, THE

06:10.100 --> 06:13.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WINNERS WERE CLINTON, GORE,

06:13.167 --> 06:14.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSH, OBAMA, OBAMA.

06:14.867 --> 06:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHAT HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST

06:16.700 --> 06:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOUR YEARS THAT IOWA SEEMS

06:19.033 --> 06:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POISED TO GIVE ITS SECRETARIES

06:20.967 --> 06:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTORAL VOTES TO THE

06:22.500 --> 06:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE?

06:23.500 --> 06:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, IT'S TRUE.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS A STATE THAT HAS GONE

06:26.633 --> 06:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOSTLY FOR DEMOCRATIC

06:28.167 --> 06:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES BUT I

06:29.200 --> 06:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS YOU

06:30.300 --> 06:32.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE SEEN IOWA GENERALLY MOVING

06:32.067 --> 06:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE RED.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU SEE THAT IN THE STATE HOUSE,

06:35.700 --> 06:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STATE SENATE WHICH MAY GO

06:39.133 --> 06:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN THIS CAMPAIGN.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU SEE IT IN THE TWO SENATE

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEATS WHICH ARE BOTH REPUBLICAN.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND NOW IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IOWA

06:45.967 --> 06:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS GOING FULLY RED FOR THIS

06:48.000 --> 06:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

06:49.900 --> 06:53.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> JEFF BROWN FROM SIOUX CITY,

07:09.100 --> 07:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE 270 ELECTORAL VOTES NEEDED

07:10.233 --> 07:12.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE.

07:12.967 --> 07:14.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT RECENT HISTORY SHOULD GIVE

07:14.967 --> 07:16.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY CLINTON AN ADVANTAGE,

07:16.567 --> 07:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN VERY

07:17.500 --> 07:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNPREDICTABLE.
