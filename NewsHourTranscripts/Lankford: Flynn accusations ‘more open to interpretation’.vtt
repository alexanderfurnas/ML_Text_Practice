HARI SREENIVASAN: On Capitol
Hill today, current and
former U.S. government
officials testified

00:04.566 --> 00:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before members of the House and
Senate Intelligence Committees,
painting a clearer portrait of

00:10.733 --> 00:13.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how Russia meddled in
the 2016 U.S. elections.

00:13.233 --> 00:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A current FBI official told
the Senate Intelligence
Committee how the Russian
government directed

00:19.333 --> 00:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cyber-attacks to wage an
information campaign that
favored then-candidate Trump.

00:25.866 --> 00:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Homeland Security official
Jeanette Manfra also
offered new details on
how Russians attempted

00:30.133 --> 00:32.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to interfere with
state election systems.

00:32.600 --> 00:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEANETTE MANFRA, Department
of Homeland Security:
As of right now we have
evidence of 21 states

00:36.400 --> 00:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
- - or election-related systems
in 21 states that were targeted.

00:40.333 --> 00:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: But in no case were
actual vote tallies altered
in any way, shape, or form?

00:46.766 --> 00:48.833 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
JEANETTE MANFRA:
That is correct.

00:48.833 --> 00:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In a separate
and almost simultaneous hearing
before House Intelligence,

00:52.266 --> 00:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
former Secretary of Homeland
Security Jeh Johnson described
learning about Russian hacking

00:56.466 --> 01:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into Democratic National
Committee systems months
after the FBI became aware.

01:01.166 --> 01:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON, Former U.S.
Secretary of Homeland Security:
It had been some months before I

01:05.133 --> 01:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was learning of this that the
FBI and the DNC had been in
contact with each other about

01:10.600 --> 01:12.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I wasn't happy to
be learning about this
several months later.

01:14.900 --> 01:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Very clearly, I wasn't
pleased that we were not
in there helping them
patch this vulnerability.

01:22.600 --> 01:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We get more
on the Senate Intelligence
Committee's Russia investigation

01:26.700 --> 01:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now with one of its key
members, Senator James Lankford,
Republican from Oklahoma.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He joins us now
from Capitol Hill.

01:32.933 --> 01:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Senator, thanks for being here.

01:34.966 --> 01:39.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This afternoon, we heard
multiple DHS officials
say that they have
more and more evidence

01:41.700 --> 01:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Russia tried to interfere
in the campaigns or interfere
in the election systems in 21

01:44.166 --> 01:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
different states.

01:46.233 --> 01:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while they stress that
none of the votes were flipped
in any of these states, they

01:48.300 --> 01:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did say that some of these
intrusions kind of made it
past of the security systems.

01:52.666 --> 01:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, my question is, why
not release the information
on which states or which
localities were compromised?

01:58.166 --> 01:59.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:59.733 --> 02:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD (R), Oklahoma: So
the FBI has a very clear policy.

02:00.733 --> 02:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't expose victims.

02:02.833 --> 02:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they consider these
states to be victims of an
intrusion on the outside.

02:05.266 --> 02:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the states want to be able
to say that or if they want
to be able to release that,

02:09.000 --> 02:11.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
obviously, they're
welcome to do.

02:11.133 --> 02:15.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But for a location that
was actually attacked by
an outside force they're
not going to release

02:16.066 --> 02:17.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

02:17.266 --> 02:19.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some of those will
continue to come out.

02:19.366 --> 02:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of those states will say,
yes, we're one of the states,
and the list will eventually

02:21.433 --> 02:23.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come out.

02:23.533 --> 02:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You agree it's
important, regardless whether if
you're Democrat or Republican,

02:25.500 --> 02:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make sure that these
things are fixed, especially
between now and 2018?

02:27.933 --> 02:29.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:29.166 --> 02:31.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD:
Absolutely, it is.

02:31.166 --> 02:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were really three
simultaneous hearings today, one
in the House, two in the Senate,

02:33.666 --> 02:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both of them in the
Senate dealing with state
election systems and
also dealing with state

02:37.500 --> 02:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
penetrations from outside actors
trying to be able to reach
into multiple state agencies.

02:42.233 --> 02:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Since the
investigation into Russian
meddling began, has anything

02:46.433 --> 02:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
changed your opinion
in how serious this is?

02:48.933 --> 02:50.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: Oh, no, it
hasn't changed my opinion.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I serve on the Intel
Committee and I have
been very aware of it.

02:54.266 --> 02:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think more Americans are
aware of what is going on, as
we try to engage our federal

02:56.800 --> 03:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government to be able to
step up to the level of
risk that we really face.

03:01.100 --> 03:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of states have become
more aware of it, and their
state CIOs, chief information

03:05.266 --> 03:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officers, and other agencies
are now stepping up to say this
is a real threat and we need

03:09.066 --> 03:11.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be able to
treat it seriously.

03:11.133 --> 03:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Since this
began, we have reports just in
the last couple of days from

03:17.933 --> 03:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The New York Times now that says
the CIA director, Mike Pompeo,
continued to brief Michael Flynn

03:24.200 --> 03:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even after he was given
information that Michael
Flynn might be compromised.

03:30.366 --> 03:31.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Was this -- was this
handled appropriately?

03:31.466 --> 03:32.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:32.733 --> 03:34.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD: It was
handled appropriately.

03:34.233 --> 03:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was very surprised at
The New York Times story.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They get some things right.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For this one, it seemed
much ado about nothing.

03:39.733 --> 03:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact that in the earliest
days Michael Flynn was there
and that there were some people

03:43.733 --> 03:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the previous administration
that didn't like Michael
Flynn or thought that he had

03:47.100 --> 03:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been challenged before, this
administration, the current
administration, was still trying

03:50.933 --> 03:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to determine that, and to be
able to put that off on Mike
Pompeo, who had also just been

03:55.166 --> 04:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hired days before, literally ,
they're confronting Mike Pompeo,
saying he could have -- should

04:02.766 --> 04:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have confronted a White
House official days into
his new post, I think,
is an unfair reevaluation

04:06.066 --> 04:08.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or rewrite of history.

04:08.100 --> 04:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This also
seems to -- from an outsider's
perspective, even when it comes

04:14.133 --> 04:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to intelligence-gathering,
there's a layer of politics
on it and a layer of distrust,

04:17.000 --> 04:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because you would think that
by the time the information
filters up to the head of the

04:20.466 --> 04:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CIA, that whoever is coming up
with that information is putting
country first and not party.

04:24.900 --> 04:25.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:25.900 --> 04:27.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD: Correct.

04:27.966 --> 04:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you would also assume that
there is a way to be able to
interpret that information.

04:29.966 --> 04:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at times, you see an
accusation that may be released
out, for instance, with Michael

04:33.100 --> 04:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Flynn, to say he might have
been compromised, he might have
been vulnerable to blackmail.

04:37.866 --> 04:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you actually see that
information, I think a lot of
Americans will look at it and

04:41.333 --> 04:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
go, what in the world
are they talking about?

04:43.233 --> 04:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One analyst will look at one
thing and see it one way.

04:46.066 --> 04:49.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Another analyst will
look at it and see it an
entirely different way.

04:49.100 --> 04:53.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's more open to
interpretation here than
what the Americans are
being led to believe

04:53.166 --> 04:54.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this by that story.

04:54.533 --> 04:56.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I would just tell people
to take a deep breath.

04:56.566 --> 05:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's not try to revise history
of what was actually going on
in literally the very first

05:00.833 --> 05:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week of a new administration
as they were getting organized.

05:03.466 --> 05:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there
any concern that Michael Flynn
had access to information that

05:06.933 --> 05:08.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he shouldn't have had?

05:08.233 --> 05:09.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: No, I haven't
seen that concern on that.

05:11.766 --> 05:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is the national security
adviser working next to the
president, so in his time that

05:15.833 --> 05:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was the national
security adviser, he is
working in the White House.

05:19.066 --> 05:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He should have access
to that information.

05:21.066 --> 05:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, once the president
fired him, he should have
access to no information at all

05:24.933 --> 05:27.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at that point.

05:27.533 --> 05:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You have
also had the opportunity
to listen to Mike Rogers
in -- I'm sorry -- you

05:30.800 --> 05:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have had the head of the
DNI and the head of the CIA
in closed-door sessions.

05:35.133 --> 05:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Has anything that they have told
you, without having to reveal
it here, given you any greater

05:39.400 --> 05:41.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sense of comfort or a
greater sense of alarm?

05:41.466 --> 05:42.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:42.700 --> 05:44.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD:
No, they haven't.

05:44.666 --> 05:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, when we walk through
classified information and
sources and methods and how

05:46.366 --> 05:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things are determined, we get
a chance to see the raw data.

05:49.100 --> 05:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Very often, what comes out in
open hearings is an impression
that has been made, and then

05:53.100 --> 05:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you look back at the data and
you have to determine whether
I would agree or disagree

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with that same impression.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are walking through
all the investigations
in a very bipartisan way.

06:01.133 --> 06:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Senate Intelligence
Committee is a very bipartisan
committee where we try to look

06:04.866 --> 06:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at all the information,
have real conversations.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You don't have Republicans and
Democrats behind closed doors.

06:09.433 --> 06:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have people passionate
about national security
behind closed doors.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think that's the
way that it should be.

06:14.333 --> 06:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The White
House is supposed to announce,
possibly as early as this week,

06:18.633 --> 06:23.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to settle this question
on whether or not there
exists recordings of
conversations between

06:23.000 --> 06:27.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the president and former
Director James Comey.

06:27.700 --> 06:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee,
do you have any reason
to believe that there

06:31.100 --> 06:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are or that there are not tapes?

06:32.500 --> 06:33.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: We don't know.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have, obviously, made
the request that we would
receive those recordings.

06:36.866 --> 06:39.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It would clear up a
lot of the issues.

06:39.133 --> 06:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Obviously, the former
FBI director, Jim Comey,
said he released out
his memos that were of

06:46.166 --> 06:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an FBI document that after he
left employment he released them
out anyway to try to proactively

06:49.566 --> 06:50.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cut that off.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I wish he wouldn't
have done that.

06:53.033 --> 06:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if we have recordings, we
could get the recordings and
get all the information out

06:56.300 --> 06:58.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

06:58.266 --> 07:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But at this point, if there
is a recording, based on a
tweet from the president saying

07:00.766 --> 07:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he -- that Jim Comey better
hope that there aren't, I
would, quite frankly, tell you,

07:04.866 --> 07:07.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
if the White House
has recordings, they
should release them.

07:07.033 --> 07:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That settles the issue.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: If
there are recordings, is
that concerning to you?

07:11.333 --> 07:13.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:13.366 --> 07:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: Well, it would
only be a question for me to
figure out why they're trying to

07:15.433 --> 07:20.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
record what's happening
in the White House and
what is happening in
private conversations.

07:21.533 --> 07:23.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If there are, we need to
get the information out.

07:23.566 --> 07:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's resolve the issues and
try to determine why those were
happening, what was the source

07:26.000 --> 07:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of those, and then that will
help settle a lot of issues.

07:28.300 --> 07:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Senator James Lankford from the
Senate Intelligence Committee

07:31.733 --> 07:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and from Oklahoma,
thanks so much.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD: You bet.

07:35.000 --> 07:35.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.
