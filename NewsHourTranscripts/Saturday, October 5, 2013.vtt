00:54.133 --> 00:55.900
IN A SEPARATE DEVELOPMENT, CHUCK

01:01.967 --> 01:04.733
HE DID NOT SAY EXACTLY HOW MANY.

01:04.733 --> 01:05.933
MEANWHILE, THERE ARE NEW SIGNS

01:05.933 --> 01:07.133
THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN IS

01:07.133 --> 01:08.767
DAMAGING THE ECONOMY, THOUSAND

01:08.767 --> 01:10.633
OF HOME BUYERS MAY NOT BE ABLE

01:10.633 --> 01:12.100
TO QUALIFY FOR MORTGAGES BECAUSE

01:12.100 --> 01:15.067
OF THE FURLOUGHING OF IR

01:15.067 --> 01:15.433
WORKERS.

01:15.433 --> 01:16.967
THE IRS OFTEN VERIFIES THE

INCOME OF HOME BUYERS TRYING T

01:18.700 --> 01:29.067
GET A LOAN

01:29.067 --> 01:30.700
FOR WEEKS NOW, WASHINGTO

01:30.700 --> 01:32.033
WATCHERS HAVE BEEN SAYIN

01:32.033 --> 01:33.267
RESOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT WIL

01:33.267 --> 01:35.800
HINGE ON THE ACTIONS OF TWO MEN,

01:35.800 --> 01:37.733
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HOUS

01:37.733 --> 01:38.867
SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER

01:38.867 --> 01:40.000
WE'LL HAVE TWO CONVERSATIONS

01:40.000 --> 01:41.367
WITH THE REPORTERS WHO COVER

01:41.367 --> 01:42.067
EACH OF THEM

01:42.067 --> 01:43.867
FOR MORE, WE'RE JOINED BY JANE

01:43.867 --> 01:45.067
HOOK OF THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,

01:45.067 --> 01:47.367
I HAVE TO ASK, DOES THIS

01:47.367 --> 01:49.233
MORNING'S UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT TO

01:49.233 --> 01:51.133
GIVE FEDERAL WORKERS WHO WER

01:51.133 --> 01:52.633
FURLOUGHED BACK PAY, IF THAT'S

01:52.633 --> 01:53.933
APPROVED BY THE SENATE AND THE

01:53.933 --> 01:55.467
WHITE HOUSE DOES, THAT BUY JOH

01:55.467 --> 01:56.467
BOEHNER MORE TIME OR INCREAS

01:56.467 --> 01:59.400
THE PRESSURE ON MINIMUM?

01:59.400 --> 02:01.900
>> I HAVE TO SAY, THAT UNANIMOUS

02:01.900 --> 02:03.567
VOTE IS REALLY AN ILLUSION

02:03.567 --> 02:04.800
IT'S THE ONE THING PEOPLE CA

02:04.800 --> 02:08.133
AGREE ON, IS THAT THEY DON'T

02:08.133 --> 02:09.400
WANT TO TAKE THIS OUT ON THE

02:09.400 --> 02:10.967
FEDERAL WORKERS WHO ARE MISSIN

02:10.967 --> 02:14.833
DAYS AND DAYS OF PAYCHECKS

02:14.833 --> 02:19.200
I THINK ACTUALLY, IT KIND OF

02:19.200 --> 02:20.600
LIFTS THE PRESSURE ON CONGRESS

02:20.600 --> 02:22.567
TO COME TO ANY KIND OF

02:22.567 --> 02:23.467
AGREEMENT, BECAUSE THERE ISN'T

02:23.467 --> 02:25.100
PRESSURE COMING FROM FEDERAL

02:25.100 --> 02:26.467
WORKERS WHO ARE WANTING TO GET

02:26.467 --> 02:28.833
THEIR PAYCHECK, THEY KNO

02:28.833 --> 02:30.033
THEY'LL BE MADE WHOLE IN THE

02:30.033 --> 02:30.367
END.

02:30.367 --> 02:32.800
>> WHAT'S THE LIKELIHOOD I

02:32.800 --> 02:35.867
SPEAKER BOEHNER COMBINES THI

02:35.867 --> 02:59.567
NEGOTIATION INTO THE DEB

02:59.567 --> 03:24.900
CEILING CONVERSATION THAT'

03:24.900 --> 04:04.433
LOOMING.

04:04.433 --> 04:05.933
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA LAST WEEK WAS

04:05.933 --> 04:08.400
GIVING SPEECHES WHERE HE WAS

04:08.400 --> 04:10.000
CALLING OUT SPEAKER BOEHNER AN

04:10.000 --> 04:11.967
BASICALLY SAYING HE WAS ALMOST

04:11.967 --> 04:13.500
SINGLE HANDEDLY RESPONSIBLE FO

04:13.500 --> 04:14.367
THE SHUTDOWN

04:14.367 --> 04:16.733
SPEAKER BOEHNER HAS BEEN HAR MUC

04:16.733 --> 04:17.100
IN RETURN QUESTIONING PRESIDEN

04:17.100 --> 04:22.000
OBAMA'S LEADERSHIP

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, I THEIR THEY

04:25.000 --> 04:25.833
PLAYED GOLF TOGETHER AND THE

04:25.833 --> 04:28.767
WERE TRYING TO GET SOM

04:28.767 --> 04:30.500
NEGOTIATIONS TOGETHER.

04:30.500 --> 04:34.467
RIGHT NOW IT'S DIFFICULT T

04:34.467 --> 04:36.333
THINK OF THEM OUT ON THE LINKS

04:36.333 --> 04:36.433
TOGETHER

04:36.433 --> 04:38.267
>> JULIE PACE IS A WHITE HOUSE

04:38.267 --> 04:39.367
CORRESPONDENT FOR THE ASSOCIATED

04:39.367 --> 04:41.667
PRESS, SHE HAD AN EXCLUSIV

04:41.667 --> 04:43.067
INTERVIEW WITH THE PRESIDENT

04:43.067 --> 04:43.333
YESTERDAY.

04:43.333 --> 04:45.700
WE JUST HEARD JANET HOOK SAY THE

04:45.700 --> 04:46.533
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPEAKER

04:46.533 --> 04:48.400
BOEHNER AND THE PRESIDENT IS

04:48.400 --> 04:49.333
ALMOST NONEXISTENT

04:49.333 --> 04:51.400
YOU SAT DOWN WITH THE PRESIDEN

04:51.400 --> 04:53.200
YESTERDAY, THAT SEEMED NAR

04:53.200 --> 04:53.533
ACCURATE

04:53.533 --> 04:55.200
>> YES, IT'S DEFINITEL

04:55.200 --> 04:56.733
ACCURATE

04:56.733 --> 04:57.633
THESE ARE TWO MEN WHO TRIED TO

04:57.633 --> 04:59.533
BUILD A RELATIONSHIP BACK IN

04:59.533 --> 05:01.367
2011, THEY REALLY FOUND THAT

05:01.367 --> 05:03.133
THEY EITHER COULDN'T TRUST EAC

05:03.133 --> 05:07.167
OTHER OR DIDN'T HAVE A LOT O

05:07.167 --> 05:08.000
OVERLAPPING POSITIONS.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.533
AND THE RELATIONSHIP HAS GOTTE

05:09.533 --> 05:12.500
WORSE OVER TIME.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.367
THEY SAY THEY DON'T SPEAK VERY

05:14.367 --> 05:15.567
OFTEN, THEY DON'T NECESSARIL

05:15.567 --> 05:17.733
NOT LIKE EACH OTHER, THEY JUST

05:17.733 --> 05:18.767
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON.

05:18.767 --> 05:19.967
AND I THINK THAT'S PLAYING OUT

05:19.967 --> 05:21.033
IN THIS DEBELATE

05:21.033 --> 05:23.200
YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF

05:23.200 --> 05:24.067
INVITATIONS FOR JOHN BOEHNER T

05:24.067 --> 05:25.067
COME OVER TO THE WHITE HOUSE

05:25.067 --> 05:26.933
YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF PHONE

05:26.933 --> 05:28.500
CALLS BEING TRADED BY THE TW

05:28.500 --> 05:28.633
MEN.

05:28.633 --> 05:32.400
>> YOU'VE COVERED THE PRESIDEN

05:32.400 --> 05:34.433
SINCE BEFORE HE WAS PRESIDENT.

05:34.433 --> 05:35.633
NOW, IN THIS PARTICULAR CRISIS

05:35.633 --> 05:36.700
HOW DOES HE SEEM TO YOU?

05:36.700 --> 05:38.700
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS

05:38.700 --> 05:39.833
STRUCK BY IN THE INTERVIEW W

05:39.833 --> 05:42.133
HAD WITH HIM, IS HOW OFD H

05:42.133 --> 05:42.267
SEEMS.

05:42.267 --> 05:43.767
THE WHITE HOUSE FEELS LIKE, IN

05:43.767 --> 05:44.867
TERMS OF THE GOVERNMEN

05:44.867 --> 05:45.933
SHUTDOWN, THEY'RE REALLY WINNING

05:45.933 --> 05:47.233
THE POLITICS OF THIS, AND TH

05:47.233 --> 05:48.867
PRESIDENT SEEMS TO REALLY SKEWED

05:48.867 --> 05:49.533
THIS CONFIDENCE.

05:49.533 --> 05:52.033
HE WAS HOLDING FIRM ON HIS

05:52.033 --> 05:53.067
POSITIONS, MAKING CLEAR THAT H

05:53.067 --> 05:57.067
WAS NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE AWA

05:57.067 --> 05:58.133
TO THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

05:58.133 --> 05:59.767
WHAT I THINK IS PARTICULARLY

05:59.767 --> 06:00.933
STRIKING, IS THAT JUST A FEW

06:00.933 --> 06:03.200
WEEKS AGO, THIS WAS A PRESIDEN

06:03.200 --> 06:05.733
WHO WAS REALLY IN CRISIS 37

06:05.733 --> 06:07.533
DON'T THINK THAT'S OVERSTATING

06:07.533 --> 06:09.033
IT, YOU HAD HIS DECISION O

06:09.033 --> 06:11.667
SYRIA, YOU HAD THE NSA

06:11.667 --> 06:13.300
REVELATIONS, GOING BACK EARLIE

06:13.300 --> 06:14.800
IN THE SUMMER.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.700
YOU HAD CONTROVERIES IN THE IR

06:16.700 --> 06:19.033
THAT WERE BUBBLING UP.

06:19.033 --> 06:20.633
THAT HAS BEEN OVERSHADOWED B

06:20.633 --> 06:22.433
THE DEBACLE IN CAPITOL HILL OVER

06:22.433 --> 06:23.600
THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, AND

06:23.600 --> 06:26.867
IT'S REALLY RENEWED HI

06:26.867 --> 06:28.300
CONFIDENCE GOING INTO THE END OF

06:28.300 --> 06:28.900
THIS YEAR.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.600
>> DOES HE THINK THIS WILL GET

06:30.600 --> 06:31.967
TIED INTO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT

06:31.967 --> 06:32.967
THE DEBT CELLING

06:32.967 --> 06:35.133
>> SO I ASKED HIM ABOUT THIS, HE

06:35.133 --> 06:37.100
SAID THAT THAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN,

06:37.100 --> 06:38.933
THAT THE HOUSE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

06:38.933 --> 06:41.767
RESOLVE THIS BEFORE WE GET T

06:41.767 --> 06:43.333
THE DEBT CEILING DEADLINE, WHICH

06:43.333 --> 06:45.833
IS ABOUT OCTOBER 17th, I THINK

06:45.833 --> 06:46.867
REALISTICALLY, THERE'S A GOO

06:46.867 --> 06:50.067
CHANCE THAT WILL HAPPEN.

06:50.067 --> 06:51.167
YOU HEAR FROM SOME REPUBLICANS

06:51.167 --> 06:52.933
ON CAPITOL HILL, THAT IT MAY B

06:52.933 --> 06:55.100
IN SPEAKER BOEHNER'S FAVOR T

06:55.100 --> 06:57.000
LET THESE TWO DEADLINES MERGE.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.567
I THINK IF YOU CAUGHT SOME WHITE

06:58.567 --> 07:00.467
HOUSE OFFICIALS IN SOME PRIVAT

07:00.467 --> 07:02.267
MOMENTS, THEY MAY ACKNOWLEDG

07:02.267 --> 07:03.567
THE FACT THAT THAT IS WHERE THIS

07:03.567 --> 07:03.933
IS HEADED.

07:03.933 --> 07:07.233
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT IRAN.

07:07.233 --> 07:07.367
ISRAEL HAS GONE ON THE RECOR

07:07.367 --> 07:10.267
AND SAID THAT IRAN IS VERY CLOSE

07:10.267 --> 07:10.933
TO A NUCLEAR BOMB.

07:10.933 --> 07:12.067
WHAT'S THE PRESIDENT'S

07:12.067 --> 07:12.433
ASSESSMENT

07:12.433 --> 07:14.200
>> THE PRESIDENT ADMITS THAT THE

07:14.200 --> 07:15.733
U.S. IS A BIT MORE CONSERVATIV

07:15.733 --> 07:18.933
THAN IRAN IN THEIR INTELLIGENC

07:18.933 --> 07:19.067
ASSESSMENT

07:19.067 --> 07:20.100
WHEN I ASKED HIM WHAT TH

07:20.100 --> 07:21.867
CURRENT ASSESSMENT IS, HE SAID

07:21.867 --> 07:23.967
THAT THE U.S. BELIEVES IRAN IS A

07:23.967 --> 07:25.400
YEAR OR MORE AWAY FROM BEING

07:25.400 --> 07:27.033
ABLE TO BUILD A NUCLEAR WEAPON

07:27.033 --> 07:29.767
THIS IS SOMETHING HE'S B

07:29.767 --> 07:30.433
TELLING BENJAMIN NETANYAHU FOR

07:30.433 --> 07:32.467
QUITE SOME TIME, THE ISRAELI

07:32.467 --> 07:34.200
ARE A BIT MORE FORWARD LEANING

07:34.200 --> 07:35.000
ON THEIR TIME FRAME.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.300
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING T

07:36.300 --> 07:38.433
DO WHEN HE LAYS OUT THIS LONGE

07:38.433 --> 07:39.800
TIME FRAME IS MAKING THE CAS

07:39.800 --> 07:41.667
FOR DIPLOMACY, SAYING WE HAVE

07:41.667 --> 07:43.600
YEAR OR MORE TO TRY TO LAUNC

07:43.600 --> 07:46.667
THIS DIPLOMATIC EFFORT WITH TH

07:46.667 --> 07:47.833
NEW IRANIAN PRESIDENT.

07:47.833 --> 07:49.300
>> JULIE PACE, THANKS SO MUCH.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.933
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

07:50.933 --> 07:52.400
>> IN OTHER NEWS, THE GOVERNMENT

08:29.133 --> 08:29.500
CITIZENSHIP.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.600
THE BILL HAS GONE NOWHERE IN THE

HOUSE.

08:32.967 --> 08:36.033
OVERSEAS TODAY, IRAN'S SUPREME

AFTER HASSAN ROWHANI SPOKE WIT

08:46.333 --> 08:46.933
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

AND SUPPORT WHAT WAS IN THIS

08:56.200 --> 08:56.600
LAST TRIP.

08:56.600 --> 08:57.900
OF COURSE, IN OUR OPINION, SOM

08:57.900 --> 08:59.967
OF WHAT OCCURRED IN THE NEW YORK

08:59.967 --> 09:01.933
TRIP WAS NOT PROFITABLE.

09:01.933 --> 09:05.600
>> THE AYATOLLAH ALSO EXPRESSE

SKEPTICISM ABOUT THEthNESS O

10:30.933 --> 10:32.667
SHE HAD HER FIRST CIGARETTE WHEN

IS AN AVENUE THAT I HAD NO

10:59.400 --> 11:01.867
EXPLORED, I WAS A SMOKER, IT WAS

11:01.867 --> 11:02.200
AVAILABLE.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.133
SO WHY NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.200
SCREENING SHOWED A CANCEROUS

MASS IN HER LUNG AND SHE WOULD

NEED SURGERY

11:16.933 --> 11:17.933
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

11:17.933 --> 11:21.300

11:21.300 --> 11:25.200

11:25.200 --> 11:27.400
PART OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT,

11:27.400 --> 11:29.567
LONG TIME SMOKERS LIKE HILLARY

11:29.567 --> 11:32.900
MIGHT BE ENTITLED TO A $30

11:32.900 --> 11:34.400
PREVENTATIVE LUNG CANCER

11:34.400 --> 11:36.267
SCREENING WITH NO CO PAY

11:36.267 --> 11:38.933
THAT'S BECAUSE OF AN OBSCURE

11:38.933 --> 11:41.433
GROUP KNOWN AS THE UNITED STATES

11:41.433 --> 11:42.633
PREVENTATIVE SERVICES TASK

11:42.633 --> 11:42.867
FORCE.

11:42.867 --> 11:45.767
IT'S COMPOSED OF 60 VOLUNTEE

11:45.767 --> 11:48.700
AND INDEPENDENT PHYSICIANS AND

11:48.700 --> 11:49.067
ACADEMICS.

11:49.067 --> 11:50.067
THE GROUP CONSIDERS WHAT

11:50.067 --> 11:51.367
SCREENINGS HAVE WORKED AND WHICH

11:51.367 --> 11:52.500
ONES DON'T

11:52.500 --> 11:54.633
ANYONE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD CA

11:54.633 --> 11:55.967
SUBMIT A NOMINATION FOR A SEAT

11:55.967 --> 11:58.233
ON THE TASK FORCE, EVE

11:58.233 --> 12:02.167
SELF-NOMINATIONS ARE ACCEPTED.

12:02.167 --> 12:04.000
MEMBERS ARE EMBEDDED IN SELECTED

12:04.000 --> 12:06.433
AGENCIES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT

12:06.433 --> 12:08.867
OF HUMAN HEALTH AND SERVICES

12:08.867 --> 12:10.667
THE GROUP WAS LITTLE KNOWN FOR

12:10.667 --> 12:11.900
30 YEARS

12:11.900 --> 12:13.833
USING LETTER GRADES TO MAK

12:13.833 --> 12:15.400
RECOMMENDATIONS TO PRIMARY CAR

12:15.400 --> 12:16.333
PHYSICIANS ON WHICH SERVICES

12:16.333 --> 12:17.733
THEY SHOULD OFFER THEIR PATIENTS

12:17.733 --> 12:19.567
AND HELPING INSURANCE COMPANIE

12:19.567 --> 12:20.367
DECIDE TO COVER.

12:20.367 --> 12:21.767
BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

12:21.767 --> 12:24.833
WAS PASSED IN 2010, A GRADE A OR

12:24.833 --> 12:27.200
B WAS ONLY A RECOMMENDATION.

12:27.200 --> 12:30.267
BUT UNDER THE NEW LAW, A GRADE A

12:30.267 --> 12:32.433
OR B NOW REQUIRES THAT MEDICAR

12:32.433 --> 12:35.267
AND PRIVATE INSURERS PICK UP

12:35.267 --> 12:36.300
100% OF THE COST

12:36.300 --> 12:37.767
>> DR. VIRGINIA MOYER IS THE

12:37.767 --> 12:38.800
CHAIR OF THE TASK FORCE.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.933
>> THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

12:40.933 --> 12:42.333
INCLUDES A PROVISION THAT SAYS

12:42.333 --> 12:43.933
THAT ANY RECOMMENDATION THAT

12:43.933 --> 12:52.000
RECEIVES AN A OR B GRADE IS PAID

12:52.000 --> 12:55.133
FOR FIRST DOLLAR, SO NO CO PAY

12:55.133 --> 12:56.200
FOR THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.800
>> SINCE THE PASSAGE OF TH

12:57.800 --> 12:59.167
AGORDABLE CARE ACT, THE TASK

12:59.167 --> 13:00.767
FORCE HAS RECOMMENDED MORE THA

13:00.767 --> 13:02.867
A DOZEN PREVENTATIVE SERVICES.

13:02.867 --> 13:06.200
SCREENINGS FOR HIV, CERVICAL

13:06.200 --> 13:07.833
CANCER AND OSTEOPOROSIS AS WEL

13:07.833 --> 13:10.767
AS COUNCILING FOR OBESITY AN

13:10.767 --> 13:11.500
TOBACCO USE.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.967
PEOPLE WHO NEED PREVENTATIVE

13:12.967 --> 13:14.633
SERVICES CAN NOW GET THEM WITHIN

13:14.633 --> 13:16.367
THEIR INSURANCE NETWORKS FULLY

13:16.367 --> 13:16.967
COVERED.

13:16.967 --> 13:18.467
>> THE PREVENTATIVE SERVICE IS

13:18.467 --> 13:20.200
SOMETHING THAT IS INTENDED T

13:20.200 --> 13:21.200
KEEP SOMETHING BAD FRO

13:21.200 --> 13:21.433
HAPPENING.

13:21.433 --> 13:23.433
WHAT WE DO AS A TASK FORCE IS,

13:23.433 --> 13:26.833
WE CAREFULLY EVALUATE TH

13:26.833 --> 13:27.033
SCIENCE.

13:27.033 --> 13:28.200
THE SCIENCE THAT TELLS U

13:28.200 --> 13:29.667
WHETHER A PREVENTATIVE SERVICE

13:29.667 --> 13:31.900
IS GOING TO BENEFIT PEOPLE

13:31.900 --> 13:34.133
>> THE IDEA IS THAT PROVIDIN

13:34.133 --> 13:35.467
PREVENTATIVE SERVICES FROM THE

13:35.467 --> 13:37.367
OUTSET WILL SAVE LIVES AND

13:37.367 --> 13:38.267
HEALTH CARE DOLLARS ON THE BAC

13:38.267 --> 13:38.500
END.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.333
>> ON THE SURFACE, PATIENTS AR

13:40.333 --> 13:42.700
GOING TO GET ALL OF THE SERVICES

13:42.700 --> 13:45.300
THAT THE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDS

13:45.300 --> 13:47.233
EITHER A OR B COVERED IN FULL,

13:47.233 --> 13:48.467
WITH NO CO PAYS.

13:48.467 --> 13:49.900
THAT SOUNDS GOOD, I THINK TH

13:49.900 --> 13:52.000
PROBLEM IS, THAT'S VERY EXPENS

13:52.000 --> 13:52.400
EVERYONE

13:52.400 --> 13:56.733
>> DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB IS WITH

13:56.733 --> 13:59.433
THINK TANK, IN THE MEDICAL

13:59.433 --> 14:00.633
WORLD, NOTHING EVER COMES FO

14:00.633 --> 14:00.900
FREE

14:00.900 --> 14:03.033
>> FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON WH

14:03.033 --> 14:05.500
HEARS THAT IT IS NOW THE LAW

14:05.500 --> 14:08.267
THAT THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY HAS

14:08.267 --> 14:11.700
TO PAY FOR PREVENTATIV

14:11.700 --> 14:12.233
SERVICES

14:12.233 --> 14:13.233
SEASON THE THAT SOMETHING PEOPLE

14:13.233 --> 14:14.633
ARE GOING TO WANT AS PART OF

14:14.633 --> 14:15.733
THEIR HEALTH BENEFITS?

14:15.733 --> 14:16.967
>> I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE

14:16.967 --> 14:18.300
THINGS THAT WON'T BE COVERED

14:18.300 --> 14:20.300
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MORE THING

14:20.300 --> 14:21.933
COVERED IN PULL THAT THE TAS

14:21.933 --> 14:23.933
FORCE RECOMMENDS AND MORE THINGS

14:23.933 --> 14:25.867
NOT COVERED THAT THE TASK FORC

14:25.867 --> 14:26.467
DOESN'T RECOMMEND.

14:26.467 --> 14:28.200
>> IF THE TASK FORCE SAY

14:28.200 --> 14:29.500
INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE TO PA

14:29.500 --> 14:30.800
FOR SOMETHING, AND IT COSTS

14:30.800 --> 14:32.267
LOT OF MONEY, AREN'T THEY JUST

14:32.267 --> 14:34.700
GOING TO TAKE MONEY FROM OTHER

14:34.700 --> 14:34.933
THINGS

14:34.933 --> 14:37.000
>> THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHAT

14:37.000 --> 14:40.433
IT SAYS IS, THAT INSURANCE

14:40.433 --> 14:42.300
COMPANIES HAVE TO PAY FOR A AN

14:42.300 --> 14:43.233
B RECOMMENDATION

14:43.233 --> 14:45.900
IT SAYS NO, SIR AT ALL ABOUT

14:45.900 --> 14:47.400
WHAT DOESN'T GET PAID FOR.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.567
THAT THEN REMAINS THE DECISION

14:50.567 --> 14:52.100
OF INSURANCE COMPANIES, AND, O

14:52.100 --> 14:53.567
COURSE, FOR MANY PEOPLE, IT'

14:53.567 --> 14:54.933
THE DECISION OF MEDICARE

14:54.933 --> 14:56.000
>> AND THE DECISION OF THE

14:56.000 --> 14:57.600
INSURANCE COMPANIES LIKE AETNA

14:57.600 --> 14:59.667
HAS BEEN TO STICK WITH WHAT TH

14:59.667 --> 15:01.133
TASK FORCE SAYS.

15:01.133 --> 15:03.900
DR. LONNIE REESE MAN IS IT

15:03.900 --> 15:04.567
CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER.

15:04.567 --> 15:06.933
>> WE'VE COVERED ALL THE

MANDATES ALREADY

15:07.767 --> 15:09.333
THEY'RE BASED INTO OUR PREMIUM

15:09.333 --> 15:10.400
AND WE'RE NOT EXPECTING

15:10.400 --> 15:11.567
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN COSTS.

15:11.567 --> 15:13.200
>> BUT THE REAL FINANCIA

15:13.200 --> 15:14.567
CHALLENGE WILL BE TO MANAG

15:14.567 --> 15:16.867
COSTS, AND AT THE SAME TIME,

15:16.867 --> 15:19.867
SATISFY CUSTOMERS AS MOR

15:19.867 --> 15:21.467
SERVICES ARE MANDATESED IN

15:21.467 --> 15:23.400
COMING YEARS

15:23.400 --> 15:24.800
>> ANY INCREASES IN COSTS WILL

15:24.800 --> 15:28.500
BE COVERED IN OUR PREMIUMS, BU

15:28.500 --> 15:30.133
WE WILL EXPLAIN THE BASIS FO

15:30.133 --> 15:32.100
INCREASING PREMIUMS AS A RESUL

15:32.100 --> 15:33.767
OF INCREASING MEDICAL COSTS.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.333
>> THAT COULD MEAN NO OUT OF

15:35.333 --> 15:36.867
POCKET EXPENSES FOR PREVENTATIVE

15:36.867 --> 15:39.233
SERVICES AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

15:39.233 --> 15:41.767
BUT HIGHER INSURANCE BILLS FOR

15:41.767 --> 15:41.967
CONSUMERS.

15:41.967 --> 15:43.467
AND THERE'S STILL ANOTHER ASPECT

15:43.467 --> 15:44.500
OF THIS STORY.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.833
WHETHER THERE'S THE SAME

15:45.833 --> 15:47.933
OVERSIGHT OF THE VOLUNTEER TAS

CARE, NOT JUST FOR MEDICARE, BUT

16:13.700 --> 16:14.367
FOR EVERYONE

BLOOD DIAMONDS ANY MORE.

FAMILIAR IS WITH MAYBE A DECAD

18:20.867 --> 18:21.067
AGO.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.267
WHAT KIND OF MINERALS?

18:22.267 --> 18:25.600
>> IT'S MINERALS WE USE IN

18:25.600 --> 18:27.467
ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS.

THINGS THAT MAKE OUR FACTORIES

FUNCTION MORE EFFICIENTLY.

18:31.267 --> 18:35.533
THINGS THAT MAKE OUR CELL PHONES

WORK SILENTLY.

18:36.567 --> 18:37.500

18:44.700 --> 18:46.900
ITS WAY TO SOMEONE IN THES

18:46.900 --> 18:47.033
MINES?

18:47.033 --> 18:51.267
>> IN THE MINE, THEY EXTRACT

18:51.267 --> 18:56.933
TIN, THAT PRODUCT THEN I

18:56.933 --> 19:00.333
EXPORTED IN -- FROM CONGO TO ITS

19:08.167 --> 19:10.467
TO ASIA TO GO TO PRODUCTIO

19:10.467 --> 19:13.167
COMPANIES, WHICH WILL TAKE THE

19:13.167 --> 19:18.033
RAW MATERIAL AND TURN IT INTO

19:18.033 --> 19:18.800
DIFFERENT FORM

19:18.800 --> 19:20.333
>> HOW IS IT -- BY READING THI

19:20.333 --> 19:21.800
PIECE, I LEARNED THAT THE CONG

19:21.800 --> 19:23.933
IS ONE OF THE MOST MINERAL RIC

19:23.933 --> 19:25.233
COUNTRIES ON THE PLANET.

19:25.233 --> 19:27.633
YET AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S ONE

19:27.633 --> 19:29.700
OF THE POOREST PLACES ON THE

19:29.700 --> 19:29.900
PLANET

19:29.900 --> 19:31.133
THEY HAVE THESE RESOURCES,

19:31.133 --> 19:32.700
WHAT'S BEEN KEEPING THEM FRO

19:32.700 --> 19:34.167
EXERCISING THAT SORT OF ECONOMIC

19:34.167 --> 19:34.867
INDEPENDENCE

19:34.867 --> 19:36.500
>> THE PROBLEM IS, THERE'S N

19:36.500 --> 19:37.100
CONTROL.

19:37.100 --> 19:39.967
23I6R9 OF ALL, WITHIN AN

19:39.967 --> 19:41.233
ENVIRONMENT LIKE THAT, THE

19:41.233 --> 19:43.133
GOVERNMENT THERE IS NOT REALLY

19:43.133 --> 19:44.200
IN CONTROL OF THE REGIONS WHER

19:44.200 --> 19:46.067
THE MINERALS ARE SOURCED

19:46.067 --> 19:48.067
IF THEY ARE IN CONTROL, IT'S A

19:48.067 --> 19:49.033
VERY MILITARY LED CONTROL.

19:49.033 --> 19:50.700
SOME OF THE MILITARY LEADERS ARE

19:50.700 --> 19:52.900
NOT AS SCRUPULOUS AS THEY SHOULD

19:52.900 --> 19:55.433
BE, AND THEY'RE EXTRACTING THOSE

19:55.433 --> 19:57.933
MINERALS FOR THEIR OWN PERSONA

19:57.933 --> 19:58.167
PROFIT

19:58.167 --> 20:02.200
ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE A HUGE

20:02.200 --> 20:03.967
COLLECTION OF MILITIA REBE

20:03.967 --> 20:05.367
GROUPS THAT ARE WORKING AN

20:05.367 --> 20:06.567
FIGHTING IN THE REGIONS.

20:06.567 --> 20:08.033
THEY USE THE NATURAL RESOURCES

20:08.033 --> 20:09.467
TO FUND THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN.

20:09.467 --> 20:12.033
THEY TRY TO TAKE OVER THE MINE

20:12.033 --> 20:14.333
TO EXTRACT THE MINERALS.

20:14.333 --> 20:15.700
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS

20:15.700 --> 20:17.100
STRIKING ABOUT YOUR PHOTOS I

20:17.100 --> 20:18.667
HOW MANY OF THESE MINES AR

20:18.667 --> 20:19.533
STAFFED BY CHILDREN.

20:19.533 --> 20:20.567
IS THERE ANY IMPROVEMENT

20:20.567 --> 20:23.167
>> I HAVE SEEN SOME SMAL

20:23.167 --> 20:23.333
IMPROVEMENT.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.100
I'VE BEEN WORKING IN CONGO SINCE

20:25.100 --> 20:26.933
THE LATE 1990s, AND WHEN I WAS

20:26.933 --> 20:29.633
IN THESE MINES IN 2003, 2004

20:29.633 --> 20:31.067
THERE WERE CERTAINLY A LOT MOR

20:31.067 --> 20:32.600
CHILDREN IN THEM THAN I SA

20:32.600 --> 20:32.833
RECENTLY

20:32.833 --> 20:35.000
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S NO

20:35.000 --> 20:36.300
A PROBLEM ANY MORE

20:36.300 --> 20:37.300
IT IS A PROBLEM.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.667
THERE'S STILL LOTS OF CHILDREN

20:39.667 --> 20:41.433
WORKING IN THE MINES, BEIN

20:41.433 --> 20:42.633
FORCED TO WORK IN TH

20:42.633 --> 20:43.833
ENVIRONMENTS BY THE MILITARY

20:43.833 --> 20:45.100
AND ALSO, SOMETIMES WHEN THE

20:45.100 --> 20:46.033
FIGHTING STARTS AGAIN, THE

20:46.033 --> 20:49.700
LEAVE THE MINES AND THEY'R

20:49.700 --> 20:51.633
FORCED TO FIGHT FOR THE MILITIA,

20:51.633 --> 20:53.633
THAT THEY ARE WORKING FOR IN THE

20:53.633 --> 20:54.033
MINES.

20:54.033 --> 20:56.800
>> THIS MAY SEEM LIKE A NAIV

20:56.800 --> 20:57.867
QUESTION, BUT IS THERE ANYTHIN

20:57.867 --> 20:59.467
THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT?

20:59.467 --> 21:01.767
HOW CAN AN AMERICAN CONSUMER

21:01.767 --> 21:02.833
AFFECT WHAT'S HAPPENING SO A

21:02.833 --> 21:04.833
CHILD IN A MINE IN THE CONGO

21:04.833 --> 21:07.733
>> IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION

21:07.733 --> 21:09.167
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE

21:09.167 --> 21:12.033
SOLUTION LIES.

21:12.033 --> 21:18.267
IT LIES WITH THE CONSUMER.

21:18.267 --> 21:19.800
THE DODD FRANK BILL WAS PASSED

21:19.800 --> 21:24.733
IN 2010, THAT MADE ANY COMPANY

21:24.733 --> 21:26.167
RESPONSIBLE FOR REPORTING IF

21:26.167 --> 21:27.800
THEY RECEIVED ANY MINERALS FRO

21:27.800 --> 21:29.867
THE CONGO.

21:29.867 --> 21:30.933
SOME OF THEM ARE WORKING BETTE

21:30.933 --> 21:34.233
THAN OTHERS.

21:34.233 --> 21:36.633
INTEL, MOTOROLA.

21:36.633 --> 21:37.767
OTHER ELECTRONICS PRODUCTS

21:37.767 --> 21:40.367
COMPANIES ARE NOT DOING SO WELL.

21:40.367 --> 21:41.833
AND SO THEY NEED A PUSH.

21:41.833 --> 21:43.300
AND THAT PUSH HAD TO COME FROM

21:43.300 --> 21:45.733
US, THE CONSUMER

21:45.733 --> 21:47.733
THEY CAN SEND MESSAGES TO TH

21:47.733 --> 21:48.633
