ANTHONY FROM THE CENTER FO

STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUD

SIS.

03:51.333 --> 03:54.033
SO, THERE ARE SOME ESTIMATES B

03:54.033 --> 03:56.700
UKRAINIANS THERE MIGHT BE UP T

03:56.700 --> 03:58.200
85,000 RUSSIAN TROOPS ALONG TH

03:58.200 --> 03:58.433
BORDER

03:58.433 --> 03:59.600
WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS, DO W

03:59.600 --> 04:00.967
KNOW ABOUT THE COMPOSITION O

04:00.967 --> 04:02.300
THOSE FORCES

04:02.300 --> 04:03.933
AND WHAT CAN RUSSIA DO WITH THAT

04:03.933 --> 04:07.267
KIND OF AN ARMY?

04:07.267 --> 04:09.367
>> WELL, FIRST, WE DON'T REALL

04:09.367 --> 04:12.967
KNOW THE EXACT STRUCTURE

04:12.967 --> 04:15.700
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD ON BACKGROUND,

04:15.700 --> 04:17.367
THERE ARE BETWEEN 48,000 AND

04:17.367 --> 04:18.733
50,000 AT LEAST TROOPS

04:18.733 --> 04:20.767
THEY HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED WHIC

04:20.767 --> 04:22.333
UNITS THEY BELONG TO

04:22.333 --> 04:24.433
BUT RUSSIA ANNOUNCED THERE WER

04:24.433 --> 04:26.500
GOING TO BE EXERCISES, AND THERE

04:26.500 --> 04:30.100
HAVEN'T BEEN ANY EXERCISES, THEY

04:30.100 --> 04:31.800
JUST KEPT BUILDING UP

04:31.800 --> 04:33.700
PRESENCE, ONE THAT COULD B

04:33.700 --> 04:35.167
GOING INTO EASTERN UKRAINE

04:35.167 --> 04:36.400
TROOPS AREN'T THE ONLY PROBLEM

04:36.400 --> 04:38.467
THERE ARE VERY LARGE NUMBERS O

04:38.467 --> 04:42.500
MINISTRY OF INTERIOR UNITS

04:42.500 --> 04:43.567
RUSSIA ALSO HAS.

04:43.567 --> 04:45.100
THESE ARE ALMOST IDEAL TROOP

04:45.100 --> 04:47.533
FOR OCCUPYING CITIES AND URBAN

04:47.533 --> 04:47.967
AREAS.

04:47.967 --> 04:49.567
THERE ARE CERTAINLY PRO-RUSSIA

04:49.567 --> 04:50.833
ELEMENTS IN SOME OF THE CITIES

04:50.833 --> 04:53.967
IN THE EASTERN UKRAINE

04:53.967 --> 04:56.200
SO AT ALMOST ANY TIME YOU COUL

04:56.200 --> 04:57.533
HAVE A RUSSIAN THRUST INTO THE

04:57.533 --> 04:59.700
EASTERN UKRAINE, AND ONE THA

04:59.700 --> 05:01.800
COULD AT LEAST TAKE SOME CITIES,

05:01.800 --> 05:04.567
PROBABLY IN A MATTER OF DAYS, IF

05:04.567 --> 05:05.500
NOT HOURS.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.967
>> WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON CRIMEA.

05:07.967 --> 05:09.233
ARE THERE OTHER REGIONS WE NEE

05:09.233 --> 05:11.633
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT?

05:11.633 --> 05:15.233
LAST WEEK WE MENTIONED THE ARE

05:15.233 --> 05:18.100
BETWEEN MOLDOVA AND UKRAINE.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.500
>> RUSSIA HAS A LIMITED PRESENCE

05:19.500 --> 05:20.333
IN THE AREA ALREADY.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.200
IT IS NOT A MARRIAGE COMBA

05:22.200 --> 05:24.833
PRESENCE, BUT THERE IS NO MAJO

05:24.833 --> 05:28.900
COMBAT PRESENCE IN THAT AREA, IN

05:28.900 --> 05:31.633
THE UKRAINE TO THE EAST OR T

05:31.633 --> 05:32.500
THE WEST

05:32.500 --> 05:33.900
IT'S CERTAINLY AN AREA RUSSI

05:33.900 --> 05:35.700
COULD SUDDENLY PUT PRESSURE ON

05:35.700 --> 05:36.967
THE UKRAINE.

05:36.967 --> 05:39.333
THERE IS AN AIRBORNE GUARD

05:39.333 --> 05:40.500
DIVISION, BASICALLY, WHICH COULD

05:40.500 --> 05:42.267
BE MOVED IN, AT LEAST IN PART,

05:42.267 --> 05:42.933
FAIRLY QUICKLY

05:42.933 --> 05:44.833
BECAUSE THE UKRAINE, FRANKLY, IS

05:44.833 --> 05:49.167
NOT CAPABLE OF EFFECTIVE AIR

05:49.167 --> 05:49.267
DEFENSE.

05:49.267 --> 05:50.700
SO RUSSIA CERTAINLY HAS TH

05:50.700 --> 05:52.400
ABILITY TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE

05:52.400 --> 05:53.800
UKRAINE IN TWO DIFFERENT

05:53.800 --> 05:56.133
DIRECTIONS

05:56.133 --> 05:57.533
AND I THINK WHAT'S OF GREA

05:57.533 --> 06:00.600
CONCERN TO THE UKRAINE IS WHEN

06:00.600 --> 06:03.367
PUTIN CALLED OBAMA, HE DIDN'

06:03.367 --> 06:04.933
TALK ABOUT NEGOTIATIONS ALONE,

06:04.933 --> 06:06.767
HE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THA

06:06.767 --> 06:09.567
RUSSIA HAD NO INTENTION OF

06:09.567 --> 06:12.567
INVADING IF THE UKRAINE DID NO

06:12.567 --> 06:15.133
HAVE HARD LINE ELEMENTS IN ITS

06:15.133 --> 06:16.200
GOVERNMENT, IF THERE ARE N

06:16.200 --> 06:18.533
PROTESTS AGAINST THE RUSSIANS.

06:18.533 --> 06:21.400
SO IT REALLY WAS NOT IN AN

06:21.400 --> 06:23.367
SENSE A QUICK INITIATIVE TOWARDS

06:23.367 --> 06:23.500
PEACE.

06:23.500 --> 06:27.867
>> SO COUNTRIES LIKE ASTONIA

06:27.867 --> 06:29.600
LITHUANIA, LATVIA, THEY'VE BEE

06:29.600 --> 06:31.067
ASKED FOR INCREASED NATO

06:31.067 --> 06:31.800
PRESENCE

06:31.800 --> 06:34.100
DO THEY HAVE REASON TO B

06:34.100 --> 06:34.300
CONCERNED?

06:34.300 --> 06:38.467
>> WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY ELEMEN

06:38.467 --> 06:40.900
OF RUSSIAN INVASION, BUT THE

06:40.900 --> 06:42.600
BALTIC STATES ARE NEAR MAJOR

06:42.600 --> 06:43.700
RUSSIAN FORCES

06:43.700 --> 06:45.133
THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE TO DO

06:45.133 --> 06:45.600
ANYTHING

06:45.600 --> 06:46.500
THEY'RE ALREADY THERE.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.833
TO PUT PRESSURE ON THEM.

06:47.833 --> 06:50.800
AND WE HAVE MOVED U.S. AIRCRAF

06:50.800 --> 06:52.967
INTO ONE OF THOSE STATES, AS W

06:52.967 --> 06:54.633
HAVE INTO POLAND

06:54.633 --> 06:56.833
BUT I THINK CERTAINLY IN TODAY'S

06:56.833 --> 06:59.333
CLIMATE, THE PROBLEM IS, IF TH

06:59.333 --> 07:01.167
UKRAINE BECOMES A MAJOR SOURCE

07:01.167 --> 07:03.633
OF CONFRONTATION BETWEEN EAS

07:03.633 --> 07:06.667
AND WEST, IF RUSSIA GOES BEYON

07:06.667 --> 07:10.233
THE CRIMEA, AND THRUSTS INTO THE

07:10.233 --> 07:12.033
UKRAINE, THEN NATO'S RESPONS

07:12.033 --> 07:16.100
WOULD HAVE TO BE LARGELY I

07:16.100 --> 07:17.400
OTHER AREAS, AND THAT COUL

07:17.400 --> 07:18.933
TRIGGER A PROCESS OF

07:18.933 --> 07:20.167
CONFRONTATION, THAT NONE O

07:20.167 --> 07:21.633
THESE STATES CAN PREDICT

07:21.633 --> 07:24.533
>> ANTHONY, JOINING US FRO

07:44.933 --> 07:46.700

07:46.700 --> 07:47.967
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES ABOUT

07:47.967 --> 07:49.633
TENURE FOR TEACHERS.

07:49.633 --> 07:52.267
THAT BATTLE IS NOW PLAYING OUT

07:52.267 --> 07:53.033
IN A CALIFORNIA COURTROOM WHER

07:53.033 --> 07:54.667

FORCES WITH A MULTIMILLIONAIRE

07:56.000 --> 07:57.500
