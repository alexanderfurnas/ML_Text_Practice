00:32.399 --> 00:33.533
TO DO THIS WHERE IT CAN BE

00:33.533 --> 00:35.535
REGULATED, IT CAN BE TAXED.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.137
>> THE DEBATE IS, SHOULD

00:37.137 --> 00:38.238
GOVERNMENT BE SPONSORING

00:38.238 --> 00:39.606
PREDATORY FORMS OF GAMBLING?

00:54.454 --> 00:56.690
TO KEEP PERSONAL INFORMATION

01:01.361 --> 01:02.362
AMERICAN SERVICEMEN AND URGED

01:02.362 --> 01:03.430

01:04.665 --> 01:06.433
PHOTOGRAPHS OF MARINES, SAILORS

01:06.433 --> 01:07.634

01:07.634 --> 01:09.102
WHO HAVE STRUCK ISIS TARGETS IN

01:09.102 --> 01:12.606
IRAQ AND SYRIA.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.274
THE LIST WAS PUBLISHED BY GROUP

01:14.274 --> 01:15.976
CALLING ITSELF THE ISLAMIC STATE

01:15.976 --> 01:17.344
HACKING DIVISION, BUT A PENTAGON

01:17.344 --> 01:18.712
OFFICIAL SAID THE PERSONAL

01:18.712 --> 01:20.180
INFORMATION APPARENTLY WAS

01:20.180 --> 01:21.615
GLEANED FROM PUBLIC RECORDS AND

01:21.615 --> 01:22.683
ONLINE SEARCHES.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.151
A DAY AFTER SECRETARY OF STATE

01:24.151 --> 01:25.986
JOHN KERRY AND IRANIAN PRESIDENT

01:25.986 --> 01:27.554
HASSAN ROUHANI SIGNALED THAT THE

01:27.554 --> 01:32.459
WEST AND IRAN ARE GETTING CLOSE

01:32.459 --> 01:33.327
TO A NUCLEAR DEAL,

01:33.327 --> 01:34.428
CIA DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN

01:34.428 --> 01:36.029
OFFERED ASSURANCES TODAY THAT

01:36.029 --> 01:36.964
IRAN WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CHEAT

01:36.964 --> 01:39.833
ON IT.

01:39.833 --> 01:40.701
>> IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF

01:40.701 --> 01:42.202
TRUSTING THE IRANIANS ON THIS.

01:42.202 --> 01:43.670
I KNOW THAT SECRETARY KERRY AND

01:43.670 --> 01:45.005
PRESIDENT OBAMA ARE COMFORTABLE

01:45.005 --> 01:46.573
WITH WHAT IT IS THAT WE ARE

01:46.573 --> 01:47.641
INSISTING ON AS FAR AS A

01:47.641 --> 01:48.775
VERIFICATION REGIME.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.277
>> BUT FRANKLY OUR TRACK RECORD

01:50.277 --> 01:51.645
WHEN IT COMES TO IRAN AND ITS

01:51.645 --> 01:53.080
NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS NOT GOOD.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.681
IRANIAN OPPOSITION GROUPS IN

01:54.681 --> 01:56.383
2002 WERE THE ONES THAT REVEALED

01:56.383 --> 01:58.018
THAT THE REGIME HAD SECRET

01:58.018 --> 02:00.354
FACILITIES AT NATANZ AND IRAQ

02:00.354 --> 02:02.756
AND ONE OF YOUR PREDECESSORS

02:02.756 --> 02:04.257
MICHAEL HAYDEN SAID THEY HAD

02:04.257 --> 02:06.326
DONE A LOT OF WORK AT FORDO

02:06.326 --> 02:11.098
BEFORE WE KNEW ABOUT IT.

02:11.098 --> 02:13.333
FACT IS THEY FOOLED US

02:13.333 --> 02:14.501
REPEATEDLY THE IRANIANS.

02:14.501 --> 02:15.635
>> AND I THINK WE'VE GONE TO

02:15.635 --> 02:16.903
SCHOOL ON SOME OF THOSE

02:16.903 --> 02:18.005
DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE LAST

02:18.005 --> 02:19.539
DECADE OR SO, SO THAT NOW WE CAN

02:19.539 --> 02:21.541
HAVE BETTER PLAN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:21.541 --> 02:23.677
VERIFY SOME OF THE THINGS THEY

02:23.677 --> 02:25.812
ARE SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO DO

02:25.812 --> 02:27.147
AND NOT DO.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.116
>> Sreenivasan: DISAGREEMENTS

02:29.116 --> 02:30.217
ABOUT THOSE NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS

02:30.217 --> 02:31.752
HAVE FUELED TENSIONS BETWEEN

02:31.752 --> 02:33.120
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN

02:33.120 --> 02:34.354
NETANYAHU AND PRESIDENT OBAMA.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.455
AND SO DID A RECENT COMMENT BY

02:35.455 --> 02:37.257
THE ISRAELI LEADER EXPRESSING

02:37.257 --> 02:38.525
OPPOSITION TO A TWO-STATE

02:38.525 --> 02:40.660
SOLUTION WITH THE PALESTINIANS.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.362
TODAY, THE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO

02:42.362 --> 02:44.031
THE UNITED STATES SOUGHT TO

02:44.031 --> 02:45.432
CLARIFY THE PRIME MINISTER'S

02:45.432 --> 02:46.533
POSITION.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.602
>> HE IS COMMITTED TO A VISION

02:48.602 --> 02:49.936
OF PEACE OF TWO STATES FOR TWO

02:49.936 --> 02:51.605
PEOPLES, A DEMILITARIZED

02:51.605 --> 02:52.906
PALESTINIAN STATE THAT

02:52.906 --> 02:54.408
RECOGNIZES THE JEWISH STATE OF

02:54.408 --> 02:55.542
ISRAEL.

02:55.542 --> 02:56.810
WHAT HAS CHANGED IS THE

02:56.810 --> 02:58.178
CIRCUMSTANCES OVER THE LAST FEW

02:58.178 --> 02:59.346
YEARS.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.614
WE HAVE A COLLAPSE OF 100 YEAR

03:00.614 --> 03:01.815
ORDER IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND

03:01.815 --> 03:02.983
MILITANT ISLAM IS CHARGING INTO

03:02.983 --> 03:04.017
THE VOID.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.152
THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT

03:05.152 --> 03:05.852
CHANGED.

03:05.852 --> 03:06.987
THE SECOND THING THAT CHANGED

03:06.987 --> 03:07.988
IS THAT A YEAR AGO, TEN MONTHS

03:07.988 --> 03:09.523
AGO, THE LEADER OF THE

03:09.523 --> 03:11.058
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY REACHED

03:11.058 --> 03:12.592
OUT TO A TERROR ORGANIZATION AND

03:12.592 --> 03:14.428
FORGED AN ALLIANCE WITH HAMAS.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.896
WHAT ISRAEL BELIEVES HAS TO

03:15.896 --> 03:17.164
HAPPEN NOW IS THAT PRESIDENT

03:17.164 --> 03:18.532
ABBAS HAS TO BREAK HIS ALLIANCE

03:18.532 --> 03:19.766
WITH HAMAS AND RETURN TO PEACE

03:19.766 --> 03:21.234
NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAEL.

03:21.234 --> 03:22.702
IF THAT HAPPENS AND WE CAN SOLVE

03:22.702 --> 03:24.204
THE PROBLEM OF ISRAEL'S

03:24.204 --> 03:25.639
LEGITIMATE SECURITY NEEDS, THEN

03:25.639 --> 03:27.007
WE CAN GET BACK TO THE PEACE

03:27.007 --> 03:28.208
TABLE.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.410
>> Sreenivasan: IN YEMEN TODAY,

03:30.410 --> 03:31.945
PRO-IRANIAN REBELS SEIZED KEY

03:31.945 --> 03:33.713
LOCATIONS IN THE NATION'S THIRD

03:33.713 --> 03:34.481
LARGEST CITY.

03:34.481 --> 03:35.649
A DEVELOPMENT REGIONAL OFFICIALS

03:35.649 --> 03:36.750
SAY COULD HAVE SERIOUS

03:36.750 --> 03:38.185
CONSEQUENCES FOR SECURITY AND

03:38.185 --> 03:39.319
STABILITY

03:39.319 --> 03:40.487
REPORTEDLY, REBELS THERE FIRED

03:40.487 --> 03:42.189
GUNS AND TEAR GAS TO DISPERSE

03:42.189 --> 03:44.057
DEMONSTRATORS WHO HAD GATHERED

03:44.057 --> 03:45.459
TO PROTEST THEIR PRESENCE

03:45.459 --> 03:47.994
IN KABUL, AFGHANISTAN TODAY,

03:47.994 --> 03:49.162
HUNDREDS OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS

03:49.162 --> 03:50.163
ACTIVISTS TURNED OUT FOR THE

03:50.163 --> 03:51.131
FUNERAL OF A 27-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

03:51.131 --> 03:52.165
WHO WAS BEATEN, SET ON FIRE AND

03:52.165 --> 03:56.803
TOSSED INTO A RIVER BY A MOB OF

03:56.803 --> 03:57.737
MEN EARLIER THIS WEEK.

03:57.737 --> 03:58.772
THEY HAD ACCUSED HER OF

03:58.772 --> 03:59.873
DESECRATING A KORAN, A CHARGE

03:59.873 --> 04:01.041
AUTHORITIES DISPUTE.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.209
THE PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN,

04:02.209 --> 04:03.510
ASHRAF GHANI, CONDEMNED THE

04:03.510 --> 04:04.678
ATTACK AND CALLED FOR AN

04:04.678 --> 04:05.512
INVESTIGATION.

04:05.512 --> 04:06.580
13 PEOPLE REPORTEDLY HAVE BEEN

04:06.580 --> 04:07.314
ARRESTED SO FAR.

04:07.314 --> 04:09.015
TURNING NOW TO NEWS FROM EUROPE.

04:09.015 --> 04:11.051
THERE WAS VOTING TODAY IN LOCAL

04:11.051 --> 04:12.052
ELECTIONS THROUGHOUT FRANCE, AND

04:12.052 --> 04:13.320
EARLY INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE

04:13.320 --> 04:14.688
FAR RIGHT LED BY THE NATIONAL

04:14.688 --> 04:16.256
FRONT PARTY LEADER, MARINE LE

04:16.256 --> 04:17.491
PEN, MADE GAINS ALONG WITH

04:17.491 --> 04:18.592
FORMER PRESIDENT NICHOLAS

04:18.592 --> 04:20.060
SARKOZY'S PARTY.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.394
TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED AND

04:21.394 --> 04:22.329
WHAT IT MEANS, WE ARE JOINED NOW

04:22.329 --> 04:23.930
VIA SKYPE FROM PARIS BY ELEANOR

04:23.930 --> 04:28.969
BEARDSLEY OF NPR.

04:28.969 --> 04:29.903
>> ELEANOR WE USUALLY WOULD NOT

04:29.903 --> 04:31.771
CARE ABOUT A LOCAL ELECTION OR

04:31.771 --> 04:33.573
LOCAL ELECTIONS IN FRANCE.

04:33.573 --> 04:34.975
WHY DID THIS ONE BECOME SO

04:34.975 --> 04:35.675
INTERESTING?

04:35.675 --> 04:38.645
>> THIS IS A LOCAL SORT OF

04:38.645 --> 04:40.280
ELECTIONS PEOPLE DON'T USUALLY

04:40.280 --> 04:42.048
GO VOTE IN HUGE NUMBERS.

04:42.048 --> 04:43.283
IT BECAME VERY INTERESTING

04:43.283 --> 04:44.584
BECAUSE THE NATIONAL FRONT THE

04:44.584 --> 04:47.187
TAR RIGHT NATIONAL FRONT PARTY

04:47.187 --> 04:50.190
WAS IN THE LEAD, SO THE PARTIES

04:50.190 --> 04:52.225
ON THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT BECAME

04:52.225 --> 04:53.660
VERY SCARED AND TOLD VOTERS YOU

04:53.660 --> 04:55.195
GOT TO GO OUT AND VOTE BECAUSE

04:55.195 --> 04:59.032
IF YOU DON'T VOTE THAT'S A PULL

04:59.032 --> 05:00.433
AWAY FROM THE NATIONAL FRONT.

05:00.433 --> 05:03.270
THERE WAS NOT THIS HUGE WAVE OF

05:03.270 --> 05:05.005
VOTES FOR THE NATIONAL FRONT.

05:05.005 --> 05:09.176
THE LEAD PARTY WAS NICHOLAS

05:09.176 --> 05:10.977
SARKOZY'S MAINSTREAM PARTY.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.846
ABOUT 50% OF VOTERS TURNED OUT

05:12.846 --> 05:14.181
ON THE FIRST ROUND OF THIS POLL

05:14.181 --> 05:16.349
AND THEY VOTED IN THE MAINSTREAM

05:16.349 --> 05:17.083
CONSERVATIVE PARTY.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.885
SECOND PLACE WAS THE SOCIALIST

05:18.885 --> 05:19.619
PARTY.

05:19.619 --> 05:23.290
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF

05:23.290 --> 05:25.659
DISENCHANTMENT WITH BE

05:25.659 --> 05:26.326
SOCIALIST PRESIDENT FRANCOIS

05:26.326 --> 05:26.860
HOLLANDE.

05:26.860 --> 05:30.063
AND 24% OF THE VOTE THEY HAD A

05:30.063 --> 05:30.931
DECENT SCORE.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.400
>> ON THAT DECENT SCORE IS THAT

05:33.400 --> 05:34.901
MOTIVATED IN PART BY THE

05:34.901 --> 05:39.072
TERRORIST ATTACK OR IMMIGRATION

05:39.072 --> 05:40.407
POLICIES OR WHAT'S BEEN

05:40.407 --> 05:41.308
HAPPENING?

05:41.308 --> 05:43.643
>> ABSOLUTELY, AFTER CHARLIE

05:43.643 --> 05:52.385
HEBDO ATTACK, THEIR POPULARITY

05:52.385 --> 05:54.120
DOUBLED.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.289
THAT THEY DON'T CONTROL

05:56.289 --> 05:57.757
CORPORATION AND CRIME HAS REALLY

05:57.757 --> 05:58.959
INCREASED THEIR NUMBERS BUT

05:58.959 --> 06:01.328
ANOTHER THING THAT ADDED TO THE

06:01.328 --> 06:02.395
NATIONAL FRONT SUCCESS DURING

06:02.395 --> 06:04.631
THIS CAMPAIGN IS THERE'S A LOT

06:04.631 --> 06:06.733
OF DISENCHANTMENT WITH BOTH

06:06.733 --> 06:07.834
MAINSTREAM PARTIES THAT THEY'RE

06:07.834 --> 06:10.370
THE SAME THING, THAT -- PARTIES

06:10.370 --> 06:12.939
THAT THEY DON'T DO THE SAME

06:12.939 --> 06:14.107
THING, MARINE LE PEN, THE NEW

06:14.107 --> 06:15.675
LEADER FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS

06:15.675 --> 06:17.777
SHE TOOK OVER FROM HER FATHER,

06:17.777 --> 06:18.678
SHE'S REALLY CHANGED THE IMAGE

06:18.678 --> 06:19.713
OF THE PARTY.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.948
IT USED TO BE SORT OF A GOOD OLD

06:21.948 --> 06:26.753
BOYS CLUB OF THESE FORMER

06:26.753 --> 06:30.223
ALGERIAN FIGHTERS, WITH A LOT OF

06:30.223 --> 06:31.424
ANTI-SEMITISM.

06:31.424 --> 06:33.627
SHE HAS TRIED TO BRING IN A LOT

06:33.627 --> 06:37.130
OF WOMEN AND OTHERS, AND SHE HAS

06:37.130 --> 06:38.498
TO SOME THERE DEGREE.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.267
IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARY

06:40.267 --> 06:41.101
ELECTIONS.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.902
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE 12 MAYORS

06:42.902 --> 06:44.437
GOVERNING IN FRANCE AND NOT JUST

06:44.437 --> 06:46.206
A SCARE TACTICS PARTY ANYMORE.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.741
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE PEOPLE ON THE

06:47.741 --> 06:48.608
GROUND GOVERNING.

06:48.608 --> 06:51.211
SHE POINTS TO THAT AND SAYS WE

06:51.211 --> 06:51.978
CAN CHANGE THINGS NOW.

06:51.978 --> 06:55.148
>> DOES THAT MEAN SHE HAS THE

06:55.148 --> 06:56.650
OPPORTUNITY TO PERHAPS BECOME

06:56.650 --> 06:57.450
THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN

06:57.450 --> 06:58.318
THE NEXT FEW YEARS?

06:58.318 --> 07:00.320
>> THAT'S ALWAYS THROWN AROUND.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.523
THE ANALYSTS SAY SHE WANTED TO

07:03.523 --> 07:07.260
USE A BIG WIN IN THE LOCALITY

07:07.260 --> 07:09.229
CANTON ELECTIONS TO USE IT TO

07:09.229 --> 07:10.063
THE PRESIDENCY.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.265
I DON'T THINK SHE'S GOING TO

07:12.265 --> 07:14.134
BECOME PRESIDENT OF FRANCE.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.769
THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE AGAINST.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.138
THEY COULD MAKE BIG INROADS IN

07:18.138 --> 07:19.239
MUNICIPAL IN LOCAL ELECTIONS.

07:19.239 --> 07:22.642
THEY COULD RUN TOWNS, THEY COULD

07:22.642 --> 07:26.279
RON CAN TONS, I DON'T THINK SO

07:26.279 --> 07:28.114
SHE'S GOING TO BE ELECTED

07:28.114 --> 07:30.150
PRESIDENT ANY TIME SOON.

07:30.150 --> 07:40.627
>> ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, THANK YOU.

07:40.627 --> 07:41.661
>> Sreenivasan: FROM BEIJING

07:41.661 --> 07:42.562
TONIGHT, A RARE ADMISSION ABOUT

07:42.562 --> 07:43.763
THE SEVERITY OF CLIMATE CHANGE:

07:43.763 --> 07:44.931
A TOP CHINESE METEOROLOGICAL

07:44.931 --> 07:45.732
OFFICIAL IS QUOTED AS SAYING

07:45.732 --> 07:46.733
CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY HAVING

07:46.733 --> 07:51.004
WHAT HE CALLED A "HUGE IMPACT"

07:51.004 --> 07:52.072
ON THAT COUNTRY.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.273
HE WARNED OF MORE DROUGHTS AND

07:53.273 --> 07:54.708
CLIMBING TEMPERATURES AND SAID

07:54.708 --> 07:55.975
CROP YIELDS ARE ALREADY

07:55.975 --> 08:00.380
DECLINING.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.681
THE PENTAGON HAS TWO MONTHS TO

08:01.681 --> 08:03.183
DECIDE HOW TO RESPOND TO A COURT

08:03.183 --> 08:04.284
RULING ORDERING IT TO RELEASE

08:04.284 --> 08:05.485
PHOTOGRAPHS DOCUMENTING THE

08:05.485 --> 08:06.853
ABUSE OF PRISONERS IN IRAQ AND

08:06.853 --> 08:08.988
AFGHANISTAN.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.490
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WARN THAT

08:10.490 --> 08:12.025
MAKING THE PHOTOS PUBLIC COULD

08:12.025 --> 08:13.827
INFLAME TENSIONS IN THE ALREADY

08:13.827 --> 08:15.195
VERY VOLATILE MIDDLE EAST.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.363
FOR MORE ABOUT THIS, WE ARE

08:16.363 --> 08:18.698
JOINED NOW BY JENNIFER PELTZ OF

08:18.698 --> 08:21.601
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.

08:21.601 --> 08:23.036
SO, FIRST OF ALL, ARE THESE

08:23.036 --> 08:25.171
SIMILAR TO OR THE SAME AS THESE

08:25.171 --> 08:26.639
PHOTOS THAT WE SAW ALMOST A

08:26.639 --> 08:27.474
DECADE AGO NOW?

08:27.474 --> 08:28.641
HOW MANY MORE ARE THERE?

08:28.641 --> 08:30.477
>> WELL ALL THAT IS KIND OF A

08:30.477 --> 08:31.277
QUESTION MARK.

08:31.277 --> 08:32.579
OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T

08:32.579 --> 08:35.115
BEEN SEEN, BUT ALSO, IT'S

08:35.115 --> 08:36.383
UNCLEAR EVEN HOW MANY

08:36.383 --> 08:37.550
PHOTOGRAPHS MAY EXIST.

08:37.550 --> 08:39.586
THIS ALL STEMS FROM A FREEDOM OF

08:39.586 --> 08:42.389
INFORMATION ACT REQUEST THAT THE

08:42.389 --> 08:45.058
AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

08:45.058 --> 08:46.693
FILED IN 2003 ASKING FOR

08:46.693 --> 08:48.294
DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF

08:48.294 --> 08:49.896
DETAINEES BY THE U.S. MILITARY

08:49.896 --> 08:50.964
IN VARIOUS PLACES AROUND THE

08:50.964 --> 08:51.931
WORLD.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.266
AND THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS

08:53.266 --> 08:55.435
NUMBERS FLOATED OVER TIME.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.704
BUT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT

08:57.704 --> 08:59.639
THERE COULD BE HUNDREDS OR EVEN

08:59.639 --> 09:01.074
THOUSANDS OF PHOTOGRAPHS, WHAT

09:01.074 --> 09:04.711
THEY DEPICT, AND WHETHER THEY

09:04.711 --> 09:06.012
DEPICT WHAT COULD BE CONSIDERED

09:06.012 --> 09:06.946
ABUSE IS ALSO UNCLEAR.

09:06.946 --> 09:08.982
>> SO WHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT

09:08.982 --> 09:10.950
DO IN THESE NEXT TWO MONTHS?

09:10.950 --> 09:11.851
WHAT ARE THEIR OPTIONS?

09:11.851 --> 09:13.286
>> WELL, THE GOVERNMENT ASKED

09:13.286 --> 09:14.654
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO DECIDE

09:14.654 --> 09:15.855
WHETHER IT SHOULD APPEAL OR

09:15.855 --> 09:17.190
WHETHER IT WANTED TO APPEAL.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.958
SO THAT'S ONE THING THAT

09:18.958 --> 09:19.759
APPARENTLY THE DEFENSE

09:19.759 --> 09:22.362
DEPARTMENT WILL BE DECIDING.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.763
IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE

09:23.763 --> 09:25.665
GOVERNMENT COULD TRY TO ANSWER

09:25.665 --> 09:29.436
SOME OF THE JUDGE'S QUESTIONS

09:29.436 --> 09:30.870
ABOUT SPECIFICALLY WHAT THESE

09:30.870 --> 09:32.372
PHOTOGRAPHS ARE, AND

09:32.372 --> 09:33.740
SPECIFICALLY WHY EACH ONE SHOULD

09:33.740 --> 09:34.774
BE WITHHELD.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.177
>> AND SO THIS OF COURSE DOESN'T

09:37.177 --> 09:39.279
SIT BEEN WITH THE ACLU WHO WON

09:39.279 --> 09:41.548
THIS RULING AT THE MOMENT.

09:41.548 --> 09:42.916
>> ABSOLUTELY.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.451
THEIR ORGANIZATION HAS WANTED

09:44.451 --> 09:45.652
THESE TO BE RELEASED FOR MORE

09:45.652 --> 09:46.486
THAN A DECADE.

09:46.486 --> 09:47.854
IT FEELS AT A THESE ARE

09:47.854 --> 09:50.156
IMPORTANT AND TELLING RECORDS OF

09:50.156 --> 09:54.894
HOW THE MILITARY TREATED DETAIN

09:54.894 --> 09:56.930
DETAINEES AND THAT THEY SHOULD

09:56.930 --> 09:59.299
BE KNOWN HOWEVER DISTURBING THEY

09:59.299 --> 09:59.933
MAY BE.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.203
>> IN TOTALITY, NOT FOR THE

10:03.203 --> 10:05.238
GOVERNMENT TO DECIDE WHICH

10:05.238 --> 10:06.506
SHOULD BE PUBLIC AND WHICH

10:06.506 --> 10:07.140
SHOULD BE PRIVATE?

10:07.140 --> 10:10.109
>> A LAW PASSED IN 2009 DOES

10:10.109 --> 10:11.711
ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO WITHHOLD

10:11.711 --> 10:13.513
PHOTOGRAPHS IF IT BELIEVES THAT

10:13.513 --> 10:20.653
THEY ARE GOING TO INCITE HARMS

10:20.653 --> 10:21.554
TO PEOPLE OVERSEAS.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.822
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN THIS

10:22.822 --> 10:24.791
WITHOUT GETTING A LITTLE BIT

10:24.791 --> 10:25.892
GRANULAR BUT ESSENTIALLY ONE OF

10:25.892 --> 10:28.428
THE OBJECTION HE THAT THE ACLU

10:28.428 --> 10:30.897
HAS AND THE JUDGE HAS TO HOW THE

10:30.897 --> 10:31.998
GOVERNMENT HAS PROCEEDED IS THAT

10:31.998 --> 10:34.267
IT'S SAID IN A RATHER BLANKET

10:34.267 --> 10:36.236
WAY, ALL OF THESE PHOTOGRAPHS

10:36.236 --> 10:37.604
FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF WHAT

10:37.604 --> 10:39.539
SHOULD BE WITHHELD.

10:39.539 --> 10:42.275
AND BOTH THE ACLU AND THE

10:42.275 --> 10:44.210
GOVERNMENT FEEL THAT INSTEAD

10:44.210 --> 10:45.845
THERE SHOULD BE MORE SPECIFICITY

10:45.845 --> 10:48.147
ABOUT EACH ONE, WHY IT SHOULD BE

10:48.147 --> 10:51.551
WITHHELD, AND WHY NOW, OR AT

10:51.551 --> 10:53.219
LEAST, DOCUMENTATION THAT THE

10:53.219 --> 10:54.854
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE OR ANOTHER

10:54.854 --> 10:57.490
HIGH LEVEL DEFENSE OFFICIAL HAS

10:57.490 --> 10:59.626
SEEN THEM ALL, CONSIDERED THEM

10:59.626 --> 11:00.527
ALL INDIVIDUALLY.

11:00.527 --> 11:03.997
>> ALL RIGHT, JENNIFER PELTZ OF

11:03.997 --> 11:07.567
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, THANKS SO

11:07.567 --> 11:13.172
MUCH.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.440
AND NOW TO OUR SIGNATURE

11:14.440 --> 11:15.475
SEGMENT.

11:15.475 --> 11:16.709
TONIGHT, THE DEBATE ABOUT

11:16.709 --> 11:18.444
LEGALIZING BETTING ON SPORTS

11:18.444 --> 11:19.779
EVENTS.

11:19.779 --> 11:21.147
LIKE MILLIONS OF OTHER

11:21.147 --> 11:22.682
AMERICANS, EARLIER THIS WEEK,

11:22.682 --> 11:24.183
PRESIDENT OBAMA FILLED OUT HIS

11:24.183 --> 11:25.585
BRACKET PREDICTING THE OUTCOME

11:25.585 --> 11:26.853
OF THE N.C.A.A. BASKETBALL

11:26.853 --> 11:29.188
TOURNAMENT.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.758
AS FAR AS ANYONE KNOWS, THE

11:31.758 --> 11:33.226
PRESIDENT ISN'T BETTING MONEY ON

11:33.226 --> 11:34.460
THE GAMES, BUT MILLIONS OF

11:34.460 --> 11:35.495
OTHERS ARE.

11:35.495 --> 11:36.763
AND THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

11:36.763 --> 11:38.031
THOSE BETS ARE ILLEGAL.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.332
RECENTLY, THE COMMISSIONER OF

11:39.332 --> 11:40.733
THE NATIONAL BASKETBALL

11:40.733 --> 11:42.602
ASSOCIATION SAID THE U.S. SHOULD

11:42.602 --> 11:43.903
CONSIDER REPEALING THE FEDERAL

11:43.903 --> 11:46.839
BAN ON SPORTS GAMBLING.

11:46.839 --> 11:47.807
AND HE'S NOT ALONE.

11:47.807 --> 11:49.175
THERE'S A PUSH UNDERWAY IN

11:49.175 --> 11:50.610
CONGRESS AND IN CASH-STARVED

11:50.610 --> 11:51.978
STATES TO LEGALIZE IT.

11:51.978 --> 11:52.979
THE NEWSHOUR'S WILLIAM BRANGHAM

11:52.979 --> 11:55.348
REPORTS.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.616
>> Reporter: RIGHT NOW, MILLIONS

11:56.616 --> 11:58.418
OF BASKETBALL FANS IN AMERICA

11:58.418 --> 11:59.752
ARE BREAKING THE LAW, BY BETTING

11:59.752 --> 12:01.688
ON THE NCAA'S MARCH MADNESS

12:01.688 --> 12:03.122
TOURNAMENT.

12:03.122 --> 12:04.057
AND IT'S NOT JUST COLLEGE HOOPS,

12:04.057 --> 12:05.158
IT'S BETS PLACED ON ANY SPORT:

12:05.158 --> 12:06.225
THE NFL, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL,

12:06.225 --> 12:07.393
THE NBA.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.761
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR

12:08.761 --> 12:10.263
ARE WAGERED, BUT, EXCEPT FOR

12:10.263 --> 12:11.464
BETS PLACED IN PERSON, IN LAS

12:11.464 --> 12:12.565
VEGAS, THEY'RE ALMOST ALL

12:12.565 --> 12:15.268
ILLEGAL.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.436
CHAD MILLMAN IS THE EDITOR OF

12:16.436 --> 12:17.837
ESPN THE MAGAZINE, WHICH PUT NBA

12:17.837 --> 12:19.038
COMMISSIONER ADAM SILVER, AND

12:19.038 --> 12:20.373
HIS DISCUSSION OF LEGALIZING

12:20.373 --> 12:22.942
SPORTS BETTING, ON LAST MONTH'S

12:22.942 --> 12:24.010
FRONT COVER.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.144
>> Reporter: RIGHT NOW, OUTSIDE

12:25.144 --> 12:26.713
OF LAS VEGAS, IT IS ILLEGAL FOR

12:26.713 --> 12:27.714
ME TO PLACE A BET ON SPORTS.

12:27.714 --> 12:28.748
SO HOW DOES ONE GO ABOUT DOING

12:28.748 --> 12:30.116
THAT?

12:30.116 --> 12:33.353
>> YOU CALL YOUR BOOKIE.

12:33.353 --> 12:34.554
YOU GO ONLINE.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.322
A LOT, THERE'S A LOT OF INTERNET

12:36.322 --> 12:38.257
SITES WHERE YOU CAN MAKE A BET.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.259
>> Reporter: OFF-SHORE BETTING

12:40.259 --> 12:41.828
SITES LIKE THIS ONE, CALLED

12:41.828 --> 12:43.363
BOVADA, ARE A HUGE HUB FOR

12:43.363 --> 12:44.631
BETTING ON SPORTS.

12:44.631 --> 12:45.832
IT'S ILLEGAL FOR AMERICANS TO

12:45.832 --> 12:47.367
USE THESE SITES, BUT THEY DO.

12:47.367 --> 12:53.740
AUTHORITIES HAVE CRACKED DOWN ON

12:53.740 --> 12:54.907
THESE TRANSACTIONS RECENTLY, BUT

12:54.907 --> 12:56.309
THEY STILL CONTINUE.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.744
NOTICE THE WEBSITE'S ADDRESS,

12:57.744 --> 12:59.846
IT'S bovada.lv, YOU MIGHT THINK

12:59.846 --> 13:01.381
THAT STANDS FOR "LAS VEGAS?"

13:01.381 --> 13:02.548
NO, IT'S LATVIA.

13:02.548 --> 13:03.750
BECAUSE IT'S A BLACK MARKET,

13:03.750 --> 13:04.751
IT'S HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW

13:04.751 --> 13:06.219
MUCH MONEY GETS WAGERED

13:06.219 --> 13:07.654
ILLEGALLY, BUT THE FEDERAL

13:07.654 --> 13:08.921
GOVERNMENT ESTIMATED IT RANGES

13:08.921 --> 13:10.256
FROM $80 TO $300 BILLION, THAT'S

13:10.256 --> 13:11.290
BILLION WITH A "B," EVERY YEAR.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.825
>> Reporter: SO THAT'S A LOT OF

13:12.825 --> 13:13.926
MONEY.

13:13.926 --> 13:15.361
>> IT'S A LOT OF MONEY THAT'S

13:15.361 --> 13:16.229
NOT BEING TAXED.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.330
A LOT OF MONEY THAT IS GOING

13:17.330 --> 13:18.331
UNDER THE TABLE.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.365
>> Reporter: THESE DAYS, IT'S

13:19.365 --> 13:20.767
NOT JUST THE COMMISSIONER OF THE

13:20.767 --> 13:21.901
NBA WHO SAYS THIS SITUATION

13:21.901 --> 13:23.002
NEEDS TO CHANGE.

13:23.002 --> 13:24.203
THERE ARE A LOT OF CASH-STRAPPED

13:24.203 --> 13:25.471
STATES THAT WANT IN ON THAT

13:25.471 --> 13:26.339
ACTION, TOO.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.607
THE RESORT TOWN OF ATLANTIC CITY

13:27.607 --> 13:28.941
IS IN DIRE ECONOMIC STRAITS, ITS

13:28.941 --> 13:30.109
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 11%, DOUBLE

13:30.109 --> 13:32.078
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.813
SEVERAL OF THE CITY'S HUGE

13:33.813 --> 13:35.515
CASINOS ARE SHUTTERED, HIT BY

13:35.515 --> 13:36.816
THE ONE-TWO PUNCH OF THE

13:36.816 --> 13:38.551
FINANCIAL CRISIS, AND

13:38.551 --> 13:39.919
COMPETITION FROM NEW CASINOS IN

13:39.919 --> 13:41.320
NEIGHBORING STATES.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.789
SOME IN NEW JERSEY NOW WANT TO

13:42.789 --> 13:44.123
TAP INTO ILLEGAL SPORTS BETTING

13:44.123 --> 13:46.526
TO REVIVE THIS AREA.

13:46.526 --> 13:49.595
>> SO THE WHOLE IDEA CAME AS A

13:49.595 --> 13:51.364
RESULT OF THE CASINO AND THE

13:51.364 --> 13:53.066
RACETRACK INDUSTRY BEING ON HARD

13:53.066 --> 13:54.734
TIMES.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.135
>> Reporter: DENNIS DRAZIN IS A

13:56.135 --> 13:57.470
LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS MONMOUTH

13:57.470 --> 13:58.938
PARK RACETRACK IN NEW JERSEY,

13:58.938 --> 14:00.440
AND HE'S HELPED CHAMPION AN

14:00.440 --> 14:01.808
EFFORT TO LEGALIZE SPORTS

14:01.808 --> 14:03.042
BETTING AT THE STATES CASINOS

14:03.042 --> 14:04.077
AND RACETRACKS.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.611
HE SAYS THE BETTING IS ALREADY

14:05.611 --> 14:07.046
HAPPENING, SO WHY LET THE

14:07.046 --> 14:08.648
CRIMINALS BE THE ONES TO PROFIT?

14:08.648 --> 14:10.049
>> LET'S FIGURE OUT A LEGAL WAY

14:10.049 --> 14:11.818
TO DO THIS WHERE IT CAN BE

14:11.818 --> 14:14.120
REGULATED, IT CAN BE TAXED, IT

14:14.120 --> 14:16.556
CAN PROVIDE REVENUES NOT ONLY

14:16.556 --> 14:17.824
FOR THE RACETRACKS AND THE

14:17.824 --> 14:19.392
STATE, BUT MONEY CAN GO TO

14:19.392 --> 14:21.227
OTHERS ALSO, LIKE SENIOR

14:21.227 --> 14:23.296
CITIZENS, PROPERTY TAX RELIEF,

14:23.296 --> 14:24.731
MEDICAL CARE, WHATEVER THE NEEDS

14:24.731 --> 14:29.635
ARE OF THE INDIVIDUAL STATE.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.070
>> Reporter: PROPONENTS HAVE

14:31.070 --> 14:32.438
ESTIMATED NEW JERSEY COULD NET

14:32.438 --> 14:34.207
$100 MILLION A YEAR IN NEW TAX

14:34.207 --> 14:35.341
REVENUE, AND SO, THROUGH A

14:35.341 --> 14:37.076
REFERENDUM AND LEGISLATION OVER

14:37.076 --> 14:38.444
THE LAST FOUR YEARS, NEW JERSEY

14:38.444 --> 14:40.146
TRIED TO LEGALIZE SPORTS

14:40.146 --> 14:41.447
BETTING.

14:41.447 --> 14:42.849
THE FOLKS AT MONMOUTH PARK

14:42.849 --> 14:44.217
THOUGHT THEY WERE SO CLOSE TO

14:44.217 --> 14:46.119
SUCCESS THAT THEY ACTUALLY BUILT

BLATANTLY DISHONEST, IN TERMS OF

19:31.570 --> 19:33.339
SEEN TODAY IN OUR SOCIETY.

ARE ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE WHO
