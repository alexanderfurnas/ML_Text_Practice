JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.239 --> 00:07.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.174 --> 00:10.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
President Trump
meets with Canada's prime
minister, amid growing

00:10.978 --> 00:16.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concerns over the White House
national security
adviser's connections with
Russia.

00:16.783 --> 00:20.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then: rushing to repair a
California dam.

00:20.420 --> 00:27.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nearly 200,000 people are forced
to evacuate
as oncoming storms approach.

00:27.527 --> 00:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the digital front lines,
how students
are using technology to
investigate human

00:32.866 --> 00:34.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rights violations in the Middle
East.

00:34.668 --> 00:39.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HALEY WILLIS, Student: We're
really used to
being able to say, here's this
store, and

00:40.007 --> 00:42.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you type it into Google, you get
an address,
and you're done.

00:42.943 --> 00:47.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Syria, there's not easily
accessible addresses.

00:47.447 --> 00:49.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no Google Street View.

00:49.549 --> 00:52.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:52.986 --> 00:56.189 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:56.290 --> 01:08.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's word from
the White
House tonight that the president
is mulling

01:08.936 --> 01:13.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the fate of his national
security adviser,
General Michael Flynn.

01:13.206 --> 01:17.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That follows a day when Mr.
Trump hosted a
new VIP visitor.

01:17.844 --> 01:19.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has our report.

01:19.813 --> 01:24.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Our two nations share much more
than a border.

01:24.117 --> 01:25.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We share the same values.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Trump may
have been full
of praise for Canada and Prime
Minister Justin

01:29.589 --> 01:32.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trudeau, but the policy
differences were clear.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On immigration, Mr. Trump touted
new roundups.

01:34.928 --> 01:41.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And I said at the
beginning
we are going to get the bad
ones, the really

01:41.501 --> 01:42.402 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bad ones.

01:42.502 --> 01:43.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're getting them out.

01:43.503 --> 01:45.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's exactly what we're
doing.

01:45.172 --> 01:48.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that in the end everyone
is going
to be extremely happy.

01:48.408 --> 01:52.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I will tell you right now a
lot of people
are very, very happy right now.

01:52.846 --> 01:57.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump is also
fighting in federal
court to reinstate a ban on
travelers from

01:57.818 --> 01:59.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
seven mostly Muslim countries.

01:59.753 --> 02:06.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In sharp contrast, Mr. Trudeau
has welcomed
some 40,000 refugees from
war-torn Syria,

02:06.293 --> 02:08.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but, today, he declined to
criticize Mr. Trump.

02:09.029 --> 02:14.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUSTIN TRUDEAU, Canadian Prime
Minister: The
last thing Canadians expect is
for me to come

02:14.701 --> 02:21.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down and lecture another country
on how they
choose to govern themselves.

02:21.208 --> 02:28.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My role, our responsibility is
to continue
to govern in such a way that
reflects Canadians'

02:28.815 --> 02:31.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
approach and be a positive
example in world.

02:31.418 --> 02:36.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The two leaders also
talked NAFTA,
the North American Free Trade
Agreement.

02:36.289 --> 02:42.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUSTIN TRUDEAU: Millions of good
jobs on both
sides of the border depend on
the smooth and

02:42.462 --> 02:47.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
easy flow of goods and services
and people
back and forth across our
border.

02:47.868 --> 02:53.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And both President Trump and I
got elected
on commitments to support the
middle class,

02:53.840 --> 02:57.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to work hard for people who need
a real shot
at success.

02:57.644 --> 03:03.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump has called
for renegotiating
NAFTA, but, today, he
soft-pedaled that stance.

03:03.116 --> 03:07.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We have a very
outstanding trade
relationship with Canada.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will be tweaking it.

03:08.889 --> 03:12.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will be doing certain things
that are going
to benefit both of our
countries.

03:12.859 --> 03:16.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a much less severe
situation than what's
taken place on the southern
border.

03:17.030 --> 03:22.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The president wasn't
asked about
Michael Flynn, his embattled
national security

03:22.402 --> 03:26.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adviser, and he ignored shouted
questions
after the formal news conference
ended.

03:26.706 --> 03:32.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post reports
that, despite
his earlier denial, Flynn did
talk to the

03:32.479 --> 03:37.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian ambassador to the United
States about
dropping sanctions on Moscow
before the inauguration.

03:38.085 --> 03:41.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That would have been illegal,
since he was
a private citizen at the time.

03:41.788 --> 03:46.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, he appears to have
misled Vice
President Pence, who publicly
vouched for

03:46.560 --> 03:48.361 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Flynn.

03:48.462 --> 03:51.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the retired general says he
can't recall
if he and the Russian envoy
discussed the

03:52.099 --> 03:53.934 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sanctions.

03:54.034 --> 04:00.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, senior Trump Kellyanne
Conway said
Flynn still had the president's
full confidence,

04:00.173 --> 04:04.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that after senior policy adviser
Stephen Miller
pointedly declined to defend
Flynn over the

04:05.011 --> 04:06.680 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weekend.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Would that be
considered a fireable
offense in the Trump White
House?

04:09.116 --> 04:11.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN MILLER, Senior Trump
Policy Adviser:
It's not for me to answer
hypotheticals.

04:11.551 --> 04:12.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wouldn't be responsible.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a sensitive matter.

04:14.621 --> 04:16.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
General Flynn has served his
country admirably.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He served his country with
distinction.

04:18.592 --> 04:22.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Kremlin said
again today that
Flynn didn't discuss lifting
sanctions with

04:22.762 --> 04:23.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Russian ambassador.

04:24.064 --> 04:27.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang at the
White House.

04:27.467 --> 04:31.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matters took a
different turn
just within the past hour when
White House

04:31.638 --> 04:36.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Press Secretary Sean Spicer read
a statement
to reporters, saying that the
president is

04:36.676 --> 04:42.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- quote -- "evaluating the
situation" regarding
Michael Flynn and he is speaking
with Vice

04:42.449 --> 04:44.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
President Pence about it.

04:45.018 --> 04:49.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
U.S. Senate moved
to confirm two more Trump
Cabinet nominees

04:49.356 --> 04:51.124 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this evening.

04:51.224 --> 04:55.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are former Goldman Sachs
banker Steve
Mnuchin for secretary of the
treasury, and

04:55.729 --> 04:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. David Shulkin to head the
Department of
Veterans Affairs.

04:59.366 --> 05:05.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senators grappled this afternoon
over Mnuchin's
record at OneWest Bank, when it
foreclosed

05:05.839 --> 05:06.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on thousands of homes.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.675 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:08.775 --> 05:10.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (D), Rhode
Island: I simply
cannot forgive somebody who took
a look at

05:10.977 --> 05:15.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that banking crisis, who took a
look at the
pain that Wall Street had sent
in a wave across

05:16.082 --> 05:22.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of America and thought, ah,
here's a great
new way to make money,
foreclosing on people.

05:22.789 --> 05:23.823 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Done.

05:23.924 --> 05:24.824 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I'm out.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sorry, can't vote for somebody
like that.

05:26.626 --> 05:28.428 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:28.528 --> 05:30.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ORRIN HATCH (R), Utah: They have
essentially
thrown everything, including the
kitchen sink,

05:30.230 --> 05:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at this nominee in a desperate
attempt to
block his confirmation.

05:34.467 --> 05:38.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, so far, Mr. President,
nothing has worked.

05:39.072 --> 05:42.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's because none of the
allegations that
my colleagues have raised can
withstand even

05:42.542 --> 05:45.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a modest amount of scrutiny.

05:45.111 --> 05:50.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Shulkin, the
Veterans nominee,
is a former Obama administration
official

05:50.150 --> 05:53.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and has had greater bipartisan
support.

05:53.720 --> 05:58.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump vowed today to
-- quote -- "deal
with North Korea," after it
test-fired a new

05:58.658 --> 06:02.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
type of solid-fuel ballistic
missile early
Sunday.

06:02.562 --> 06:04.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He didn't elaborate.

06:04.164 --> 06:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korean state TV today
released video
of the launch.

06:07.567 --> 06:13.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A U.S. tracking of the
intermediate-range
missile showed it traveled about
310 miles,

06:13.240 --> 06:16.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before landing in the Sea of
Japan.

06:16.643 --> 06:22.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A powerful storm dumped two feet
of snow or
more on states along the
Northeast Seaboard

06:22.382 --> 06:24.184 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

06:24.284 --> 06:28.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The storm blasted its way from
Upstate New
York to Maine, touching off car
crashes and

06:28.188 --> 06:30.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
closing roads and hundreds of
schools.

06:31.057 --> 06:34.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Crews worked to dig out streets,
as the snow
kept coming.

06:34.794 --> 06:39.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Our biggest concern moving
forward is
what's happening with all this
snow.

06:39.633 --> 06:44.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're worried about snowplow
drivers blocking
vents or snow falling off of
roofs.

06:45.005 --> 06:50.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The storm is
expected to ease
tonight, but coastal towns are
bracing for

06:50.210 --> 06:52.012 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
flooding.

06:52.112 --> 06:56.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal judge in Washington,
D.C., has denied
the latest bid by two Sioux
Indian tribes

06:56.883 --> 07:00.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to block completion of the
Dakota Access oil
pipeline.

07:00.687 --> 07:05.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The judge ruled that there's no
immediate
risk as long as oil is not yet
running through

07:05.425 --> 07:07.127 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the line.

07:07.227 --> 07:11.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The tribes say the pipeline will
endanger
water supplies and cultural
sites, and they

07:11.131 --> 07:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vow to pursue the case.

07:13.466 --> 07:16.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wall Street today, financial
stocks led
a broad advance.

07:16.936 --> 07:24.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 142
points to close at 20412,
another new Dow

07:24.477 --> 07:25.512 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
record.

07:25.612 --> 07:29.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 29, and the S&amp;P
500 added
12.

07:29.949 --> 07:34.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're still buzzing about the
Grammy Awards
and a banner night for Adele.

07:34.554 --> 07:39.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She won for song and record of
the year with
"Hello," and album of the year,
"25."

07:39.926 --> 07:46.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It came at the expense of
Beyonce, who won
instead for best contemporary
urban album

07:46.399 --> 07:48.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with "Lemonade."

07:48.268 --> 07:53.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it fueled new criticism that
black artists
are overshadowed, and Adele said
later that

07:53.640 --> 07:56.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Beyonce deserved the album
award.

07:56.976 --> 08:03.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All this on the same day a
seven-time Grammy
Winner, Al Jarreau, died in Los
Angeles, just

08:03.116 --> 08:05.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two days after announcing his
retirement.

08:05.585 --> 08:11.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jarreau was lauded for his deft
vocals and
earned critical acclaim in R&amp;B
and pop as

well as jazz.

His best-known hits included

Al Jarreau was 76 years old.

08:21.401 --> 08:25.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
reports of
the president's National
Security Council

08:25.372 --> 08:33.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in disarray; erosion at a
California lake
forces nearly 200,000 to
evacuate; rare video

08:33.279 --> 08:49.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
showing life under the terror
group Boko Haram;
and much more.

08:49.162 --> 08:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been less than a month
since Donald Trump
took office, but already there
are numerous

08:53.733 --> 08:59.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
reports that the National
Security Council,
which advises the president on
key foreign,

08:59.572 --> 09:02.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
military and intelligence
issues, is in disarray.

09:03.009 --> 09:08.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The leader of the NSC, retired
Army General
Michael Flynn, has come under
increasing criticism

09:08.281 --> 09:11.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for his contacts with Russia's
ambassador
to the U.S.

09:11.918 --> 09:13.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We turn now to Leon Panetta.

09:13.887 --> 09:19.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He served as the director of the
CIA and secretary
of defense during the Obama
administration.

09:19.359 --> 09:23.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also served as White House
chief of staff
for President Clinton.

09:23.530 --> 09:27.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And David Sanger, he covers
national security
for The New York Times.

09:27.534 --> 09:29.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the program.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Sanger, I'm going to start
with you.

09:31.871 --> 09:35.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You and your colleagues at The
New York Times
wrote a pretty remarkable story
yesterday

09:35.442 --> 09:41.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about -- well, you can't use any
words other
than disarray, chaos, inside the
National

09:41.481 --> 09:42.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Security Council.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Given that, and the events of
today, where
do things stand?

09:46.085 --> 09:50.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SANGER, The New York
Times: Well, I
think that everybody in the
National Security

09:50.690 --> 09:55.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Council is wondering when
they're going to
begin to get to what the council
is supposed

09:55.762 --> 10:03.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be doing, which is coordinate
among the
different agencies of
government, bring in

10:03.269 --> 10:04.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
intelligence, debate policy.

10:04.671 --> 10:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And several things have gotten
in the way
of doing that, Judy.

10:08.241 --> 10:16.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The first is that, as you
reported before,
General Flynn has been under
this cloud and

10:16.216 --> 10:18.017 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation.

10:18.117 --> 10:23.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we hear just a little
while ago that
President Trump and Vice
President Pence are

10:23.490 --> 10:28.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
considering his fate, that just
an hour after
we were told that he's got the
president's

10:28.628 --> 10:30.263 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
full confidence.

10:30.363 --> 10:35.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second thing that is going
on is that
the staff itself is a little bit
paranoid

10:35.368 --> 10:36.936 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now.

10:37.036 --> 10:43.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They know that Mr. Flynn has
talked about
starting an insider threat
program.

10:43.309 --> 10:48.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That seems to them to be an
invitation for
their e-mails to be monitored,
their cell

10:48.181 --> 10:49.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
phones to be watched.

10:50.049 --> 10:53.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't know that any of that
is going to
happen, but it gives you a sense
of the mood.

10:53.419 --> 10:57.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the third thing is that many
of the people
on the NSC, this body that is
supposed to

10:57.724 --> 11:03.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coordinate all this different
policy, come
from the agencies, and they feel
as if they

11:03.963 --> 11:05.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have been frozen out.

11:05.899 --> 11:10.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet there is no one above
them who has
got a clear job responsibility.

11:10.803 --> 11:14.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I would say that, for an
operation that
is supposed to run like a
business, it's not

11:14.440 --> 11:15.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
running much like a business.

11:15.642 --> 11:18.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, there's a
lot to tackle
there.

11:18.311 --> 11:23.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Secretary Panetta, I want
to go first
to the fate of Michael Flynn,
the general

11:23.149 --> 11:26.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who is the president's national
security adviser.

11:26.352 --> 11:31.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we have been reporting and as
David just
said, the president himself
issued a statement

11:32.025 --> 11:36.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through his press secretary
tonight saying
that he's talking to the vice
president about

11:36.629 --> 11:38.364 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what to do.

11:38.464 --> 11:45.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is what General Flynn reportedly
did, talking
to the Russian ambassador to the
U.S. before

11:45.104 --> 11:51.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump takes office
about what to
do about Russian sanctions, is
that something

11:51.678 --> 11:58.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is just off -- should be,
frankly, off-limits
for someone in his position,
advising the

11:58.384 --> 12:00.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president-to-be?

12:00.320 --> 12:04.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LEON PANETTA, Former U.S.
Secretary of Defense:
Well, there's a lot for the
president and

12:04.290 --> 12:07.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the vice president to consider
here.

12:07.493 --> 12:13.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think first and foremost is,
one of the
principal qualities that you
need as national

12:13.333 --> 12:17.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security adviser is trust, the
trust of the
president.

12:17.770 --> 12:21.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that depends on truth and it
depends on
honesty.

12:21.641 --> 12:29.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if, indeed, the national
security adviser
didn't tell the truth to the
vice president,

12:29.649 --> 12:34.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the vice president in turn
went out to
the American people and said
that he had had

12:34.287 --> 12:41.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no such conversations with the
Russian ambassador,
I think that's a serious matter,
and one for

12:41.160 --> 12:43.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them to think seriously about.

12:43.896 --> 12:49.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With regards to the substance of
what was
discussed, you know, it's hard
to tell exactly

12:49.636 --> 12:52.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what these conversations were
about.

12:52.805 --> 13:00.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it is of concern in
terms of judgment
for somebody who is not in a
position of power

13:00.380 --> 13:02.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to raise the sanctions issue.

13:02.849 --> 13:09.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the sanctions issue in
general is
a terrible mistake to even imply
that we would

13:09.288 --> 13:11.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
withdraw from those sanctions.

13:11.958 --> 13:16.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I guess more seriously here
is the issue
of just exactly what was
discussed.

13:17.030 --> 13:21.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those issues are under
investigation,
both by the FBI, as well as the
Congress.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Secretary
Panetta, let
me stay with you, because while
we wait to

13:24.470 --> 13:29.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learn the fate of General Flynn,
what David
Sanger and his colleagues are
reporting on

13:29.642 --> 13:33.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the situation inside the
National Security
Council, the staff.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that typical for the early
days of a new
administration?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
LEON PANETTA: No.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No, it certainly isn't.

13:41.554 --> 13:47.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the other quality that a
national
security adviser must have is
the ability

13:48.094 --> 13:49.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to set up procedures.

13:49.228 --> 13:50.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Look, he's an adviser.

13:50.897 --> 13:51.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's staff.

13:51.964 --> 13:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's not the president of the
United States.

13:54.500 --> 14:00.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His primary responsibility is to
set up the
procedures that would allow the
deputies to

14:00.973 --> 14:06.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meet, the principals to meet and
the National
Security Council in order for
them to move

14:06.179 --> 14:11.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forward recommendations to the
president of
the United States, who makes the
final decision.

14:11.651 --> 14:15.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As far as I know, none of those
processes
have been put in place.

14:15.955 --> 14:18.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're almost a month into this
administration.

14:18.958 --> 14:21.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're dealing with a number of
crises around
the world.

14:21.828 --> 14:25.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think this is a very dangerous
moment not
to have those procedures in
place.

14:26.032 --> 14:30.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, David
Sanger, what more
have you learned about why these
procedures

14:30.436 --> 14:34.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aren't in place, why there is
still so much
uncertainty on the part of
people working

14:34.707 --> 14:36.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the National Security
Council?

14:36.542 --> 14:42.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SANGER: Well, I think part
of it, Judy,
is that what we're seeing happen
here is an

14:42.115 --> 14:47.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration that came in
saying that it
would destroy the status quo,
that it got

14:47.754 --> 14:49.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
elected to do something
different.

14:49.655 --> 14:55.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it has brought in people who
it deliberately
chose for the fact that they
were outside

14:55.895 --> 14:57.730 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington.

14:57.830 --> 15:03.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that meant that they didn't
have around
them the people who understood
how the system

15:04.036 --> 15:05.805 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
worked.

15:05.905 --> 15:10.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you saw General Flynn
come in, I think,
without much of an
understanding, though he

15:10.109 --> 15:15.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had run the Defense Intelligence
Agency, of
how this coordinating role came
together.

15:15.281 --> 15:20.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, people who know
the NSC well
talk about the days when General
Brent Scowcroft

15:20.753 --> 15:28.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ran it for George H.W. Bush,
when others familiar
with how these organizations are
supposed

15:29.028 --> 15:35.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to come together, how you build
a staff, as
Secretary Panetta did at the CIA
and as chief

15:35.735 --> 15:37.436 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of staff.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think most of these folks
have come
in without that experience, and
then they

15:40.373 --> 15:45.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brought in Cabinet members who
largely came
from the business world, bring a
refreshing,

15:45.778 --> 15:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different view to this, but also
have no sense
of how the system is supposed to
run.

15:50.783 --> 15:56.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the basics, running deputies
committees
to make decisions and run those
up to the

15:56.389 --> 15:57.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
principals, aren't happening.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

15:58.825 --> 16:02.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Panetta, what are the
risks in a
situation like this?

16:02.395 --> 16:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEON PANETTA: Well, you're
running terrible
risks.

16:07.633 --> 16:13.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw a little bit of that over
the weekend
with the North Korean missile
launch and what

16:14.006 --> 16:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seemed to be the inability of
the White House
to respond definitively to what
had happened.

16:22.882 --> 16:25.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those kinds of crises are going
to happen.

16:25.418 --> 16:29.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're dealing with a number of
crises, whether
it's ISIS, whether it's Iran,
whether it's

16:29.689 --> 16:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea, whether it's Russia
or China,
cyber-attacks.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a whole array of crises
out there.

16:35.828 --> 16:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you don't have a mechanism in
the White
House that is able to deal with
those crises

16:41.167 --> 16:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a thoughtful and careful way,
in order
to move options to the
president, then you're

16:46.272 --> 16:50.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
going to have a very
hit-and-miss operation,
the kind that we're seeing now.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Sanger, I
know this is
speculation, but if there were
someone to

16:54.046 --> 16:58.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come in to replace Michael Flynn
if he is
removed, how much difference
would that make,

16:58.551 --> 17:00.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
based on your reporting?

17:00.486 --> 17:06.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SANGER: Well, it depends
on who it is,
whether you bring in somebody
else who might

17:06.292 --> 17:10.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have the confidence of the
president, but
not understand the NSC
procedures, or whether

17:10.997 --> 17:15.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you bring in somebody who has
done this before,
but might not fit in well with
that inner

17:15.801 --> 17:18.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
team around the president.

17:18.237 --> 17:23.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, of course, the most
important thing for
an NSC adviser is to have the
trust of the

17:23.209 --> 17:25.077 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

17:25.177 --> 17:30.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So people have named, for
example, Steve Hadley,
who was the national security
adviser under

17:30.917 --> 17:36.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
George W. Bush in his second
term and had
been experienced in things like
this.

17:37.056 --> 17:42.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There are a few other
Republicans around who
have also had that experience.

17:42.828 --> 17:45.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But none of them have
connections to Mr. Trump.

17:45.698 --> 17:50.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Mr. Trump seems to be mostly
impressed
these days with people who have
had either

17:50.870 --> 17:54.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military experience -- most of
the senior
directors he has appointed on
the NSC come

17:55.041 --> 17:59.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the military -- or have
been very successful
in business.

17:59.512 --> 18:03.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And neither of those two
backgrounds, necessarily,
help you with what the NSC does.

18:03.416 --> 18:08.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And very quickly
to Secretary
Panetta, new person comes in,
can that turn

18:08.154 --> 18:09.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
things around quickly?

18:10.089 --> 18:18.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEON PANETTA: If that person has
experience
in terms of how the NSC is
supposed to operate,

18:18.364 --> 18:22.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then I think you can put in
place the procedures
that are required to do.

18:23.002 --> 18:26.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that person is going to have
to have the
trust of the president first and
foremost.

18:26.806 --> 18:31.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, if he has that, or she has
that, it can
work.

18:31.344 --> 18:42.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary Leon
Panetta, David
Sanger, we thank you both.

18:42.221 --> 18:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now: The integrity of a major
dam in California
comes under threat, after days
of historic

18:54.667 --> 18:56.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rainfall in the region.

18:56.402 --> 18:58.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has our report.

18:58.237 --> 19:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At Northern
California's
Lake Oroville, home to the
nation's tallest

19:02.475 --> 19:08.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
dam, water levels finally
receded, which stopped
the overflow of water from the
dam's emergency

19:08.214 --> 19:10.116 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
spillway.

19:10.216 --> 19:13.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This reduced the risk of the
spillway's complete
collapse, which would've
triggered uncontrolled

19:13.519 --> 19:16.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flooding and threatened tens of
thousands
of homes below.

19:16.922 --> 19:20.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a press conference, local
officials couldn't
answer why the system failed.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM CROYLE, California
Department of Water
Resources: We're not sure
anything went wrong.

19:22.928 --> 19:29.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that the system has been
installed
since early 1960s.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.569 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's been looked.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's been monitored.

19:32.271 --> 19:36.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Today, they
faced a much
tamer scene than on Saturday.

19:37.076 --> 19:41.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials had to open the dam's
emergency
spillway for the first time in
50 years because

19:41.580 --> 19:46.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of record high water levels
caused by recent
heavy winter rain and snow.

19:46.485 --> 19:51.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When water was drained from the
dam's main
spillway, the huge volume eroded
chunks of

19:51.557 --> 19:55.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concrete and dug a 30-foot-deep
hole at its
base.

19:56.062 --> 19:59.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was then that officials
opened the emergency
spillway.

19:59.799 --> 20:04.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When that water started eroding
the earthen
embankment, officials feared the
wall would

20:04.270 --> 20:06.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
collapse altogether.

20:06.138 --> 20:10.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, on Sunday, authorities
ordered the
evacuation of nearly 200,000
people living

20:10.843 --> 20:12.511 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
below the lake.

20:12.611 --> 20:15.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With little notice, residents
were stuck in
traffic for hours trying to
leave.

20:15.648 --> 20:19.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY BORSDORF, Evacuee: I
panicked and just
started putting things in my
car, basically

20:20.052 --> 20:26.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my violin, a didgeridoo, some
family photos,
and I didn't grab enough
clothes.

20:27.026 --> 20:27.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I grabbed some wet laundry.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can you believe that?

20:29.862 --> 20:32.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Mercury
News reports
that officials ignored warnings
about the

20:32.932 --> 20:35.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fragility of the emergency
spillway for years.

20:35.968 --> 20:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in 2005, environmental
groups warned
officials that this other
spillway -- quote

20:40.940 --> 20:44.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- "didn't meet modern safety
standards."

20:44.243 --> 20:49.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For now, officials hope to drain
enough water
from the reservoir to make room
for the large

20:49.148 --> 20:52.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
storm that's expected on
Wednesday.

20:52.685 --> 20:56.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on the threat at the
Oroville Dam,
I'm joined now by Jeffrey Mount.

20:56.388 --> 21:01.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's senior fellow with the
Public Policy
Institute of California Water
Policy Center.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His research focuses on water
resources and
flood management.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you very much for being
here.

21:06.532 --> 21:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Jeffrey, I understand that
the main threat
seems to have receded slightly.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think people are still
evacuating as we
speak.

21:15.241 --> 21:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What was it that officials were
worried was
going to happen?

21:17.877 --> 21:20.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY MOUNT, Public Policy
Institute of
California: Well, ultimately,
what the big

21:21.080 --> 21:24.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fear was, that there would be an
uncontrolled
release from the reservoir.

21:24.416 --> 21:29.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The worst nightmare of a
reservoir engineer
is to not be able to control the
water behind

21:29.989 --> 21:31.724 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the reservoir.

21:31.824 --> 21:35.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the emergency spillway, had
it failed
and had it collapsed, would
basically have

21:36.061 --> 21:37.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lowered the lake level by almost
30 feet.

21:38.097 --> 21:42.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is a tremendous amount
of water in
a short period of time, which
would have resulted

21:42.868 --> 21:44.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in catastrophic flooding
downstream.

21:44.770 --> 21:48.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So the basic
issue here,
obviously, as we reported, is
too much rain,

21:48.707 --> 21:51.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
too much snow, which I know is a
good thing
in California normally.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY MOUNT: Yes.

21:53.012 --> 21:55.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But what is it
with regards
to the engineering that went
wrong here?

21:56.048 --> 21:58.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY MOUNT: Well, so, we have
a couple
of things.

21:58.651 --> 22:03.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You have to remember that
California reservoirs
are under tension all the time.

22:03.622 --> 22:05.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We use them to store water.

22:05.224 --> 22:08.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, we're just
coming out of a
record drought.

22:08.294 --> 22:11.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We store water, but we also use
them to regulate
floods.

22:11.130 --> 22:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you have to set aside some
space behind
the reservoir.

22:14.667 --> 22:18.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in this case, there's not
much space set
behind this reservoir to catch
floods.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, it filled.

22:20.239 --> 22:21.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it filled pretty quickly.

22:22.074 --> 22:24.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then we had to run water
down a spillway.

22:24.643 --> 22:28.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we were forced to allow
water to go over
an emergency spill which had
never been tested

22:28.514 --> 22:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
since the Oroville was built in
1968.

22:32.418 --> 22:35.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And things didn't go well when
the water went
over the spillway.

22:35.921 --> 22:40.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we ended up with basically,
what you can
consider the fog of war in a
flood event.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You never quite know what is
going to happen.

22:43.929 --> 22:49.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And water has a way of testing
all the shortcomings
of your design and your actions.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it did so in Oroville.

22:50.903 --> 22:54.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, as we
reported, there
is a hole that was carved out of
the main

22:54.306 --> 22:57.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
spillway and concrete was
basically ripped
part by the volume of water.

22:57.776 --> 22:59.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY MOUNT: Right.

22:59.111 --> 23:00.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: How are they
addressing
that issue now?

23:00.579 --> 23:02.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY MOUNT: Well, they're not
addressing
it now.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.483 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They can't.

23:04.583 --> 23:06.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They can't do anything about it
because they
are running 100,000 cubic feet
per second

23:06.919 --> 23:09.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of water down that spillway now.

23:09.622 --> 23:14.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will be able to address it
this summer,
and they don't know now what
they are going

23:15.094 --> 23:16.095 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do about it.

23:16.195 --> 23:18.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they have lost almost half
of that spillway.

23:18.530 --> 23:22.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just the power of water tore it
to pieces
and moved it on down into the
river downstream.

23:22.701 --> 23:27.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is really nothing they can
do today
about that spillway.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have to use it.

23:29.008 --> 23:32.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We mentioned
that there
had been some concerns raised
about the earthen

23:32.911 --> 23:37.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
berm that is underneath the
auxiliary spillway.

23:37.383 --> 23:39.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why is it that that wasn't
shored up?

23:39.184 --> 23:41.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did people just not see that
this was going
to possibly be an issue?

23:41.987 --> 23:45.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY MOUNT: No, I'm sure
people thought
it was an issue at the time.

23:45.958 --> 23:50.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you are always faced with,
how much money
are you going to spend to
address something

23:50.829 --> 23:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you think is going to be a
very, very
rare event?

23:54.433 --> 23:59.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's actually what happens
in reservoir
design, dam design anywhere.

23:59.505 --> 24:04.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can spend an infinite amount
of money
to mitigate the most improbable
things, but

24:04.743 --> 24:06.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there still is a probability.

24:06.845 --> 24:12.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the big thing, big
takeaway here when
you look at this is that the
engineers probably

24:12.785 --> 24:18.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dismissed the idea of coating
that hillside
in concrete, because it would be
very, very

24:18.857 --> 24:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expensive to mitigate something
that was highly
unlikely to happen.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it never happened before in
the dam's
history.

24:24.396 --> 24:26.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Well, now it happened.

24:26.265 --> 24:31.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, frankly, all our climate
projections
for the future are suggesting
these kind of

24:31.236 --> 24:34.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
events might be more frequent
and even more
intense.

24:34.940 --> 24:41.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for us here in California,
this is a bit
of a time to reflect on what we
are asking

24:41.413 --> 24:45.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our reservoirs to do and how we
manage them
and how we're going to prepare
for the future.

24:45.617 --> 24:49.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Jeffrey Mount
of the Public Policy Institute
of California,

24:49.655 --> 24:51.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thank you so much.

24:51.523 --> 24:57.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY MOUNT: Thank you.

24:57.730 --> 25:08.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: a rare look
at life under
the rule of the Nigerian
militant group Boko

25:08.107 --> 25:11.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Haram, as filmed by the group
itself.

25:11.343 --> 25:16.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Audie Cornish of NPR's "All
Things Considered"
recorded this conversation for
us last week.

25:16.382 --> 25:20.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Last year, Voice
of America
News Service, which is funded by
the U.S.

25:20.386 --> 25:25.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government, received a stunning
trove of videos
from Nigeria, 18 hours of
footage recorded

25:25.324 --> 25:28.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by Boko Haram's own cameras in
2014.

25:28.494 --> 25:30.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The pictures comes from
Northeastern Nigeria.

25:30.596 --> 25:34.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, at the time, Boko Haram had
total control
of the region.

25:34.967 --> 25:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The videos take us behind Boko
Haram's assault
on the Nigerian military and
into villages

25:40.139 --> 25:42.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where their leaders administer
rough justice.

25:42.941 --> 25:47.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VOA has produced a series of
four reports
based on the videos.

25:47.212 --> 25:52.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And joining me to talk about
what we can learn
from these images is VOA's
Ibrahim Ahmed.

25:52.184 --> 25:55.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He hosts a weekly program for
their service
broadcast in Nigeria.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you for joining us.

25:57.156 --> 25:58.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IBRAHIM AHMED, Voice of America:
It's my pleasure.

25:59.057 --> 26:02.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Now, tell us a
little bit about
how you were able to verify
these videos.

26:02.995 --> 26:10.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM AHMED: When the Voice of
America got
these videos, first of all, we
sat down and

26:10.602 --> 26:13.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
went through almost all of them.

26:13.238 --> 26:19.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we were able to determine
that they came
from not Northeastern Nigeria
because the

26:19.144 --> 26:24.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people in the videos speak in
Kanuri, which
is the predominant language
there, and which

26:24.783 --> 26:31.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is also the language of most of
the Boko Haram
leadership and the members.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was the first thing.

26:33.225 --> 26:39.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then there are references to
Boko Haram and
to events that only Boko Haram
will know,

26:39.898 --> 26:43.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like the attacks carried in some
areas of
Northeastern Nigeria.

26:43.869 --> 26:49.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Your reporting
shows a couple
of things, one, the faces of
some leaders

26:49.441 --> 26:53.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and participates in Boko Haram,
which I understand
is very uncommon.

26:53.745 --> 27:02.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also shows how they are able
to basically
bring whole villages into their
ideology using

27:02.888 --> 27:04.289 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
violence.

27:04.389 --> 27:08.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in one clip, there is a
tribunal where
they exert their justice.

27:08.694 --> 27:10.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do these tribunals work?

27:10.562 --> 27:16.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM AHMED: Well, in order to
control the
people, when Boko Haram captures
a place and

27:17.035 --> 27:21.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they want to bring people in
line, they will
hold these kind of tribunals.

27:21.607 --> 27:27.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they will force everybody
from the village
or the town to attend the
tribunals.

27:27.346 --> 27:33.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will bring people they're
accusing, whether
they are drug users or drug
sellers, according

27:33.118 --> 27:34.920 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to them.

27:35.020 --> 27:40.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will bring them to these
tribunals, and
they will read out a statement
that you are

27:40.392 --> 27:42.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guilty of this or guilty of
that.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you accept your guilt?

27:43.729 --> 27:45.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, if you accept it, fine.

27:45.597 --> 27:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You just go and lay down and get
killed.

27:47.733 --> 27:52.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: They do something
similar with
young boys and men who they
conscript into

27:52.137 --> 27:53.839 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fighting.

27:53.939 --> 27:58.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You have a video that is
unusual, in that
it shows a Boko Haram leader
basically getting

27:58.677 --> 28:01.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
everyone to gear up to fight.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.148 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let's watch that.

28:03.248 --> 28:09.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Awaz (ph) says the
best of the martyrs
are those that fight in the
front.

28:09.988 --> 28:12.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are the ones who do not
turn back until
they are killed.

28:12.791 --> 28:21.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM AHMED: When Boko Haram
started in
2009, initially, their
membership were made

28:21.199 --> 28:25.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up of the original followers of
the (INAUDIBLE)
Boko Haram.

28:25.871 --> 28:31.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when they started capturing
territory,
they started conscripting
people.

28:31.243 --> 28:36.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: There is video of
a failed
attack, essentially, on an army
barracks.

28:36.582 --> 28:38.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you see fighters looking for
weapons.

28:38.984 --> 28:42.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You see fighters not necessarily
able to use
the weapons they have.

28:42.688 --> 28:45.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What are the fighting
capabilities of Boko
Haram at this point?

28:45.824 --> 28:52.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM AHMED: Initially, Boko
Haram was kind
of going into fights with the
military with

28:52.497 --> 28:56.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much more powerful weapons then
what the military
had.

28:56.401 --> 29:04.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The military had AK-47 rifles,
while the militants
come with heavy machine guns,
anti-aircraft

29:04.910 --> 29:05.811 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
guns.

29:05.911 --> 29:08.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the military had to run away
at the time.

29:08.480 --> 29:17.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, in 2015, the present
government in Nigeria,
when they started taking the
fight to Boko

29:17.122 --> 29:22.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Haram, they were able to adapt
themselves
and to get those kind of weapons
that Boko

29:22.961 --> 29:24.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Haram was using on them.

29:24.863 --> 29:29.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is when they started
winning the
war and kicking Boko Haram out
of these major

29:29.601 --> 29:31.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cities and towns.

29:31.169 --> 29:33.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Do you feel as
though these
are areas that can rebuild?

29:33.639 --> 29:40.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM AHMED: It is possible,
but it's going
to be really difficult, because
the crisis

29:40.679 --> 29:46.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or the carnage that Boko Haram
has done in
the area is just unbelievable.

29:46.485 --> 29:50.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Ibrahim Ahmed of
Voice of America,
thank you so much for speaking
with us.

29:50.956 --> 29:54.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IBRAHIM AHMED: Thank you so
much.

29:54.326 --> 29:59.364 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
My pleasure.

29:59.464 --> 30:09.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we near the
gruesome sixth
anniversary of the war in Syria,
daily documents

30:09.541 --> 30:12.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the carnage there now flood
the Internet.

30:12.344 --> 30:17.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Photos and videos posted by both
civilians
and combatants catalogue the
shocking depths

30:17.949 --> 30:21.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of human cruelty and possible
war crimes.

30:21.653 --> 30:27.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now human rights investigators
are increasingly
turning to the Internet to track
what's happening,

30:27.159 --> 30:29.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not only in Syria, but in other
conflict zones.

30:30.095 --> 30:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As part of our Breakthroughs
coverage of invention
and innovation, special
correspondent Cat

30:35.500 --> 30:41.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wise reports on a new university
program training
students to become human rights
investigators

30:42.074 --> 30:43.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the digital age.

30:43.375 --> 30:47.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And a warning: This story
contains some disturbing
images.

30:47.145 --> 30:53.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: For decades, human
rights investigators
have relied on tools like
shovels and backhoes

30:53.385 --> 30:59.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to uncover mass graves and mass
atrocities
in places like Bosnia, Iraq, and
Rwanda.

30:59.458 --> 31:05.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in today's smartphone-filled
world, videos
and images of people killed or
suffering thousands

31:05.564 --> 31:11.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of miles away take only a couple
of clicks
to find on YouTube, Facebook,
Twitter.

31:11.770 --> 31:16.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The front lines of human rights
work have
shifted in the digital age, and
a new generation

31:16.441 --> 31:19.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of investigators is beginning to
employ high-tech
tools.

31:19.945 --> 31:22.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUDENT: We can probably
screen-shot that.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.014 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Yes.

31:23.115 --> 31:24.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT: And reverse-image it.

31:24.116 --> 31:25.350 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Yes.

31:25.450 --> 31:26.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: And we should look up
the name of
that pharmacy.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: Can anyone translate
that?

31:28.386 --> 31:32.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: These students are
part of the recently
launched Human Rights
Investigations Lab at

31:32.824 --> 31:37.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the University of California,
Berkeley's Human
Rights Center.

31:38.063 --> 31:42.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The university and partner
organization Amnesty
International are training the
students to

31:42.434 --> 31:47.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
verify videos and other publicly
available
social media content coming out
of areas like

31:47.873 --> 31:51.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Syria, where human rights
violations have
been occurring.

31:51.143 --> 31:56.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the first time, students are
using open
source investigation methods
used previously

31:56.615 --> 31:58.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by journalists and human rights
professionals.

31:58.784 --> 32:00.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOUSTINA YOUSSEF, Student: Oh,
those are uniforms.

32:00.652 --> 32:05.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Youstina Youssef is a
20-year-old
political science major in the
program.

32:05.524 --> 32:08.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's become a highly skilled
digital detective.

32:08.226 --> 32:12.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And her native language, Arabic,
also comes
in handy.

32:12.297 --> 32:13.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Youssef grew up in Cairo, Egypt.

32:14.032 --> 32:17.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She and her family are Coptic
Christians,
a religious minority in Egypt.

32:17.669 --> 32:21.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They came to the U.S. in 2010
shortly before
the revolution began.

32:21.706 --> 32:24.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YOUSTINA YOUSSEF: I didn't have
a minute of
hesitation about this.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I jumped right on it.

32:26.945 --> 32:31.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it has a lot to do with
my background
of coming from Egypt, being a
regular person,

32:31.283 --> 32:37.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then being affected by the
political scene
in the country, and having your
life upended.

32:37.622 --> 32:42.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This project gives me an outlet,
gives me
a way to feel like I am
contributing in some

32:42.594 --> 32:44.362 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

32:44.462 --> 32:45.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEXA KOENIG, Executive
Director, Berkeley
Human Rights Center: Welcome to
the spring

32:45.697 --> 32:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2017 launch of the Human Rights
Investigations
Lab.

32:48.567 --> 32:53.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The 60-plus student
volunteers are
a diverse group from different
majors and

32:53.271 --> 32:54.172 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the law school.

32:54.272 --> 32:56.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They speak more than 20
languages.

32:56.274 --> 33:00.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alexa Koenig is the executive
director of
Berkeley's Human Rights Center.

33:00.512 --> 33:04.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says the lab was a natural
progression
for the organization, which has
been advancing

33:04.649 --> 33:07.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
human rights work, around the
world, for more
than 20 years.

33:07.719 --> 33:11.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXA KOENIG: We have noticed
over and over
that there are a number of
front-line human

33:11.923 --> 33:16.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rights advocates that are really
trying to
figure out, how do you ensure
that the videos

33:16.561 --> 33:20.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're getting from survivors
on the ground
are what they purport to be?

33:20.565 --> 33:24.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one of the things we were
thinking is,
couldn't we leverage our
position here to

33:24.269 --> 33:30.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
provide the labor that so many
of these organizations
really can't afford, but also
provide a pipeline

33:30.342 --> 33:35.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of students who are skilled in
an area that's
increasingly in demand,
front-line human rights

33:35.947 --> 33:37.382 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
workers?

33:37.482 --> 33:41.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: And it appears the
human rights
movement is eager for help.

33:41.820 --> 33:45.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Since the lab began in
September, students
have been asked by Amnesty and
other groups

33:46.024 --> 33:51.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to look at material coming out
of Yemen, Sudan,
Democratic Republic of Congo,
and Myanmar.

33:51.730 --> 33:55.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the bulk of their work has
been focused
on Syria, specifically Aleppo.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HALEY WILLIS, Student: This is
very deep in
Aleppo.

33:57.669 --> 34:01.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Haley Willis is a
sophomore in the
program from Texas.

34:01.606 --> 34:05.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She showed me one of the key
methods she and
the other students use to verify
videos.

34:05.644 --> 34:10.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HALEY WILLIS: Geolocation is
essentially,
did this take place where it
says it took

34:10.482 --> 34:12.317 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place?

34:12.417 --> 34:16.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're really used to being able
to say, here's
this store, and you type it into
Google, you

34:16.187 --> 34:17.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get an address, and you're done.

34:18.056 --> 34:22.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Syria, there's not easily
accessible addresses.

34:22.560 --> 34:26.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no Google Street View.

34:26.831 --> 34:33.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this particular video, the
thing that stood
out to me the most is a white
dome sticking

34:33.672 --> 34:35.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out from behind this building
right here.

34:35.173 --> 34:36.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: Oh, I see that.

34:37.008 --> 34:39.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HALEY WILLIS: That is a good
place to start
for geolocating, because a dome
is round.

34:39.811 --> 34:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a very distinct shape
that you will
be able to see from above.

34:44.049 --> 34:49.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Wills then began
looking for a needle
in a haystack: a tiny dome in
pre-war satellite

34:49.454 --> 34:51.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
images of Aleppo.

34:51.456 --> 34:56.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HALEY WILLIS: I combed through
this neighborhood,
and I basically looked for every
white circular

34:57.062 --> 34:58.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
object that I saw.

34:58.797 --> 35:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I ended up narrowing it down to
about two.

35:01.266 --> 35:05.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't always be 100 percent
sure, and
you should never say you're 100
percent sure

35:05.804 --> 35:07.605 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unless you are.

35:07.706 --> 35:11.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: After getting as far
as they can,
the students turn over their
research to the

35:11.109 --> 35:14.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
partner organizations for final
analysis.

35:14.612 --> 35:19.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Screening hours and hours of
disturbing images
can obviously take a toll.

35:19.517 --> 35:22.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's an issue that's taken very
seriously
within the program.

35:22.287 --> 35:25.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SAM DUBBERLEY, Amnesty
International: The
most important thing you can do
to look after

35:25.156 --> 35:30.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yourself personally is just have
awareness,
understanding how you normally
respond to

35:30.962 --> 35:36.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
things and how are you
responding after spending
a couple of hours looking at and
verifying

35:36.634 --> 35:37.869 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
videos.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Sam Dubberley works
for Amnesty
International.

35:40.572 --> 35:43.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The lab partnership with
Berkeley was actually
his idea.

35:43.641 --> 35:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's now running three similar
programs at
universities in South Africa,
the United Kingdom,

35:47.846 --> 35:52.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Canada, and each group is
required to
go through regular resiliency
training.

35:52.784 --> 35:57.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM DUBBERLEY: Just watching a
video without
sound is actually less
distressing than watching

35:57.455 --> 35:58.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it with sound.

35:59.024 --> 36:03.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And very often, the audio is not
necessarily
important for verification.

36:03.595 --> 36:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very important to us to
make sure the
students are trained and given a
safe environment,

36:09.401 --> 36:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that they do not suffer any
adverse effects
of trauma.

36:12.804 --> 36:17.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reality is, the world of
human rights
investigation requires you to
look at this

36:17.809 --> 36:19.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
content today.

36:19.644 --> 36:22.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if in two years' time, three
years' time,
you want to move into that
field, I think

36:22.947 --> 36:27.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's very good for them that
they actually
understand the skills and the
resiliency required

36:28.086 --> 36:29.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do this job.

36:30.021 --> 36:33.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Under that guided
leadership, the
students have been cranking
away, more than

36:33.291 --> 36:36.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
1,500 hours of verification work
thus far.

36:36.694 --> 36:40.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of that work has even
made it all
the way to the United Nations,
according to

36:40.799 --> 36:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Syrian activist Hadi Al Khatib.

36:42.600 --> 36:47.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HADI AL KHATIB, Syrian Activist:
The students
found a specific type of cluster
munitions

36:47.639 --> 36:50.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that has been used in Aleppo
City and its
countryside.

36:50.942 --> 36:58.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this has been all included
in a verified
data set that we have sent to
the U.N.

36:58.650 --> 37:03.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Al Khatib runs an
organization called
the Syrian Archive.

37:03.254 --> 37:07.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He and his colleagues are
creating a large
database of verified videos
documenting human

37:07.659 --> 37:12.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rights violations on all sides
since the start
of the Syrian civil war.

37:12.664 --> 37:16.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke to him on Skype about
why he asked
Berkeley for help.

37:16.401 --> 37:21.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HADI AL KHATIB: With the
archive, we have
about more than 3,800 videos
that have been

37:21.473 --> 37:23.141 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
verified.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We still have a backlog of more
than 30,000
of videos that we need to go
through.

37:27.011 --> 37:31.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So this is why we need the help
of Berkeley
university students.

37:31.616 --> 37:36.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: But the big question,
of course,
on the minds of both the
students and others

37:36.521 --> 37:40.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing this type of work: Will
any of it actually
be presented in an international
court of

37:40.992 --> 37:42.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
law one day?

37:42.293 --> 37:44.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Could a YouTube video lead to
the downfall
of a leader?

37:44.829 --> 37:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN TAUB, "The New Yorker": If
there is no
geopolitical will to actually
help people,

37:48.833 --> 37:53.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then you can have all the videos
in the world,
and it won't actually garner
support to save

37:53.605 --> 37:55.507 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people's lives.

37:55.607 --> 37:58.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: Ben Taub is a
contributing writer
at "The New Yorker" who has
written extensively

37:58.676 --> 38:01.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about human rights violations in
Syria.

38:01.346 --> 38:05.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We caught up with him recently
on the Columbia
University campus, where he
talked about the

38:05.283 --> 38:08.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pluses and minuses of open
source evidence.

38:08.253 --> 38:10.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEN TAUB: It's extremely useful
for advocacy.

38:10.822 --> 38:16.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also extremely useful for
putting the
crimes before the international
community

38:16.761 --> 38:24.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to try to garner the kind of
political pressure
that could result in a trial
taking place

38:24.169 --> 38:26.004 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to begin with.

38:26.104 --> 38:32.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it doesn't necessarily link
the actor
that you're trying to prosecute
to the crime.

38:33.011 --> 38:38.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Footage of, for instance, a
hospital being
blown up doesn't show that that
was ordered

38:38.550 --> 38:43.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Assad or by his highest-level
security
committee.

38:43.254 --> 38:48.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The kind of evidence that really
would get
them would be a document, an
order, something

38:48.426 --> 38:50.261 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that's signed.

38:50.361 --> 38:53.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: That's an issue that
is very much
on the mind of the Human Rights
Center's Alexa

38:53.331 --> 38:55.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Koenig.

38:55.266 --> 38:57.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXA KOENIG: One of the biggest
hurdles about
using these new methods is that
they are so

38:57.769 --> 38:59.571 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
new.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, judges often don't know how
to evaluate,
and give any kind of weight to
information

39:02.874 --> 39:06.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're pulling off Facebook, or
Twitter, or
these other platforms.

39:06.244 --> 39:10.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things we're hoping
to do for kind
of investing in the long-term
use of these

39:10.915 --> 39:16.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
methods is just begin to build
an international
standard for how to evaluate
what constitutes

39:16.154 --> 39:18.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an effective and a good
investigation.

39:18.690 --> 39:23.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: In the months ahead,
the students
will continue their work on
Syria and start

39:23.161 --> 39:26.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new projects in Africa and
Central America.

39:26.331 --> 39:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Cat
Wise in Berkeley,
California.

39:35.373 --> 39:45.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just over three
weeks into
the Trump administration, and,
as you heard

39:45.650 --> 39:49.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
earlier, reports aren't going
away of disarray
inside the White House.

39:50.021 --> 39:55.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For more, we turn to our
Politics Monday team,
Tamara Keith of NPR and Amy
Walter of The

39:55.260 --> 39:56.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Cook Political Report.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you both for being here.

39:59.030 --> 40:03.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Tam and Amy, we did talk
earlier about
what is happening to General
Flynn, the president

40:03.901 --> 40:05.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
himself weighing in.

40:05.136 --> 40:06.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Tam, you were at the White
House this
afternoon.

40:06.971 --> 40:07.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is the latest on that?

40:07.972 --> 40:09.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Yes.

40:09.907 --> 40:13.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I was at the White House
waiting to hopefully
talk to Sean Spicer, the press
secretary,

40:13.177 --> 40:18.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when the president walked by an
area where
there were about a dozen, maybe
10 reporters

40:18.316 --> 40:19.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
waiting to see Spicer.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The president shows up.

40:22.620 --> 40:26.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And reporters asked the
president, do you
have confidence in General
Flynn?

40:26.291 --> 40:27.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is General Flynn's status?

40:27.692 --> 40:30.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he said, "Oh, there's a
statement coming."

40:30.528 --> 40:34.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then someone else shouted, how
about Reince
Priebus, the chief of staff?

40:34.265 --> 40:36.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you have confidence in Reince
Priebus?

40:36.868 --> 40:39.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he says: "Reince is doing
great.

40:39.470 --> 40:41.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Reince is doing great."

40:41.272 --> 40:45.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is a real contrast
there between
saying, oh, there is a statement
coming, a

40:45.143 --> 40:50.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
statement that says that the
president is
evaluating the situation, and
saying that

40:50.214 --> 40:51.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the chief of staff is doing
great.

40:52.016 --> 40:55.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A contrast
between what he
says about General Flynn and
what he says

40:55.320 --> 40:56.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about Reince Priebus.

40:56.321 --> 40:58.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

40:58.356 --> 41:00.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But also, Amy, a
contrast about
what they are saying just an
hour after Kellyanne

41:00.258 --> 41:04.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Conway, the president's
counselor, said that
the president had full
confidence in General

41:05.029 --> 41:06.431 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Flynn.

41:06.531 --> 41:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Although,
Judy, you know this.

41:08.533 --> 41:12.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is a classic line that
folks in Washington
use, like they use the, he's
taking time off

41:12.570 --> 41:14.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to spend time with his family.

41:14.772 --> 41:17.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they use -- they throw that
line out there.

41:17.508 --> 41:19.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's really not very definitive.

41:19.377 --> 41:24.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, look, the issue with Flynn
is as much
about the frustration within the
White House

41:24.849 --> 41:29.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the fact that he made at
least two very
high-ranking members of that
administration,

41:29.954 --> 41:34.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the vice president and the chief
of staff,
look like they lied.

41:34.192 --> 41:40.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They gave information out on
television that
wasn't truthful.

41:40.198 --> 41:41.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it came directly from
Michael Flynn.

41:42.066 --> 41:47.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That seems like the bigger
question here than
whether or not we can talk about
a specific

41:47.205 --> 41:52.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law being broken about the fact
that he talked
to the Russians before he was
officially in

41:52.110 --> 41:53.911 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his position.

41:54.011 --> 41:56.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will see
what happens
about General Flynn and whether
he stays in

41:56.681 --> 41:58.449 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
his job.

41:58.549 --> 42:00.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, meantime, Tamara, just
quickly, there
has been speculation about
Reince Priebus.

42:01.052 --> 42:05.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been stories out
there in the last
few days about whether he is on
thin ice,

42:05.523 --> 42:07.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether Sean Spicer, the press
secretary,
is on thin ice.

42:07.725 --> 42:09.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

42:09.527 --> 42:13.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean, how
stable are some
of these top advisers to the
president?

42:13.164 --> 42:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It's not clear.

42:15.066 --> 42:19.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there has been a lot of
self-interested
leaking coming out of that White
House and

42:19.103 --> 42:24.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a lot of administration
officials saying things
about other administration
officials, and,

42:24.275 --> 42:27.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you know, friends of the
president saying
things.

42:27.145 --> 42:28.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's all very hazy.

42:28.746 --> 42:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is some thought that
President Trump
likes to keep people on edge.

42:32.884 --> 42:41.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is a lot of noise and
commotion and
distraction from what are some
pretty major

42:41.292 --> 42:44.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issues that the president ran on
and could
be pursuing.

42:44.495 --> 42:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, you know, like, for
instance, they don't
fully have an answer yet on what
they're going

42:49.434 --> 42:51.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to do about his immigration ban.

42:51.736 --> 42:54.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They haven't sent any
legislation over to
Congress.

42:54.705 --> 42:59.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And that's the real
issue here,
is whether or not this is just
about internal

42:59.477 --> 43:04.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fighting and that they are not
particularly
stable is one thing, just stable
internally

43:04.449 --> 43:06.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in terms of the functioning.

43:06.751 --> 43:10.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether this impedes their
ability to actually
get stuff done is the real
question.

43:10.521 --> 43:11.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, does it matter?

43:11.522 --> 43:13.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It matters if it matters, right?

43:13.357 --> 43:19.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the lack of clear lines of
delineation,
if the infighting is preventing
them from

43:19.464 --> 43:23.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually putting legislation on
the Hill,
getting an Obamacare
replacement, passing

43:23.801 --> 43:25.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tax law, then it is a very big
deal.

43:25.636 --> 43:29.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it is just -- and, again,
remember, this
is a president who ran -- as a
candidate,

43:29.640 --> 43:32.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his campaign looked exactly like
this.

43:32.143 --> 43:39.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the chaos is something that
he is either
likes or thinks is important,
but it didn't

43:39.150 --> 43:42.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deter him and it didn't stop him
from winning
in the first place.

43:42.420 --> 43:45.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Someone who has
been speaking
very emphatically for the White
House -- and

43:45.389 --> 43:49.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to ask both of you about
this -- is
the president's -- one of his
senior policy

43:49.293 --> 43:51.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
advisers, Stephen Miller.

43:51.162 --> 43:56.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tam, he went on four of the
Sunday talk show,
interview shows yesterday, went
after the

43:56.934 --> 43:59.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
judiciary, the courts, backed up
the president.

43:59.136 --> 44:00.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was attacked on the courts.

44:01.072 --> 44:06.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At one point, he said the powers
of the president
are substantial and will not be
questioned.

44:06.310 --> 44:10.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when he was asked
specifically about -- to
defend the president's criticism
of the courts,

44:11.082 --> 44:12.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here's what Stephen Miller said.

44:12.583 --> 44:14.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this was on ABC "This Week."

44:14.485 --> 44:16.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN MILLER, Senior Trump
Policy Adviser:
We have equal branches of
government in this

44:16.554 --> 44:17.455 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

44:17.555 --> 44:19.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The judiciary is not supreme.

44:19.457 --> 44:24.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A district judge in Seattle
cannot force the
president of the United States
to change our

44:24.662 --> 44:27.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
laws and our Constitution
because of their
own personal views.

44:27.732 --> 44:33.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, we have
here someone
saying that the president
doesn't have to

44:33.738 --> 44:34.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
obey the courts?

44:34.739 --> 44:36.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that what it sounds like?

44:36.674 --> 44:40.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, there is
certainly something,
in the way he said it, that
makes it come

44:40.444 --> 44:42.213 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
across like that.

44:42.313 --> 44:45.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is also an argument
that the White
House is making that they do
have grounds

44:45.683 --> 44:50.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make, which is, the president
does have
a lot of authority, if you look
at the statute

44:50.254 --> 44:57.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
regarding immigration, on
national security
issues, that it is there, and
that the courts,

44:57.695 --> 45:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while they can make judgments,
as they did
in this Ninth Circuit, on other
issues, the

45:02.166 --> 45:04.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president does have a lot of
latitude.

45:04.235 --> 45:06.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is where this fight
should be.

45:06.504 --> 45:09.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the bottom line is, it goes
back to the
dysfunction within the office.

45:09.674 --> 45:13.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Had this executive order been
written more
cleanly, had the rollout gone
better, had

45:13.911 --> 45:18.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they made changes to it, we
might not be where
we are now, having a fight over
what the role

45:18.950 --> 45:21.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the court is in this, because
it wouldn't
have gotten there.

45:21.652 --> 45:26.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Tam, these
statements
yesterday -- I watched all of
those interviews

45:26.190 --> 45:28.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that Stephen Miller did.

45:28.292 --> 45:32.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He seems to be clearly
expressing the frustration
from the president.

45:32.196 --> 45:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, and the
president tweeted
that Stephen Miller did a great
job.

45:36.133 --> 45:38.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He went out there and channeled
the president.

45:38.936 --> 45:44.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He went out there and said
exactly what the
White House wanted to be said.

45:44.675 --> 45:48.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, that wins you
support from
the president of the United
States.

45:48.646 --> 45:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, the
other thing
he said, and I want to -- if we
have time,

45:51.749 --> 45:53.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I want to play this clip.

45:53.250 --> 45:55.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was asked -- I want to see if
I can find
it now.

45:55.953 --> 45:58.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was asked about -- now I
won't be able
to find it it.

45:58.923 --> 45:59.824 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, we can't...

45:59.924 --> 46:00.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Oh, was it
about...

46:00.925 --> 46:01.826 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

46:01.926 --> 46:02.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sorry.

46:02.927 --> 46:04.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's about the president's
legacy.

46:04.962 --> 46:11.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was asked a question about
Ivanka Trump,
the president defending her work
and criticizing

46:11.168 --> 46:12.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nordstrom, the department store.

46:12.670 --> 46:16.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
George Stephanopoulos, the ABC
anchor, asked
him about that.

46:16.540 --> 46:19.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And here is how Stephen Miller
turned the
corner.

46:19.210 --> 46:22.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN MILLER: I really hope,
George, we
can move on to discussing things
that the

46:22.346 --> 46:26.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American people care about, like
their jobs,
like their wages, like their
security, like

46:26.517 --> 46:30.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the fact that we have a
president who has
done more in three weeks than
most presidents

46:30.321 --> 46:32.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have done in an entire
administration.

46:32.189 --> 46:36.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, more
than -- in three
weeks more than other presidents
in an entire

46:36.727 --> 46:37.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

46:37.728 --> 46:40.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Not the most recent
president.

46:40.531 --> 46:45.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama at this point,
literally on
this day, the Senate passed his
stimulus bill.

46:45.403 --> 46:47.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was soon going to be
signed into
law.

46:47.405 --> 46:51.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we haven't seen anything
even get up to
the Hill, nonetheless a major
piece of legislation

46:51.575 --> 46:53.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
getting passed.

46:53.644 --> 46:55.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But to say the
president has
done more in three weeks than an
entire administration,

46:55.246 --> 46:56.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that is quite a statement.

46:56.280 --> 46:58.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: That is quite a
statement.

46:58.182 --> 47:02.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, also, President Obama, by
this point,
had signed more executive orders
than President

47:02.253 --> 47:03.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump has signed.

47:03.421 --> 47:05.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are a number of metrics to
measure this.

47:05.990 --> 47:07.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Superlatives are always
perilous.

47:07.792 --> 47:12.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what is for
sure is,
there is nothing quiet about
this White House.

47:12.363 --> 47:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All right, Tamara Keith, Amy
Walter, thank
you both.

47:16.600 --> 47:21.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

47:21.272 --> 47:25.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

47:25.910 --> 47:33.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: An iconic
American fashion
designer tells his story.

47:33.350 --> 47:38.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tommy Hilfiger talked with our
Jeffrey Brown
at the Miami Book Fair about his
new book,

47:38.589 --> 47:41.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"American Dreamer: My Life in
the Fashion
Business."

47:41.325 --> 47:43.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the latest edition to the
"NewsHour"
Bookshelf.

47:43.527 --> 47:45.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why write a
memoir?

47:45.396 --> 47:48.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why did you stop life and write
this thing?

47:48.432 --> 47:49.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TOMMY HILFIGER, Author,
"American Dreamer:
My Life in the Fashion
Business": Look, I

47:49.934 --> 47:54.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had been asked to write it over
the years
by a few different people.

47:54.538 --> 47:58.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I kept saying, no, no, no, I
think I will
wait until I'm much older.

47:58.142 --> 48:05.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then it dawned on me that I
might forget
a lot in my later years.

48:05.116 --> 48:06.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

48:06.117 --> 48:07.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOMMY HILFIGER: My mind is very
fresh now.

48:07.918 --> 48:11.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have got a lot of energy, so I
thought,
you know what, for my children's
sake, I would

48:11.889 --> 48:16.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like to take the reader through
my journey
chronologically.

48:16.794 --> 48:20.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You talk about
coming of age
in the '60s.

48:20.698 --> 48:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did you know what you wanted to
do early,
at the beginning?

48:22.833 --> 48:24.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOMMY HILFIGER: I didn't know
what I wanted
to do.

48:24.935 --> 48:27.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what I really didn't know
was that I was
dyslexic.

48:27.805 --> 48:29.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

48:29.240 --> 48:33.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOMMY HILFIGER: And my grades
were very, very
poor in school.

48:33.377 --> 48:37.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I really thought I was one
of the dumb
ones.

48:37.748 --> 48:43.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think my teachers also
agreed with that,
and certainly my father, who
held the bar

48:43.254 --> 48:46.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very high for me, agreed with
that.

48:46.290 --> 48:52.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, when this whole music
revolution
came about, I was obsessed with
the Beatles,

48:52.129 --> 48:58.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Rolling Stones, Hendrix, all
of the rock
groups and rock stars.

48:58.435 --> 49:00.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I thought, well, I want to
be a rock star.

49:00.905 --> 49:03.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I really couldn't play and I
couldn't
sing.

49:03.140 --> 49:04.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I looked like...

49:04.275 --> 49:05.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So far, you were
millions...

49:05.209 --> 49:06.110 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:06.210 --> 49:07.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The rest of us,
right?

49:07.211 --> 49:08.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We all wanted to be rock stars,
yes.

49:08.212 --> 49:09.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOMMY HILFIGER: But I looked the
part.

49:09.213 --> 49:11.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I had long hair, bell bottoms.

49:11.715 --> 49:15.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of my friends wanted
to know where
I got my clothes.

49:15.886 --> 49:23.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a couple of other buddies
and I put together
our $150 we had saved from
working part-time

49:23.861 --> 49:28.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jobs, bought 20 pairs of jeans
and opened
a shop, at 18 years old.

49:28.699 --> 49:30.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?

49:30.134 --> 49:33.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At that moment, was there a plan
or a future
that you envisioned?

49:33.871 --> 49:36.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or was this just sort of making
it up as you
go along?

49:36.340 --> 49:38.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOMMY HILFIGER: Making it up as
we went along.

49:38.475 --> 49:42.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought, if I could build my
own brand,
I could do whatever I want to do
with it.

49:42.913 --> 49:44.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I could design it myself.

49:44.348 --> 49:46.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I could market it the way I want
to market
it.

49:46.550 --> 49:49.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was born in Elmira, New York,
a very small
town in Upstate New York.

49:50.020 --> 49:55.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I thought, if I move to New
York City,
I could really begin to plant
seeds to build

49:55.392 --> 49:56.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my own brand.

49:56.927 --> 50:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wanted to build a brand that
that was creative
and exciting and unique.

50:02.066 --> 50:03.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I wanted to make it into a
real business.

50:04.068 --> 50:05.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

50:05.703 --> 50:10.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOMMY HILFIGER: And I wanted to
distinguish
my look from everyone else's.

50:10.207 --> 50:14.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I decided that I should create
new American
classics.

50:14.778 --> 50:22.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I looked at all of the
preppy clothes
I had worn as a very young boy.

50:22.686 --> 50:24.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I thought they were very
boring and very
tired.

50:24.655 --> 50:27.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I said, OK, Well, how do I
redesign these?

50:27.391 --> 50:29.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Can you sum up
what you didn't
like most of all?

50:30.027 --> 50:31.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOMMY HILFIGER: I didn't like
the fit.

50:31.896 --> 50:33.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I didn't like the feel of the
fabric.

50:34.031 --> 50:38.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't like that it was too
mediocre, so
to speak.

50:38.435 --> 50:44.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I thought, I'm going to make
everything,
like, relaxed, colorful,
detailed.

50:44.575 --> 50:47.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I wanted to build it for a
broad audience.

50:47.211 --> 50:51.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I wanted it to be as
aspirational, affordable,
accessible.

50:51.815 --> 50:57.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The book takes us
through a
lot of success, but, of course,
a lot of problems

50:57.988 --> 50:58.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
along the way as well.

50:58.989 --> 51:00.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TOMMY HILFIGER: Yes.

51:00.691 --> 51:02.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Were there
moments where you
thought, this isn't going to
work?

51:03.060 --> 51:04.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOMMY HILFIGER: A couple of
times.

51:04.628 --> 51:06.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

51:06.530 --> 51:09.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOMMY HILFIGER: I mean, once in
particular,
I thought, I should just hang it
up, because

51:09.767 --> 51:16.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was being ridiculed, and I
thought I had
made this enormous mistake by
doing this advertising

51:16.840 --> 51:21.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
campaign created by this
advertising genius,
George Lois.

51:21.345 --> 51:23.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said, look, you just need one
ad.

51:23.981 --> 51:29.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You need one ad to allow the
public to at
least learn your name.

51:29.987 --> 51:36.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he created this ad campaign
that compared
me with all the big names in the
business.

51:36.760 --> 51:38.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

51:38.228 --> 51:42.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOMMY HILFIGER: And when we ran
that, it was
very controversial.

51:42.299 --> 51:49.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But people learned that there
was a Tommy
Hilfiger fashion designer out
there, and they

51:49.940 --> 51:50.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
should go look at the clothes.

51:51.041 --> 51:51.942 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:52.042 --> 51:53.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why is fashion
important?

51:53.610 --> 51:54.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Or is it important?

51:54.712 --> 51:57.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, what is it, in the end,
do you think?

51:57.147 --> 52:01.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOMMY HILFIGER: Look, there are
many more
important things in life than
fashion.

52:01.685 --> 52:04.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But fashion, to me, is part of
pop culture.

52:04.822 --> 52:05.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

52:05.823 --> 52:07.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOMMY HILFIGER: And I'm an art
collector.

52:07.558 --> 52:10.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm obsessed with art and pop
culture.

52:11.061 --> 52:20.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I say that there is FAME,
F-A-M-E, fashion,
art, music and entertainment,
including celebrity,

52:20.471 --> 52:23.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that really moves the needle in
society.

52:24.074 --> 52:25.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

52:25.943 --> 52:31.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Looking back at your whole life,
right, and
you are remembering, does that
young kid seem

52:32.016 --> 52:33.617 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
like you?

52:33.717 --> 52:37.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, do you see a clear
thread from when
you went back to look up to
today?

52:37.521 --> 52:43.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOMMY HILFIGER: Yes, because I
was always
a very positive-thinking person.

52:43.460 --> 52:48.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, other than a couple of
moments in
time, I always thought that,
some way, I'm

52:48.799 --> 52:49.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to make it.

52:49.800 --> 52:50.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm just going to make it.

52:50.801 --> 52:52.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm not going to give up.

52:52.569 --> 52:55.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm going to realize that
dream.

52:55.205 --> 52:57.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, I never gave up.

52:57.975 --> 53:03.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have realized the dream,
and I enjoy
every moment of every day.

53:03.247 --> 53:07.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, well,
the book is
"American Dreamer: My Life in
the Fashion

53:07.351 --> 53:08.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Business."

53:08.352 --> 53:09.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tommy Hilfiger, thank you very
much.

53:09.353 --> 53:11.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOMMY HILFIGER: Thank you very
much.

53:11.221 --> 53:16.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: Since
the early 1990s, scientists have
known that

53:16.293 --> 53:20.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the sun's surface rotates more
slowly than
its interior.

53:20.864 --> 53:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they haven't been able to
pinpoint why.

53:23.400 --> 53:28.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now astrophysicists at the
University of Hawaii
say they have a hunch.

53:28.205 --> 53:30.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can read about that on our
home page.

53:30.374 --> 53:36.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: Two fathers turned to
poetry to teach
their children about growing up
black in America.

53:36.580 --> 53:41.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can find that and more at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:41.518 --> 53:42.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:42.886 --> 53:43.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:43.987 --> 53:46.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

53:46.423 --> 54:00.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.
