DEPARTMENT, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

00:02.966 --> 00:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EUROPEAN INVESTIGATORS, HAS SHUT

00:04.133 --> 00:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOWN TWO OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST

00:05.400 --> 00:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEBSITES ON WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE

00:06.833 --> 00:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DARK WEB.

00:07.966 --> 00:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BLACK MARKET SITES WERE

00:09.266 --> 00:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLEGEDLY PURVEYORS OF ILLEGAL

00:10.833 --> 00:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DRUGS, GUNS, AND HACKING TOOLS

00:12.966 --> 00:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCORDING TO FEDERAL CHARGES

00:14.600 --> 00:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANNOUNCED ON THURSDAY.

GREENBERG IS COVERING THE CASE

00:18.833 --> 00:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND JOINS ME NOW TO DISCUSS IT.

00:20.433 --> 00:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, FIRST OF ALL, HOW

00:22.633 --> 00:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNIFICANT WERE THESE BUSTS?

00:25.033 --> 00:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE

00:26.300 --> 00:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE LARGEST BLOWS, LAW

00:27.533 --> 00:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENFORCEMENT BLOWS TO THE DARK

00:28.566 --> 00:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEB IN A VERY LONG TIME.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF SCALE,

00:32.700 --> 00:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THE BIGGEST OF THESE

00:34.100 --> 00:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITES CALLED ALPHABAY, HAD TEN

00:35.633 --> 00:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIMES AS MANY ILLEGAL PRODUCT

00:38.200 --> 00:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISTINGS AS THE SILK ROAD.

00:39.766 --> 00:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REMEMBER, THE SILK ROAD WAS THE

00:41.300 --> 00:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORIGINAL SORT OF DARK WEB

00:42.266 --> 00:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARKET.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ALSO THEY TOOK DOWN ANOTHER

00:44.600 --> 00:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITE, HANSA, WHICH WAS THE

00:47.366 --> 00:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIRD LARGEST DARK WEB MARKET,

00:49.333 --> 00:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND BEFORE THEY TOOK IT DOWN

00:51.033 --> 00:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CONTROLLED IT FOR A FULL

00:52.333 --> 00:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONTH, SO THEY WERE ABLE TO

00:53.600 --> 00:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBSERVE WHAT WAS HAPPENING

00:56.200 --> 00:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THAT UNDERGROUND MARKET AND

00:58.833 --> 01:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBABLY IDENTIFIED THOUSANDS OF

01:00.533 --> 01:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ITS USERS WHO MAY NOW BE

01:01.733 --> 01:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARRESTED.

01:03.100 --> 01:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHEN ONE OF

01:04.700 --> 01:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE SITES WENT DOWN, DID ALL

01:05.766 --> 01:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THOSE USERS MOVE TO THE OTHER

01:06.900 --> 01:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITE?

01:07.933 --> 01:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS WAS KIND OF THE TRAP

01:09.166 --> 01:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE INTERNATIONAL POLICE

01:11.200 --> 01:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCES... THIS WAS ACTUALLY THE

01:12.733 --> 01:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
F.B.I., D.E.A., EUROPOL AND THE

01:15.033 --> 01:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DUTCH POLICE ALL WORKING

01:16.200 --> 01:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOGETHER.

01:17.333 --> 01:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY TOOK CONTROL OF THE THIRD

01:18.600 --> 01:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARGEST SITE, AND THEN WEEKS

01:20.600 --> 01:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LATER SHUT DOWN THE VERY LARGEST

01:22.433 --> 01:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITE AND THAT SORT OF SENT ALL

01:25.166 --> 01:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE LARGEST SITE'S USERS,

01:27.033 --> 01:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALPHABAY'S USERS, FLOCKING TO

01:29.100 --> 01:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT OTHER SITE SO THEY'RE ABLE

01:30.700 --> 01:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO WATCH THEM REGISTER, THEY'RE

01:32.000 --> 01:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABLE TO WATCH THEM DO SOME

01:33.166 --> 01:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRANSACTIONS, PROBABLY GAIN THE

01:34.733 --> 01:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IDENTIFYING DETAILS OF MANY MORE

01:36.466 --> 01:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USERS THAT WAY.

01:37.700 --> 01:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS CERTAINLY PART OF THEIR

01:38.966 --> 01:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTENTION AND I THINK IT ALSO

01:40.300 --> 01:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CREATED A KIND OF PSYCHOLOGICAL

01:41.933 --> 01:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPACT.

01:43.033 --> 01:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS A FEAR IN THE DARK

01:45.366 --> 01:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NET NOW THAT COPS ARE

01:47.500 --> 01:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYWHERE.

01:48.866 --> 01:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO ARE THESE

01:50.033 --> 01:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USERS... I MEAN, THEY DON'T USE

01:51.000 --> 01:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR REAL NAMES, BUT IF THEY'RE

01:52.400 --> 01:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUYING OR SELLING PRODUCTS,

01:53.800 --> 01:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE PHYSICAL PRODUCTS HAVE TO

01:55.100 --> 01:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO SOMEPLACE IN THE REAL WORLD,

01:56.633 --> 01:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE A MAILING ADDRESS, RIGHT?

01:57.866 --> 01:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU'RE BUYING DRUGS, YOU

01:59.033 --> 01:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PHYSICALLY HAVE TO GET CONTROL

01:59.966 --> 02:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF IT.

02:01.100 --> 02:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES THAT MEAN THAT NOW THE

02:02.333 --> 02:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICE OR THE DIFFERENT

02:03.400 --> 02:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AUTHORITIES SAY NOW I KNOW I'VE

02:04.600 --> 02:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOT YOUR ADDRESS.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IN THEORY, WHEN YOU BUY

02:07.600 --> 02:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DRUGS ON THE DARK WEB, YOU

02:10.133 --> 02:11.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENCRYPT YOUR ADDRESS AND THEN

02:11.566 --> 02:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU SEND THAT ENCRYPTED ADDRESS

02:12.800 --> 02:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THE SELLER OF THE DRUGS, SO

02:14.100 --> 02:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ONLY THE HE OR SHE CAN

02:15.166 --> 02:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECRYPT IT AND SEE YOUR ACTUAL

02:16.533 --> 02:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE YOU LIVE.

02:18.300 --> 02:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT LOTS OF USERS ARE CARELESS.

02:20.166 --> 02:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WOULD SAY A MAJORITY OF USERS,

02:21.866 --> 02:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN ON DARK WEB

02:23.466 --> 02:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORUMS, DON'T ENCRYPT THEIR

02:25.100 --> 02:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADDRESSES.

02:26.666 --> 02:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU KNOW, THIS

02:28.033 --> 02:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REMINDS ME, YOU MENTIONED SILK

02:29.166 --> 02:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROAD, WHEN THAT WENT DOWN, WE

02:30.366 --> 02:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING TO HAVE A

02:31.500 --> 02:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIG IMPACT, BUT THIS IS AN

02:32.533 --> 02:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMY THAT MOVES ON, RIGHT?

02:35.733 --> 02:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO OTHER, THREE OTHER SITES POP

02:37.300 --> 02:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

02:39.933 --> 02:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT THE

02:41.166 --> 02:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST OF THESE TAKEDOWNS AND

02:42.900 --> 02:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NONE OF THEM HAVE TAKEN A

02:43.966 --> 02:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERMANENT BITE OUT OF THE DARK

02:45.433 --> 02:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEB.

02:46.433 --> 02:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SILK ROAD IN 2013, THE

02:50.100 --> 02:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECOND SILK ROAD, THE SEQUEL

02:51.366 --> 02:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITE, WAS TAKEN DOWN IN 2014.

02:52.966 --> 02:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EACH TIME THE DARK WEB BOUNCES

02:54.400 --> 02:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK IN LARGE PART BECAUSE

02:56.100 --> 02:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE ARE ADDICTED TO DRUGS AND

02:58.200 --> 03:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEMAND DOESN'T GO AWAY IF

03:00.233 --> 03:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CAN ONLY OR MOST EASILY

03:01.866 --> 03:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBTAIN THE DRUGS THEY WANT

03:03.466 --> 03:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH THE DARK WEB INSTEAD OF

03:04.400 --> 03:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE STREETS, THEN THEY ARE

03:06.233 --> 03:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO COME BACK AND THEY

03:07.366 --> 03:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE EVERY TIME.

03:08.466 --> 03:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO DOES THIS

03:09.700 --> 03:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEAN THE AUTHORITIES HAVE A

03:10.900 --> 03:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY TO CRACK TOR, WHICH

03:12.666 --> 03:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYBODY THOUGHT WAS THIS

03:14.000 --> 03:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOTALLY ENCRYPTED, SAFE WAY TO

03:15.666 --> 03:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNICATE ANONYMOUSLY?

03:17.533 --> 03:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE DON'T KNOW HOW AT LEAST

03:20.566 --> 03:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE THIRD LARGEST SITE IN THIS

03:23.233 --> 03:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKEDOWN WAS CRACKED.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FIRST LARGEST SITE,

03:27.533 --> 03:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALPHABAY, THE ADMINISTRATOR HAD

03:28.966 --> 03:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY POSTED HIS EMAIL

03:30.166 --> 03:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADDRESS IN THE WELCOME MESSAGE

03:31.533 --> 03:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THE SITE IN 2014.

03:33.866 --> 03:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS THE FIRST CLUE THAT

03:35.233 --> 03:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLOWED AUTHORITIES TO START

03:36.533 --> 03:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRACING HIM BACK TO HIS HOME

03:37.666 --> 03:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THAILAND, ARREST HIM.

03:38.733 --> 03:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE ACTUALLY COMMITTED SUICIDE IN

03:39.866 --> 03:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE THAI JAIL.

03:41.633 --> 03:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, IN THAT CASE, IT DOESN'T

03:43.100 --> 03:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEM THAT THERE WAS ANY KIND OF

03:44.400 --> 03:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOUR BREAK THAT WAS NECESSARY.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IN OTHER CASES, IT DOES

03:48.300 --> 03:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEM THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS

03:49.800 --> 03:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROKEN TOR.

03:50.900 --> 03:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EACH TIME, TOR USUALLY FIGURES

03:52.366 --> 03:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT WHAT WENT WRONG AND
