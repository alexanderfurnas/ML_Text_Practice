Rape is notorious for being
under-reported,

00:31.932 --> 00:38.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it's because survivors are
faced with
a system that is stacked so high
against them.

00:38.472 --> 00:42.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus: preserving

Today's FBI statement about
Hillary Clinton's
e-mails roiled the presidential
race, just

01:19.713 --> 01:22.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
11 days before the election.

landed in
Cedar Rapids, Iowa to campaign,
but was greeted

01:34.861 --> 01:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the news that the FBI is
reviewing newly
found e-mails linked the private
server she

01:40.133 --> 01:42.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
used as secretary of state.

01:42.402 --> 01:48.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a letter to congressional
chairmen, FBI
Director James Comey said: "An
unrelated investigation

01:48.575 --> 01:52.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turned up e-mails that appear
pertinent to
the Clinton case."

01:52.679 --> 01:57.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he agreed with his team
to allow investigators
to review the e-mails and
determine whether

01:57.851 --> 02:02.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they contain classified
information, as well
as assess their importance.

02:02.622 --> 02:08.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The candidate herself didn't
respond to shouted
questions, and didn't address it
at her rally,

02:08.295 --> 02:10.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sticking with her stump speech.

02:10.230 --> 02:13.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Everyone working across the

to make sure that we win Iowa.

the timing of the announcement
extraordinary
and urging the FBI to give more
details about

02:26.213 --> 02:32.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the e-mails in question,
stressing that it's
not clear if these e-mails are
significant.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In Manchester, New Hampshire:

02:34.321 --> 02:35.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
That I heard this 10 minutes
ago.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The news was
certainly significant
to Donald Trump.

02:38.992 --> 02:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We must not let
her take her
are criminal scheme into the
Oval Office.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:47.768 --> 02:55.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I have great
respect for the
fact that the FBI and the
Department of Justice

02:55.842 --> 03:04.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are now willing to have the
courage to right
the horrible mistake that they
made.

03:04.284 --> 03:09.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This the same
day that Clinton
hoped to focus on other areas,
like debuting

03:09.523 --> 03:11.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a new television ad featuring
President Obama.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
These last eight years is on the
ballot.

03:13.960 --> 03:18.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And the Clinton
camp had
good news on the fund-raising
front, as Donald

03:18.265 --> 03:23.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump faced new money questions,
especially
about his repeated pledges to
personally finance

03:23.303 --> 03:25.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his campaign, like this from two
days ago.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I will have over
$100 million
in the campaign.

03:28.575 --> 03:31.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm prepared to go much more
than that.

03:31.378 --> 03:35.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: But new
fund-raising reports
show the total Trump personally
donated to

03:35.749 --> 03:40.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the campaign was $56 million as
of just over
a week ago.

03:40.420 --> 03:45.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His contributions dropped in
October to a
total of $31,000 for the first
three weeks

03:45.492 --> 03:46.927 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of this month.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What might matter more is how
much Trump's
campaign has on hand.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's $16 million according to
the report.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That compares with $62 million
in Hillary
Clinton's war chest.

03:57.571 --> 04:01.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Trump said he is writing
a $10 million
check to his campaign.

04:02.008 --> 04:07.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is a big boost, but it
still leaves a
more than 2-1 money gap.

04:07.080 --> 04:12.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, key Senate races are
winding up
with a contentious New Hampshire
Senate debate

04:12.052 --> 04:15.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last night and a headline-making
face-off
in Illinois.

04:15.889 --> 04:20.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Iraq War veteran

her family's

04:20.694 --> 04:25.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
history of military service
going back to
the Revolutionary War.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That prompted this from
incumbent Republican
Mark Kirk:

SEN.

forgotten that
your parents came all the way
from Thailand

04:32.439 --> 04:33.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to serve George Washington.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Duckworth's
mother is a Thai
immigrant.

04:36.943 --> 04:40.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her father's family does go back
to the nation's
founding.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Kirk later apologized.

04:42.482 --> 04:48.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With a week-and-a-half left, the
twists and

sacrifice, and we
are so grateful.

05:47.113 --> 05:51.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are in tears because we were

they heard the truth and they
didn't -- and

05:51.885 --> 05:56.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they weren't intimidated enough

08:22.602 --> 08:28.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The protesters are demanding
that Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif step down over
corruption charges.

08:28.908 --> 08:33.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the deadliest incident yet
in the Philippines'
drug war.

08:33.113 --> 08:38.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police in a southern province
killed a mayor
and nine of his men in a
shoot-out today.

08:38.752 --> 08:44.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hours earlier, outspoken
President Rodrigo
Duterte declared thousands more
may die in

08:44.391 --> 08:46.192 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the drug war.

08:46.226 --> 08:51.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also said that he's going to
stop swearing
because God spoke to him and
warned him to

08:51.664 --> 08:53.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mend his ways.

08:53.867 --> 08:58.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the death
of a two-star
U.S. Army general just two days
before he

08:58.338 --> 09:03.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was to assume command of the
Space and Missile
Defense Command has been ruled a
suicide.

09:03.977 --> 09:09.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Major General John Rossi was
found dead at
his home at Redstone Arsenal,
Alabama, in

09:09.149 --> 09:10.950 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
July.

09:10.984 --> 09:15.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the first general officer
to take his
own life since record-keeping
began in 2000.

09:16.022 --> 09:21.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Military suicides have risen in
recent years,
but an Army statement shed no
light on Rossi's

09:21.227 --> 09:22.996 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
motive.

09:23.029 --> 09:27.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average
lost eight points to close at
18161.

09:27.967 --> 09:32.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell nearly 26, and
the S&amp;P 500
fell six.

09:32.472 --> 09:37.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the week, the Dow gained a
faction, the
Nasdaq fell more than 1 percent,
and the S&amp;P

09:37.944 --> 09:41.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dropped seventh-tenths of a
percent.

09:41.047 --> 09:45.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Bob Dylan will accept the
Nobel Prize
for Literature after all.

09:45.051 --> 09:48.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had not been heard from since
the prize
was announced two weeks ago.

09:48.855 --> 09:53.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, today, the Nobel Foundation
said that
Dylan has now called to say he
-- quote -- "appreciates

09:53.793 --> 09:56.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the honor" and accepts.

09:56.062 --> 10:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No word yet on whether he will
attend the
award ceremony in December.

10:01.034 --> 10:05.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the FBI's
review of new e-mails linked to
Hillary Clinton;

10:05.705 --> 10:11.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the tight race for president in
unexpected
battleground states; efforts to
stop rape

10:11.845 --> 10:24.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kits from being destroyed; and
much more.

10:24.190 --> 10:29.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We return to today's revelation
that the FBI
will review newly discovered
e-mails connected

10:30.029 --> 10:33.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Hillary Clinton's handling of
classified
information.

10:33.233 --> 10:38.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To help us unpack what we know
is Devlin Barrett,
reporter with The Wall Street
Journal.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Devlin, welcome back to the
"NewsHour."

10:40.273 --> 10:42.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, where did these e-mails come
from?

10:42.542 --> 10:46.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT, The Wall Street
Journal: I'm
told that these e-mails were
found on a personal

10:46.045 --> 10:52.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
laptop that was shared by a key
Clinton aid,
Huma Abedin, and her then
husband -- they

10:52.385 --> 10:56.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are now separated -- Anthony
Weiner, who is
a former congressman.

10:56.289 --> 11:02.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The backstory here is that Mr.
Weiner is under
investigation for allegedly
sexting with potentially

11:02.328 --> 11:04.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an underaged girl.

11:04.097 --> 11:08.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they looked at that
laptop as part
of that investigation and found
a whole slew

11:08.134 --> 11:13.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of e-mails that -- some of
which, I'm told,
include Ms. Abedin's having work
discussions

11:13.706 --> 11:15.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on e-mail.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now they have to go through
these thousands
of e-mails to see if any of them
might contain

11:18.945 --> 11:24.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
classified or any other
information that the
investigators would consider
instructive to

11:24.517 --> 11:25.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the e-mail investigation.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, it's
thousands of e-mails?

11:27.620 --> 11:28.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that what they're saying?

11:28.621 --> 11:30.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Well, right.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's thousands of e-mails on
the laptop,
I'm told, but they have to go
through and

11:32.325 --> 11:36.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
figure out how many of those are
her work
discussions.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that number, I'm told,
hasn't been calculated
yet.

11:38.765 --> 11:43.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But this
investigation into
Hillary Clinton's confidential
e-mails has

11:43.269 --> 11:44.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been going on for some time.

11:45.004 --> 11:47.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're just now looking at this
particular
laptop?

11:47.440 --> 11:49.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Right.

11:49.309 --> 11:53.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm told investigators in the
original Clinton
e-mail investigation were not
aware of this

11:53.079 --> 11:58.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
device being used for any State
Department
work discussions at the time
they did that

11:58.518 --> 12:00.520 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation.

12:00.553 --> 12:06.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm told that the FBI
essentially only realized
that they had possession of
these work discussions,

12:06.492 --> 12:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these e-mail work discussions
earlier this
week.

12:08.695 --> 12:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there's been, frankly, a bit
of a scramble
in the FBI in the last few days
to, one, figure

12:13.600 --> 12:15.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out what they have and then
figure out what
to do about it.

12:16.002 --> 12:20.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, as we say,
this happens
11 days before the presidential
election?

12:20.907 --> 12:24.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This has to do with one of the
two nominees
for president.

12:24.444 --> 12:29.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did the FBI say anything to you
about the
timing of this and whether that
affected their

12:29.282 --> 12:30.450 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decision?

12:30.483 --> 12:32.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: They're not
saying anything
publicly.

12:32.251 --> 12:37.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I'm told is that they
considered the
possibility of just reviewing
the material

12:38.024 --> 12:40.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then telling just -- and
then Congress
later.

12:40.893 --> 12:46.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the decision they came
to, though,
was that they'd rather take
whatever grief

12:46.432 --> 12:50.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're going to take for saying
this now
than be accused after the
election of having

12:50.703 --> 12:55.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
held it back, having sat on
something important,
and wait until the election was
over to tell

12:55.341 --> 12:57.110 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

12:57.143 --> 12:59.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, so we have
the chairman
of Hillary Clinton's campaign
and a number

12:59.679 --> 13:03.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of others saying, we want to see
what that
is; it's not fair...

13:03.383 --> 13:05.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Right.

13:05.251 --> 13:06.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... that you're
announcing
you're doing this without
letting us see what's

13:06.419 --> 13:07.387 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do they say to that?

13:08.421 --> 13:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Well, right.

13:10.289 --> 13:13.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the challenge for
both campaigns
is that they get to talk to this
without knowing

13:13.926 --> 13:15.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what the underlying facts are.

13:15.862 --> 13:19.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, frankly, it's not -- from
my understanding,
is that the FBI doesn't really
know what the

13:19.365 --> 13:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
underlying facts are yet.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what they're trying to
figure out.

13:22.435 --> 13:26.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, frankly, it is
going to be a
political football for the rest
of this time,

13:26.973 --> 13:29.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it's obviously politically a
very big
deal.

13:29.976 --> 13:33.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What no one knows -- and I
suspect not even
the FBI really knows at this
point -- is,

13:33.946 --> 13:35.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is it a big deal legally?

13:35.081 --> 13:36.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Does it have a legal
consequence?

13:36.849 --> 13:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will almost certainly have a
political
consequence, but it's not clear
at all yet

13:39.619 --> 13:41.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if this will have a legal
consequence.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how long do
they think
this is going to take to go
through these

13:43.790 --> 13:44.757 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
e-mails?

13:44.791 --> 13:46.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Well, there's
two steps.

13:46.259 --> 13:49.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, you have to figure out,
OK, find the
universe of work e-mails.

13:50.029 --> 13:53.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then you have to figure out, OK,
is any of
the information classified?

13:53.132 --> 13:55.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Classification reviews can take
weeks or months.

13:55.501 --> 14:01.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if there are things that are
potentially
classified, we may not know that
for months.

14:01.240 --> 14:05.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, they are
going -- they
have already begun the process,
is that right,

14:05.945 --> 14:07.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of going through what's on this
laptop.

14:07.613 --> 14:08.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Right.

14:08.748 --> 14:11.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And who's doing
the work?

14:11.217 --> 14:13.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Well, it's the
FBI investigators.

14:13.619 --> 14:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the folks who did the
original e-mail
investigation.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're now going through.

14:18.558 --> 14:23.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one thing they don't know is
how many
of the e-mails on that laptop
are possibly

14:23.763 --> 14:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
copies of e-mails they have
already seen earlier
in the investigation?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where she might
have copied
herself or copied...

14:30.002 --> 14:31.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

14:31.738 --> 14:33.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Right, if there
is e-mails
between two people, those
e-mails exist on

14:33.573 --> 14:34.540 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two computers.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So maybe what they have is a lot
of copies.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But they to figure that out.

14:38.177 --> 14:42.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it
certainly has opened
up a whole new set of questions
as we get

14:42.215 --> 14:43.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
closer to Election Day.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Devlin Barrett with The Wall
Street Journal,
thank you.

14:45.651 --> 14:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Thank you.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: While it's too
soon to tell
what the impact of today's
revelation will

14:50.723 --> 14:55.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be on the presidential race,
there are plenty
of other dynamics to drill down
on.

14:55.628 --> 14:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here to discuss how the campaign
is playing
out in some of the states where
it matters

14:59.999 --> 15:02.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most, we're joined by Andra
Gillespie.

15:02.201 --> 15:07.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a professor of political
science at
Emory University in Atlanta.

15:07.039 --> 15:11.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Emily Ramshaw, she's editor in
chief of The
Texas Tribune in Austin.

15:11.844 --> 15:17.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Paul Steinhauser, he's
political director
for NH1 in Manchester, New
Hampshire.

15:17.617 --> 15:20.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all of you to the
program.

15:20.319 --> 15:26.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to start with you,
Emily, by asking
where the race stands in the
state of Texas.

15:26.592 --> 15:31.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm doing that because I
can't believe
that Texas is actually in play
in this election

15:31.898 --> 15:35.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year, because, what, Mitt Romney
won four
years ago by how many points?

15:35.535 --> 15:38.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY RAMSHAW, Editor in Chief,
The Texas
Tribune: Close to 18 percentage
points.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's really a fascinating case
right now.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are, in theory, within the
margin of error.

15:43.009 --> 15:47.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Polling shows that Hillary
Clinton is trailing
Donald Trump here by 3
percentage points.

15:47.914 --> 15:52.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Early voting turnout here has
been through
the roof in almost every major
county.

15:52.084 --> 15:57.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the first time in my career
covering Texas,
Texas is actually, in theory, in
play for

15:57.223 --> 15:59.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Democrats.

15:59.058 --> 16:01.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Andra Gillespie,
we have asked
you to look at three states for
us that are

16:01.828 --> 16:08.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in play, where you are right
now, Georgia,
which is a place, again, you
wouldn't expect

16:08.367 --> 16:09.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Democrats would have a shot.

16:09.368 --> 16:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does it look like right now
in Georgia?

16:11.170 --> 16:15.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDRA GILLESPIE, Emory
University: So, right
now, the polls have Donald Trump
ahead, but

16:15.241 --> 16:18.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
his lead is within the
statistical margin
of error.

16:18.177 --> 16:23.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, this is something that
nobody would
have expected in a normal
presidential election

16:23.249 --> 16:25.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year, but, of course, this year
has been every
-- anything but normal.

16:25.852 --> 16:28.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about
Florida, which
you're also looking at?

16:28.855 --> 16:33.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: So, in Florida,
it's also
still statistically died.

16:33.759 --> 16:35.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a little bit mixed.

16:35.628 --> 16:40.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Going into this week, a lot of
prognosticator
have started to put Florida in
the lead-Clinton

16:40.066 --> 16:44.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
category, but there's been a
couple of polls
that have put Donald Trump up.

16:44.337 --> 16:48.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, these leads are
narrow leads and
statistically they're within the
margin of

16:48.741 --> 16:51.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
error, so we can say nothing
other than the
fact that they're tied right
now.

16:51.777 --> 16:54.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we're hearing
today that
Hillary Clinton is going to
spending much

16:54.647 --> 16:58.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the weekend in Florida, in
Daytona Beach
and Miami.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Andra, let me ask you, what
about North
Carolina?

17:00.686 --> 17:04.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a state where both of
these campaigns
have practically been living for
the last

17:04.090 --> 17:05.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
few weeks.

17:05.324 --> 17:07.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: So, this is
also a hotly
contested state.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's started to trend toward
Clinton.

17:09.896 --> 17:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, we're talking about
these razor-thin
margins that are within the
statistical margin

17:13.933 --> 17:15.668 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of error.

17:15.701 --> 17:19.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, people have started
to look at
North Carolina as a must-win
state for Donald

17:19.505 --> 17:24.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump if he hopes to be able to
amass 270
Electoral College votes.

17:24.243 --> 17:28.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, for that reason, Hillary
Clinton yesterday
brought Michelle Obama in to try
to shore

17:28.514 --> 17:32.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up support there to make sure
that she keeps
that in the lean-Clinton
category.

17:32.418 --> 17:34.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, again, it's still
statistically too close
to call.

17:34.954 --> 17:39.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Paul
Steinhauser, you
are in New Hampshire, where
Donald Trump was

17:39.725 --> 17:40.693 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How's it looking there?

17:42.461 --> 17:44.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL STEINHAUSER, NH1 News
Network: Well,
I think you could say Donald
Trump is one

17:44.730 --> 17:46.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happy dude today.

17:46.299 --> 17:49.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He broke the news about the
e-mail investigation
by the FBI at this rally.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Overall, though, Judy, it's
getting tighter
here in New Hampshire.

17:51.637 --> 17:54.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A new poll out today shows a
three-point edge
for Clinton.

17:54.407 --> 17:58.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you average all the polls
over the last
week, it's only five points for
Clinton.

17:58.444 --> 18:01.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's one reason you keep
seeing Donald Trump
back here, three times this
month.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's been seven times since the
Republican
Convention, Judy.

18:04.083 --> 18:08.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about why
these races are shaping up the
way they are.

18:08.354 --> 18:12.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Emily Ramshaw, in Texas, what is
driving voters?

18:12.191 --> 18:13.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm sure you have talked to
some.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Your reporters have talked to
them.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is motivating them this
year?

18:17.730 --> 18:21.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY RAMSHAW: Well, what is
really motivating
them is the polarization of this
race.

18:21.667 --> 18:26.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're seeing huge turnout in
communities
with large Latino populations,
with a lot

18:26.639 --> 18:30.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of women turning out to the
polls, saying
they're just outraged by Donald
Trump's comments

18:30.543 --> 18:32.445 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about women.

18:32.478 --> 18:36.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, you're seeing
record turnout
in really strong Republican
parts of the state,

18:36.182 --> 18:40.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where folks are just determined
to ensure
that Hillary Clinton doesn't get
elected.

18:40.052 --> 18:45.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, really, you're seeing just
incredible
polarization and anger and
outrage and excitement

18:45.057 --> 18:46.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on both sides.

18:46.959 --> 18:51.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about --
Emily, staying
with you, what about in the
Latino community?

18:51.063 --> 18:52.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How is that breaking down?

18:52.565 --> 18:56.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMILY RAMSHAW: The Latinos in
Texas are considered
the sleeping giant.

18:56.202 --> 18:59.905 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
They are largely
Democratic-leaning when they
are inspired to the polls, but
they're very

18:59.939 --> 19:01.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
difficult to get to the polls.

19:01.774 --> 19:05.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, so far, what we
have seen from
early voting turnout, normally,
you vote early

19:05.211 --> 19:07.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Texas to avoid the lines.

19:07.279 --> 19:10.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there have been incredible
lines in the
first five days of early voting,
particularly

19:10.983 --> 19:15.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a lot of these strongly
Latino communities,
even on the border and in El
Paso.

19:15.688 --> 19:19.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that would suggest that a lot
of these
Latinos are being spurred to the
polls.

19:19.425 --> 19:24.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Andra
Gillespie, again,
we have asked you to take on
three states.

19:24.296 --> 19:26.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But let's take them one by one.

19:26.098 --> 19:30.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Georgia, the fact that
Hillary Clinton
is even in contention there, how
do you explain

19:30.503 --> 19:31.737 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

19:31.771 --> 19:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: Well, I think
it's a number
of factors.

19:33.773 --> 19:39.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's, one, just the
polarizing candidacy
of Donald Trump, which has
divided the Republican

19:39.045 --> 19:44.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party and perhaps dampened
enthusiasm among
some segments of the Republican
population,

19:44.216 --> 19:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
particularly suburban white
college-educated
women.

19:46.752 --> 19:52.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We also have a growth in voter
registration
amongst Latino and
Asian-American voters.

19:52.892 --> 19:57.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we expect that, given Donald
Trump's immigration
rhetoric, that that -- those
groups are going

19:57.296 --> 19:59.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to trend Democratic.

19:59.098 --> 20:03.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have also seen efforts in the
Democratic
Party to do party building to
make sure that

20:03.235 --> 20:07.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they identify likely Democratic
voters in
the state in an attempt to try
to get them

20:07.573 --> 20:09.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to register to vote as well.

20:09.508 --> 20:13.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's jump
down to Florida,
where we know it's a very
different demographic

20:13.779 --> 20:14.747 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dynamic.

20:14.780 --> 20:18.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Latino vote there has been
significant.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What role is it playing this
year?

20:20.586 --> 20:25.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: So, I think,
this year, all
eyes are going to be on the
Orlando area in

20:25.658 --> 20:27.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
particular.

20:27.493 --> 20:31.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we know that, in South
Florida, Cuban
Americans have historically
trended Republican

20:31.197 --> 20:37.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in presidential elections, and
so the Latino
population in the state of
Florida is diversifying.

20:37.336 --> 20:42.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you're looking at Puerto
Ricans in particular
who might be leaving the
economic woes of

20:42.541 --> 20:44.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the island to come straight to
the mainland.

20:44.376 --> 20:45.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they can register to vote.

20:45.377 --> 20:47.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're U.S. citizens.

20:47.246 --> 20:51.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, we could be seeing a
different type of
Latino electorate, one that
would be disinclined

20:51.517 --> 20:55.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to support Donald Trump for
president, and
again the same national
pressures, with Donald

20:55.721 --> 20:59.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump having alienated many
women, having
alienated African-Americans.

20:59.158 --> 21:04.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this might drive up turnout
for Hillary
Clinton amongst these segments
of the electorate.

21:04.363 --> 21:09.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Andra, in
both Florida
and North Carolina, what kind of
an organization

21:09.668 --> 21:13.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do these two campaigns, Clinton
and Trump,
have?

21:13.506 --> 21:19.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: So, Donald
Trump has relied
on the RNC to do a lot of the
GOTV work and

21:19.778 --> 21:24.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hasn't really laid the same type
of campaign
infrastructure that Hillary
Clinton has.

21:24.316 --> 21:27.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this could be the difference
between winning
and losing this time around.

21:27.887 --> 21:32.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we know that Clinton has
more campaign
offices.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know that she has more paid
staff.

21:34.527 --> 21:38.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these people are in place to
help direct
the GOTV operations that are in
place now

21:38.797 --> 21:43.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get people to the polls for
early voting
and in particular to get them
out on Election

21:43.269 --> 21:45.104 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Day.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is not to say that the
Trump campaign
isn't organizing, but some of
this is being

21:48.707 --> 21:50.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a more decentralized fashion.

21:50.476 --> 21:54.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It becomes a question of whether
not that
decentralization can actually
yield the same

21:54.780 --> 21:59.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
type of high-impact voter
turnout that we
know a classic shoe-leather
campaign can.

21:59.285 --> 22:02.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Paul Steinhauser,
coming back
to you, you alluded to this a
minute ago,

22:02.721 --> 22:06.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but what is driving voters this
year in New
Hampshire?

22:06.058 --> 22:09.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is it the same sort of
polarization we're
seeing in these other states?

22:09.528 --> 22:13.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL STEINHAUSER: Yes, we're not
that different
than the rest of the country.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think you're seeing the
same trends
up here that you're seeing
elsewhere.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We get a lot more campaign
traffic.

22:17.269 --> 22:18.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obviously, we get two bites at
the apple.

22:18.804 --> 22:20.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We saw all the candidates in the
primary as
well.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, Judy, we're a little
old-school up here.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't have early voting, so
it's November
8 for us.

22:25.544 --> 22:28.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's all about the
grassroots outreach,
the get-out-the-vote efforts
here.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's about the door-knocks and
it's about
the phone calls.

22:31.584 --> 22:36.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as in the other states, the
Trump campaign
is a little stronger here, I
think.

22:36.055 --> 22:39.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have had a little longer to
put their
organization together.

22:39.792 --> 22:43.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, still, the Clinton campaign
has the bigger
get-out-the-vote effort than the
Trump campaign

22:43.729 --> 22:45.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here in New Hampshire, Judy.

22:45.531 --> 22:48.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me just
quickly touch base
with all three of you with this
question.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Emily, to you first.

22:50.736 --> 22:57.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much is undecided, would you
say, or still
-- people who may still change
their minds

22:57.243 --> 22:58.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Texas?

22:58.978 --> 23:02.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY RAMSHAW: You know, I
think, at this
point, most folks' minds are
already made

23:02.181 --> 23:03.182 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You saw Clinton playing late
here in the game.

23:05.017 --> 23:08.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She started advertising just a
little bit
in Texas, which was unheard of
for a Democrat

23:08.120 --> 23:09.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the presidential race.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's opened some offices here.

23:11.290 --> 23:14.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, by this point in
the game, most
people really know where they're
voting.

23:14.293 --> 23:18.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, early voting turnout
has been
so high that records may not be
broken on

23:18.197 --> 23:20.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Election Day itself.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Andra
Gillespie, again,
three states, Georgia, Florida,
North Carolina,

23:23.669 --> 23:26.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what would you say about minds
not quite made
up?

23:26.639 --> 23:31.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: So, I think
that at, this
point, it's not so much about
persuasion as

23:31.310 --> 23:33.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it is about mobilization.

23:33.245 --> 23:37.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, given the turn in news
events, whether
it's tapes or whether it's
e-mails, that's

23:37.683 --> 23:41.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fodder for campaigns to go out
and try to
reach their targeted groups of
people.

23:41.954 --> 23:46.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if they have done the hard
work of identifying
voters and banking those votes,
now it's just

23:46.325 --> 23:49.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a question of getting those
voters out to
the polls.

23:49.161 --> 23:53.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, changes in the news cycle
probably aren't
going to change folks' minds at
this point.

23:53.332 --> 23:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of that's already baked
in.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think a lot of that is
being reflected
in the numbers of people who
have turned out

23:57.870 --> 23:59.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for early voting.

23:59.805 --> 24:02.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will wait to see whether this
is a harbinger
of record turnout or it's a
harbinger of people

24:03.008 --> 24:04.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
having made up their minds
already.

24:04.943 --> 24:08.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think this race really
does come down
to who is best equipped to be
able to get

24:08.947 --> 24:11.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their people out to the polls
between now
and November 8.

24:11.650 --> 24:15.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in just a
couple of seconds,
Paul, minds not made up, big
percentage or

24:15.954 --> 24:16.922 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
not?

24:16.955 --> 24:18.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Small percentage?

24:18.190 --> 24:20.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL STEINHAUSER: Very small
percentage here,
same story.

24:20.559 --> 24:22.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Minds are pretty much made up.

24:22.361 --> 24:24.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's all about getting out
the base, not
only in the presidential race,
but in our

24:24.697 --> 24:26.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
blockbuster U.S. Senate race as
well, Judy.

24:26.532 --> 24:30.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which we didn't
have a chance
to talk to, but we will be in
one of these

24:30.869 --> 24:32.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
coming days before election.

24:32.871 --> 24:40.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Steinhauser, Emily Ramshaw,
Andra Gillespie,
thank you very much.

24:40.846 --> 24:49.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

24:49.521 --> 24:54.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up, there's much more
politics on the
"NewsHour," as Mark Shields and
David Brooks

24:54.193 --> 24:59.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take on the week's news; the
so-called polar
Garden of Eden set to become the
world's largest

24:59.898 --> 25:08.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marine reserve; and a call for
designers to
make gorgeous plus-sized
clothing.

25:08.173 --> 25:13.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: how one woman's
struggle to protect
evidence in her rape case led to
the start

25:13.612 --> 25:17.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a movement and now a new
federal law.

25:17.049 --> 25:18.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has her story.

25:18.851 --> 25:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANDA NGUYEN, President and
Founder, Rise:
Over and over again, I started
discovering

25:24.323 --> 25:26.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a system that is so broken.

25:26.492 --> 25:32.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For sexual assault
survivors like
Amanda Nguyen, this small box
has the tremendous

25:32.698 --> 25:36.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
power to deliver justice and
bring closure.

25:36.835 --> 25:38.570 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a rape kit.

25:38.604 --> 25:43.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Inside are the tools to collect
and store
the evidence to track down and
prosecute an

25:43.609 --> 25:45.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
assailant.

25:45.344 --> 25:50.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANDA NGUYEN: Rape is notorious
for being
underreported, and it's because
survivors

25:50.482 --> 25:54.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are faced with a system that is
stacked so
high against them.

25:54.753 --> 25:59.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amanda was assaulted
in 2013 when
she was in college in
Massachusetts.

26:00.025 --> 26:04.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rape kits are automatically
destroyed in that
state after six months unless
the victim asks

26:04.797 --> 26:06.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for an extension.

26:06.231 --> 26:07.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And how do they do that?

26:08.000 --> 26:11.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANDA NGUYEN: The catch is that
there's no
information given on how to
extend it, and

26:11.770 --> 26:15.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the greater catch is that
there's no way to
actually extend it.

26:15.073 --> 26:20.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Even after she filled
out the proper
forms, the bureaucratic
confusion continued.

26:20.179 --> 26:24.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANDA NGUYEN: I found out that,
against an
extension put into place, my kit
was wrongly

26:24.850 --> 26:27.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
removed from the forensic lab
and almost destroyed.

26:27.519 --> 26:31.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, even if I have played by
their game, it
still is broken.

26:31.924 --> 26:35.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: After that, Amanda
began asking
questions.

26:35.060 --> 26:39.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She learned that, in most
states, police can
legally destroy rape kits well
before the

26:39.598 --> 26:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
statute of limitations runs out.

26:41.700 --> 26:46.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMANDA NGUYEN: What that
literally means is
that, if I was raped in a state
that doesn't

26:46.371 --> 26:53.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
destroy kits, like California,
Colorado, Texas,
Illinois, then this wouldn't
have happened

26:53.378 --> 26:57.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to me, and it's just because
Massachusetts
doesn't have those rights.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: An activist was born.

26:59.718 --> 27:01.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMANDA NGUYEN: I had a choice.

27:01.954 --> 27:05.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I could accept injustice or
rewrite the law.

27:05.457 --> 27:08.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of these things is a lot
better than
the other.

27:08.393 --> 27:12.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My mission is simple: Fix the
patchwork of
rights.

27:12.097 --> 27:17.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amanda formed a
coalition of rape
survivors demanding a federal
bill of rights.

27:17.736 --> 27:23.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Change.org petition has more
than 140,000
signatures.

27:23.175 --> 27:28.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Most sexual assaults are
investigated and
prosecuted under state law, but
Amanda believes

27:28.313 --> 27:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that a national standard can
serve as a model
for statehouses.

27:32.818 --> 27:37.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier this month, that finally
became a
reality when President Obama
signed the Sexual

27:37.756 --> 27:40.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Assault Survivors Bill of
Rights.

27:40.325 --> 27:46.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the first time that the
term sexual assault
survivor appears in federal law.

27:46.131 --> 27:50.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bill says those who've been
assaulted
should be clearly told their
legal rights,

27:50.569 --> 27:56.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be able to track the status and
results of
their rape kit, not pay for a
rape kit exam,

27:56.308 --> 27:58.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and be able to get the police
report.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.945 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

27:59.978 --> 28:01.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEANNE SHAHEEN (D), New
Hampshire: The way
we met Amanda is that she just
started coming

28:01.413 --> 28:03.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to offices on the Hill.

28:03.382 --> 28:07.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: To help draft the
Sexual Assault
Survivors Act, Amanda turned to
Democratic

28:07.953 --> 28:10.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New
Hampshire.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator, tell us, what would the
bill do?

28:12.824 --> 28:13.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's in the bill?

28:13.825 --> 28:15.627 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

28:15.661 --> 28:18.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEANNE SHAHEEN: Oftentimes, the
system makes
people feel like they are being
revictimized.

28:18.964 --> 28:26.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the bill is an effort to
say that survivors
of sexual assault should have
certain rights

28:26.104 --> 28:30.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
under our criminal justice
system, and they
should know what those rights
are, and they

28:30.108 --> 28:33.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should be treated -- everyone
should be treated
fairly.

28:33.078 --> 28:38.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is something that is
overlooked in the
law the way it exists now.

28:38.684 --> 28:46.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so it was really her
advocacy and her
determination that has raised
this issue,

28:46.491 --> 28:51.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and gives us all of those
supporters around
the country who can help us talk
to other

28:51.797 --> 28:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
senators and members of Congress
to get this
done.

28:54.466 --> 28:59.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amanda's coalition is
now lobbying
state lawmakers across the
country.

28:59.204 --> 29:04.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Versions of the bill are pending
in several
states, including Oregon,
California and Maryland,

29:04.710 --> 29:08.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and has even passed in
Massachusetts.

29:08.246 --> 29:11.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The overall goal of the bill is
to empower
assault victims with
information.

29:11.883 --> 29:15.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY SILVERBERG, Network for
Victim Recovery
of D.C.: It's so scary, it's so
overwhelming

29:15.454 --> 29:19.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to walk into a hospital to not
have any idea
really about what is going to
happen.

29:19.958 --> 29:25.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: MedStar Washington
Hospital Center
in the District of Columbia
offers every patient

29:25.163 --> 29:30.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
requesting a rape kit exam a
forensic nurse
specially trained to conduct
those exams and

29:30.335 --> 29:34.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a sexual assault advocate like
Lindsey Silverberg.

29:34.272 --> 29:37.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's there to provide victims
with legal
and emotional support.

29:37.442 --> 29:41.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY SILVERBERG: One of the
benefits of
having an advocate, with
somebody in the exam

29:41.346 --> 29:45.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
room and then following up after
with them,
is that, if they decide to then
engage law

29:45.217 --> 29:50.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enforcement after the forensic
exam is over,
they have somebody who can walk
them through

29:50.422 --> 29:52.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that system.

29:52.224 --> 29:55.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have seen an increase in
the number
of people who have decided to
report to law

29:55.961 --> 30:00.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enforcement after an exam, once
they have
all the information about what
that looks

30:00.499 --> 30:02.234 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
like.

30:02.267 --> 30:06.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But, in many states,
full-time
professional advocates like
Lindsey don't

30:06.238 --> 30:08.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exist.

30:08.240 --> 30:12.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY SILVERBERG: Access to
competent, well-trained
individuals, both an advocate
and a forensic

30:12.678 --> 30:15.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nurse, is not the national
standard at the
moment.

30:15.213 --> 30:21.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amanda continues to
champion the
rights of the estimated 25
million sexual

30:21.620 --> 30:23.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
assault survivors nationally.

30:23.388 --> 30:28.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is cheered by unexpected
encounters like
this one with an Uber driver on
one of her

30:28.427 --> 30:30.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
many rides to Capitol Hill.

30:30.295 --> 30:34.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANDA NGUYEN: He didn't talk to
me the entire
ride, but he saw I was going to
the Senate.

30:34.433 --> 30:35.701 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, he asked me.

30:35.734 --> 30:38.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I told him the reason why
and what I was
fighting for.

30:38.203 --> 30:44.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this man who I would never
met before,
who was once intimidating,
started crying.

30:44.409 --> 30:47.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, just -- tears just welled
up in his
eyes.

30:47.579 --> 30:53.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he turned to me and he said:
"My daughter
is a rape survivor.

30:53.351 --> 30:57.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when she went to the system,
they didn't
treat her right."

30:57.923 --> 31:03.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we arrived at the
Senate, he stopped
and said: "Can I shake your
hand?

31:03.328 --> 31:05.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you so much for fighting
for my daughter."

31:05.130 --> 31:11.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm John
Yang in Washington.

31:11.303 --> 31:23.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: a major
agreement on ocean
conservation today.

31:23.348 --> 31:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dozens of nations created the
world's largest
marine reserve at the bottom of
the globe.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

31:30.555 --> 31:35.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Twenty-four
countries and
the European Union agreed today
to set aside

31:35.227 --> 31:38.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
600,000 square miles of ocean.

31:38.463 --> 31:42.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The newly protected zone is in
the Ross Sea,
which borders Antarctica.

31:42.601 --> 31:45.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most commercial fishing will be
banned in
this area, though researchers
will be allowed

31:45.904 --> 31:47.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to take limited samples.

31:47.706 --> 31:53.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The protection will take effect
starting December
2017, and will continue for 35
years.

31:53.445 --> 31:57.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on what this means, and
how it came
to be, I am joined by Karen
Sack.

31:57.949 --> 32:01.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's managing director of
conservation organization
Ocean Unite.

32:01.353 --> 32:02.521 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

32:02.554 --> 32:03.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN SACK, Managing Director,
Ocean Unite:
Thank you.

32:03.789 --> 32:05.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Nice to be
reporting on
some good news.

32:05.724 --> 32:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN SACK: It's fantastic to be
talking about
some really unprecedented news
for the ocean.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tell us, how
important is
this?

32:12.497 --> 32:18.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN SACK: This is truly a
seminal event
in international ocean
governance.

32:18.370 --> 32:23.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's the first time that
countries around
the world are coming together to
agree not

32:23.809 --> 32:29.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take fish or other species
out of the water,
but to leave them in, and to
leave them in

32:29.314 --> 32:31.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for a good long period of time.

32:31.183 --> 32:35.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, what
species in particular
are we protecting here with this
preserve?

32:35.420 --> 32:42.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN SACK: Well, the Ross Sea
is known as
a Garden of Eden in the ocean,
or sometimes

32:42.360 --> 32:44.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
called the ocean's Serengeti.

32:44.396 --> 32:52.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are 16,000 species that
live there,
from seals, whales, penguins, of
course.

32:52.037 --> 32:58.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Commercially, the species that
is caught there
is called Antarctic toothfish.

32:59.010 --> 33:01.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's known in the United States
as Chilean
sea bass.

33:01.613 --> 33:06.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, when we
think of these
preserves normally being done,
we think of

33:06.117 --> 33:10.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them being done by individual
nations within
their own territorial waters.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But this one is quite different.

33:12.524 --> 33:14.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAREN SACK: It is.

33:14.326 --> 33:20.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's because the Antarctic and
the Southern
Ocean around it is governed
collectively by

33:20.265 --> 33:23.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a group of countries under the
Antarctic Treaty
System.

33:23.902 --> 33:28.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the system actually came
into being at
the height of the Cold War,
where countries

33:28.106 --> 33:32.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
set aside their differences and
agreed to
govern the Antarctic as a place
for peace

33:32.544 --> 33:33.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and science.

33:33.912 --> 33:39.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That governance is now extending
into the
ocean.

33:39.117 --> 33:45.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And about five years ago, the
countries agreed
to begin to work together to
establish marine

33:45.290 --> 33:47.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reserves and protected areas.

33:47.559 --> 33:51.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Ross Sea is the first
big one that
they have managed to agree to.

33:51.162 --> 33:56.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I understand
also that Russia
needed to be cajoled to putting
its name on

33:56.635 --> 33:58.436 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this agreement.

33:58.470 --> 34:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN SACK: Well, part of the
difficulty and
why this is such a significant
agreement is

34:02.574 --> 34:08.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that decisions are made by
consensus, which
means that all of those 24
countries and the

34:08.480 --> 34:13.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
European Union have to agree to
a decision
going forward.

34:14.019 --> 34:23.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For several years, Russia and
China were not
supportive of establishing a
protective area.

34:23.094 --> 34:27.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was very high-level
engagement from
the Obama administration.

34:27.332 --> 34:34.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We believe that President Obama
actually discussed
this issue with President Xi in
China, and

34:35.006 --> 34:37.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that shifted the Chinese
position.

34:37.208 --> 34:45.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Over the last 18 months,
Secretary Kerry has
really worked incredibly hard
with his counterparts

34:45.850 --> 34:51.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in New Zealand and around the
world, working
with Minister Lavrov of Russia.

34:51.356 --> 34:56.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was just earlier this
week, we understand,
that we managed to reach
agreement on this

34:56.828 --> 34:57.796 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

34:57.829 --> 34:58.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It was that
touch and go?

34:58.830 --> 35:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAREN SACK: It was that close.

35:01.900 --> 35:07.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Several of us were planning for
maybe another
year of negotiation.

35:07.405 --> 35:13.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is just fantastic that we
managed to
get to this point, and is a
testament to the

35:13.912 --> 35:21.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ability of multinationalism to
work, even
when there are incredibly
difficult issues

35:21.219 --> 35:22.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the global agenda at the
moment.

35:22.954 --> 35:27.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We said at the
beginning
this is a 35-year period of time
where this

35:27.459 --> 35:28.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
space will be protected.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that long enough?

35:30.228 --> 35:32.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAREN SACK: Well, no, it isn't.

35:32.297 --> 35:37.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, this was one of
the big sticking
points for Russia, how long the
area should

35:37.669 --> 35:39.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be protected for.

35:39.504 --> 35:46.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The science shows that
marine-protected areas
should be in place without a
limit in their

35:46.411 --> 35:48.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
duration.

35:48.279 --> 35:53.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We believe, though, that these
35 years will
provide the marine life in the
Antarctic and

35:53.952 --> 36:03.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Ross Sea area the ability to
show us all
just how amazing it is and will
convince everyone

36:03.595 --> 36:10.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sitting at that table 35 years
from now to
continue protecting this
unbelievably iconic

36:10.535 --> 36:12.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and special ocean area.

36:12.370 --> 36:16.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Karen Sack, thank
you so much for being here.

36:16.374 --> 36:22.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAREN SACK: Thank you.

36:22.580 --> 36:29.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back to politics
now, and to
the analysis of Shields and
Brooks.

36:29.220 --> 36:33.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

36:33.258 --> 36:34.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

36:34.259 --> 36:35.226 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mark.

36:35.260 --> 36:36.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:36.261 --> 36:37.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Hi.

36:37.262 --> 36:39.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hello, Judy, Judy.

36:39.097 --> 36:42.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we
have a moment
of levity before we talk about
something very

36:42.467 --> 36:44.235 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
serious, David.

36:44.269 --> 36:48.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is this announcement
from the FBI
that they have a new batch of
e-mails from

36:48.640 --> 36:53.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a laptop that belongs to Hillary
Clinton's
aide Huma Abedin.

36:53.244 --> 36:56.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eleven days before the election,
what -- how
much does this matter?

36:56.081 --> 36:58.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: I think it
matters.

36:58.283 --> 37:02.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not going to know the
substance of it
by Election Day.

37:02.087 --> 37:04.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whatever e-mails were in there,
whatever they
are investigating, it's hard to
believe we

37:04.823 --> 37:06.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will have some actual knowledge.

37:06.958 --> 37:10.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it brings Anthony Weiner
back to the surface.

37:10.095 --> 37:14.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the argument that
Republicans could make
with a lot of justices, welcome
to the next

37:14.933 --> 37:17.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
four years of your life.

37:17.135 --> 37:20.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having a reign of Clinton
without a little
-- a lot of scandal bubble
around side is

37:20.638 --> 37:23.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just not something we have any
historical
precedent for.

37:23.708 --> 37:25.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so this is just another.

37:25.677 --> 37:29.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And who you hang around with and
who you associate
with is going to come back to
haunt you.

37:29.814 --> 37:36.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's almost perverse, in the
way we have
come down to sex scandals and
the way this

37:36.421 --> 37:40.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election has descended into the
realm of Kardashianville.

37:40.892 --> 37:42.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But we're here.

37:42.627 --> 37:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I do think a lot of
others will think,
there is just scandal on both
sides.

37:46.297 --> 37:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just all sleazy.

37:48.099 --> 37:51.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's not the substance of
what we have
learned today, but that's the
atmospherics

37:51.302 --> 37:52.637 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it.

37:52.670 --> 37:54.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What effect do
you think this
is going to have?

37:54.472 --> 37:56.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, first of
all, it will
have a long-term effect on
politics, I think.

37:56.908 --> 38:03.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is Martin Lomasney, who
was the legendary
ward boss in Boston around the
turn of the

38:03.314 --> 38:09.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
century and the early 20th
century, said,
never write it when you can say
it, never

38:09.187 --> 38:14.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say it when you can wink it, and
never wink
it when you can nod it.

38:14.092 --> 38:19.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the compulsion to put
all this stuff
in e-mails, I think, comes back,
is going

38:19.531 --> 38:21.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to haunt future campaigns.

38:21.733 --> 38:27.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As far as right now, for the
Clinton campaign,
it's a real kick in the teeth.

38:27.772 --> 38:29.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That had been resolved.

38:29.607 --> 38:34.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They'd gotten a clean bill of
health, or at
least a nonprosecution, by the
FBI director

38:35.013 --> 38:37.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
90 days ago.

38:37.749 --> 38:43.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to have this revisited,
especially featuring
Anthony Weiner, who doesn't have
to be introduced

38:43.254 --> 38:46.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the nation, is a political
problem.

38:46.891 --> 38:54.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it does just remind of the
-- and the
problems and the difficulties
that have surrounded

38:54.299 --> 38:56.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the family for years.

38:56.234 --> 38:59.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, it's a
problem, even not
knowing what's in these e-mails,
which we

38:59.804 --> 39:00.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
won't know?

39:00.805 --> 39:01.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

39:01.806 --> 39:03.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are two levels of media
information.

39:03.541 --> 39:08.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is those of us who cover
politics a
lot and probably most people
watching our

39:08.346 --> 39:12.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shows, whether it's on this
channel or it's
any of the cables or the many
networks.

39:12.617 --> 39:13.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have decided.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this gets to "Entertainment
Tonight."

39:15.987 --> 39:18.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It gets to every comedian.

39:18.723 --> 39:20.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It gets to The National
Enquirer.

39:20.858 --> 39:25.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It gets out to the group of
people who are,
as they say, not
information-rich voters,

39:25.563 --> 39:27.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who are the ones who are
actually deciding.

39:27.398 --> 39:31.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of their decision is,
I really don't
like this Donald Trump guy, but
-- so I have

39:31.636 --> 39:32.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
got to vote for Clinton.

39:32.637 --> 39:34.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But then they get this news
about Clinton.

39:34.505 --> 39:39.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're just going on their
moral instincts,
and it begins to look like
parity of sleaze.

39:39.377 --> 39:43.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mark, do you
think there
are enough people out there who
either -- they

39:43.114 --> 39:48.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are either undecided or they're
just persuadable
at this point, or maybe they
will stay home

39:48.586 --> 39:50.255 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and not vote?

39:50.288 --> 39:54.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think, Judy,
that there is
no question going into this week
that the

39:55.026 --> 40:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats were very much in the
saddle and
very dominant, when, in Utah,
which, in the

40:02.367 --> 40:06.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last 10 elections, seven times
has been the
most Republican state in the
union, in the

40:06.571 --> 40:10.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last week of October, the
Republicans feel
it's necessary because of the
third-party

40:10.675 --> 40:15.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
challenge of Evan McMullin, that
they're worried
about it being a three-way race
and perhaps

40:15.780 --> 40:17.115 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
losing Utah.

40:17.148 --> 40:19.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They send the vice presidential
candidate
all the way out there.

40:19.851 --> 40:21.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That tells you their playing
defense.

40:21.719 --> 40:27.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And right next door in Arizona,
which has
voted Republican 15 of the last
16 times,

40:27.525 --> 40:33.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michelle Obama is introduced by
Barry Goldwater's
granddaughter to a crowd of
7,000, after Bernie

40:33.631 --> 40:36.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sanders got -- Democrats are on
the offensive.

40:36.534 --> 40:38.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then you get three things
that happened.

40:38.469 --> 40:42.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You get the Obamacare raise and
hikes.

40:42.907 --> 40:51.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You get the WikiLeaks and the
peek, the unpleasant
peek, unflattering peek anyway,
into the financial

40:51.416 --> 40:56.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doings of the Clinton Foundation
and Bill
-- and former President Bill
Clinton, and

40:56.120 --> 40:57.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
then you get this.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what does it hurt?

40:58.956 --> 41:04.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It hurts, Judy, the women
voters, especially
Republican women voters, who, as
David said,

41:04.729 --> 41:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had turned off of Donald Trump,
were trending
toward Hillary Clinton.

41:08.399 --> 41:13.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think younger idealistic
Sanders voters,
it may just stop them for a
second, as they

41:13.971 --> 41:18.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were turning to going to vote
for Hillary
Clinton, whether, gee, do I
really want to

41:18.876 --> 41:19.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do it?

41:19.877 --> 41:21.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that's the problem
for Democrats.

41:21.379 --> 41:23.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And maybe we
should put in perspective.

41:23.047 --> 41:27.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Say, Hillary Clinton -- say, she
has an 87
percent chance of winning now.

41:27.618 --> 41:31.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think this may knock her down
a point or
two, and so that may reduce her
chance of

41:31.823 --> 41:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
winning to like 80 or 75.

41:34.359 --> 41:38.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I don't think it's like a
game-changer
by any stretch of the
imagination.

41:38.262 --> 41:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a point or two, if we were
driving home
and somebody said you have a 30
percent chance

41:43.101 --> 41:46.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of getting into a wreck on the
way home, we
would think, that's pretty bad
odds.

41:46.604 --> 41:49.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that -- it does slightly
increase the
odds.

41:49.407 --> 41:52.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're saying
it's not
going to turn the race around,
but you're

41:52.477 --> 41:54.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
saying it will have an effect?

41:54.212 --> 41:58.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I just think
everything was
heading in her direction, and I
think that

41:58.916 --> 42:00.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it maybe freezes that.

42:00.551 --> 42:05.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I agree it's not at this point a
game-changer,
by any means, Judy.

42:05.289 --> 42:10.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if Hillary Clinton won by
five points
or more, virtually every
Republican I know

42:10.428 --> 42:12.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
believes she will carry the
Senate.

42:12.196 --> 42:17.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if, all of a sudden, it's a
three-point,
a two-point victory, it means a
couple of

42:17.034 --> 42:18.770 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

42:18.803 --> 42:22.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It means that the Senate is very
much up for
grabs and it also means that
Donald Trump

42:22.707 --> 42:28.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be a factor in a very
bloody civil war
in the Republican Party after
this election.

42:28.813 --> 42:30.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean
whichever way this
goes?

42:30.648 --> 42:35.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think, if
he suffered
a real defeat, a stinging defeat
of 10 points,

42:35.453 --> 42:41.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or in that area, I think he
would no longer
be a major figure, because
nobody in the Republican

42:41.893 --> 42:45.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Party basically wants him to be
there.

42:45.096 --> 42:47.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he would have a claim if he
loses by two.

42:47.965 --> 42:51.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, this has
clearly been a
bad week for Hillary Clinton.

42:51.702 --> 42:53.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David, I do want to bring up
something Mark
mentioned.

42:53.638 --> 42:59.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, you hear not just
Democratic
women, independent women,
Republican women

42:59.243 --> 43:03.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
saying -- and we had a
discussion about it
here on the "NewsHour" last
night -- who are

43:03.648 --> 43:08.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really troubled by what they
have seen in
the course of this election.

43:08.519 --> 43:12.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How long-lasting a problem is
that for the
Republican Party?

43:12.323 --> 43:14.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think it's
mostly Trump-related.

43:14.192 --> 43:16.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, there's always been a
gender gap.

43:16.861 --> 43:21.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But among -- it's -- for
Republicans politically,
it's sort of been manageable.

43:21.999 --> 43:24.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it depends on how they
project themselves.

43:24.135 --> 43:25.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In some years, they have done
better.

43:25.870 --> 43:29.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Donald Trump is so egregious
in the way
he talks about women, the way he
allegedly

43:29.974 --> 43:34.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
treated women, I do think it's
more his own
thing.

43:34.312 --> 43:38.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And where you're seeing it
especially is among
college-educated women.

43:38.316 --> 43:43.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The college-educated in general
in all our
previous elections have voted
Republican,

43:43.488 --> 43:45.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but now they're going massively
for the Democrats.

43:45.690 --> 43:50.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And college-educated women, in
particular,
like 65 percent for Hillary
Clinton.

43:50.228 --> 43:54.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're turned off of Trump
both on issues,
but especially on these moral
positions, or

43:54.632 --> 43:57.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the moral behavior that he's
undertaken.

43:57.802 --> 44:00.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I still think it's mostly a
Trump phenomenon.

44:00.671 --> 44:05.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you get -- next time you get
a Mitt Romney
or somebody who's just morally
clean, I don't

44:05.243 --> 44:06.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
think it lingers.

44:06.611 --> 44:08.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think that
that's the
way it will work, Mark?

44:08.045 --> 44:09.080 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, I don't.

44:09.113 --> 44:12.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think Mitt Romney is the
conspicuous exception.

44:12.617 --> 44:17.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mitt Romney was the man who
stood up to Donald
Trump early, hard, never
wavered.

44:17.622 --> 44:25.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have seen this
back-and-forth, Jason Chaffetz
from Utah saying, I have a
15-year-old daughter.

44:25.363 --> 44:27.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no way I could support
somebody like
him.

44:27.865 --> 44:29.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now he's voting for him.

44:29.433 --> 44:31.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You get this back-and-forth.

44:31.202 --> 44:34.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just think, Judy, I mean, the
Democrats
have tried the war against women
in the past.

44:34.739 --> 44:37.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It didn't really have that much
traction.

44:37.575 --> 44:38.576 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
But I...

44:38.609 --> 44:39.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Accusing the
Republicans of...

44:39.577 --> 44:40.845 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:40.878 --> 44:42.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Accusing the
Republicans waging
a war on women.

44:42.747 --> 44:49.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But when you have got a
candidate who basically
authors his own how-to tape on
how to assault

44:49.587 --> 44:57.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women for your own needs and
wants, you know,
without impunity -- with
impunity, and you

44:57.628 --> 45:03.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't have that many people
stand up and say
he's unacceptable, I think it's
a stain on

45:03.301 --> 45:05.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Republicans,.

45:05.102 --> 45:08.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it could very well
be a problem,
not of the dimensions of '64 and
the Civil

45:08.673 --> 45:09.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Rights Act.

45:09.941 --> 45:12.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think he's not -- it's not
going to
go away in a hurry.

45:12.743 --> 45:14.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

45:14.512 --> 45:17.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I agree it's a stain, but
I would make
a generational point here that
there is a

45:17.782 --> 45:21.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big difference, especially on
some of these
issues and basically on ethnic
diversity issues,

45:21.252 --> 45:26.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on a bunch of issues and
sensibility issues,
between older Republicans and
younger Republicans.

45:26.924 --> 45:32.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what Newt Gingrich said to
Megyn Kelly,
a total insensitivity to sexual
assault, that

45:32.163 --> 45:37.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is just -- I don't meet too many
Republican
candidates under 45 who are that
numb and

45:37.468 --> 45:39.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that blind.

45:39.103 --> 45:42.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do think there's different
attitudes
growing up in the Republican
Party.

45:42.506 --> 45:46.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm struck especially among
social conservatives,
among evangelical voters.

45:46.944 --> 45:51.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very hard to find an
evangelical person
under 45, let alone on some of
the Christian

45:51.582 --> 45:54.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
college campuses, who has any
tolerance for
Donald Trump.

45:54.318 --> 45:57.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, they're there, but
there is such
a stark generational divide.

45:57.755 --> 46:02.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, the rising group of
Republican voters
are different tonally on a lot
of these issues.

46:02.526 --> 46:05.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, it's not just
evangelical
women, who we have talked about.

46:05.396 --> 46:07.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't disagree
with David.

46:07.598 --> 46:13.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I think what's been
unleashed by this
experience, by Donald Trump and
by the women

46:13.671 --> 46:20.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who have come forth, I think
there's been
a spontaneous, almost public and
private confessional

46:20.745 --> 46:26.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of women everywhere at every
generation about
revealing to their own
daughters, to their

46:26.651 --> 46:27.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spouses, to their family...

46:27.652 --> 46:28.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: About their own
experience.

46:28.853 --> 46:30.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: ... about their
own experience.

46:30.521 --> 46:33.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think this is out there
now.

46:33.324 --> 46:34.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, it really is.

46:34.892 --> 46:38.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think this is an -- it's
an issue that
was very private.

46:38.729 --> 46:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think now it's very much a
part of the
national agenda.

46:42.566 --> 46:48.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there is not going
to be an unwillingness
to address this in the future,
like there

46:48.639 --> 46:50.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has been in the past.

46:50.474 --> 46:52.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in that
connection, I will
just mention briefly, Marcia
Coyle, who is

46:52.376 --> 46:53.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our Supreme Court reporter...

46:53.377 --> 46:55.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Exactly.

46:55.279 --> 46:57.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She's a regular
on the "NewsHour"
-- reported this week for "The
National Law

46:57.748 --> 47:02.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Journal," a woman who just
posted on her Facebook
page, personally, something that
happened

47:02.653 --> 47:05.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between her and Supreme Court
Justice Clarence
Thomas.

47:05.489 --> 47:06.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is now in the news.

47:06.957 --> 47:10.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it goes to your point Mark
about, it's
coming forward.

47:10.695 --> 47:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just a little bit of time before
-- I don't
want to leave everybody on a
political note

47:15.599 --> 47:20.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tonight, because there is
something going
on in this country that has to
do with baseball,

47:20.871 --> 47:24.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it's the World Series, and
it's the Cubs
and the Indians.

47:24.275 --> 47:28.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are not two teams that
have spent a
lot of time in the finals of the
Series.

47:28.312 --> 47:31.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I want to -- you two love
baseball.

47:31.115 --> 47:32.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, what do you see happening?

47:32.750 --> 47:35.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what do you -- you have got
to tell me
who's going to win.

47:35.619 --> 47:37.121 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mark.

47:37.154 --> 47:40.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I can't tell
you who will
win, but I will say this, Judy.

47:40.057 --> 47:44.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everybody knows it's -- Teddy
Roosevelt was
president the last time the Cubs
won the World

47:44.228 --> 47:46.030 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Series, 1908.

47:46.063 --> 47:47.064 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

47:47.098 --> 47:49.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so the Cubs are kind of
America's darling.

47:49.800 --> 47:53.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, everybody's rooting for
them, and
they're trendy.

47:54.004 --> 47:55.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're kind of chic.

47:55.973 --> 47:59.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Cleveland, Cleveland is
special.

47:59.110 --> 48:03.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Cleveland was the second
franchise and the
first in the American League to
desegregate

48:03.948 --> 48:05.783 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 1948.

48:05.816 --> 48:09.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, beyond that, it's taken a
lot of -- they
are the real underdogs in this
race -- I mean,

48:09.954 --> 48:11.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this competition.

48:11.055 --> 48:14.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I have a very soft spot for
Cleveland.

48:14.525 --> 48:19.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Jim Bouton, who wrote "Ball
Four," of
the Yankees said once that, if
you're going

48:19.096 --> 48:23.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have a flying accident, you
want it on
the way into Cleveland, not the
way out.

48:23.601 --> 48:26.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, that's a terrible thing
to say about
a city.

48:26.070 --> 48:27.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I'm rooting for them.

48:27.271 --> 48:29.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I'm appalled that
you can't
pick a side.

48:29.507 --> 48:31.008 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:31.041 --> 48:32.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think we're
morally obligated
to pick the Chicago Cubs.

48:32.810 --> 48:34.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have wondering who to vote
for.

48:34.745 --> 48:39.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm writing in Kyle Schwarber,
Indiana University,
proud native, great hitter,
coming out of

48:39.383 --> 48:40.351 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the bench.

48:40.384 --> 48:41.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Great story.

48:41.385 --> 48:42.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Owner of the
team.

48:42.386 --> 48:43.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: No.

48:43.387 --> 48:44.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: No, no.

48:44.388 --> 48:45.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's a -- the designated hitter.

48:45.389 --> 48:46.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Oh, oh, OK.

48:46.390 --> 48:48.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:48.125 --> 48:48.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Six hundred days,
he hadn't
faced face Major League
pitching, and gets

48:48.926 --> 48:49.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the hit and...

48:49.927 --> 48:50.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Schwarber for
president.

48:50.928 --> 48:53.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

48:53.297 --> 48:54.265 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

48:54.298 --> 48:58.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We heard it here
first.

48:58.869 --> 49:00.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: OK.

49:00.971 --> 49:06.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
David Brooks,
thank you.

49:06.610 --> 49:09.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, finally, a "NewsHour"
Essay.

49:09.547 --> 49:14.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we just discussed, this
presidential campaign
has raised a lot of questions
about how women

49:14.451 --> 49:16.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are seen and discussed.

49:16.720 --> 49:21.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the end of the first debate,
Hillary Clinton
mentioned former Miss Universe
Alicia Machado.

49:21.659 --> 49:27.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During her reign, pageant owner
Donald Trump
repeatedly commented on Machado
for gaining

49:28.032 --> 49:32.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weight, just one example of size
consciousness
in our society.

49:32.436 --> 49:37.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, fashion guru Tim Gunn
shares a challenge
for American designers.

49:37.608 --> 49:41.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM GUNN, Fashion Consultant: To
begin, I
love the American fashion
industry, but it

49:41.645 --> 49:43.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has a lot of problems.

49:43.614 --> 49:48.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Consider this: When the actress
Leslie Jones
couldn't find anything to wear
to her "Ghostbusters"

49:48.552 --> 49:53.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
premiere, she had to call out on
social media
to find someone to dress her.

49:53.357 --> 49:55.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How did that happen?

49:55.159 --> 50:00.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Would it surprise you to know
that the average
American woman now wears between
a size 16

50:00.464 --> 50:02.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and a size 18?

50:02.199 --> 50:07.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is what the industry calls a
plus-size
woman, a term that I would like
to erase.

50:07.605 --> 50:12.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are more than 80 million
of these women
in America, and for the past
three years,

50:12.343 --> 50:17.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have increased their
spending on clothes
faster than their straight-size
counterparts.

50:17.815 --> 50:20.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But many designers refuse to
make clothes
for them.

50:20.784 --> 50:23.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They pretend that they don't
even exist.

50:23.087 --> 50:28.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have spoken to many people in
the industry
about this, and the overwhelming
response

50:28.359 --> 50:31.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is, "I'm not interested in her."

50:31.629 --> 50:37.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say the plus-size woman is
complicated,
different and difficult, and
that no two size

50:37.334 --> 50:39.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
16s are alike.

50:39.737 --> 50:41.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's decode that.

50:41.405 --> 50:45.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fashion industry works from
standards
established decades ago.

50:45.442 --> 50:47.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Habits are hard to break.

50:47.278 --> 50:52.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the runway, to magazines,
pictures of
how clothes are supposed to
look, how women

50:52.149 --> 50:54.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are supposed to look, are set.

50:54.785 --> 50:57.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it all revolves around
thinness.

50:57.454 --> 51:03.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For decades, models have trotted
down the
runway with bodies that are
completely unattainable

51:03.761 --> 51:05.095 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for most women.

51:05.129 --> 51:09.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet we have been conditioned to
think that
that's what looks good.

51:09.133 --> 51:13.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no reason why larger
women can't
look just as fabulous as all
other women.

51:13.837 --> 51:17.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a design issue, and not a
customer issue.

51:17.074 --> 51:22.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The key is the following: It's
the harmonious
balance of silhouette,
proportion and fit.

51:22.546 --> 51:28.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, most plus-size
designs make the
body look larger, with box
pleats and shoulder

51:28.052 --> 51:29.019 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pads.

51:29.053 --> 51:31.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trust that I'm not trivializing
the task.

51:31.422 --> 51:33.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's challenging.

51:33.190 --> 51:36.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Designs need to be reconceived,
not just sized
up.

51:36.427 --> 51:40.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And done right, our clothing can
create an
optical illusion that helps us
look taller

51:40.664 --> 51:41.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and slimmer.

51:41.966 --> 51:46.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, done wrong, we look worse
than if we
were, well, naked.

51:46.704 --> 51:50.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus-size women deserve fashion,
and they
deserve choices.

51:50.040 --> 51:54.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not looking for solutions
from high-end
designers, because it's a given
that they

51:54.812 --> 51:59.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't want their precious brands
tarnished
by the likes of a size 16.

51:59.917 --> 52:03.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This message is for more
accessible designers.

52:03.287 --> 52:05.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's time to step up to the
plate.

52:05.889 --> 52:09.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Furthermore, why aren't
retailers demanding
that this be done?

52:09.560 --> 52:13.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The retailers have plenty of
leverage, as
in: Marc Jacobs, if you want to
continue to

52:13.931 --> 52:18.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own the current space that you
have in our
store, then we also need
clothing for our

52:18.469 --> 52:24.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
larger market; 14-plus is now
the shape of
women in this nation, and
designers need to

52:24.508 --> 52:27.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wrap their creative minds around
that.

52:27.211 --> 52:32.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I profoundly believe that women
of every size
can look great.

52:32.483 --> 52:37.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in this time of
inclusiveness, why should
80 million women be
marginalized?

52:37.588 --> 52:40.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Designers, make it work.

52:40.057 --> 52:42.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
