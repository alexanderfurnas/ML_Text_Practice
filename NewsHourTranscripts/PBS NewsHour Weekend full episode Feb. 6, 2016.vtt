GOING ON HERE.

03:34.414 --> 03:35.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

03:44.057 --> 03:45.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHILE SHE IS STILL CERTAINLY

03:45.992 --> 03:46.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT THIS

03:46.760 --> 03:49.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
