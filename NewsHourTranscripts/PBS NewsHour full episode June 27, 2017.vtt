JUDY WOODRUFF: Good
evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Facing revolt from inside the
party, Republican senators delay

00:13.200 --> 00:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a vote on health care reform,
as President Trump calls them
to the White House to keep

00:18.000 --> 00:20.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the pressure on.

00:20.033 --> 00:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then: Tensions rise,
as the White House
warns Syria's president
against another chemical

00:24.633 --> 00:26.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
weapons attack.

00:26.733 --> 00:30.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in the second part of my
interview with Warren Buffett,
one of the world's wealthiest

00:30.866 --> 00:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
men talks about philanthropy,
what keeps him going, and tax
breaks under the Republican

00:36.766 --> 00:38.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health care bill.

00:38.866 --> 00:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT, Chairman and
CEO, Berkshire Hathaway: You
could entitle this, you know,

00:40.933 --> 00:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Relief for the Rich Act or
something, because it -- I have
got friends where it would have

00:44.866 --> 00:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saved them as much as
-- it gets into the
$10-million-and-up figure.

00:52.133 --> 00:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus,
the Nashville sound.
Acclaimed singer-songwriter
Jason Isbell finds

00:59.833 --> 01:02.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
music in life's
tough conversations.

01:02.466 --> 01:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON ISBELL, Musician: A lot
of people in my family told
me growing up that cities were

01:09.533 --> 01:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrible places and anything
outside of our little circle
was scary and dangerous and

01:13.300 --> 01:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
frightening. And so I wrote that
song based on that kind of fear.

01:16.133 --> 01:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:23.700 --> 01:26.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:26.500 --> 01:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The United
States Senate will not try to
repeal and replace the Obamacare

01:36.666 --> 01:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health care law until after
the Fourth of July recess.

01:41.033 --> 01:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican leaders gave up today
on getting a vote this week.

01:43.966 --> 01:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our Lisa Desjardins
begins our coverage.

01:46.133 --> 01:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader: Legislation of
this complexity almost always

01:52.266 --> 01:54.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
takes longer than
anyone else would hope.

01:54.300 --> 01:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell was
forced to accept the reality:

01:58.000 --> 02:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Not enough Republicans are
ready to vote for the Republican
health care bill as it stands

02:02.533 --> 02:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now. At least five Republicans
said they opposed even beginning
debate. That's three more than

02:08.966 --> 02:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
McConnell can afford to lose.
So now it's time to revise.

02:12.633 --> 02:17.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL:
Consequently, we will
not be on the bill this
week, but we're still

02:17.066 --> 02:22.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
working toward getting
at least 50 people in
a comfortable place.

02:24.033 --> 02:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: McConnell's
math got tougher after Monday's
report from the Congressional

02:26.333 --> 02:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Budget Office. It found the
current Senate bill would
leave 22 million more uninsured

02:33.366 --> 02:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by 2026 than under Obamacare.
That includes 15 million who
would lose Medicaid coverage.

02:38.933 --> 02:43.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The average premium
would decrease in 2020,
but plans would offer
less coverage and have

02:45.933 --> 02:49.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
substantially higher
out-of-pocket costs.
Supporters of the bill
highlighted the CBO

02:51.000 --> 02:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conclusion that it would save
$321 billion off deficits.

02:55.166 --> 02:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Alabama Republican Richard
Shelby reminded his colleagues
that they all campaigned on

02:59.866 --> 03:02.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
repealing Obamacare.

03:02.033 --> 03:06.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. RICHARD SHELBY
(R), Alabama: We need
some votes. And a lot of
people ran on repealing

03:07.600 --> 03:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it. Now we're going to see
if they keep their word.

03:09.733 --> 03:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), Maine:
It is difficult for me to see
how any tinkering is going to

03:15.800 --> 03:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
satisfy my fundamental
and deep concerns about
the impact of the bill.

03:23.266 --> 03:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The bill
hit problems from two
sides. Moderate Maine
Senator Susan Collins

03:25.900 --> 03:30.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
said she is a no because
of a one-year defunding
to Planned Parenthood
funding and also because

03:32.966 --> 03:36.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of sharp cuts for those
on Medicaid. Medicaid
is also a concern for
Dean Heller, whose state

03:37.566 --> 03:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Nevada has expanded Medicaid
under the Affordable Care Act.

03:40.533 --> 03:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, several GOP
conservatives, Rand Paul, Mike
Lee, Ron Johnson and Ted Cruz,

03:47.500 --> 03:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said the bill doesn't repeal
enough and spends too much on
subsidies. Party leaders mounted

03:53.333 --> 03:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a full-court press to convert
those no votes. Vice President
Pence met with senators at

03:56.300 --> 04:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Capitol, and President Trump
held a private meeting with
Rand Paul at the White House.

04:01.266 --> 04:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats, meanwhile, remained
uniformly opposed to the bill.
They hosted a protest on the

04:08.233 --> 04:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
steps of the Capitol, holding
pictures of constituents
they said would lose coverage

04:10.900 --> 04:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
under the Republican plan.

04:12.766 --> 04:14.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senate Minority
Leader Chuck Schumer:

04:14.766 --> 04:17.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER
(D-NY), Minority Leader:
If our Republican
colleagues stick to this

04:17.133 --> 04:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
base bill, which so
hurts working families,
which so benefits
multimillionaires, and them

04:24.966 --> 04:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
almost alone, we're going to
fight the bill tooth and nail.
And we have a darn good chance

04:32.166 --> 04:34.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of defeating it.

04:34.100 --> 04:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Late today,
buses ferried Republican
senators to the White House for

04:37.500 --> 04:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a sit-down with President
Trump to talk things over.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: So, we're going
to talk and we're going to

04:42.900 --> 04:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see what we can do.
We're getting very close.
And if we don't get it
done, it's just going

04:46.333 --> 04:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be something that we're
not going to like, and that's
OK, and I understand that very

04:51.800 --> 04:53.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then later
this evening, Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell spoke

04:56.566 --> 05:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to reporters and defended
the prospects of getting
a bill passed eventually.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Lisa, who has been
running around on the hill
all day long, joins us now.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, Lisa, where do things stand?

05:07.266 --> 05:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, they
do want to take a vote after
the July 4 recess, so a lot of

05:09.933 --> 05:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
folks are saying, oh,
they will come up with
a bill in the meantime
while they're on recess.

05:13.366 --> 05:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, Judy. I talked to
Senate Republican Conference
chairman John Thune.
He said they want the

05:20.333 --> 05:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
revise their bill and get out
a new draft this week, which
is ambitious. They want to

05:23.000 --> 05:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
do it before senators go home.

05:25.033 --> 05:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, in your
assessment from talking to all
these senators, what is the

05:28.100 --> 05:30.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
main problem here? Why
is this failing so far?

05:30.633 --> 05:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There
were a couple problems.
One, the CBO score, Judy.
The bill was already

05:34.233 --> 05:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in trouble, as we had
reported on Monday. But
when that score came out...

05:37.466 --> 05:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is the
Congressional Budget Office.

05:39.566 --> 05:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: The
Congressional Budget
Office score, which
showed that 22 million

05:41.733 --> 05:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Americans lose insurance.

05:43.800 --> 05:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And not just that. It was
the depth of that 50-page CBO
report that Republicans really

05:48.166 --> 05:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got thinking about. Senator
Bob Corker told me he read it
at 4:00 a.m. this morning and

05:52.133 --> 05:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asked for CBO to come up and
give a briefing today. They did.

05:55.700 --> 05:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, Judy, Republicans weren't
ready. Some of them hadn't
even read this bill, like Chuck

05:59.600 --> 06:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Grassley, who I saw today
carrying the bill. He told
me he hadn't read it yet.

06:03.433 --> 06:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, given all
that, what is it going to
take to get them to 50 votes?

06:07.566 --> 06:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Leadership
obviously isn't sure yet, but
they have more money to spend.

06:11.133 --> 06:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They think we will see
more money on opioids,
for example, which is
something that is popular,

06:15.066 --> 06:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health savings accounts,
something that most Republicans
agree on, but no one can answer

06:19.966 --> 06:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that question, Judy, yet.

06:22.066 --> 06:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do they decrease the Medicaid
cuts somehow? Unclear. Do they
shift how they're reforming

06:28.366 --> 06:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Affordable Care Act?
Unclear. It's very a difficult,
tricky, formula. They say they

06:32.100 --> 06:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can do it, but they obviously
haven't figured out how yet.

06:34.466 --> 06:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And finally
the role of President
Trump in all this?

06:37.366 --> 06:39.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are question marks
about that. Some say they were
worried that this meeting today

06:41.333 --> 06:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would be one where he makes
Republicans feel better, but
actually doesn't do anything to

06:45.500 --> 06:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change this bill. There are
others, like John McCain, who
said this kind of a situation

06:49.700 --> 06:53.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
requires presidential
leadership. Clearly,
the president is
showing that tonight.

06:53.633 --> 06:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins
has been reporting and will go
back to reporting after this.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you, Lisa.

07:00.633 --> 07:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will talk to
Republican Senator Rand
Paul about his concerns
with health care legislation

07:05.800 --> 07:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right after the news summary.

07:07.866 --> 07:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the day's other news: A
new cyber-attack caused major
disruptions across Europe and

07:12.500 --> 07:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elsewhere. Ukraine was hit
hard, where banks and the power
grid were breached. Government

07:19.466 --> 07:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
computers also locked up, as
so-called ransomware scrambled
data until payment is made. Also

07:25.300 --> 07:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
affected, Russia's state-run
oil company was hit, along
with Danish shipping giant A.P.

07:29.800 --> 07:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Moller-Maersk and U.S.
drugmaker Merck and Company.

07:34.600 --> 07:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Last month, a similar attack
spread to 150 countries.

07:38.166 --> 07:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. State Department has
declared China to be among
the worst countries tolerating

07:45.066 --> 07:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
human traffickers in the world.
The annual listing today put
China in the same category

07:50.366 --> 07:53.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as North Korea,
Syria and Zimbabwe.

07:53.600 --> 07:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
said China's record is marred
in part by its continued

07:59.333 --> 08:01.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
support of North Korea.

08:01.466 --> 08:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: The North Korean regime
receives hundreds of millions

08:03.566 --> 08:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of dollars per year from the
fruits of forced labor. China
was downgraded to tier-3 status

08:10.533 --> 08:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this year's report, in
part, because it has not taken
serious steps to end its own

08:15.666 --> 08:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
complicity in trafficking,
including forced laborers from
North Korea that are located

08:19.333 --> 08:21.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in China.

08:21.400 --> 08:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even before the
announcement, China's Foreign
Ministry rejected the findings.

08:26.966 --> 08:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brazil's President Michel
Temer is now facing corruption
charges. The country's attorney

08:32.800 --> 08:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
general formally accused him
last night of taking a bribe
of $152,000. Temer called the

08:38.466 --> 08:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charge fiction. The lower

Rousseff was impeached.

European antitrust officials
fined Google a record $2.7
billion today. In Brussels,

08:56.633 --> 09:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the E.U. competition
commissioner said the
Internet giant highlights
its own businesses

09:02.200 --> 09:04.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and buries search
results for rivals.

09:04.266 --> 09:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGRETHE VESTAGER, European
Commission: What Google has done
is illegal under E.U. antitrust

09:11.266 --> 09:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rules. It has denied
other companies the chance
to compete under merits
and to innovate, and,

09:18.766 --> 09:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most importantly, it has denied
European consumers the benefits
of competition, genuine choice

09:25.900 --> 09:28.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and innovation.

09:28.433 --> 09:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Google
has 90 days to change its
ways in Europe or face
additional penalties.

09:33.933 --> 09:38.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Back in this country,
three current and former
Chicago policemen were
indicted today in the

09:40.166 --> 09:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killing of a black teenager,
Laquan McDonald, by a white
officer. They are accused of a

09:45.333 --> 09:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cover-up. McDonald was shot 16
times by Officer Jason Van Dyke
in October 2014. He was charged

09:51.133 --> 09:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with murder a year later,
after video of the incident was
released. Van Dyke is in jail

09:56.733 --> 09:58.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
awaiting trial.

09:58.700 --> 10:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, selling
gained momentum after the
health care bill's delay raised

10:03.366 --> 10:08.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
new questions about
the Trump agenda. The
Dow Jones industrial
average lost nearly 99

10:10.400 --> 10:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
points to close at 21310.
The Nasdaq fell 100 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 slipped 19.

10:16.566 --> 10:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Republican Senator Rand Paul
on divisions over the health

10:23.500 --> 10:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care bill; the White House warns
Syria about chemical weapons
preparations; Warren Buffett

10:29.366 --> 10:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opens up about his
personal taxes and
philanthropy; and much more.

10:45.133 --> 10:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And back to the battle
over health care.

10:47.233 --> 10:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke a short time ago with
Republican Senator Rand Paul of
Kentucky, one of the key votes

10:54.100 --> 10:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that could determine the
future of the GOP effort to
repeal and replace Obamacare.

10:58.833 --> 11:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Paul, thank you
very much for joining us.

11:00.866 --> 11:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there any doubt in your
mind, if the vote had gone ahead
today or tomorrow, that the

11:04.866 --> 11:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bill would have failed?

11:06.933 --> 11:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL (R), Kentucky:
Yes, I don't think there were
enough votes, but I think

11:08.566 --> 11:11.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
there also just hasn't
been enough time to
have a full discussion.

11:11.800 --> 11:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We just got the bill last week.
We just got the CBO score on
Monday. So, there needs to

11:16.133 --> 11:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be a little bit more time
to absorb this, then also to
discuss, what are the changes

11:21.133 --> 11:23.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that the leadership
might be open to in
order to get it to pass?

11:23.800 --> 11:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking
of that, you met with President
Trump at the White House

11:27.833 --> 11:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earlier today. You tweeted
after your meeting, you
said: "@realDonaldTrump
is open to making

11:34.700 --> 11:39.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the bill better. Is
the Senate leadership?"

11:39.133 --> 11:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My question to you is -- and
the president is meeting now
with the rest of the Republicans

11:42.966 --> 11:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Senate -- what
changes does the president
want to see in this bill?

11:47.400 --> 11:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: Well, I don't
think it's so much him lobbing
us for changes. It's us asking

11:53.533 --> 11:55.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
him for help in getting
the changes done.

11:55.600 --> 11:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he has the bully
pulpit. He has a great deal of
influence with the Republican

11:59.333 --> 12:04.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Party on both the House
and the Senate side. And
I think the bill right
now to the conservative

12:06.266 --> 12:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
point of view doesn't have
enough repeal. In fact, it
looks like we're keeping a lot

12:09.800 --> 12:11.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Obamacare.

12:11.733 --> 12:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even the architect of Obamacare,
Jonathan Gruber, said, hey,
hey, guys, don't worry,

12:15.466 --> 12:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're actually keeping
Obamacare. So we actually
think that there needs
to be more repeal.

12:20.166 --> 12:22.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's the message
I took to him.

12:22.200 --> 12:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I also took a specific list
that we're sending to Senate
leadership, and we're saying,

12:26.666 --> 12:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if you address these items,
there's a possibility we could
vote for this bill, but it's got

12:31.133 --> 12:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to look more like repeal and
less like we're keeping it.

12:33.900 --> 12:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as you
know, what the president has
said about the House version

12:38.033 --> 12:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the bill, which many people
said was tougher than the Senate
bill, he said it was mean,

12:44.166 --> 12:46.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and he wanted a bill
with more heart.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So where are we on this?

12:48.866 --> 12:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: You
know, I think there are
various ways you can
characterize both Republican

12:52.733 --> 12:55.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Democrat proposals.

12:55.500 --> 12:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama, I think,
wanted what was best for the
country, but I think it didn't

12:59.633 --> 13:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work well. I think we
have the death spiral,
and I think particularly
premiums in the individual

13:04.166 --> 13:06.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
market are going
through the roof.

13:06.166 --> 13:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think Republicans want what's
best for the country also,
but I think they're not fixing

13:09.900 --> 13:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the death spiral of Obamacare.
They're going to subsidize it
with a lot of taxpayer money.

13:14.566 --> 13:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, characterizing something as
mean or generous I think goes
to people's motives, and I think

13:19.400 --> 13:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is sort of why we have such
an angry country now. We think
that people have ill motives.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think Republicans want
people to have health insurance.
We want people to be healthy.

13:28.633 --> 13:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So do Democrats. We just believe
in a different type of economic
system or different types

13:33.000 --> 13:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of limitations of government
or more expansive government
and how we can do it.

13:37.666 --> 13:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the
things, Senator Paul, you have
talked about wanting to do

13:40.600 --> 13:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away with is the Obamacare
tax on individuals making
over $250,000 a year.

13:47.733 --> 13:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That would be money -- that's
the money that's been used to
pay for many of the subsidies

13:52.633 --> 13:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for people with lower income.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEN. RAND PAUL: Right.

13:55.866 --> 13:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's a transfer,
taking money away from those
who have more to give it to

14:01.100 --> 14:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people who have less,
but that troubles you?

14:03.033 --> 14:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: No, we
already do quite a bit of
that, and it's call Medicaid.

14:07.033 --> 14:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem or the
fundamental flaw of
Obamacare was that they put
regulations on the insurance,

14:14.133 --> 14:17.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about 12 regulations,
which increased the
cost of the insurance.
And so President Obama

14:17.433 --> 14:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted to help poor,
working-class people, but
he actually hurts them
by making the insurance

14:21.733 --> 14:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
too expensive to want to buy.

14:23.766 --> 14:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had someone at the house
just recently was doing some
work, and he said: "Oh, my son

14:27.900 --> 14:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't have insurance,
he's paying the penalty
because it's too expensive."

14:32.033 --> 14:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, President Obama said,
oh, we want to make insurance
perfect for people, but he added

14:36.600 --> 14:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all these regulatory mandates,
made it too expensive. Young,
healthy people didn't buy

14:41.133 --> 14:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it, and the people remaining in
the insurance pool were sicker
and sicker. That's the adverse

14:45.766 --> 14:49.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
selection and the death
spiral of Obamacare.

14:49.100 --> 14:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so really we do need
to discuss the intricacies
of what worked and what
didn't work in Obamacare.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the better way to
do this is to let individuals
have the freedom to choose

14:58.466 --> 15:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what kind of insurance is
best for them. The government
doesn't always know best. Maybe

15:02.833 --> 15:04.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the individual should
be allowed to choose.

15:04.866 --> 15:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, I
hear you, and I have read of
some of the other comments you

15:08.200 --> 15:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have made lately. You have
some very strong views on this.
As you just said, you would

15:11.933 --> 15:16.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
like to do away with
this tax on individuals
earning -- high earners.

15:18.833 --> 15:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have talked about doing
away with the mandates in
Obamacare. You talk about health

15:22.533 --> 15:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
savings accounts. But other
members of the Senate, including
other Republicans, have

15:26.333 --> 15:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very different ideas. They are
worried about these Medicaid
cuts in this legislation.

15:31.333 --> 15:32.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEN. RAND PAUL: Right.

15:32.566 --> 15:34.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where
is the common ground?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: Well,
that's what we're going
to see, if we can find it.

15:36.566 --> 15:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the things that horrifies
me is that we would be giving
taxpayer money to very,

15:40.500 --> 15:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very wealthy corporations.
The insurance companies
make about $15 billion a
year. They have doubled

15:47.400 --> 15:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their profit margin under
Obamacare. And so now we're
going to take a lot of this and

15:50.633 --> 15:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
call it a stabilization fund,
but really it's a bailout
of insurance companies.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just think that's wrong.
I just can't see why ordinary,
average taxpayers would

15:59.500 --> 16:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be giving money to very,
very wealthy corporations.
An analogous situation
would be this: We all

16:06.566 --> 16:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
complain that new cars cost
too much. Why don't we have
a new car stabilization fund

16:10.300 --> 16:13.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and give $130 billion
to car companies?

16:13.133 --> 16:15.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: We could do that
in any industry, but it's not
really good economics. What it

16:17.766 --> 16:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, is, you're simply
transferring money from
the ordinary, average
taxpayers to very wealthy

16:23.166 --> 16:25.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
corporations.

16:25.266 --> 16:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Senator,
my understanding is that plan
was put in there to take care

16:28.566 --> 16:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of some of those people at
the lower income level because
of these changes in Medicaid.

16:35.533 --> 16:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I still don't see where the
middle ground is between you,
other Republicans, and certainly

16:39.266 --> 16:41.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Democrats.

16:41.266 --> 16:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: Actually, the
money in the stabilization
fund, $130 billion which I call

16:44.600 --> 16:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an insurance bailout, is put
in to try to cure the adverse
selection that Obamacare

16:51.466 --> 16:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
created by making insurance
too expensive. Healthy
people didn't buy it.

16:54.633 --> 16:59.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They tried to fix this
by forcing young people
to buy it through an
individual mandate. Even

16:59.000 --> 17:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that didn't work. So the way
the Republicans fix it is they
don't actually fix it. They

17:03.366 --> 17:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
subsidize it. So we have
to fix what went wrong with
Obamacare, not just recapitulate

17:09.866 --> 17:11.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
something that's broken.

17:11.866 --> 17:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What you're
saying makes it sound like
you're still uncertain this is

17:13.666 --> 17:15.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to pass.

17:15.633 --> 17:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: Yes. I'm
uncertain whether it's going to
be enough of a repeal bill for

17:18.666 --> 17:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conservatives. And we need
to adhere to our promise. We
promised people we'd repeal it.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talked about all the problems
of Obamacare. We shouldn't
leave half of it in place and

17:27.933 --> 17:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
expect things to be better.

17:29.400 --> 17:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Rand
Paul of Kentucky, we thank you.

17:33.900 --> 17:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: Thank you.

17:41.333 --> 17:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House
today reinforced a stark warning
to the government of Syria's

17:48.400 --> 17:52.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Bashar al-Assad against
using chemical weapons.

17:52.466 --> 17:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last night, the administration
announced that the U.S. had
detected -- quote -- "potential

17:56.800 --> 18:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
preparations" by the regime to
use the banned weapons, again.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner reports.

18:04.566 --> 18:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: President
Assad was seen today touring
a Russian air base just hours

18:11.533 --> 18:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after last night's White House
statement. It warned that
the Syrian regime would pay

18:16.133 --> 18:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a heavy price for launching
another chemical attack.

18:18.633 --> 18:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the Pentagon elaborated,
saying the U.S. has seen active
preparations for chemical

18:25.033 --> 18:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weapons use at Shayrat air base
near Homs in Western Syria.

18:31.733 --> 18:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nancy Youssef is senior
national security
correspondent at BuzzFeed.

18:33.800 --> 18:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY YOUSSEF, BuzzFeed: The
Pentagon told us that they saw
evidence of planes that were

18:37.500 --> 18:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
used to conduct aerial chemical
attacks in the past being moved
around on Shayrat airfield.

18:44.366 --> 18:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also heard reports of chatter
happening on the ground in
preparation for a possible

18:50.033 --> 18:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
imminent attack. The number
of people who knew was so
limited, and the message from

18:52.966 --> 18:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the White House was so ominous,
that it created a real confusion
that we are just not used

18:57.633 --> 18:59.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

18:59.700 --> 19:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: A chemical
weapons attack was launched
from that same base in April,

19:02.400 --> 19:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killing dozens of men, women
and children. The Syrians denied
responsibility. But President

19:11.100 --> 19:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump ordered the U.S.
military to fire 59 Tomahawk
missiles at the base.

19:18.066 --> 19:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump's response was a sharp
departure from his predecessor's
caution about intervening

19:24.733 --> 19:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Syria's civil war. In 2012,
President Obama famously warned
that the use of chemical weapons

19:30.500 --> 19:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
use would constitute a red line,
triggering U.S. action. But
instead, after a deadly August,

19:37.933 --> 19:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2013, attack on a Damascus
suburb, then-Secretary
of State John Kerry
and Russia worked on a

19:43.933 --> 19:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
deal with Assad that
aimed to rid his regime
of chemical weapons.

19:48.833 --> 19:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump officials say
that strategy clearly
didn't work, and it's
taking a tougher approach

19:53.800 --> 19:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to Syria and its key backers.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley
spoke at a House hearing today.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NIKKI HALEY, U.S. Ambassador to
the United Nations: I believe
that the goal is, at this

20:02.866 --> 20:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
point, not just to send Assad
a message, but to send Russia
and Iran a message that, if

20:09.633 --> 20:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this happens again, we
are putting you on notice.

20:13.666 --> 20:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: A spokesman
for Russian President Vladimir
Putin retorted: "Such threats to

20:20.000 --> 20:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syria's legitimate
leaders are unacceptable."

20:22.466 --> 20:27.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Iran's foreign minister
said: "Another dangerous
U.S. escalation in Syria
on fake pretext will

20:29.533 --> 20:33.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
only serve ISIS," the
Islamic State group.

20:33.100 --> 20:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since the April 3 U.S.
missile barrage, the
U.S. has had several
confrontations with pro-Assad

20:40.066 --> 20:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forces, shooting down a Syrian
air force jet and an armed
Iranian-made drone. In response,

20:46.233 --> 20:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia has threatened to
target coalition aircraft in
certain parts of Syria. Today,

20:52.666 --> 20:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's unclear what the
broader U.S. strategy is.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NANCY YOUSSEF: Is the
U.S. committed to a
form of deterrence
against the regime for

20:59.333 --> 21:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possible chemical attacks?
And, if so, in what form? Going
forward, will the U.S. put

21:03.866 --> 21:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out a statement every
time it suspects chemical
weapons attacks? Is
that what we are to take

21:07.933 --> 21:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
away from yesterday's statement?

21:09.433 --> 21:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Margaret Warner.

21:15.933 --> 21:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the second
part of my conversation with
billionaire Warren Buffett.

21:26.766 --> 21:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke with him last week in
Omaha last week at the Nebraska
Furniture Mart, the largest

21:31.533 --> 21:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
furniture store in America. It
is just one small piece of a
huge portfolio of investments

21:38.400 --> 21:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
owned by his company, Berkshire
Hathaway, but one that Buffett
takes particular pride

21:42.733 --> 21:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in as part of his legacy.

21:44.766 --> 21:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both the Senate and House
Republican health care reform
bills would roll back taxes that

21:50.833 --> 21:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are part of Obamacare. Buffett
has taken issue with that.

21:54.666 --> 21:57.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's where my
conversation picks up.

21:57.766 --> 22:02.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One of the things the
Republicans are looking
at, as you know very
well, is doing away with

22:02.566 --> 22:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the so-called Obamacare
surcharge on people
earning a higher income.

22:07.366 --> 22:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT, Chairman and
CEO, Berkshire Hathaway: Yes.

22:09.433 --> 22:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Republicans
are looking at taking that
away, or doing away with that,

22:12.466 --> 22:14.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which would mean a tax
cut, you have said...

22:14.366 --> 22:15.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Yes.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ...
for people like you.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Yes.

22:18.466 --> 22:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I brought my tax return
along for the last year. I
filed this on April 15. And if

22:22.333 --> 22:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Republican -- well, if the
bill that passed the House with
217 votes had been in effect

22:29.333 --> 22:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this year, I would have saved --
I can give you the exact figure.
I would have saved $679,999,

22:36.866 --> 22:39.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or over 17 percent
of my tax bill.

22:39.700 --> 22:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's nothing ambiguous about
that. I will be given a 17
percent tax cut. And the people

22:44.133 --> 22:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's directed at are couples
with $250,000 or more of
income. You could entitle this,

22:51.200 --> 22:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, Relief for the Rich
Act or something, because it
-- I have got friends where it

22:54.533 --> 22:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would have saved them as
much as -- it gets into the
$10-million-and-up figure.

23:02.100 --> 23:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I might point out --
it might be an interesting
question. I think
members of the Senate and

23:04.166 --> 23:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the House get $174,000 a year.
But most of them have -- if
you look at the disclosures,

23:07.766 --> 23:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have substantial other
income. If they get to higher
than $250,000, as a married

23:12.733 --> 23:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
couple, or $200,000 as a
single person, they have given
themselves a big, big tax cut,

23:18.900 --> 23:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if they -- if they
voted for this.

23:20.966 --> 23:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking
of taxes, let's just use that
as an entry point to talk about

23:25.300 --> 23:27.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

23:27.333 --> 23:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You shared some of your
tax return with us for
2016. Thank you very much.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Yes.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But before I
ask you about that, how wealthy
are you? I mean, I'm reading

23:34.666 --> 23:36.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that you're $77 billion?

23:36.766 --> 23:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Ninety-nine
percent of my net worth is
in Berkshire Hathaway stock.

23:42.900 --> 23:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Every share of that stock has
been pledged to philanthropy.

23:45.033 --> 23:49.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I'm a trustee for
that stock. So, it will
go to society. And then
the rest will as well.

23:51.533 --> 23:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you add up what's in
my name, if we go down to my
safe deposit box, we will find

23:56.666 --> 23:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some stock certificates
that are worth that much.

23:59.833 --> 24:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as I -- you know, I have
written, they have no utility
to me. They can't do anything

24:04.033 --> 24:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make me happier. I'm already
happy. I would be happy with,
you know -- certainly with

24:11.033 --> 24:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$100,000 a year, I could be
very happy. And they can't buy
anything for me that I want.

24:15.666 --> 24:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
If they did, I would buy it.

24:18.200 --> 24:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they do have utility
to others, so I have got
this system to essentially
try and translate

24:23.733 --> 24:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that into vaccines and education
and all of that sort of thing.

24:26.033 --> 24:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The reason I
bring that up, Warren Buffett,
is that that's your wealth,

24:32.933 --> 24:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your worth. And yet, on
your tax return, you earned
$19 million-something.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Right.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Nineteen-and-a-half
million last year.

24:40.033 --> 24:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your effective tax rate was
16.3 percent, which -- we
looked it up. This is what an

24:46.833 --> 24:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
average couple, a married
couple, no children, taking the
standard deduction would pay on

24:53.166 --> 24:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an income of $136,000. In other
words, a couple who earned --
you earn 143 times more than

24:58.433 --> 25:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they do, but your tax rate
is the same as theirs.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Yes, I
have pointed that out
in past, in the past.

25:04.100 --> 25:07.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's even worse than
you say, Judy, because
you're looking at what
that couple would pay

25:07.666 --> 25:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in federal income tax. But they
are also paying payroll taxes,
in overwhelming cases. And

25:14.600 --> 25:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my cleaning lady has a 15
percent tax, you know, just from
Social -- just from the Social

25:19.833 --> 25:24.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Security that she and
her employer pay, but
it's kind of incredible.

25:26.500 --> 25:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now they want to cut it.
No, they want to cut it for
me. I mean, you know, they -- I

25:28.733 --> 25:31.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
don't look like somebody
that deserves a cut.

25:31.433 --> 25:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, they --
the Republicans are talking
about lowering taxes...

25:35.900 --> 25:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Absolutely.

25:36.900 --> 25:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... on the...

25:38.933 --> 25:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: They want to
cut my tax 17 percent. They saw
those figures and were shocked

25:40.266 --> 25:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that I was paying
that much, apparently.

25:41.533 --> 25:43.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

25:43.566 --> 25:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, among other
things, they're talking about
doing away with some of the

25:46.000 --> 25:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
- - some of the deductions,
charitable deductions,
maybe, mortgage deductions,
maybe, state and

25:51.233 --> 25:54.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
local tax -- taxes
paid as deductions.

25:54.033 --> 25:56.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you have a thought
about all those?

25:56.033 --> 25:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, you can't
really talk about specifics
without looking at the whole

25:59.733 --> 26:02.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
thing.

26:02.266 --> 26:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if they're talking about
making it revenue-neutral,
you know, I think if
they're going to make

26:04.266 --> 26:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it revenue-neutral, it ought to
be -- it ought to be something
other than revenue-neutral

26:10.566 --> 26:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the guys like me. Our
rates should go up, allowing
others to go down somewhat.

26:14.466 --> 26:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there ought to be
minimum taxes for people that
make $10 million a year, and a

26:18.833 --> 26:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different one at a million
a year, but certainly
at $10 million a year.

26:21.533 --> 26:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They also, as you
know, want to tackle business
corporate tax rates. They're

26:26.266 --> 26:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about the current
corporate rate, lowering it
from 35 percent to 15 percent?

26:30.900 --> 26:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president has talked about
-- I guess Speaker Paul Ryan
this week said 20 percent.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What would that
mean for you if...

26:39.733 --> 26:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it
would mean, for Berkshire,
in all probability,
that we would pay less

26:45.700 --> 26:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in U.S. federal income taxes.

26:47.733 --> 26:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But until you see the final
thing, you can't tell. Berkshire
Hathaway is the second largest

26:51.600 --> 26:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
corporation on the Fortune 500
this year. I don't know any
case where our competitiveness

26:58.633 --> 27:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is being hurt by the federal
income tax rate on corporations.

27:02.033 --> 27:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Estate
taxes, a thought about that?

27:04.633 --> 27:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Oh, estate
taxes, I mean, I -- you hear
people call it the death tax.

27:08.200 --> 27:12.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are going to be
two-and-a-half million
people die in the
United States this year.

27:12.300 --> 27:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How many estate tax returns
are there going to be? Probably
about 5,000. And the interesting

27:19.333 --> 27:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
thing is, if I talked to
somebody about welfare
mothers or something
like that, they say how

27:21.433 --> 27:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debilitating it is to have these
food stamps, and it takes away
their incentive to do anything.

27:25.266 --> 27:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If a kid comes out of the right
womb in this country, they
have got food stamps for their

27:29.033 --> 27:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rest of their life. They just
call them stocks and bonds. And
their welfare officer is their

27:32.800 --> 27:35.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
trust officer.

27:35.333 --> 27:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think I -- I
think having a significant
estate tax that starts
at a fair-sized level

27:41.300 --> 27:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is -- if you're going to have
to raise $3.5 trillion, I
think that's a good source of

27:46.066 --> 27:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
revenue, and that I -- it
shouldn't apply to, you know,
99 percent of the people.

27:49.866 --> 27:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have been
very -- I mean, very open about
your own taxes, and people

27:54.500 --> 27:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have taken a look at that,
and they have also looked at
Berkshire Hathaway. It has been

27:57.333 --> 28:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pointed out that Berkshire
Hathaway does take
advantage of the legal
ability to defer taxes,

28:05.533 --> 28:06.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and...

28:06.766 --> 28:08.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Sure.
Well, that's because...

28:08.900 --> 28:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I saw a
number, something like $75
billion in deferred taxes?

28:10.966 --> 28:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, that's we
haven't cashed things that we
-- just like you, if you have

28:12.466 --> 28:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
got a stock that's gone up a
whole lot, until you sell it.

28:14.966 --> 28:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's just the law. And
we're going to - - we don't
have any of the Cayman Islands

28:21.966 --> 28:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or anything like that stuff.
But we follow the law, and we
got a million shareholders.

28:25.333 --> 28:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think they probably
expect us to do that. That
doesn't mean I don't think the

28:28.466 --> 28:30.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
law shouldn't be
changed in some way.

28:30.533 --> 28:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I follow the law in terms
of my personal return. I do
not send an extra $5 million

28:33.766 --> 28:35.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the Treasury.

28:35.800 --> 28:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Your
philanthropy, we have
talked about it a little
bit. It's legendary.

28:42.033 --> 28:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You and Bill Gates, Melinda
Gates have come together and,
I guess, broken all records

28:47.366 --> 28:49.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
imaginable for giving.

28:49.433 --> 28:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, it's being
pointed out that you're also
making -- you first made that

28:54.800 --> 28:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pledge, what, 10, 11 years ago.

28:55.866 --> 28:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: 2006, yes.

28:56.966 --> 28:58.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: 2006.

28:58.933 --> 29:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're now making so much
more even than you did then.
People are saying, well, wait a

29:04.333 --> 29:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
minute, you know, is he
going to be giving more away?

29:05.266 --> 29:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you think about that?

29:07.300 --> 29:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I have
got it set up so that, if I make
more, I do give more, because

29:09.733 --> 29:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm giving on a schedule,
and that schedule ends
10 years after I die.

29:16.633 --> 29:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's all -- so I'm not
setting up -- and, actually,
they can't use it for endowments

29:19.333 --> 29:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or anything. It has to be
spent within 10 years, really,
after my estate's closed, but

29:25.066 --> 29:27.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
call it after I die.

29:27.133 --> 29:30.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
much influence do you
think you had on other,
others with wealth, with

29:32.333 --> 29:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
means to give, to be as
generous as you have been?

29:35.766 --> 29:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, a lot of
people come back to me on that.

29:38.300 --> 29:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And basically, I said, you
know, if you're extremely rich,
and you have got children,

29:45.200 --> 29:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my theory was, you give them
enough so they can do anything,
but not enough so they can

29:47.200 --> 29:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do nothing. And I have had more
people come back to it, so,
apparently I was smarter in

29:51.033 --> 29:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1980, whatever it was, than
I am now. But that seemed
to have some influence.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you
comfortable today with
what you're giving? I
mean, does it feel...

29:57.866 --> 29:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: It's
exactly what I wanted to do.

29:59.866 --> 30:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does it
feel like the right thing
to be doing right now?

30:01.900 --> 30:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: It's the right
thing. It's the right thing,
because it's going -- it's

30:03.933 --> 30:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to people who believe,
as the Gates, for example, that
every life is of equal value.

30:07.933 --> 30:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the truth is, I have
got a lot of wealth, little
pieces of paper, says Berkshire

30:14.900 --> 30:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hathaway on it. They are claim
checks on all kinds of goods
and services in the world.

30:19.933 --> 30:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can buy anything. I can
buy 400-foot yachts and have 20
homes and all that. I wouldn't

30:23.166 --> 30:25.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be happier. But they
can buy anything.

30:25.666 --> 30:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And once they move into the
hands of people who are working
like hell on getting something

30:32.666 --> 30:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accomplished in areas I want
them to -- you know, I love
the idea of getting them used,

30:38.033 --> 30:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that's what they're doing.

30:40.100 --> 30:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You said it
wouldn't make you happy to have
a hundred, 200 homes and yachts

30:43.033 --> 30:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and so forth. What does
make Warren Buffett happy?

30:45.800 --> 30:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: I just have
a lot of fun doing my job.

30:48.366 --> 30:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I can do anything
I want, basically,
as long as it doesn't
involve athletic ability,

30:52.766 --> 30:53.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or something like that.

30:53.766 --> 30:55.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:55.833 --> 30:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: But if it's
something I can buy, I can
buy anything, basically.

30:57.833 --> 31:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been on 400-foot yachts,
and I have - - I have lived
the life a little bit with

31:04.233 --> 31:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people that have 10 homes and
everything. And I live in the
same house I bought in 1958.

31:06.433 --> 31:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if I could spend $100
million on a house that would
make me a lot happier, I would

31:11.200 --> 31:13.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do it.

31:13.166 --> 31:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for me, that's the happiest
House In the world. And it's
because it's got memories,

31:16.533 --> 31:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and people come back, and all
that sort of thing. So, I am
doing what I love to do with

31:20.766 --> 31:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people I love. And it doesn't
get any better than that, Judy.

31:23.366 --> 31:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And -- but I should be. I mean,
why in the hell -- why should
I be working at 86 at something

31:28.233 --> 31:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that I don't like or
with people I don't like?

31:30.566 --> 31:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I see
you're drinking a Cherry Coke.

31:33.166 --> 31:34.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Right.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
do you stay healthy?

31:36.433 --> 31:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I
think I stay healthy partly
by being happy, actually.

31:39.800 --> 31:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that -- I think it
really helps if your stomach
isn't grinding all the time,

31:44.300 --> 31:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you're doing things you
don't want to do, or you're
working with people that -- you

31:47.466 --> 31:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know? So I have gone very
light on the diet advice.

31:52.233 --> 31:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I eat like a normal 6-year-old,
but if you look at the
mortality statistics, I mean,

31:56.933 --> 31:58.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
6-year-olds don't
die very often.

31:58.200 --> 31:59.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:59.700 --> 32:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: I mean, the
diet's doing something for them.

32:00.966 --> 32:02.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
much sleep do you get?

32:02.733 --> 32:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: I get quite a
bit of sleep. I like to sleep.

32:04.800 --> 32:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I will usually sleep eight
hours a night, and that --
no, I have no desire to get to

32:12.000 --> 32:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
work at 4:00 in the morning.

32:14.033 --> 32:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So many people
look at you and they think,
oh, my goodness, this man,

32:16.633 --> 32:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's accomplished so much.
He's been so successful.
He's 86 years old, and
he's still going strong.

32:22.300 --> 32:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: I love it.

32:23.766 --> 32:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what do
they -- so, what's the secret?

32:25.266 --> 32:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: The secret is
to find what you love to do.

32:27.300 --> 32:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I tell the students
look for the job that you would
take if you didn't need a job.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it's that simple. And
I was lucky enough to find
it very early in life. And

32:35.633 --> 32:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then the second thing is to
have people around you that make
feel good every day, and make

32:41.833 --> 32:43.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you a better person than
you otherwise would be.

32:43.866 --> 32:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have more fun doing this than
anything else I can think of
in the world, and I have seen

32:46.133 --> 32:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot of other things you
could do in the world.

32:47.733 --> 32:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Warren
Buffett, thank you very much.

32:50.433 --> 32:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you, Judy.

32:51.966 --> 32:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he does
come across as a happy man.

32:54.533 --> 32:59.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, for the record,
Warren Buffett is CEO
of Berkshire Hathaway,
which owns BNSF Railway.

33:00.966 --> 33:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is one of the funders
of the "NewsHour."

33:07.966 --> 33:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now: a sexual assault
scandal that has rocked
Baylor University, and
ignited questions over

33:19.866 --> 33:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether the university ignored
the complaints of victims.

33:23.333 --> 33:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The school confirmed in
recent days that it is
also the subject of an
ongoing NCAA investigation.

33:29.733 --> 33:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the focus of our weekly
segment Making the Grade.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has the latest.

33:35.300 --> 33:39.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: More than a
dozen women have filed
lawsuits against Baylor,
the country's largest

33:39.300 --> 33:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Baptist university, saying the
school ignored or mishandled
their claims going back several

33:44.866 --> 33:47.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

33:47.466 --> 33:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The school's Board of
Regents has acknowledged
that 19 football players
were accused of criminal,

33:53.466 --> 33:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sexual or physical assault
at one point. One of
them, Tevin Elliot, was
convicted and sentenced

33:57.033 --> 33:59.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to 20 years in prison.

33:59.133 --> 34:04.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The head football coach,
Art Briles, was fired,
and the president, Ken
Starr, quit after he

34:04.633 --> 34:06.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was demoted.

34:06.566 --> 34:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paula Lavigne is a reporter with
ESPN. She's been investigating
the Baylor case. She's

34:12.400 --> 34:15.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the co-author of a
forthcoming book on the
case called "Violated:
Exposing Rape at Baylor

34:17.200 --> 34:20.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
University Amid College
Football's Sexual
Assault Crisis."

34:20.766 --> 34:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Paula, thanks for joining us.

34:23.200 --> 34:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remind us of these allegations.
They have been around for
a while, but remind us of

34:27.333 --> 34:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the scope, how far back
they go, the nature of
the allegations at Baylor.

34:31.700 --> 34:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAULA LAVIGNE, ESPN: Right.

34:33.766 --> 34:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The allegations go back for more
than a decade. And right now,
in court cases alone, you have

34:40.566 --> 34:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
15 different women filing Title
IX federal lawsuits against
the school in cases involving

34:47.200 --> 34:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
domestic violence, sexual
assault. But depending
on who you talk to,
there are hundreds of

34:52.233 --> 34:54.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cases.

34:54.266 --> 34:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And many of them involve
football players, but actually
this is a much larger problem.

35:00.866 --> 35:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They involve regular students,
fraternity members, I mean,
you name it. It is a huge

35:07.100 --> 35:09.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
problem at the school.

35:09.166 --> 35:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And another sort of interesting
layer to it is the fact that
we're talking about the world's

35:13.266 --> 35:18.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
largest Baptist university, and
a lot of these women are saying,
you know, part of the problem

35:20.266 --> 35:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here was that the school's
Christian values really didn't
foster an environment in which

35:26.100 --> 35:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women were encouraged to come
forward or in which their
cases were taken seriously.

35:32.566 --> 35:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you compound that on top of
the issues with the prominent
football team. And, yes,

35:37.800 --> 35:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the scope, it just touches all
aspects of higher education
and of sexual assault on

35:43.566 --> 35:45.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
campus.

35:45.600 --> 35:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And what can the
NCAA do, and what can it
not do in cases like this?

35:49.200 --> 35:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAULA LAVIGNE: So, that's
a really good question.

35:51.633 --> 35:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, a lot of people -- if
you're not familiar with college
sports, it's important to know

35:55.066 --> 36:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the NCAA is sort of the
arbiter over amateur college
athletics, right? And their

36:02.566 --> 36:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
purpose is to ensure fair
competition and amateurism, OK?

36:09.600 --> 36:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, a lot of people think They
want the NCAA to do something
about this. Right? There is

36:15.966 --> 36:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a huge call for the NCAA to
address this. But the issue is
that sexual violence, addressing

36:22.066 --> 36:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sexual violence, addressing
just criminal behavior on
behalf of athletes really isn't

36:26.400 --> 36:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something that's technically
in the NCAA's wheelhouse.

36:30.433 --> 36:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so for people to
understand what their
scope is, it's important
to understand a particular

36:37.433 --> 36:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
term that the NCAA uses, which
is extra benefit, OK? So, and
when we think of extra benefits,

36:44.200 --> 36:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we often think of student
athletes being given
money from boosters or
fancy cars or allowed

36:50.566 --> 36:53.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to basically skate
on a class, OK?

36:53.766 --> 36:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The NCAA, in this case, for
people who are - - people on
the outside who are familiar

37:00.800 --> 37:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the investigation and
people who are familiar with
the NCAA are saying, well, one

37:05.900 --> 37:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way they can get enforcement in
a case involving sexual violence
is to say, OK, are these student

37:10.733 --> 37:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
athletes getting an extra
benefit if they are being
diverted from judicial affairs,

37:17.333 --> 37:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they are getting a pass
from local law enforcement,
if coaches or administrators

37:24.400 --> 37:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are hooking them up with legal
counsel and maybe they're not
paying what a regular student

37:29.766 --> 37:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would be paying for that legal
counsel, all of those sort of
things that a regular student

37:33.000 --> 37:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
might -- who gets in trouble
might not be afforded?

37:35.700 --> 37:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're saying, well, maybe the
NCAA can consider that an extra
benefit, and, in that sense,

37:42.300 --> 37:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it could come in and take
some enforcement action.

37:44.266 --> 37:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The issue of sexual
assaults on - - sexual violence
on college campuses has

37:48.933 --> 37:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gotten a lot of discussion.
Talk about sort of the bigger
issue here of how colleges even

37:56.866 --> 37:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outside athletic programs
are dealing with that.

37:59.833 --> 38:02.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAULA LAVIGNE: It
is a huge issue.

38:02.666 --> 38:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's been statistics that
have been backed up by numerous
research that one in five women

38:09.666 --> 38:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will experience some sort of
type of sexual assault while in
college. And right now, there's

38:16.266 --> 38:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than 200 colleges
and universities under
investigation by the U.S.
Department of Education.

38:21.466 --> 38:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, this is a perfect
time to be talking about
this, because a lot of
the federal government's

38:26.533 --> 38:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
civil rights enforcement
actions are being called into
question right now, and one of

38:32.400 --> 38:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those deals specifically with
Title IX. And Title IX is the
venue that the U.S. Department

38:37.366 --> 38:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Education uses to enforce
how colleges and universities
are addressing sexual violence.

38:44.433 --> 38:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are a lot of people
who are saying schools shouldn't
be involved in what is seen

38:51.400 --> 38:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a criminal matter. And a
problem with that is that that's
pretty short-sighted, because

38:57.300 --> 39:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Title IX does a lot more in
addressing sexual violence than
just determining whether or

39:02.933 --> 39:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not an alleged perpetrator
is responsible for the act.

39:06.500 --> 39:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, one of the -- you
mentioned the case involving
Tevin Elliot. The young woman in

39:13.566 --> 39:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that case, I mean, she saw her
accused perpetrator convicted.
However, her biggest issue was

39:20.466 --> 39:25.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the fact that she didn't
get the counseling
services, she didn't get
the academic services.

39:25.233 --> 39:29.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She was basically sort
of left floundering. She
ends up dropping out,
doesn't get to pursue

39:29.266 --> 39:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her dream, and has to
transfer and move back home.

39:32.666 --> 39:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is nothing in the criminal
justice system that provides
that sort of remedy, and that's

39:37.533 --> 39:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what Title IX is designed to
do. It's designed to force these
schools to address specific

39:44.600 --> 39:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases of sexual violence, in
part to determine whether or
not someone is responsible.

39:49.733 --> 39:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the bigger part, the part
that's often ignored, is by
providing a safe campus for

39:55.066 --> 39:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these women to attend, providing
counseling services if they
need them, providing academic

39:58.333 --> 40:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
services to make them
whole again, so they can
continue their education.

40:02.133 --> 40:07.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Paula Lavigne
of ESPN, thanks so
much for joining us.

40:07.133 --> 40:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAULA LAVIGNE: You're welcome.

40:14.133 --> 40:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: China is leading
a trillion-dollar project to
build a 21st century version of

40:20.633 --> 40:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Silk Road, the trading
routes that once spanned Asia.
And it is on that original Silk

40:27.266 --> 40:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Road, in Central Asia,
where we again catch
up with Paul Salopek.

40:31.533 --> 40:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is on his Out of Eden
walk. It's an around-the-world
reporting project that
began four years ago.

40:38.700 --> 40:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan
recently spoke with him.

40:40.833 --> 40:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Since we spoke
last time, Paul, you have walked
through Kazakstan, Uzbekistan.

40:44.833 --> 40:48.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You're in Kyrgyzstan
now. And you are going
to walk into China.

40:48.300 --> 40:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK, Fellow, National
Geographic: My deadlines
are often seasonal, right?

40:52.233 --> 40:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I have been crossing deserts
and mountains across Central
Asia, and the trick is to cross

40:59.300 --> 41:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the deserts in the cold part
of the year and the mountains
in the warm part of the year.

41:02.033 --> 41:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And guess what? I haven't
been able to do that so far.
I'm been -- it's reversed.

41:06.166 --> 41:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tell me a
little bit about that desert
crossing. I know you had to plan

41:09.033 --> 41:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ahead and plant stashes
of water into some of the
places along your walk.

41:13.333 --> 41:16.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But I read one of the
places you walked up
to, your water was gone.

41:16.366 --> 41:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Yes, that's right.

41:19.033 --> 41:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's one of these
physical challenges of
walking across desolate
landscapes. We had to put

41:26.033 --> 41:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some water caches out before.
And I had to walk to them.
And to my great surprise, one

41:29.700 --> 41:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the caches in that middle
of the Kyzyl Kum, this big
waterless area, this badlands

41:34.700 --> 41:37.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the size of Arizona,
had been broken into.

41:37.700 --> 41:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the water had been taken.
And that was a big surprise,
because local shepherds would

41:44.733 --> 41:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
probably never do that. They
know how valuable water is. So
I don't know who took it. My

41:50.433 --> 41:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
walking partners at the time
and I had to resort to using
the satellite phone to call

41:52.766 --> 41:54.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in for help.

41:54.866 --> 41:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Who lives out
in these deserts? Tell me about
these nomads. What are these

41:57.100 --> 41:59.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
herders like?

41:59.133 --> 42:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Well, it's --
this part of the world, Central
Asia, is one of the two big

42:03.033 --> 42:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hot spots, if you will, left
in our current age in the
early 21st century for pastoral

42:09.966 --> 42:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nomads, for people who still
move with animals. The other
one, of course, is North Africa.

42:15.733 --> 42:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When the steppe turns green,
they go out in the spring and
move their flocks and then

42:17.933 --> 42:20.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
move with their flocks
as their ancestors did.

42:20.233 --> 42:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You have
been following the Silk Road
that millions of people before

42:24.233 --> 42:26.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you have.

42:26.266 --> 42:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: The Silk Road
was an artery of trade not
just of luxury item, not just

42:29.466 --> 42:33.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of commodities, but
of ideas, right?

42:33.100 --> 42:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Buddhism moved along the Silk
Road routes. Inventions like
paper, which conveyed ideas,

42:40.233 --> 42:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, culture, art, music,
all of these things moved along
these camel caravan roads.

42:47.300 --> 42:51.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's interesting to
be walking them today,
Hari, as we're entering
a phase where there's

42:51.766 --> 42:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been a bit of backlash against
globalism. And the Silk Road
was the first real experiment

42:57.900 --> 42:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in globalization
about 2,000 years ago.

42:59.933 --> 43:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Most of us
would have trouble finding these
countries on a map. But how

43:02.666 --> 43:05.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have these former
Soviet republics fared?
What's life like there?

43:05.433 --> 43:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Kazakstan
got lucky. They had
tremendous energy reserves.

43:12.366 --> 43:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of the great challenges,
believe it or not, of walking
with a cargo horse across

43:15.833 --> 43:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these open steppes in today's
day and age was getting
around gas pipelines. They're

43:20.466 --> 43:22.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everywhere.

43:22.500 --> 43:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I was kind of bumping into
gas pipelines and turning right
or left, hoping that I would

43:25.500 --> 43:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eventually come to a gate. So,
Kazakstan has done well in this
lottery of natural resources.

43:33.066 --> 43:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Uzbekistan has done less
well. Uzbekistan is an ancient
part of the world, where they

43:37.733 --> 43:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had Silk Road cities that had
many, many tens of thousands of
people -- they had universities,

43:44.666 --> 43:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they had temples -- that has
kind of fallen on harder times.
They don't have the natural

43:47.166 --> 43:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
resources that Kazakstan does.

43:49.266 --> 43:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now I'm in Kyrgyzstan, a
smaller Central Asian republic
that's very mountainous, that

43:56.033 --> 44:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is basically capitalizing on
its natural beauty, eco-tourism
to kind of make its way ahead.

44:02.033 --> 44:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk
a little bit about the people
that you have been walking

44:03.033 --> 44:05.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with.

44:05.033 --> 44:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I imagine that you get to
know these people that you're
walking hundreds of miles with.

44:08.400 --> 44:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: So, I have walked
about 6,000 kilometers out
of Ethiopia since January of

44:15.433 --> 44:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2013. I have crossed about 13
borders. I have passed through
about a dozen countries and

44:22.000 --> 44:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
territories, many
languages within those
territories and countries.

44:25.233 --> 44:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And along most of the way,
about 95 percent of the way,
I have been walking with local

44:29.500 --> 44:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people. That's part of the
project. This is a project about
humanity. It's a project about

44:36.466 --> 44:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what connects us and what
separates us, so I need
to have local people.

44:38.833 --> 44:43.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's truly amazing.
In conversations about,
is the world becoming
more dangerous, is it

44:45.700 --> 44:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
becoming more turbulent, I
have to remind my readers that,
at least in my experience,

44:49.133 --> 44:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the world is an incredibly
hospitable place.

44:51.766 --> 44:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all of these folks who walk
with me, mostly men, but some
women, have become like family

44:58.700 --> 45:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to me. I literally put my
life into their hands. And I'm
being passed like a human baton

45:03.000 --> 45:05.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from walking partner
to walking partner.

45:05.533 --> 45:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what does that do?
It gives me great heart.
It gives me great energy.
It proves in a very

45:11.900 --> 45:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concrete way, my safety, that
most people are good and most
people will help you out,

45:17.566 --> 45:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even if they're strangers,
even if they're from another
culture, even if they don't look

45:19.066 --> 45:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like you or speak in the
same words that you speak.

45:21.600 --> 45:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's been
more than four years since
you have been walking on this

45:25.866 --> 45:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story now. What have you
discovered about yourself?

45:28.533 --> 45:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: As you know,
I covered many conflicts for
many years as a war journalist,

45:34.933 --> 45:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I saw a lot of the
dark side of human nature.

45:37.600 --> 45:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have run into a few scrapes
on this project. You know, I
was ambushed twice in Turkey.

45:44.566 --> 45:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I got shot at on the West Bank
and have had my water cache
broken into in Uzbekistan.

45:51.500 --> 45:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I can remember those
items, those incidents
because they stood out,
because the vast majority

45:58.500 --> 46:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of my interactions with people
across the world on foot has
been fantastically positive.

46:03.900 --> 46:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's simplified my
writing, and I think made it
better. And the same applies

46:07.233 --> 46:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
basically to my daily life.

46:09.300 --> 46:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When your world and your
problems and your anxieties are
calipered by your legs and by

46:16.266 --> 46:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the extent that you can walk
in a day, say, 20 miles or
15 miles, it eliminates a lot

46:23.133 --> 46:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of unnecessary worry. You
don't expend too much energy
worrying about things that are

46:28.066 --> 46:30.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
beyond your control.

46:30.066 --> 46:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Paul Salopek,
we wish you the best of luck.
And we will catch up with

46:31.900 --> 46:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you again as soon as we can.

46:33.400 --> 46:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Thanks a lot,
Hari. Good to talk again.

46:40.200 --> 46:43.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nashville
has long been considered
the beating heart of
the country music world,

46:50.633 --> 46:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but the new album "The Nashville
Sound" by Jason Isbell is
infusing the genre with rock,

46:56.800 --> 46:58.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
folk and blues.

46:58.900 --> 47:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Grammy Award winner has
turned heads with his lyrics,
which this time around address

47:02.833 --> 47:06.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
topics like poverty,
race, and love.

47:06.300 --> 47:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown recently joined
Isbell on the first stop
of his international tour.

47:13.200 --> 47:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In his song
"The Last of My Kind," Jason
Isbell creates a character based

47:23.566 --> 47:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on people he grew up around
in rural Northern Alabama who
fear how the world is changing.

47:31.766 --> 47:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON ISBELL, Musician: A lot
of people that I grew up with,
went to school with in Alabama,

47:41.400 --> 47:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a lot of people in my family
who told me growing up that
cities were terrible places

47:48.433 --> 47:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and anything outside of our
little circle was scary and
dangerous and frightening.

47:52.700 --> 47:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I thought about the effect
that had on people, when you
start to believe that, and

47:56.533 --> 48:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you let yourself be so afraid
of other people and the outside
world, that you never feel

48:01.533 --> 48:04.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
tethered, you never
feel a connection with
the rest of humanity.

48:04.933 --> 48:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I wrote that song
based on that kind of fear.

48:08.133 --> 48:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In both ballads
and hard-charging rock 'n' roll
songs like "Cumberland Gap,"

48:20.200 --> 48:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Isbell's storytelling prowess
has made him one of today's most
acclaimed singer-songwriters.

48:25.133 --> 48:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His last album, "®MDNMomething
More Than Free," won two
Grammys and achieved the rare

48:31.600 --> 48:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feat of topping folk, rock,
and country charts in 2015.

48:40.266 --> 48:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now 38, he's back with a new
album titled "The Nashville
Sound," and we joined him and

48:47.266 --> 48:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his band, The 400 Unit, at
the Thomas Wolfe Auditorium in
Asheville, North Carolina, on

48:51.666 --> 48:56.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the first day of their
new national tour.

48:58.700 --> 49:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once again, Isbell's
songs are filled with
rural country characters,
this time also reflecting

49:11.100 --> 49:13.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the nation's political
and cultural fears.

49:13.466 --> 49:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:40% size:100%
®MD+IMD-I®MD+IMD-IJASON
ISBELL:
It's
just
hard
to
tell
people
who

49:16.100 --> 49:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are my family that anybody in
government really cares about
them, because I don't think I

49:23.133 --> 49:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
can sell that. I don't
think I can convincingly
tell Middle America that
the government gives

49:27.100 --> 49:28.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a damn.

49:28.466 --> 49:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Disaffected
white male, yes?

49:29.666 --> 49:33.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JASON ISBELL: Yes. Yes,
you hear about that.

49:33.600 --> 49:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think a lot of people
try to tell us that that's who
elected our current president,

49:40.566 --> 49:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but I don't necessarily believe
that, because I know a lot of
disaffected white males and

49:42.666 --> 49:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
disaffected white people
in general who didn't
vote at all because they
didn't think anybody

49:46.566 --> 49:48.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gave a damn about them.

49:48.100 --> 49:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: They just didn't
believe in the political system.

49:50.066 --> 49:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON ISBELL: No. They
thought the system had been
broken for a long time.

49:53.966 --> 49:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Isbell started
out as many do, in bands that
travel by van wherever the

50:00.300 --> 50:02.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gigs take them.

50:02.300 --> 50:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His first big break was as a
member of the southern indie
rock band the Drive-By Truckers.

50:08.966 --> 50:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That came to an end when his
drinking and drug abuse grew
so bad, he was thrown out

50:11.033 --> 50:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the band. It took him
several years to sober up and
restart his life and career.

50:20.866 --> 50:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON ISBELL: Before I stopped
drinking, I thought, if I quit
drinking, am I still going

50:25.533 --> 50:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be funny? Am I still going
to be a good songwriter? Am
I going to still be a rock

50:28.900 --> 50:32.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
'n' roll person? Are
people going to still
want to be around me?

50:32.100 --> 50:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, is my creativity
going to be there if I quit
doing these drugs? Am I going to

50:38.500 --> 50:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be able to record in the
studio, these kinds of things?

50:40.666 --> 50:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now they sound so ridiculous
even just coming out of my
mouth, like, of course, that's

50:45.066 --> 50:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not where the work comes from.

50:47.233 --> 50:51.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: But I can
see where the anxiety
comes from, because, I
mean, in your business,

50:51.233 --> 50:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's a thin line, isn't it,
between kind of making it and
not making it or having success

50:55.966 --> 50:58.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or not?

50:58.066 --> 51:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON ISBELL: Yes. Yes, it's
hard. It's really hard to make a
living writing songs and singing

51:01.933 --> 51:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them, really, really hard.
A lot of people, they try it
out like as a lottery ticket.

51:08.933 --> 51:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, if it doesn't work,
they go do something else. But
that's not the tradition that I

51:11.666 --> 51:13.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come from.

51:13.733 --> 51:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I come from a group of people
who pretty much set themselves
to do this for the rest of

51:19.700 --> 51:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their life, whether it kills
them or not. And that's how
I was early on. That's how

51:21.600 --> 51:23.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I still am.

51:23.633 --> 51:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now he's on
the road with his wife, Amanda
Shires, herself a singer and

51:30.500 --> 51:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
songwriter who performs
on her own and as
bandmate with her husband.

51:37.100 --> 51:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they're joined by
their almost 2-year-old
"Moon Shadow"-loving
daughter, Mercy Rose.

51:42.900 --> 51:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Isbell's recent breakthrough
success allows some
newfound traveling comforts.

51:47.000 --> 51:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON ISBELL: We have recently
gotten to the point where we
can have multiple buses. That's

51:51.400 --> 51:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something I never really thought
that I would get to. Maybe
one bus, that'd be great, with

51:55.633 --> 51:59.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a trailer behind it with
our gear in it. That was
always the goal for me.

51:59.600 --> 52:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: This
is how you judge where
you're at, right, by...

52:01.533 --> 52:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JASON ISBELL: Oh, God, yes.

52:03.033 --> 52:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: ... whether it's
a van or one bus or two buses?

52:04.366 --> 52:06.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JASON ISBELL: Yes. Yes.

52:06.433 --> 52:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's practical concerns, you
know? Because I have always
made the art I wanted to make,

52:08.900 --> 52:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I will always do that. So,
I'm going to judge my level
of success by whether or not

52:15.900 --> 52:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can hear myself on stage,
or whether or not my wife can
come along with me and have

52:21.666 --> 52:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a mirror to put her makeup
on in, and my baby can have a
bunk with this, like, dog gate

52:27.400 --> 52:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we bought at Petco and
bolted to the outside of the
bunk, so she doesn't roll off

52:29.600 --> 52:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the middle of the night.

52:36.666 --> 52:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In one beautiful
love song on the new album,
Isbell writes and sings

52:46.166 --> 52:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as himself about a future of
joy and sorrow with his wife.

JASON ISBELL: If you can write
a good love song now that
actually adds something to the

52:56.866 --> 52:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
canon of love songs, then
you're qualified, in my opinion,
because that's tough. That's

53:02.033 --> 53:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like painting a picture of a
tree that needs to exists. How
many times have people done

53:04.766 --> 53:09.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that before?

JEFFREY BROWN: Another
song getting much attention
tackles racism in America
today. It's called

53:30.233 --> 53:32.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"White Man's World."

53:32.200 --> 53:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON ISBELL: It's important
for me to just continue to
notice that there are doors that

53:39.333 --> 53:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are open for me that
wouldn't be if I wasn't
white or if I wasn't male.

53:46.333 --> 53:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not guilty about it, and
I'm not ashamed of it. I had
no control over it. And I need

53:49.000 --> 53:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to consider those things,
because, if I don't,
then I'm just running
wild and never really

53:55.966 --> 54:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
considering what privilege
that I have and how to make the
world a better place for people

54:01.633 --> 54:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
don't get what they deserve.

On the "NewsHour" online: A
poet pays homage to the late
writer David Foster Wallace by

54:28.400 --> 54:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
