The State Department said that a
them have been retroactively cla

they have been redacted, so ther

Every month, there will be anoth

her defense on this, which is th

going to tighten, this should be

10:20.119 --> 10:20.520
race, it always has been.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.923
The really interesting thing tho
the tightening of the race in Io

10:25.391 --> 10:28.828
New Hampshire as well with Berni
is that it's not because voters

Clinton is less likable or that

10:34.601 --> 10:36.736
ratings have gone up appreciably

10:38.204 --> 10:41.708
It's that they see in Bernie San

that they see as more authentic,
somebody who is enthusiastic. He

However, these big endorsements

she has money. She has infrastru

TAMARA KEITH: I think with Jeb B
a certain element of not wanting

hacks of U.S. data are being use

16:33.993 --> 16:36.195
and Russia to target U.S. spies.

Jeffrey Brown has more.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.650

data breaches all the time. Toda

who work with U.S. undercover ag

has already been compromised.

17:11.697 --> 17:14.233
One of the article's authors, L.
Brian Bennett, joins me now.

17:14.901 --> 17:14.767
And welcome to you.

17:16.235 --> 17:19.605
So, we hear about these acts. Th
what happens afterwards, right,

17:21.073 --> 17:22.775
and putting together the informa
kind of clues are they looking f

17:24.243 --> 17:26.112
BRIAN BENNETT, The Los Angeles T
right now, countries like China

17:27.580 --> 17:31.417
are collecting massive amounts o
the lives of Americans and the l

17:31.884 --> 17:32.485
workers.

17:33.953 --> 17:38.758
And this is going to allow them

it difficult to do?

18:19.899 --> 18:21.867
BRIAN BENNETT: It is difficult t
it's technical to do.

18:23.336 --> 18:27.306
But computers have become so adv
that countries like China and Ru

18:28.774 --> 18:31.944
capable of doing this, and not o
but they can work with criminal

18:33.412 --> 18:37.550
their own countries, Chinese hac
companies. And they can collect

18:38.150 --> 18:38.084
put it together.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.854
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, this is one
that struck me in your article.

18:43.322 --> 18:48.227
about governments, China and Rus
but working with mobs, mob group

18:49.695 --> 18:52.999
with private companies in their
to do this. Why would they be wo

18:53.532 --> 18:53.632
such groups?

18:55.101 --> 18:58.938
BRIAN BENNETT: So, in the case o
example, intelligence officials

19:00.406 --> 19:02.742
the data breaches that have been
with China, and they determined

19:04.210 --> 19:06.979
a hacking ring, a criminal hacki
is working at the behest of the

19:08.447 --> 19:13.586
And that ring, for example, was
data that was stolen from Anthem

19:15.054 --> 19:20.226
That was 80 million files on dif
stolen from that. And that infor

19:21.694 --> 19:23.696
made it to the black market. Usu
there's a big data breach like t

19:24.930 --> 19:26.499
would be sold to the highest bid
it never appeared.

19:27.967 --> 19:33.039
And so intelligence officials ar
that the hack was done at the be

19:34.507 --> 19:36.776
foreign government and that Chin
that information combined with o

19:37.643 --> 19:38.310
they have stolen from U.S. gover

19:39.779 --> 19:42.081
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, now, s
using, because that's what also

19:43.549 --> 19:46.952
out here, is not just the gather
the cross-indexing, but the usin

19:48.421 --> 19:51.891
information, you say there's bee
some evidence of at least one ne

19:53.059 --> 19:54.160
has been compromised. What do we
in that case?

19:55.628 --> 19:57.163
BRIAN BENNETT: So, what was desc
by these officials I spoke with

19:58.631 --> 20:01.567
was that they aren't concerned a
so much about the trained spies,

20:02.768 --> 20:04.270
who have had years and years of
doing this work.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.407
They're more concerned about a n

an expertise, and when asked the
and they have a security clearan

20:18.451 --> 20:23.489
Well, now, because China was beh
data breach that was able to dig

20:24.957 --> 20:29.962
security clearance files, they n
can cross-index information on p

20:31.430 --> 20:34.066
records, people's health care re
whether they have a security cle

20:34.467 --> 20:34.100
not.

20:35.568 --> 20:39.772
JEFFREY BROWN: And compromised i
means, do we know how -- was the

20:40.806 --> 20:42.074
given to these scientists or pre
them?

20:43.542 --> 20:47.480
BRIAN BENNETT: So, intelligence
say that they have evidence that

20:48.347 --> 20:50.116
this information and is using it

20:51.584 --> 20:55.621
We don't know exactly how they a

they try to hide their tracks, a
won't necessarily detain or hold

21:04.830 --> 21:07.399
One warning that was given out t
officials, for example, was that

21:08.868 --> 21:11.537
at an airport and someone approa
they seem to have a lot in commo

21:13.005 --> 21:16.075
be very wary of that. So, there
sort of soft advances is what th

21:16.876 --> 21:17.009
community is talking about.

21:18.477 --> 21:20.479
JEFFREY BROWN: And are authoriti
you that they suspect this has h

21:21.347 --> 21:22.348
other cases, that there are othe

21:23.015 --> 21:23.582
BRIAN BENNETT: Yes.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.886
They're very concerned about tha
they're concerned about the Russ

21:28.354 --> 21:30.156
doing this, the Chinese governme
also concerned about the Iranian

21:31.624 --> 21:35.728
being able to collect these mass
of data and use it to identify p

21:36.462 --> 21:36.428
with U.S. intelligence.

21:37.897 --> 21:41.000
JEFFREY BROWN: And do we know wh
U.S. is taking, are able to take

21:41.534 --> 21:41.901
any of this?

21:43.369 --> 21:45.971
BRIAN BENNETT: So, right now, th
aggressively trying to educate t

21:47.439 --> 21:50.209

22:08.594 --> 22:08.761
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

22:09.795 --> 22:15.000
Brian Bennett of The L.A. Times,

22:15.868 --> 22:22.641

So, it's kind of a blessing and

WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It seems like

SCOTT SHAFER: Steve Palumbi is t
of Stanford University's Hopkins

29:29.935 --> 29:34.406
He has studied coral reefs aroun

29:35.874 --> 29:40.145
For decades, warming ocean water
even killed coral. But Palumbi s

29:41.613 --> 29:45.450
are now facing an insidious thre
chemical change that is making o

29:45.984 --> 29:46.351
more acidic.

29:47.819 --> 29:53.158
STEPHEN PALUMBI: Ocean acidifica
the entire globe's oceans. And i

29:54.626 --> 29:58.463
organisms by reducing their grow
by making it more difficult to m

29:59.598 --> 30:02.467
We know that fish actually react
differently.

30:03.935 --> 30:07.039
SCOTT SHAFER: With ocean surface
30 percent more acidic than they

30:08.240 --> 30:12.044
centuries ago, protecting the re

30:13.512 --> 30:17.516
STEPHEN PALUMBI: It's not a prob

30:18.984 --> 30:22.554
that, once it gets really bad en
it's having an incredible global

SCOTT SHAFER: The increase in ac
the result of people burning coa

30:32.264 --> 30:37.102

of carbon dioxide into the atmos

30:38.537 --> 30:42.541
then sinks into the ocean waters
of nine billion tons per year.

30:44.009 --> 30:47.646
The carbon dioxide robs the ocea
element that corals and other an

30:50.015 --> 30:54.820

JIM BARRY, Monterey Bay Aquarium

31:26.351 --> 31:26.918
Most of them might be deeper.

31:28.386 --> 31:32.624
SCOTT SHAFER: Jim Barry is a sen
at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Res

31:34.092 --> 31:38.163
He is looking at the effects of

31:38.597 --> 31:38.463
coral.

JIM BARRY: The ocean critters ou
faced with a faster and larger c

31:45.470 --> 31:49.775
chemistry than they have seen fo
300 million years, through much

31:50.242 --> 31:50.075
history.

31:51.510 --> 31:56.248
SCOTT SHAFER: Barry says, if one
an entire food web can suffer.

Inside a chilly lab, Boch is ind

SCOTT SHAFER: Boch and Barry are

32:36.788 --> 32:38.623
levels of acidity to examine how
fertilization.

32:40.091 --> 32:44.596
JIM BARRY: Maybe what we saw in
where fertilization was lower in

32:45.630 --> 32:47.032
it's because the sperm are not s
fast.

36:38.763 --> 36:39.397
Thank you for joining us.

36:40.865 --> 36:43.535
In a nutshell, what is your oppo
this deal as it is written now?

36:45.003 --> 36:46.237
STEPHEN RADEMAKER, Former U.S. A
Official: I believe there are nu

36:47.005 --> 36:47.372
flaws with the agreement.

36:48.840 --> 36:53.611
But the single most important on
it basically locks in that Iran

36:55.080 --> 36:58.716
threshold nuclear weapons state.
that Iran is going to be able, i

36:59.584 --> 37:01.086
order, to produce nuclear weapon

37:02.554 --> 37:05.256
GWEN IFILL: Explain to people th
between threshold, just a little

37:06.124 --> 37:07.192
question, and actually having th

37:08.660 --> 37:11.329
STEPHEN RADEMAKER: Well, being o
means a country can be very, ver

37:12.797 --> 37:16.101
actually having a nuclear weapon
actually produced one. The term

37:17.569 --> 37:21.372
that they can be a screwdriver's
from actually putting together a

37:22.841 --> 37:27.045
And experts have said for years,
that if Iran is allowed to becom

37:28.513 --> 37:32.183
nuclear weapon state, that will
a cascade of nuclear proliferati

37:33.651 --> 37:35.820
Middle East, which of course is
region of the world. And there a

37:37.288 --> 37:39.657
there that, if Iran was allowed
capability, they are going to wa

37:40.358 --> 37:40.391
that same capability.

37:41.860 --> 37:46.197
GWEN IFILL: And so your reading
is that by doing this, we are em

37:46.931 --> 37:47.132
instead of weakening it?

37:47.932 --> 37:48.333
STEPHEN RADEMAKER: Exactly.

37:49.801 --> 37:53.605
You need to distinguish between
and the long term. The president

37:55.073 --> 37:57.475
to sell this agreement has focus
short term. And his argument, hi

37:58.943 --> 38:02.147
in favor of the agreement is tha
reduce Iran's nuclear breakout t

38:03.615 --> 38:06.985
or three months today to a year,
I should say it will extend thei

38:08.453 --> 38:10.855
break -- it will take longer for
a nuclear weapon, to produce the

38:12.323 --> 38:15.794
the fissile material, the highly
uranium they would need for a nu

38:16.394 --> 38:15.960
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

38:17.095 --> 38:18.496
STEPHEN RADEMAKER: And that is t
short term.

38:19.964 --> 38:23.201
But in the long term, President
that starting in about 13 years,

38:24.068 --> 38:24.769
time will reduce to almost zero.

38:26.237 --> 38:29.107
GWEN IFILL: And when you testifi
to Congress, you described it as

38:29.574 --> 38:29.741
bargain.

38:31.209 --> 38:35.213
STEPHEN RADEMAKER: Exactly. Faus
mythological figure who sold his

38:36.681 --> 38:40.018

powers for -- I think it was 26

38:41.486 --> 38:44.189
For 26 years, he had magical pow
end of 26 years, the devil came

to what this deal provides. For

38:52.230 --> 38:56.034
it's not a bad deal. After 10 ye
a horrible deal and it gives Ira

39:11.216 --> 39:11.449
apples and oranges?

39:12.917 --> 39:16.321
STEPHEN RADEMAKER: I think they
in the sense they were both Faus

39:17.789 --> 39:20.158
The agreed framework with North
a good deal for us in the short

39:21.626 --> 39:26.564
a very bad deal in the long term
however, was that, in the case o

39:28.032 --> 39:33.838
there was a reason to believe th
devil came to claim our soul, wh

39:35.306 --> 39:38.443
-- the benefits of the deal reve
to the other side, that there wo

39:39.310 --> 39:39.978
different government in North Ko

39:41.446 --> 39:45.283
But, remember, this was in 1994,
regimes were collapsing all over

39:46.751 --> 39:52.090
And so it wasn't unreasonable to
1994 that, in 15 years or whenev

39:53.558 --> 39:56.728
had to be delivered to North Kor
would be a very different regime

39:58.196 --> 40:01.466
would be gone from North Korea,
was gone from Russia and all of

40:02.934 --> 40:05.570
Of course, we know today communi
there, so in fact would have bee

40:07.038 --> 40:09.474
I think the difference with the
is, there's absolutely no reason

40:10.942 --> 40:16.247
that in 10 or 15 years, we will
different regime in Iran. Quite

40:17.715 --> 40:20.518
This agreement is going to resul
immediate transfer to Iran of so

40:21.986 --> 40:26.724
$100 billion and $150 dollars, w
is an enormous amount of money,

40:27.592 --> 40:28.192
the size of their economy and th

40:29.661 --> 40:31.396
GWEN IFILL: But let's talk about
problem here, because part of th

40:32.864 --> 40:35.967
is -- part of the stick and the
in this deal was that the sancti

40:37.435 --> 40:40.505
eventually be lifted, that Iran
basically to feed their people a

40:41.973 --> 40:45.510
And you're saying that's exactly
perverse incentive, that would e

40:46.244 --> 40:46.411
part of the empowering.

40:47.879 --> 40:51.716
STEPHEN RADEMAKER: Well, I'm say
be empowered because of the rest

40:53.184 --> 40:56.487
nuclear activities will go away.
they're going to be empowered in

40:56.921 --> 40:57.088
sense.

40:58.556 --> 41:02.760
In an economic sense, yes, they
economically as a result of the

41:04.228 --> 41:07.332
first instance, they get a huge
because there's money, pursuant

41:08.800 --> 41:10.935
sanctions, that is being segrega
was being held in foreign banks.

41:11.569 --> 41:11.035
GWEN IFILL: Right.

41:11.903 --> 41:12.937
STEPHEN RADEMAKER: They will get

41:14.405 --> 41:17.942
Then they will get increased tra
ability to export their oil, inc

41:19.410 --> 41:21.713
investment in their economy. So,
longer term, there will be many

41:22.213 --> 41:23.014
benefits.

41:24.482 --> 41:29.187
And I'm not saying it would be a
to trade that for meaningful lon

41:30.655 --> 41:35.193
restrictions on Iran's nuclear p
problem I have is, we have trade

41:36.661 --> 41:43.935
to Iran in exchange for very sho
if 13 years ago, 15 years ago, P

41:45.403 --> 41:49.107
had cut a deal with Iran that sa
15 years, you behave, but at the

41:50.575 --> 41:51.976
years, you can pretty much do wh
want. You can be a screwdriver's

41:52.810 --> 41:53.478
from having a nuclear weapon.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.547
Had President Bush cut that deal
ago, we'd be cursing him today.

41:58.015 --> 42:01.252
GWEN IFILL: So, do you also thin
deal in some way, because of tho

42:02.720 --> 42:08.292
incentives, because -- are propp
current regime, that they do not

42:09.594 --> 42:11.729
disincentive for this regime or
environment to change?

42:13.197 --> 42:17.668
STEPHEN RADEMAKER: I think endin
and delivering these significant

42:19.137 --> 42:21.239
benefits to the Iranian regime,
to support the regime, which is

42:22.707 --> 42:26.511
this is not at all like North Ko
there was a reason in 1994 to be

42:27.712 --> 42:30.181
the tide of history was running
regimes in Asia.

42:30.715 --> 42:30.515
(CROSSTALK)

42:31.983 --> 42:34.285
STEPHEN RADEMAKER: There's no re
-- there's no objective reason,

the situation in the Middle East
that the Iranian regime is going

42:38.189 --> 42:39.023
big trouble after this deal.

42:40.491 --> 42:44.328

43:04.949 --> 43:07.885
to make this a less harmful deal
your perspective?

JANE FERGUSON: Fabulous wealth i
in Lebanon, and the income divid

But demands are also being made
changes, like calls for fresh pa
