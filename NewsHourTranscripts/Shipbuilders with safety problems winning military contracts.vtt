JUDY WOODRUFF: As a candidate,
President Trump called for the
largest expansion of the Navy

00:04.800 --> 00:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since the Reagan administration,
but his latest budget proposal
contains more modest short-term

00:10.500 --> 00:12.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
increases.

00:12.466 --> 00:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, it would boost business
in the U.S. shipbuilding
industry, which, despite serious

00:18.500 --> 00:22.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
safety violations in the
past decade, continues
to win billions of
dollars in contracts to

00:23.266 --> 00:26.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
build Navy and
Coast Guard vessels.

00:26.233 --> 00:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aubrey Aden-Buie of Reveal, from
the Center for Investigative
Reporting, has the story.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN WILLIAMS, Injured in
Accident: I love you, baby doll.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WANDA WILLIAMS, Wife of John
Williams: I love you, too.

00:35.233 --> 00:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE:
Wanda Williams' life
changed forever when her
sister-in-law rushed to her

00:40.033 --> 00:41.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
house in 2014.

00:41.566 --> 00:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WANDA WILLIAMS: And she
got out of the car crying.

00:43.666 --> 00:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she said that John got hurt
and he was hurt really bad.

00:46.866 --> 00:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Wanda's
husband, John, nearly died in an
accident at the shipyard where

00:51.533 --> 00:53.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he worked.

00:53.700 --> 00:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WANDA WILLIAMS: We would have
never thought that this would
have happened to him, because

00:59.766 --> 01:02.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this is things that he
did every single day.

01:02.600 --> 01:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He went to work as my husband,
and he came home as a child.

01:09.233 --> 01:13.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Wanda
now takes care of her
husband 24 hours a day.

01:15.333 --> 01:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The accident happened three
years ago at a VT Halter
Mississippi shipyard.

01:19.133 --> 01:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A surveillance camera recorded
as Williams' crane lost balance
and suddenly tipped over.

01:25.333 --> 01:27.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His co-worker, Willie
Horne, saw it happen.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIE HORNE, Co-Worker: The
boom pulled back and it just
bounced back all kind of ways.

01:31.833 --> 01:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he was just messed up.

01:33.900 --> 01:35.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
His head was crushed.

01:35.933 --> 01:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That stuff like that, it's
just something that you
just can't forget like that.

01:44.066 --> 01:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: The
accident crushed Williams'
skull and left him blind.

01:49.066 --> 01:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For months before the accident,
he had complained about the
crane's broken load sensor.

01:53.666 --> 01:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VT Halter re-installed the
sensor two days earlier, but the
Occupational Safety and Health

02:00.666 --> 02:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Administration, or OSHA,
later determined it
wasn't fully operational.

02:06.166 --> 02:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a history of serious
accidents at VT Halter.

02:09.600 --> 02:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A few years earlier, two
workers were killed applying
paint thinner inside a tugboat.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this crawlspace, while
working with insufficient
ventilation and without
explosion-proof lights,

02:21.866 --> 02:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vapors built up over 600
times the legal limit,
igniting in a flash fire.

02:27.433 --> 02:29.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Joey Pettey barely
escaped the blast.

02:29.533 --> 02:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEY PETTEY, Accident Survivor:
The explosion, when it happened,
it blew doors and hatches

02:33.866 --> 02:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and electrical panels,
boom, boom, boom.

02:36.500 --> 02:39.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
When that third one
hit, it blew it out.

02:39.300 --> 02:44.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: OSHA
investigated and called
that accident horrific
and preventable, and

02:45.166 --> 02:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fined the company over $800,000.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But a month following
the explosion, the Navy
awarded VT Halter the
contract to build this

02:55.766 --> 02:57.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ship, worth $87 million.

02:57.933 --> 03:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEY PETTEY: The contracts
are pretty hefty amounts,
and the fines is really low.

03:04.933 --> 03:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seems like a slap on the
wrist when you got that kind
of money rolling around.

03:07.733 --> 03:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: We repeatedly
reached out to VT Halter,
but they declined to comment

03:12.100 --> 03:14.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or to be interviewed.

03:14.100 --> 03:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're one of seven major
U.S. shipbuilders that contract
with the Navy and Coast Guard.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our review of federal contracts,
court records, and OSHA files
found that, since 2008, the

03:25.900 --> 03:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
federal government has awarded
more than $100 billion to these
companies, despite serious

03:31.433 --> 03:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
safety lapses that have
endangered and killed workers.

03:35.833 --> 03:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In neighboring Mobile, Alabama,
Austal USA is building some
of the country's newest naval

03:41.900 --> 03:43.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vessels.

03:43.900 --> 03:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Huge aluminum modules are
assembled into warships on
the banks of the Mobile River.

03:50.666 --> 03:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But dozens of its workers have
been injured by a power tool
used to cut through metal.

03:57.900 --> 04:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their own top safety manager
dubbed it the widow maker.

04:00.833 --> 04:04.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN OSBORN, Injured
in Accident: The day
of my accident, I was
using the miller, as

04:04.933 --> 04:06.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it is called at Austal.

04:06.366 --> 04:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Martin
Osborn is a welder at Austal.

04:09.066 --> 04:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN OSBORN: I was up in a
boom lift, as we call it, or a
man lift, up in the air about

04:16.033 --> 04:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
40 feet, cutting a lifting
lug off the side of a module,
and had a violent kickback.

04:21.700 --> 04:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It kicked out of my hands
and went across my left
hand, cutting me pretty bad.

04:28.733 --> 04:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't take my glove off,
because, I knew if I did that,
I would have blood everywhere.

04:34.233 --> 04:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Before
Osborn's accident, Austal
modified the Metabo
grinder by replacing

04:37.233 --> 04:42.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the standard disc with
a sawtooth blade made
by an outside company.

04:42.166 --> 04:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This made the tool more
versatile, able to cut
through aluminum more quickly.

04:46.633 --> 04:51.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the manufacturer of
the grinder specifically
warned against using
these blades, saying

04:52.966 --> 04:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they cause frequent kickback
and loss of control.

04:55.033 --> 05:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN OSBORN: I have seen
pictures of people getting cut
in their face, in their necks,

05:00.700 --> 05:02.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in their thighs.

05:02.233 --> 05:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the most dangerous tool
I have ever put in my hands.

05:04.300 --> 05:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Does
Austal know that the tool
is as dangerous as it is?

05:07.400 --> 05:09.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARTIN OSBORN: Yes,
ma'am, they do.

05:09.900 --> 05:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Company
e-mails among Austal's
managers obtained by
Reveal show that, even

05:13.133 --> 05:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before Osborn's accident, they
called the modification lethal,
and the grinders an accident

05:19.233 --> 05:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
waiting to happen.

05:21.200 --> 05:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet, according to Osborn,
Austal workers still
use the grinder daily.

05:25.266 --> 05:29.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN OSBORN: I have
had numerous supervisors
tell me that, you
know, if you don't want

05:29.633 --> 05:32.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to use the tool, go get
a job at Burger King.

05:32.066 --> 05:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Despite
repeated requests,
Austal declined to
comment for this story.

05:38.600 --> 05:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The company has received
more than $6 billion in
Navy contracts since 2008.

05:44.133 --> 05:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when OSHA concluded the saw
exposed workers to amputations,
severe lacerations, and other

05:49.066 --> 05:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
injuries, they fined the
shipyard just over $4,000.

05:53.600 --> 05:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Austal's own records show at
least 50 workers were injured
by the tool in four years.

05:58.133 --> 06:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIAN DUNCAN, Attorney:
Why would any manufacturer
or any company continue
to use a tool after

06:04.500 --> 06:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dozens and dozens of
people have been injured?

06:06.466 --> 06:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Attorney
Brian Duncan is representing
Osborn, along with eight others,

06:10.366 --> 06:14.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in a lawsuit which he
hopes will bring more
than just compensation.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRIAN DUNCAN: I hope, when there
are companies out there that
have intentionally, knowingly

06:18.766 --> 06:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
violated safety standards, that
somebody will come in, in that
scenario and will hold those

06:25.300 --> 06:27.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people accountable.

06:27.233 --> 06:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: David
Michaels, the head of OSHA under
former President Obama, was

06:30.766 --> 06:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
until recently in charge of
enforcing workplace safety laws.

06:34.966 --> 06:39.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He acknowledges that
OSHA's maximum penalties
are insufficient,
capped by federal law.

06:41.933 --> 06:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MICHAELS, Former OSHA
Director: They're tiny compared
to the contracts that many of

06:44.133 --> 06:46.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
these companies get
from the government and
from the private sector.

06:46.700 --> 06:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: He says
that the real power the
government holds is in
awarding the contracts

06:51.333 --> 06:53.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
themselves.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MICHAELS: The biggest
fine is a million dollars,
two million dollars.

06:55.333 --> 07:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is petty cash for these
companies that get $100 million,
$200 million, $300 million

07:02.800 --> 07:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contracts from the Defense
Department to build
ships that are protecting
the United States.

07:07.033 --> 07:09.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We need to be protecting
our workers as much as
protecting our shores.

07:09.066 --> 07:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW PAXTON, President,
Shipbuilders Council of America:
I know Navy puts a high priority

07:11.466 --> 07:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on safety, as do our shipyards
that are building those ships.

07:14.733 --> 07:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: President
of the Shipbuilders
Council of America,
Matthew Paxton, says the

07:19.233 --> 07:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government does consider safety
records when awarding contracts.

07:22.333 --> 07:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW PAXTON: I think they
take that into a whole lot of
considerations that they have

07:28.433 --> 07:29.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to figure out on
their contracting end.

07:29.933 --> 07:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's many requirements
that go into that beyond safety.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But safety's in there.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Yet,
the Navy's history of
awarding contracts to
companies with repeated

07:38.733 --> 07:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
violations suggests that
it places little emphasis
on safety records.

07:45.633 --> 07:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAVSEA, the Naval command
responsible for shipbuilding
contracts, declined an on-camera

07:51.066 --> 07:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interview, but a spokesperson
said in an e-mail that
it's up to OSHA, not
the Navy, to enforce

07:54.933 --> 07:57.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
federal safety laws.

07:57.100 --> 08:01.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They added: "We are not
the overlords of private
shipyards when it comes
to workplace safety."

08:02.866 --> 08:04.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID MICHAELS: The
Navy has the power.

08:04.866 --> 08:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can easily say, if
workers are hurt, if you don't
follow the basic commonsense

08:10.233 --> 08:12.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
safety rules, you don't
get any more contracts.

08:12.966 --> 08:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That would have a huge impact.

08:15.033 --> 08:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Former
President Obama signed
an executive order
that required companies

08:19.333 --> 08:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to disclose three years of
safety violations when vying
for large federal contracts.

08:25.533 --> 08:28.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But a federal court
blocked that order.

08:28.300 --> 08:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, this spring, Congress
drafted a resolution to
overturn it altogether.

08:32.933 --> 08:34.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:34.833 --> 08:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
