JUDY WOODRUFF: It's that time
of the year when many folks
flock to beaches, resort towns

00:04.533 --> 00:06.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and weekend getaways.

00:06.566 --> 00:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those communities can be quite
dependent on foreign workers
to help staff them through

00:10.733 --> 00:12.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the summer season.

00:12.800 --> 00:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this year has a different
kind of pressure point, as the
Trump administration has pushed

00:17.200 --> 00:20.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for some big changes
on immigration rules.

00:20.833 --> 00:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman has a look at the impact
of this supply-and-demand

00:25.500 --> 00:26.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

00:26.733 --> 00:28.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's part of his weekly
series, Making Sense.

00:28.833 --> 00:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Ah, the
iconic seaside summer
getaway Provincetown
at the tip of Cape Cod.

00:37.100 --> 00:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A single mom prison guard in
New York state, Joy McNulty,
got away here to bring up her

00:41.966 --> 00:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
four kids in a safe
place and bought a tiny
restaurant, the Lobster Pot.

00:48.933 --> 00:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Forty years later, the family
and about 100 hundred employees
serve 1,200 to 1,300 meals

00:55.033 --> 00:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a day during peak
season, prepared in the
back of the House by
six-month-a-year immigrants

00:59.733 --> 01:01.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Jamaica.

01:01.833 --> 01:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McNulty insisted I find out
for myself for how many years
they had been coming, 21 years,

01:08.066 --> 01:09.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
22 years.

01:09.266 --> 01:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're the new champ, 24.

01:12.233 --> 01:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That beats everybody.

01:14.233 --> 01:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Provincetown has a year-round
population of just under 3,000,
which swells to 10,000 in

01:19.600 --> 01:21.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the summer.

01:21.666 --> 01:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Add the estimated four to five
million tourists that visit the
Cape every year, and you have

01:25.433 --> 01:27.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
got the poster child
for peak demand.

01:27.500 --> 01:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOY MCNULTY, Owner, Lobster
Pot: How do you run a business
where all your kids work for

01:31.866 --> 01:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you, all your grandchildren
work for you, and I don't
know if I can open next year?

01:35.733 --> 01:37.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How could you do that?

01:37.866 --> 01:42.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: The problem
is getting Americans, of
any vintage, to do the
back of the housework.

01:44.433 --> 01:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So businesses here rely on
foreigners, says Jane Nichols
Bishop, known as Mama Visa to

01:48.766 --> 01:50.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the workers.

01:50.900 --> 01:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE NICHOLS BISHOP, Owner, Peak
Season Workforce: In a seasonal
economy, there are usually not

01:54.300 --> 01:58.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enough American workers
to fill all of the jobs.

01:58.266 --> 02:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're not year-round jobs.

02:00.233 --> 02:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So the Congress allowed
something called an H-2B.

02:03.300 --> 02:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Which allows
half-year work if no
one else can be found,
and must be renewed

02:10.166 --> 02:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
annually, for temporary
positions like hotel
housekeepers and
restaurant workers.

02:13.733 --> 02:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the past, Congress has
made 66,000 of these visas
available annually nationwide.

02:20.866 --> 02:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And workers with previous H-2Bs,
like almost everyone here,
could return without being

02:27.200 --> 02:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
counted against that
limit, but not this summer.

02:29.466 --> 02:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE NICHOLS BISHOP: Congress
didn't pass a returning worker
exemption in the continuing

02:36.033 --> 02:38.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
resolution to fund the
government, which is
where it's always been.

02:38.933 --> 02:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And because they didn't
do that, the number
of visas available was
greatly restricted.

02:45.900 --> 02:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there are not enough visas
for all the employers to
bring in their temporary work

02:50.300 --> 02:52.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
force.

02:52.333 --> 02:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The Department
of Homeland Security did add
another 15,000 visas last week.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But with the exemption
gone, the total number
of H-2Bs is way down.

03:03.433 --> 03:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And with employers now having
to prove irreparable harm to get
one of the additional visas, the

03:08.500 --> 03:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paperwork that might,
or might not, get a
worker in has mushroomed.

03:13.733 --> 03:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What an irony for a supposedly
anti-red tape administration,
says Congressman Bill Keating,

03:19.566 --> 03:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who represents the Cape, though,
of course, he's from a district
even bluer than its fish.

03:22.666 --> 03:24.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:24.533 --> 03:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL KEATING (D),
Massachusetts: The fix is
staring us right in the face.

03:25.766 --> 03:27.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's just raise the cap
on returning workers.

03:27.766 --> 03:29.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have done it for
the last 11 years.

03:29.766 --> 03:30.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It works.

03:30.933 --> 03:31.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But
they just did it now.

03:31.766 --> 03:32.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:32.766 --> 03:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILL KEATING: No, they didn't.

03:34.800 --> 03:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They created a whole new series
of regulations and requirements
that would scare any small

03:40.166 --> 03:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
business person into not using
this because of politics.

03:44.133 --> 03:46.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Really?

03:46.166 --> 03:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOY MCNULTY: It's impossible to
run a business when you don't
know if you're getting 43 of

03:51.366 --> 03:52.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your 96 people.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The rest of them
are all Americans.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This year, we were
open six weeks late.

03:57.366 --> 03:59.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Last week, we opened
six weeks late.

03:59.833 --> 04:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Next year, we may
not open at all.

04:02.233 --> 04:04.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We don't know.

04:04.333 --> 04:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Gui Yingling got
none of the requested 26 H-2B
workers for nearby Bubala's

04:08.833 --> 04:10.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
By the Bay.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GUI YINGLING, Bubala's By the
Bay: It's been next impossible.

04:11.266 --> 04:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have had to close days.

04:12.266 --> 04:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have had to shorten hours.

04:14.366 --> 04:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And a corollary
problem, say restaurateurs
like Yingling and Mac Hay of

04:18.333 --> 04:21.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mac's Seafood, is that
if and when they close:

04:21.466 --> 04:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAC HAY, Owner, Mac's Seafood:
I would have to lay off way
more than half of the work

04:27.200 --> 04:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
force that I have now.

04:28.166 --> 04:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: American workers.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAC HAY: An American work force.

04:31.366 --> 04:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And, look, they
say, it's not for lack of
trying, to recruit natives, that

04:34.333 --> 04:36.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

04:36.233 --> 04:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, the H-2B application
requires employers to
offer the jobs locally.

04:39.700 --> 04:42.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOY MCNULTY: I advertise
on the Internet.

04:42.633 --> 04:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I advertise in every job fair.

04:44.933 --> 04:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We advertise in every newspaper.

04:47.533 --> 04:51.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Everyone on the entire
Cape knows that we're
all looking for help.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's nobody here.

04:52.800 --> 04:57.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They will not take
seasonal dishwashing and
cook jobs for anything.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But wait a second,
counters H-2B skeptic Jessica
Vaughan of the Center for

05:02.200 --> 05:04.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Immigration Studies.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JESSICA VAUGHAN, Center
for Immigration Studies:
I don't think there's
any such thing as a

05:05.233 --> 05:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
job an American won't do.

05:07.300 --> 05:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are millions of workers
in the United States who are
not employed, and we need to

05:14.366 --> 05:17.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
find a way to match them
up with some of these
opportunities as well.

05:17.533 --> 05:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Employers just
aren't trying hard enough,
Vaughan insists, while driving

05:21.300 --> 05:24.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
down wages, and maybe
even working conditions.

05:24.433 --> 05:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More and more, she says,
teens and those with a high
school diploma at best:

05:28.033 --> 05:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSICA VAUGHAN: Employers
should look to those workers
first before they take the easy

05:34.200 --> 05:36.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
route out, and bring in
workers from overseas.

05:36.300 --> 05:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAC HAY: I have no
issue, no problem.

05:38.633 --> 05:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would prefer to do that.

05:41.233 --> 05:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trying to bring workers
from Jamaica or Mexico is
incredibly challenging,
incredibly expensive.

05:47.500 --> 05:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Mac Hay worked in
kitchens on the Cape since he
was 12, now owns six businesses,

05:52.833 --> 05:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
restaurants and seafood markets.

05:54.266 --> 05:56.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
The pay?

05:56.266 --> 06:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAC HAY: A dishwasher is
$12.50 to a cook can make $17,
$18 an hour, plus overtime.

06:01.033 --> 06:02.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Not bad.

06:02.466 --> 06:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So why aren't these
summer jobs for students?

06:04.200 --> 06:08.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAC HAY: The majority of
them leave August 12 or
August 13 or August 14.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have a 10-week season.

06:10.733 --> 06:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It runs through Labor Day.

06:12.766 --> 06:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can't lose more than half
my work force with three weeks
to go, with 30 percent of

06:17.233 --> 06:18.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my season left.

06:18.733 --> 06:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And nonstudents
who are un- or under-employed?

06:21.000 --> 06:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAC HAY: Americans, they
don't want to relocate
their life for six months.

06:25.033 --> 06:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't want to move down,
but if they're willing to do
it, I'm more than happy to hire

06:28.966 --> 06:31.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Like Joy McNulty
at the Lobster Pot, Mac Hay
utterly depends on visa workers.

06:36.133 --> 06:38.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Egan Bonny's been with
him for 10 seasons.

06:38.100 --> 06:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EGAN BONNY, Mac's Seafood: I do
cleaning, clean the restaurant
and do all kind of jobs

06:42.900 --> 06:45.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which no American kids
would come and do.

06:45.033 --> 06:47.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This grease job here,
fill the grease job.

06:47.833 --> 06:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No young kid's going to come
around and do this stuff.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Keep everything nice,
clean the bathroom.

06:52.533 --> 06:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because
they're spoiled?

06:54.133 --> 06:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EGAN BONNY: They're spoiled.

06:55.333 --> 06:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Seriously, they're spoiled.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Really?

06:58.133 --> 07:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is no wage at which
they would do these jobs?

07:01.233 --> 07:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GUI YINGLING: I have hired
every employee who has tried
to walk through the door.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have advertised.

07:06.733 --> 07:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most of them don't show up, is
the truth, once I hire them.

07:09.633 --> 07:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's pretty incredible.

07:11.166 --> 07:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have had 17 employees no-show
this season, after being hired.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, we did
run into one underemployed
American worker.

07:17.766 --> 07:19.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So what are you
doing this summer?

07:19.466 --> 07:21.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CLAIRE VAUGHAN, Student:
I'm working in a church
nursery every Sunday.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And you have
applied for other jobs.

07:23.800 --> 07:24.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLAIRE VAUGHAN:
Yes, that's right.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And?

07:26.300 --> 07:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLAIRE VAUGHAN: I have not
heard back from any of them.

07:28.300 --> 07:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Seventeen-year
old Claire Vaughan lives
about two hours from the Cape.

07:31.133 --> 07:33.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: So now,
why aren't you here?

07:33.666 --> 07:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLAIRE VAUGHAN: I didn't
know there were jobs here.

07:36.433 --> 07:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I had no idea you could do that.

07:38.833 --> 07:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Claire Vaughan
happens to be the daughter
of our immigration skeptic.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CLAIRE VAUGHAN: Now
that I know about it,
I will definitely look.

07:45.366 --> 07:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But it turned
that she, like most students,
would have to leave before

07:49.066 --> 07:50.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the season was over.

07:50.533 --> 07:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And her parents didn't want
her living on the Cape.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so we come to
the bottom line.

07:55.133 --> 07:59.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Bubala's is down 10
percent and may actually
lose money this year.

07:59.866 --> 08:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mac Hay worries about next year.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And the Lobster Pot?

08:04.233 --> 08:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the six weeks it had to
close, it bought a lot fewer
lobsters from local fishermen,

08:09.900 --> 08:12.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hired fewer Americans
for fewer hours.

08:12.033 --> 08:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOY MCNULTY: All of the
Americans are out of
work for six extra weeks.

08:16.033 --> 08:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The state doesn't get the
taxes, the vendors don't get
the work, nothing happens here,

08:22.233 --> 08:24.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the town collapses.

08:24.133 --> 08:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But my people have been with me
for 20, 25 years, a lot of them.

08:30.366 --> 08:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What harm is that to anybody?

08:32.266 --> 08:34.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We just want to
run a restaurant.

08:34.366 --> 08:39.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the
"PBS NewsHour," this is
economics correspondent
Paul Solman, reporting

08:39.233 --> 08:40.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Cape Cod.
