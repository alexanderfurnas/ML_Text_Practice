tonight:
President-elect Trump makes more
moves to

00:11.078 --> 00:17.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
set the stage for his
administration -- what
his controversial pick to head
the EPA signals

00:17.150 --> 00:18.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the future of the

00:22.956 --> 00:25.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's economic team and the
future president's
promises.

00:25.692 --> 00:30.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

front line,
the first part in our series
spotlighting

00:30.831 --> 00:35.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first generation of women

the toughest combat positions.

00:35.736 --> 00:44.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VICTORIA GOLAB-MEYER, Marine

I want to advance my career and
be in a place

00:44.645 --> 00:45.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that feels like family.

00:45.812 --> 00:48.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know that they have your
back.

00:48.282 --> 00:53.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And we
remember John Glenn,
the first U.S. astronaut to
orbit Earth, who

00:53.387 --> 00:55.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
became a national hero and
senator.

00:55.589 --> 01:03.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:03.163 --> 01:05.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.966 --> 01:16.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The nation marks
the passing
tonight of a major figure of the
20th century.

01:16.176 --> 01:20.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
John Glenn was the first
American to orbit
the planet, and the oldest
person ever to

01:21.014 --> 01:22.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
go into space.

01:22.516 --> 01:27.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He passed away today at a
hospital in Columbus,
Ohio, at the age of 95.

01:27.521 --> 01:32.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama joined in an
outpouring of
tributes, saying John Glenn
showed there's

01:32.192 --> 01:35.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no limit to the heights we can
reach together.

01:35.228 --> 01:38.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And president-elect Trump called
him a great
American hero.

01:38.198 --> 01:42.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have a full report on
his life later
in the program.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now to the presidential
transition.

01:44.705 --> 01:49.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Word of John Glenn's passing in
Columbus,
Ohio, came shortly before Donald
Trump arrived

01:49.843 --> 01:52.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the city on an already
planned trip.

01:52.679 --> 01:55.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It followed more moves to fill
out his Cabinet.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins begins our
coverage.

01:57.684 --> 02:02.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: President-elect
Trump left
New York and the transition
behind this afternoon,

02:02.689 --> 02:06.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and flew to meet with and
first-responders
to last week's Ohio State
stabbings.

02:06.460 --> 02:10.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: We just
saw the victims and the
families.

02:10.263 --> 02:16.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these were really brave
people, amazing
people.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The police and first-responders
were incredible.

02:18.872 --> 02:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This evening,
it's Iowa,
where he will continue on that
thank you tour

02:23.944 --> 02:30.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after stops North Carolina and
Ohio in the
past week, all that and more
news on his Cabinet.

02:30.650 --> 02:34.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump formally announced
Scott Pruitt,
Oklahoma's attorney general and
opponent of

02:34.788 --> 02:39.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
climate change regulations, is
his choice
to head the Environmental
Protection Agency,

02:39.926 --> 02:43.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and late today that Andy Puzder
will be the
labor secretary nominee.

02:43.797 --> 02:48.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Puzder is CEO of the company
that owns Hardee's
and the Carl's Jr. burger
chains.

02:48.168 --> 02:52.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was an early supporter of and
fund-raiser
for candidate Trump.

02:52.539 --> 02:56.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also been we know he's
critical of the
Affordable Care Act, and he
opposes raising

02:56.276 --> 02:59.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the federal minimum wage, saying
it would
mean fewer jobs.

02:59.479 --> 03:03.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW PUZDER, President &amp; CEO,
CKE Restaurants:
What are we doing if we're
locking young Americans,

03:03.283 --> 03:06.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
16-to-24 year olds, out of the
labor force?

03:06.053 --> 03:10.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a very, very serious
problem at the
moment and increasing the
minimum wage is

03:10.657 --> 03:12.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just exacerbating it.

03:12.426 --> 03:15.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This means Mr.
Trump now
has named choices for more than
half of his

03:15.562 --> 03:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cabinet, from chief of staff, to
treasury
secretary, to U.N. ambassador.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The group shows a few initial
trends.

03:22.402 --> 03:26.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearly half have been business
executives,
including four who are
billionaires.

03:26.106 --> 03:28.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A third are current elected
officials.

03:28.575 --> 03:32.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so far, the proposed Cabinet
is twice
as many men as women.

03:32.746 --> 03:37.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also today, another chapter in
that deal that
Mr. Trump struck with the
Carrier Corporation

03:37.050 --> 03:38.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to keep jobs in Indiana.

03:38.919 --> 03:44.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Local union leader Chuck Jones,
in Indianapolis,
questioned the president-elect's
claim that

03:44.057 --> 03:46.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he saved 1,100 jobs.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He said it's more like 800.

03:47.861 --> 03:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK JONES, Union Leader: I
have been in
a lot of negotiations as a union
representative,

03:53.133 --> 03:59.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so I would have to assume that
he assured
the world -- either knew the
precise numbers

03:59.773 --> 04:01.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or most certainly should've.

04:01.508 --> 04:05.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: But, on
Twitter, Mr. Trump
sharply questioned Jones'
ability to fight

04:05.445 --> 04:07.380 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for workers.

04:07.414 --> 04:10.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elsewhere, the president-elect
did win a significant
fight today over Green Party
candidate's Jill

04:10.650 --> 04:12.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Stein's recount push.

04:12.652 --> 04:17.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, a judge halted the
effort in Michigan,
saying Stein received too few
votes to force

04:17.424 --> 04:18.825 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a recount.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And a Hillary Clinton sighting.

04:20.727 --> 04:24.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, Former
U.S. Secretary
of State: This is not exactly
the speech at

04:24.164 --> 04:27.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Capitol I hoped to be giving
after the
election.

04:27.701 --> 04:32.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The former
Democratic nominee
appeared at the U.S. Capitol for
the unveiling

04:32.038 --> 04:36.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a portrait of outgoing Senate
Minority
Leader Harry Reid.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

04:38.178 --> 04:43.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
The 114th Congress scrambled to
finished its

04:43.350 --> 04:45.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
business.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The House OKed a bill to fund
the government
through next April, ahead of a
deadline tomorrow

04:48.421 --> 04:50.223 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
night.

04:50.257 --> 04:53.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It includes disaster relief for
Louisiana
and other states and aid for
Flint, Michigan's

04:53.393 --> 04:55.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
contaminated water system.

04:55.162 --> 04:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's also a waiver for
retired General
James Mattis to serve as defense
secretary,

04:59.799 --> 05:03.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even though he's been out of the
military
less than seven years.

05:03.069 --> 05:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before the vote, lawmakers on
both sides complained
about the process and the
result.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.608 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:08.642 --> 05:12.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAL ROGERS (R), Kentucky: I
truly hope that,
in the near future, we can stop
lurching from

05:13.013 --> 05:20.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
C.R. to C.R. and return to
regular order for
the sake of our national
security, our economy

05:20.587 --> 05:23.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the well-being of all
Americans.

05:23.156 --> 05:28.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, at this point, this is
our best and
only path forward.

05:28.795 --> 05:30.630 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader:
We cannot go down a path of
missed opportunities

05:33.099 --> 05:40.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and just roll over and not speak
out and say
this isn't the best that we can
do for the

05:40.106 --> 05:41.374 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
American people.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we owe them much better than
this bill.

05:43.877 --> 05:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The bill's
passage in the
Senate is still threatened by a
fight over

05:48.148 --> 05:51.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health care benefits for retired
coal miners.

05:51.351 --> 05:55.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the Senate overwhelmingly
gave final approval
to a defense policy bill today.

05:55.522 --> 06:00.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It again bars closing the prison
at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, and grants a pay
raise for the

06:00.160 --> 06:01.962 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
military.

06:01.995 --> 06:05.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senate Minority
Leader Harry
Reid delivered his final speech
to the chamber

06:05.265 --> 06:07.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

06:07.100 --> 06:11.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Nevada Democrat recalled
growing up in
a tiny town outside Las Vegas,
and ultimately

06:11.304 --> 06:13.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
joining the Senate 30 years ago.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also looked forward, speaking
about the
future of the body.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.245 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:18.278 --> 06:21.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARRY REID (D-NV), MINORITY
LEADER: I would
hope that everyone would do
everything they

06:21.781 --> 06:24.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can to protect the Senate as an
institution.

06:24.784 --> 06:29.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As part of our Constitution, it
should be
given the dignity it deserves.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I love the Senate.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't need to dwell on that.

06:32.659 --> 06:33.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I love the Senate.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I care about it so very, very
much.

06:36.396 --> 06:40.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: New York Senator
Chuck Schumer
will take over as minority
leader when the

06:40.667 --> 06:42.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:42.902 --> 06:47.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Syria,
heavy fighting
raged in Eastern Aleppo today,
as regime forces

06:47.707 --> 06:50.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pushed ever deeper into
rebel-held districts.

06:50.877 --> 06:55.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gunfire and the pounding of
airstrikes echoed
across the besieged city.

06:55.815 --> 06:59.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Government troops have now
retaken more than
three-quarters of the rebel
areas.

06:59.920 --> 07:04.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Bashar al-Assad
rejected further
truce offers today, but Russia
said U.S. and

07:04.924 --> 07:07.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian officials will meet
Saturday to discuss
the situation.

07:07.994 --> 07:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The city of Paris
spent a third
day under emergency
restrictions, in the face

07:13.333 --> 07:16.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of its worst winter pollution in
a decade.

07:16.469 --> 07:21.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A haze hung over the French
capital, and half
of all cars were barred from
traveling in

07:21.641 --> 07:24.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the city, while public
transportation was
free.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But many drivers ignored the
curbs.

07:26.780 --> 07:31.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
don't know if
it is unique to Parisians or
it's all the

07:31.351 --> 07:33.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
French, but people are a bit
selfish.

07:33.453 --> 07:37.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

JUDY WOODRUFF: The haze contains
dangerous
levels of very fine dust that
can cause heart

07:43.897 --> 07:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country, life
expectancy has declined for the
first time

07:51.171 --> 07:52.972 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in decades.

07:53.006 --> 07:56.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Centers for Disease Control

reports someone born last year
is projected

07:56.710 --> 07:59.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to live 78 years,
nine-and-a-half months.

07:59.746 --> 08:06.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a month less than for
someone born
a year earlier, and its first
drop since 1993,

08:06.386 --> 08:08.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when the AIDS epidemic was
raging.

08:08.822 --> 08:12.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Researchers cite a rise in
deaths from heart
disease and other leading
ailments.

JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. surgeon
general warned
today of growing e-cigarette use
by the nation's

08:21.801 --> 08:23.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
teenagers.

08:23.570 --> 08:28.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vivek Murthy said vaping could
create a new
generation of kids addicted to
nicotine.

08:28.274 --> 08:33.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
E-cigarettes were initially
pushed as a safer
alternative for adult smokers.

08:33.313 --> 08:38.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's already illegal to sell
them to minors,
but there is no scientific
consensus yet on

08:38.351 --> 08:40.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the risks or advantages.

08:40.220 --> 08:44.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And on Wall
Street, stocks
pushed to new highs, again, as a
post-election

08:44.491 --> 08:45.892 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
surge continued.

08:45.925 --> 08:49.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 65
points to close at 19614.

08:49.929 --> 08:54.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 23 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added four.

08:54.868 --> 08:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a major shift
at the Environmental Protection
Agency, soon

08:58.772 --> 09:05.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be run by a climate skeptic;
inside a military
camp where women are training
for combat roles;

09:05.578 --> 09:08.681 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

09:08.715 --> 09:21.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: more on
today's nomination
of Oklahoma Attorney General
Scott Pruitt

09:21.461 --> 09:23.129 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to head the EPA.

09:23.163 --> 09:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We start with a little
background on the man.

09:26.199 --> 09:31.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A leading critic of the EPA now
in line to
take its helm.

09:31.271 --> 09:37.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Oklahoma state attorney
general since 2011,
Scott Pruitt has called for
rolling back the

09:37.110 --> 09:41.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agency's efforts on climate
change and other
rule-making.

09:41.314 --> 09:46.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement today, he said:
"The American
people are tired of seeing
billions of dollars

09:46.920 --> 09:52.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drained from our economy due to
unnecessary
EPA regulations."

09:52.091 --> 09:56.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not surprisingly, his selection
drew harsh
words from a number of
Democrats.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.064 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED HUFFMAN (D), California:
Some of these
folks only qualifications for
the job that

09:59.833 --> 10:06.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have been appointed for is
that they
have attempted to dismantle and
undermine

10:06.439 --> 10:10.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and destroy the very agencies
that they are
now hoping to run.

10:10.643 --> 10:15.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Pruitt is in
synch with
president-elect Trump on a range
of issues,

10:15.882 --> 10:19.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including his skepticism about
manmade global
warming.

10:19.886 --> 10:25.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Writing in The National Review
this year,
he said: "That debate is far
from settled.

10:25.391 --> 10:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scientists continue to disagree
about the
degree and extent of global
warming."

10:30.129 --> 10:35.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the vast majority of
scientists agree
that human activity contributes
to global

10:35.301 --> 10:40.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
warming, all of which
underscores questions
about whether a Trump
administration will

10:41.007 --> 10:46.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
refuse to abide by the Paris
accords on greenhouse
gas emissions.

10:46.246 --> 10:51.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pruitt has also vigorously
fought the EPA's
Clean Power Plan, which set
unprecedented

10:51.951 --> 10:55.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
caps on carbon pollution by
power plants.

10:55.855 --> 11:01.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's repeatedly sued the
agency on the
Clean Power Plan, as well as
limits on methane

11:01.728 --> 11:04.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
emissions and other regulations.

11:04.731 --> 11:09.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Transition spokesman Sean Spicer
defended
Pruitt's approach on the
"NewsHour" last night.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, Communications
Director, Republican
National Committee: It is a very
big difference

11:11.170 --> 11:15.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to care about whether or not
we're toting
to the agenda of the far extreme
left that

11:15.909 --> 11:20.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is a job-killing,
regulation-type agenda that
wants to step out of -- put
businesses out

11:20.813 --> 11:25.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of business, or people who
actually care about
the environment and whose goal
is clean air,

11:25.718 --> 11:28.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clean water, making sure that we
preserve
our natural resources.

11:28.054 --> 11:33.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One issue in the
confirmation
hearings may be oil and gas
industry contributions

11:33.593 --> 11:35.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Pruitt's campaigns.

11:35.461 --> 11:42.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A New York Times investigation
in 2014 found
that Pruitt's office sent
letters to the EPA

11:42.435 --> 11:47.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and President Obama that were
largely written
by energy industry lobbyists.

11:47.273 --> 11:53.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pruitt, in turn, defended his
right to ally
with what he called private
sector players

11:53.446 --> 11:55.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that shared his views.

11:55.882 --> 11:59.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We get two reactions to the
nomination now
with Scott Segal.

11:59.752 --> 12:06.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He advises clients on energy,
the environment
and natural resources at
Bracewell, a law

12:06.092 --> 12:09.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and government relations firm
serving the
oil and gas industry.

12:09.762 --> 12:15.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Rhea Suh, she is president
of the Natural
Resources Defense Council, an
environmental

12:15.101 --> 12:16.970 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
advocacy group.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the "NewsHour."

12:19.372 --> 12:21.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Scott Segal, is Mr. Pruitt a
good choice?

12:21.975 --> 12:28.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT SEGAL, Bracewell: Well,
you know, he's
done a wonderful job as attorney
general of

12:28.181 --> 12:29.148 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Oklahoma.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a complicated job that he's
had to perform.

12:31.150 --> 12:32.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a resource-rich state.

12:33.019 --> 12:37.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It has a lot of its own
environmental statutes,
as well as a good track record
on enforcement

12:37.724 --> 12:39.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of federal statutes.

12:39.392 --> 12:48.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has had to balance not just
his desire
to limit federal authority under
a policy

12:48.501 --> 12:55.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of federalism, but he also
balances that with
a much larger shop that defends
consumer protection

12:55.074 --> 13:00.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the state of Oklahoma, and
even argues
against the major power
companies, making

13:00.780 --> 13:03.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sure that rate structures are
appropriate.

13:03.116 --> 13:09.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he has a very balanced record
as far as
both consumer protection and
working on regulations

13:09.489 --> 13:10.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is concerned.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have seen him in action.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's a smart guy.

13:13.059 --> 13:14.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's articulate.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think he will do a very
good job at
EPA.

13:16.362 --> 13:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rhea Suh, you
told us you were
alarmed when you heard he was
chosen.

13:20.266 --> 13:22.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RHEA SUH, President, Natural
Resources Defense
Council: It's pretty shocking to
have somebody

13:22.869 --> 13:27.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
nominated to lead the
Environmental Protection
Agency -- and, literally, the
name the Environmental

13:27.874 --> 13:33.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Protection Agency pretty much
defines what
this government entity is
responsible for.

13:33.112 --> 13:37.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's responsible for the
oversight and the
enforcement of our collective
environment

13:38.017 --> 13:41.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and protections around our
collective environment
for all of us.

13:41.220 --> 13:48.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To have somebody chosen that not
only doesn't
believe in the ability of the
agency to enforce

13:48.061 --> 13:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those things, as is evidenced by
the multiple
lawsuits that he has issued
against the EPA,

13:54.267 --> 13:59.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but doesn't believe basically in
the sanctity
of that government agency and
protecting its

13:59.072 --> 14:02.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public trust responsibilities
for all Americans,
is quite disturbing.

14:02.809 --> 14:08.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Scott
Segal, does Mr.
Pruitt believe in the mission of
the Environmental

14:08.481 --> 14:11.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Protection Agency, to protect
the environment?

14:11.217 --> 14:13.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT SEGAL: He absolutely does.

14:13.319 --> 14:19.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, he's the senior law
enforcement officer
for the state of Oklahoma's
environmental

14:19.525 --> 14:22.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protection statutes, and so he
absolutely
does believe it.

14:22.762 --> 14:28.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What he does believe, in
addition to that,
is a firm commitment to the rule
of law.

14:28.067 --> 14:32.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, frankly, some of the very
regulations
that have been referenced so
far, whether

14:32.271 --> 14:36.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's the Clean Power Plan for
power plants
or whether it's the Definition
of Waters of

14:36.843 --> 14:43.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States, have been
such a departure
from past precedent and what the
statutes

14:43.049 --> 14:47.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually say at EPA that in both
cases those
rules have been stayed.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Attorney General Pruitt has
been part
of those stays.

14:50.723 --> 14:55.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That tells me that he will keep
a watchful
eye on whether EPA does
activities that are

14:55.862 --> 14:57.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
consistent with their statutes.

14:57.797 --> 15:03.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if that is the case, then we
all win in
the long run, because we want to
have executive

15:03.703 --> 15:07.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agencies that actually abide by
the law.

15:07.273 --> 15:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their regulations will stay many
place longer
and they will be more
predictable and they

15:11.344 --> 15:13.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will end up protecting the
American people.

15:13.446 --> 15:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Rhea
Suh, if that's
the kind of thing he's going to
do, what worries

15:17.049 --> 15:18.584 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you?

15:18.618 --> 15:21.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RHEA SUH: Well, unfortunately,
there's a whole
host of things that worry us.

15:21.420 --> 15:27.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Number one, again, this agency
is responsible
for protecting public health, so
these are

15:27.894 --> 15:32.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decisions that are made every
day, both in
terms of policy, as well as in
terms of enforcement,

15:32.398 --> 15:35.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that affect the daily lives of
people.

15:35.168 --> 15:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, whether it's polluting
industries that
are not held to account, or
whether it's climate

15:39.472 --> 15:44.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change, I think the biggest of
all policy
opportunities that this
administration will

15:44.310 --> 15:50.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have, instead of taking the
mantle and really
seeing the authority and the
responsibility

15:50.883 --> 15:57.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
associated with the job, we see
this individual
walking in and turning it 180
degrees in the

15:57.790 --> 15:59.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
opposite direction.

15:59.592 --> 16:02.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, if he's
looking -- we
just heard Mr. Segal refer to
power plants

16:02.295 --> 16:04.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and refer to water.

16:04.564 --> 16:10.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there is a scaling back of
regulations
in these areas, why isn't it
still possible

16:10.269 --> 16:16.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to at least carry out some or a
large part
of what you see as the mission
of the EPA?

16:16.142 --> 16:19.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can there be a middle ground, is
what I'm
asking.

16:19.478 --> 16:25.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RHEA SUH: Well, thank goodness
that the middle
ground, I believe, is the law
and the statutes

16:25.084 --> 16:26.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the land.

16:26.919 --> 16:30.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a variety of different
laws that are
in place designed to protect
clean air, clean

16:30.857 --> 16:32.525 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
water.

16:32.558 --> 16:35.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The thing that is quite
worrisome about this
nominee in particular is that he
has gone

16:35.494 --> 16:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after those underlying statutes
and questioned
the very legitimacy of us as a
community,

16:41.500 --> 16:44.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a nation to have the right to
things like
clear air and clean water.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, make no mistake about it.

16:46.606 --> 16:52.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of radicalism, this is
something
that we have never quite seen
before in the

16:52.111 --> 16:53.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Environmental Protection Agency.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, it sounds --
Scott Segal,
Ms. Suh and others in the
environmental community

16:57.216 --> 17:05.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are worried that Mr. Pruitt is
going to do
is basically undo the bulk of
what -- in other

17:05.658 --> 17:09.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
words, the heart and soul of
these regulations
and the difference that they
make.

17:09.795 --> 17:11.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT SEGAL: Right.

17:11.297 --> 17:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just don't think there's any
evidence of
that.

17:13.599 --> 17:17.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they're going to proceed
basically
on sort of two levels.

17:17.837 --> 17:22.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first is, those regulations
which have
gone further than the underlying
statutes

17:22.275 --> 17:27.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
would allow, yes, those
regulations are probably
going to be pared back, to the
extent that

17:27.647 --> 17:32.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Attorney General Pruitt can do
so consistent
with law and public policy
concerns.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So that's going to happen.

17:34.120 --> 17:39.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Broader than that, though, EPA
must go through
regulatory reform.

17:39.425 --> 17:41.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It simply must.

17:41.260 --> 17:46.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It has for a long time
overstated the benefits
of its rules with the knowing
acquiescence

17:46.098 --> 17:51.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the major environmental
organizations in
this country, and it has done so
in a way

17:51.237 --> 17:56.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has misspent resources that
could better
protect the American public if
they were spent

17:56.075 --> 17:57.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more wisely.

17:57.643 --> 18:02.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I believe a degree of
regulatory reform
is necessary for that agency.

18:02.214 --> 18:06.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is exactly what was said on
the campaign
trail.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Regulatory reform is a critical
element.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You won't get it with using the
same old players.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that,
Rhea Suh?

18:12.591 --> 18:17.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RHEA SUH: So, I think this
language of regulatory
reform, of overstepping the
boundaries, when

18:17.430 --> 18:23.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it comes down to it, these are
the basic values
that uphold our standard of
living, our quality

18:23.903 --> 18:28.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of living, the right to drink
clean water
and to breathe clean air.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not regulatory
muckety-muck.

18:30.476 --> 18:35.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are basic values that,
again, most Americans
believe is their right.

18:35.614 --> 18:41.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we believe the Environmental
Protection
Agency has the authority and the
responsibility

18:41.454 --> 18:43.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to uphold that right for all
Americans.

18:43.723 --> 18:48.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the fact, again, that we're
seeing a nominee
come into this position that not
only doesn't

18:48.861 --> 18:55.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believe in that authority, let
alone will
take the responsibility of
upholding that

18:55.167 --> 18:58.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
authority, I think many, many
people are more
than disturbed.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's actually quite a
frightening prospect.

19:00.339 --> 19:04.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, so, much of
this is going
to be debated and discussed
during his confirmation

19:04.844 --> 19:05.811 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hearings.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we look forward to that.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rhea Suh, Scott Segal, we thank
you both.

19:10.182 --> 19:15.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RHEA SUH: Thank you.

19:15.087 --> 19:19.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT SEGAL: Thank you.

19:19.992 --> 19:25.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For decades,
women have
played important roles in the
U.S. military,

19:25.998 --> 19:30.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, until recently, they were
blocked from
front-line combat positions.

19:30.636 --> 19:36.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But under orders from the
secretary of defense,
women can now try out for all
combat jobs

19:36.242 --> 19:38.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in all services.

19:38.210 --> 19:42.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the past several months, we
have followed
three female pioneers striving
for these positions

19:42.548 --> 19:46.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
within the U.S. Marine Corps,
considered the
toughest of the services.

19:46.519 --> 19:51.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Producer Dan Sagalyn and
correspondent William
Brangham have the first of two
reports.

19:51.290 --> 19:54.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: You should be standing at
the division
of attention.

19:54.727 --> 19:59.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means your heels are
touching, feet at
a 45-degree angle.

19:59.698 --> 20:05.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Eighteen-year-old Rebekah
Wolff's life is about to turn
upside-down.

20:05.805 --> 20:11.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She and a group of fellow
recruits have just
arrived at Parris Island, South
Carolina.

20:11.110 --> 20:14.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's day one of Marine Corps
boot camp.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Your mouth is shut!

20:16.215 --> 20:17.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RECRUITS: Aye, sir!

20:17.216 --> 20:21.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: I said, do you understand
me?.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RECRUITS: Aye, sir!

20:23.589 --> 20:32.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: They now start
thirteen
weeks of grueling, disorienting,
physically

20:32.798 --> 20:35.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stressful training.

20:35.234 --> 20:39.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rebekah Wolff is one of the
young female recruits
who wants to join the fight to
go into one

20:39.538 --> 20:44.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the jobs that for generations
had been
blocked to women, until now.

20:44.043 --> 20:47.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Low-altitude air defense is what
she wants
to do.

20:47.313 --> 20:51.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's basically shooting
shoulder-fired Stinger
missiles at enemy aircraft.

20:51.717 --> 20:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what you want to be
doing, shooting
Stinger missiles?

20:53.419 --> 20:54.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REBEKAH WOLFF, Marine Corps
Recruit: Yes.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Why that?

20:55.387 --> 20:56.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REBEKAH WOLFF: Because it'd be
cool.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.791 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

20:58.824 --> 21:03.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBEKAH WOLFF: Not a lot of
females have had
that opportunity until now,
really, so that's

21:03.295 --> 21:04.396 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
exciting.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Of course,
that's a long
way off.

21:07.333 --> 21:12.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For now, she's not only got to
prove herself
at boot camp, but she will have
to pass tougher

21:12.238 --> 21:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
physical standards than females
have ever
had to meet before.

21:15.441 --> 21:21.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the first night, after
filling out some
paperwork, recruits are required
to make one

21:21.147 --> 21:22.982 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
phone call home.

21:23.015 --> 21:26.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: They're
instructed to shout
five scripted lines into the
phone, nothing

21:26.685 --> 21:27.653 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

21:27.686 --> 21:29.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Thank you for your
support!

21:29.355 --> 21:31.257 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Goodbye for now!

21:31.290 --> 21:36.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Drill
instructors intentionally
create this sense of chaos, a
miniature fog

21:36.095 --> 21:37.763 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of war.

21:37.796 --> 21:43.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They want to see how the
recruits respond,
and to shake their civilian
mind-set.

21:43.068 --> 21:44.436 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

21:44.470 --> 21:47.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER DUKE, Marine Corps: We
need to break
them down mentally.

21:47.840 --> 21:51.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to break down these
individualities
that they come with of self and
me and I.

21:51.810 --> 21:56.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to break them down to
basically nothing,
so we can build them back up,
not as one,

21:56.048 --> 21:59.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but as one team, one element to
join our Marine
Corps.

21:59.185 --> 22:00.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not my Marine Corps.

22:00.186 --> 22:01.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not his Marine Corps.

22:01.187 --> 22:02.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's our Marine Corps.

22:02.922 --> 22:07.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We first
caught up with
Rebekah Wolff earlier this
summer back home

22:07.293 --> 22:08.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in rural Maryland.

22:08.294 --> 22:11.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At the time, she was living with
her parents.

22:11.130 --> 22:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her mom and dad didn't like it
that she was
joining the Marine Corps, but
they were not

22:15.100 --> 22:16.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
surprised.

22:16.535 --> 22:20.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From an early age, Rebekah
wanted to break
the traditional girl mold.

22:20.339 --> 22:24.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: When she was young, she
said she was
always going to drive
motorcycles, drink beer,

22:24.210 --> 22:25.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
smoke cigarettes, and get
tattoos.

22:25.411 --> 22:26.612 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:26.645 --> 22:28.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I can remember her
telling me that,
oh, my goodness.

22:28.514 --> 22:32.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: How do you
feel about the
idea that your daughter might
end up in a

22:32.251 --> 22:34.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
combat unit, maybe on the front
lines somewhere?

22:34.553 --> 22:39.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT WOLFF, Father of Rebekah
Wolff: I don't
think any parent wants their
kid, boy or girl,

22:39.792 --> 22:42.261 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to go to combat.

22:42.294 --> 22:43.629 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I surely don't.

22:43.662 --> 22:47.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I feel that they shouldn't be on
the front
lines.

22:47.166 --> 22:51.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I don't know that she
fully understands
what she's getting into, though,
too, sometimes.

22:51.637 --> 22:53.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I mean, we have explained.

22:53.405 --> 22:55.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's like, well, I will be able
to shoot
helicopters.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, they do shoot back.

22:57.443 --> 22:59.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't know that she
comprehends that.

22:59.178 --> 23:01.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

23:01.080 --> 23:04.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Turns out the
Marine Corps
didn't want women in certain
combat jobs either.

23:04.950 --> 23:09.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2013, the secretary of
defense ordered
that all combat positions be
opened to women.

23:09.255 --> 23:12.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But after a period of
deliberations, the Marines
asked for an exemption.

23:12.992 --> 23:17.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They argued that putting women
into the infantry
and to other combat jobs would
make the Marine

23:17.796 --> 23:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Corps a less effective fighting
force.

23:20.499 --> 23:25.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: General Robert
Neller is
the commandant of the Marine
Corps, the highest

23:25.738 --> 23:27.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
uniformed officer.

23:27.406 --> 23:32.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says the Corps' resistance
came from a
test the Marines ran back in
2014.

23:32.378 --> 23:37.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It took all-male units and units
that mixed
men and women, and then compared
their performance

23:38.017 --> 23:39.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a series of combat drills.

23:39.518 --> 23:41.253 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

23:41.287 --> 23:41.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT NELLER, Marine Corps
Commandant: And
then we ran them through a very
physically

23:41.754 --> 23:42.721 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
demanding test.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, it was hard.

23:44.556 --> 23:48.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there was data in there that
showed, in
the aggregate, that, in certain
things, mostly

23:48.661 --> 23:53.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in load-bearing and the most
physically demanding
tasks, that the teams that have
females integrated

23:53.632 --> 23:57.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in them didn't perform at the
same levels
as the all-male team.

23:57.436 --> 24:02.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The results
showed that
male-only teams moved faster,
especially with

24:02.408 --> 24:07.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heavy loads, they fired at the
enemy more
often, hit their targets more
often, and evacuated

24:07.913 --> 24:10.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
casualties faster.

24:10.349 --> 24:14.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Integrated units, with men and
women, also
suffered more injuries.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Commandant Neller acknowledges
integrated
teams did have some advantages.

24:18.023 --> 24:19.525 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

24:19.558 --> 24:21.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT NELLER: We found that
integrated teams
did better in problem-solving.

24:21.327 --> 24:26.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why, as part of a team,
if we have
differences, any of us have
differences, it

24:26.598 --> 24:30.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can mitigated because the team
figures out,
OK, you're good at this, you do
this.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're better at this, you focus
on this.

24:32.071 --> 24:36.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The test was
criticized
by many, including the
commandant's boss,

24:36.241 --> 24:42.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the secretary of the Navy,
because it compared
highly experienced,
combat-hardened men with

24:42.114 --> 24:43.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
far less experienced women.

24:43.949 --> 24:45.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Hit him in the face!

24:45.818 --> 24:50.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But, still,
there are many
who say you don't need a study
to prove that

24:50.422 --> 24:52.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
men and women, physically, are
different.

24:52.725 --> 24:54.426 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

24:54.460 --> 24:57.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY REINWALD (RET.), Marine
Corps: You know,
the Marine Corps, we're not
idealists.

24:57.896 --> 24:59.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We're realists.

24:59.231 --> 25:01.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we know that there are
differences between
men and women.

25:01.967 --> 25:06.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I came in the Marine Corps,
I was 5'3'',
I was 110 pounds.

25:06.305 --> 25:11.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to be able to do the same
thing as my
counterpart, who was 6'1'', you
know, 180

25:11.910 --> 25:16.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pounds, lean, mean fighting
machine-type thing,
was just unrealistic, no matter
how good of

25:16.715 --> 25:18.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shape I was in at the time.

25:18.484 --> 25:22.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Retired
Colonel Mary Reinwald
spent 27 years in the Marine
Corps.

25:22.554 --> 25:26.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She now edits "Leatherneck"
magazine, which
is geared to the Marine
community.

25:26.492 --> 25:30.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She thinks women just don't
belong in certain
combat jobs because they're too
physically

25:30.963 --> 25:31.930 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
demanding.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.799 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

25:33.832 --> 25:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY REINWALD: I have no problem
saying I'm
not as physically strong as my
male counterpart.

25:35.701 --> 25:39.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I will also say that I bring
other things
to the table that he doesn't.

25:39.405 --> 25:40.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can wish all we want.

25:40.706 --> 25:43.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that doesn't mean that
everybody's going
to be the same.

25:43.175 --> 25:47.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Marines'
attempt to
keep women from certain combat
jobs was rejected

25:47.579 --> 25:53.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the defense secretary last
December, and
so now women can apply for all
combat positions

25:53.152 --> 25:58.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Marine Corps, women like
18-year-old
Lacey Elkins.

25:58.390 --> 26:02.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's from Hays, Kansas, and
she's just three
weeks from finishing boot camp.

26:02.761 --> 26:05.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's applied to operate tanks
or amphibious
assault vehicles.

26:05.998 --> 26:08.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LACEY ELKINS, Marine Corps
Recruit: College
sounded boring.

26:08.967 --> 26:10.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Marine Corps offered me a
bigger challenge.

26:10.769 --> 26:12.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My brother is a Marine.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's in Africa right now.

26:13.839 --> 26:17.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It just offered me a bigger
challenge that
I was willing to accept and push
me outside

26:17.075 --> 26:18.043 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my comfort zone.

26:18.076 --> 26:21.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what I was looking
for.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I don't know a
lot of 18-year-olds
who ever say, I want to get
pushed out of

26:23.782 --> 26:24.917 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my comfort zone.

26:24.950 --> 26:26.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You were really looking for a
challenge like
this?

26:26.685 --> 26:29.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LACEY ELKINS: Yes, sir.

26:29.121 --> 26:34.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having the opportunity to be a
part of that
generation for women was
something that I

26:34.193 --> 26:37.529 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wanted to do.

26:37.563 --> 26:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My dad, I think I nearly gave
him a heart
attack, because he started
screaming on the

26:41.700 --> 26:42.835 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
phone.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Screaming in a
good way
or a bad way?

26:44.303 --> 26:48.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LACEY ELKINS: No, he was like,
no, no, don't
even think about it..

26:48.574 --> 26:52.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Twenty-one-year-old Victoria
Golab-Meyer comes from Sheridan,
Wyoming,

26:52.110 --> 26:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and she too wants to serve in
combat as a
combat engineer.

26:56.114 --> 27:01.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We caught up with her as she was
on the Crucible,
the grueling two-day 45-mile
course that's

27:01.920 --> 27:05.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the last major training event
for every Marine
recruit.

27:05.190 --> 27:08.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VICTORIA GOLAB-MEYER, Marine
Corps Recruit:
I want to be here.

27:08.327 --> 27:10.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to be fighting for my
country.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to learn how to be
honorable.

27:12.498 --> 27:14.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want to learn to fight.

27:14.333 --> 27:19.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to advance my career and
be in a place
that feels like family.

27:19.171 --> 27:21.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know that they have your
back.

27:21.340 --> 27:25.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Part of what
sets the Marines
apart is how it trains recruits.

27:25.377 --> 27:31.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the rappel tower, at the
shooting range,
in mock combat, even in the
classrooms, the

27:31.650 --> 27:33.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sexes are divided.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Women train with women, men with
men.

27:35.787 --> 27:38.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Marines are the only service
that does
it this way.

27:38.690 --> 27:39.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

27:39.691 --> 27:40.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JENNIFER DUKE: One, it's just a
tradition.

27:40.692 --> 27:42.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's what the Marine Corps has
always done.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It takes away distraction.

27:43.161 --> 27:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most of these kids are high
school age.

27:44.596 --> 27:46.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, they're 18, 19 years
old.

27:46.098 --> 27:49.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, when you kind of get
down to boys
and girls, it's a distraction.

27:49.601 --> 27:53.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But others,
like retired
Lieutenant Colonel Kate Germano,
say this

27:53.805 --> 27:57.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
separation of the sexes is a bad
idea that
hurts females.

27:57.142 --> 27:58.110 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

27:58.143 --> 27:59.912 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

27:59.945 --> 28:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATE GERMANO (RET.), Marine
Corps: History
has shown that regardless of
where or when,

28:02.314 --> 28:04.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
separate is never equal.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is absolutely evident
on Parris Island.

28:06.618 --> 28:10.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Germano
commanded the female
battalion at Parris Island, but
she was fired

28:10.622 --> 28:15.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in 2015, accused of creating a
-- quote -- "hostile
command climate."

28:15.794 --> 28:20.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Germano says she was just
pushing to improve
the performance of women
recruits.

28:20.732 --> 28:25.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Germano says that, when she
arrived at Parris
Island, women were performing
far worse than

28:25.137 --> 28:30.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
men on a range of activities,
everything from
scores on the shooting range to
academics,

28:30.042 --> 28:33.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a disparity she attributes to
segregated training.

28:33.111 --> 28:34.079 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

28:34.112 --> 28:35.881 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

28:35.914 --> 28:38.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATE GERMANO: I didn't think it
was a matter
of the ability of the women and
physiology,

28:38.083 --> 28:42.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as much as it was a reflection
of being separate
and different.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Why does that
matter?

28:44.256 --> 28:48.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why does it matter if you get
trained how
to shoot, how to navigate, how
to do any of

28:48.327 --> 28:52.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those military jobs, and you and
I do it separately,
you as a woman, me as a man?

28:52.698 --> 28:53.665 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why does differ?

28:53.699 --> 28:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why does that make a difference?

28:54.700 --> 28:55.667 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

28:55.701 --> 28:57.436 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATE GERMANO: Because what ends
up happening
is there becomes this perception
that women

28:59.605 --> 29:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are trained differently from the
men and that
it's easier for them, because
the male recruits

29:04.276 --> 29:09.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the male drill instructors
never really
see those females putting out
their maximum

29:09.147 --> 29:11.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
effort and pushing themselves.

29:11.383 --> 29:16.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Women are absolutely capable of
performing
in extraordinary ways, if high
expectations

29:17.022 --> 29:18.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
become the norm.

29:18.790 --> 29:23.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Commandant
Neller says full
integration takes place after
boot camp.

29:23.061 --> 29:28.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While he says the Marines are
looking into
some further integration now, he
feels separate

29:28.400 --> 29:29.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
training has advantages.

29:29.668 --> 29:31.536 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

29:31.570 --> 29:35.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT NELLER: We believe the
way we do recruit
training sets women and men up
for success,

29:35.173 --> 29:38.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that they're able to,
particularly at the
beginning, move at their own
rate, at their

29:38.443 --> 29:40.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
own speed, build confidence.

29:40.512 --> 29:43.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, as we go further down,
they end
up training together.

29:43.715 --> 29:48.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tomorrow
night, we will
see how the three recruits we
met made it

29:48.353 --> 29:49.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through boot camp.

29:50.022 --> 29:54.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Will they pass the tough
physical standards
required to make it to the front
lines?

29:54.860 --> 29:59.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Parris Island, South
Carolina.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Fascinating.

30:01.333 --> 30:06.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will have more online on
the chaos
and disorientation of that first
night of

30:06.538 --> 30:07.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
boot camp.

30:07.606 --> 30:13.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can watch a video on that at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
journalist's
take on getting your news from
Facebook; plus,

30:29.428 --> 30:32.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
remembering pioneering astronaut
John Glenn.

30:32.764 --> 30:38.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, first, economics
correspondent Paul Solman
looks at how Donald Trump's long
business

30:38.637 --> 30:43.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
career, especially his
relationship with Wall
Street, may be shaping the way
he to fills

30:43.508 --> 30:45.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
top slots in his administration.

30:45.977 --> 30:48.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Its part of our weekly series
Making Sense.

30:48.313 --> 30:49.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: I know
Wall Street.

30:49.948 --> 30:54.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The Trump campaign
refrain from
the get-go: Beware of Wall
Street.

30:54.553 --> 30:57.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I'm not going to
let Wall Street
get away with murder.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Wall Street has caused
tremendous problems
for us.

30:59.491 --> 31:05.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And yet, within
weeks of winning,
the president-elect has let
bygones be bygones,

31:05.197 --> 31:10.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raiding the Street for top
economic posts
in his administration to be,
like Wilbur Ross

31:10.635 --> 31:17.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for commerce secretary, a
vulture investor
to some, a company savior to
others, and former

31:17.509 --> 31:22.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Goldman Sachs executive Steve
Mnuchin for
treasury secretary.

31:22.581 --> 31:27.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We sought out longtime Wall
Street investment
banker turned investigative
journalist William

31:27.352 --> 31:29.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
D. Cohan to put the picks in
context.

31:29.821 --> 31:30.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN, Author, "House Of
Cards: A
Tale Of Hubris And Wretched
Excess On Wall

31:30.989 --> 31:34.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Street": Steve Mnuchin and
Wilbur Ross are
deal guys.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are Wall Street deal guys.

31:36.528 --> 31:37.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What is a deal guy?

31:37.896 --> 31:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN: That means that
you are very
transactional.

31:42.033 --> 31:49.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Steve Mnuchin's case, he made
his fortune
by buying a bank that the FDIC
had foreclosed

31:49.875 --> 31:56.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
upon during the financial crisis
of 2008,
renamed it OneWest, and sold it
eventually

31:56.715 --> 32:02.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to CIT, that was run by another
ex-Goldman
banker named John Thain.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they all made billions as a
result.

32:05.457 --> 32:12.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wilbur Ross did the same thing
buying a business
that was in the ashes of the
financial crisis

32:13.031 --> 32:15.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and, like a phoenix,
resurrecting it from
the ashes.

32:15.667 --> 32:21.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But isn't a major
reason that
Donald Trump got elected the
idea that he

32:21.239 --> 32:25.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was the ultimate change agent,
that he would
disrupt things as they are?

32:25.710 --> 32:29.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, who better than deal-makers
to do that?

32:29.414 --> 32:35.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN: Absolutely, the
selection of
Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross
fit into this

32:35.287 --> 32:38.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vision of people who cut through
bureaucracy.

32:38.256 --> 32:44.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you know, one of Trump's
great accomplishments
is, you know, fixing Wollman
Rink in Central

32:44.462 --> 32:45.430 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Park.

32:45.463 --> 32:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The skating -- the
skating rink.

32:46.565 --> 32:47.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN: The skating rink.

32:47.532 --> 32:48.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

32:48.934 --> 32:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I got together
with everybody,
the city, the council.

32:50.602 --> 32:51.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everything had to be done fast.

32:51.703 --> 32:52.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we got it done.

32:52.904 --> 32:54.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you can do that with this
country.

32:54.272 --> 32:58.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN: Is America
Wollman Rink?

32:58.276 --> 33:00.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't think so.

33:00.111 --> 33:04.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: No, America isn't
Wollman Rink,
but I think almost everybody
watching, and

33:04.950 --> 33:13.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainly the people who voted
for him, have
had frustrating experiences with
bureaucrats

33:13.692 --> 33:19.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and bureaucracy, private as well
as public,
pushing them around.

33:19.064 --> 33:24.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN: It's really hard
to know what
a Steve Mnuchin or a Wilbur Ross
will do.

33:24.135 --> 33:31.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, their firms, they're
small, 10, 20,
30 people.

33:31.409 --> 33:33.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now they're commanding
battleships.

33:33.612 --> 33:36.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Treasury has 80,000 people.

33:36.081 --> 33:37.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Commerce has 50,000 people.

33:37.616 --> 33:43.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, you have to start
miles away to
turn a battleship around.

33:43.421 --> 33:48.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's nothing in their
background, nothing,
that would indicate that they
would have any

33:48.960 --> 33:51.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
skill at running these
bureaucracies.

33:51.329 --> 33:58.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Is there anything
in their background
or in their personalities that
would suggest

33:58.870 --> 34:09.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they can further Donald Trump's
populist ambition,
that is, serving the people who
elected him?

34:09.848 --> 34:15.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN: I'm laughing
because Steve
Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross are
about as far from

34:15.654 --> 34:18.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
populism as you can possibly
imagine.

34:19.024 --> 34:23.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are the .001 percent of the
1 percent.

34:23.194 --> 34:27.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the biggest ironies
of the fact
that he's surrounded himself
with all these

34:27.098 --> 34:32.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Goldman Sachs people is that
Goldman Sachs
-- he was on the Goldman Sachs
do-not-fly

34:32.203 --> 34:35.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
list: This is the kind of client
we do not
want at Goldman Sachs.

34:35.573 --> 34:36.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: How do you know
that?

34:36.808 --> 34:40.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN: Because I wrote a
book about
Goldman Sachs.

34:41.012 --> 34:45.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know that, from talking to
people at
Goldman Sachs, that he is the
poster child

34:45.517 --> 34:50.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the kind of client they
don't want to
do business with, mainly because
he would

34:50.455 --> 34:54.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
borrow all this money from Wall
Street to
build his casinos, and then
didn't pay it

34:54.392 --> 34:56.194 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
back.

34:56.227 --> 34:59.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: One big bank that
did lend to
Trump in recent years was
Deutsche Bank, in

34:59.631 --> 35:05.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
2005, to build the Trump
International Hotel
and Tower in Chicago.

35:05.070 --> 35:09.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Steve Mnuchin's hedge fund also
lent money
to the project.

35:10.008 --> 35:13.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2008, at the height of the
financial crisis,
a big payment came due.

35:13.945 --> 35:17.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN: We're talking
$330 million
payment that was due.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He just decided he didn't want
to pay it.

35:19.951 --> 35:27.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He sued Deutsche Bank, as well
as all the
other lenders, including Steve
Mnuchin's Dune

35:27.325 --> 35:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Capital, claiming that he didn't
have to pay
the money back because an act of
God had occurred,

35:34.899 --> 35:40.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this financial crisis, caused by
the very
people who lent him the money
for this project,

35:40.372 --> 35:42.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, therefore, he didn't have
to pay it back.

35:42.907 --> 35:49.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the one firm on Wall Street
that would
do business with him, he turns
around and

35:49.147 --> 35:50.949 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sues.

35:50.982 --> 35:54.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Cohan worked on
Wall Street for
17 years, and has been writing
about it ever

35:54.753 --> 36:00.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since, in bestsellers like "The
Last Tycoons,"
"House of Cards," and that book
on Goldman

36:00.558 --> 36:03.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sachs, "Money and Power."

36:03.161 --> 36:06.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's interviewed Donald Trump
for magazine
articles.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What was he like to interview?

36:07.732 --> 36:09.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN: Very charming,
very funny.

36:09.267 --> 36:14.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He once, you know, told me I had
a great head
of hair, like him, by the way.

36:14.139 --> 36:20.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing that I talked to him
about was how
everybody on Wall Street had
told me that

36:20.145 --> 36:21.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he cheats at golf.

36:21.613 --> 36:23.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, you mean you
asked him, do
you cheat at golf?

36:23.815 --> 36:24.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN: Of course.

36:24.949 --> 36:26.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I said -- of course I asked him,
do you cheat
at golf?

36:26.484 --> 36:29.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said: "No, William, I
don't cheat at
golf.

36:29.621 --> 36:33.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm a scratch golfer," and, of
course, "I
have all these country clubs
that I own.

36:33.525 --> 36:34.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why would I cheat at golf?"

36:34.759 --> 36:36.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And you didn't
believe him?

36:36.694 --> 36:42.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN: No, I didn't
believe him, because
subsequent to that, a friend of
mine was playing

36:42.300 --> 36:45.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with him in a foursome that day
and saw him
cheat at golf.

36:45.236 --> 36:47.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He shanked the ball off to the
right.

36:47.272 --> 36:53.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he would sort of parade
up the middle
of the fairway with his caddy 20
feet behind

36:53.344 --> 36:57.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him, and then say: "Oh, Mr.
Trump, Mr. Trump,
your ball, I found it.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's right here in the middle of
the fairway."

36:59.050 --> 37:03.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you're surrounded by
yes-men, when you're
surrounded by people telling you
how great

37:03.254 --> 37:07.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you are all the time, then you
lose perspective.

37:07.392 --> 37:13.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My point is, it's very different
running your
own private company, where
you're the boss,

37:13.998 --> 37:15.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you're the king.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's not even a board of
directors.

37:18.369 --> 37:21.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is Donald Trump all the time.

37:21.906 --> 37:27.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's used to telling them
what to do,
and if they don't do it, he gets
very angry

37:27.178 --> 37:28.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and he makes sure that it gets
done.

37:28.913 --> 37:32.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But from the point
of view of
his constituency, that's not a
bad thing,

37:32.117 --> 37:33.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is it?

37:33.952 --> 37:38.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN: I think that's a
very different
skill set than the one that's
required to

37:38.690 --> 37:44.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get your policies through
Congress at a very
divisive moment in American
history.

37:44.896 --> 37:49.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But make America
great is about,
hey, this country's in trouble.

37:49.634 --> 37:54.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
By doing things the
old-fashioned way, I'm
going to bring in people,
deal-makers, who

37:54.372 --> 37:56.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know how to change things
dramatically.

37:56.174 --> 38:01.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN: And that is the
premise that
allowed him to stitch together
an Electoral

38:01.079 --> 38:02.847 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
College victory.

38:02.881 --> 38:06.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, then why isn't
it a good
thing that he's got Wilbur Ross,
Steve Mnuchin

38:06.217 --> 38:09.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and whoever else he gets from
Wall Street
in his administration?

38:09.154 --> 38:14.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN: They may turn out
to be just
what we're looking for.

38:14.292 --> 38:20.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if these Cabinet appointees
that he's
named, who have this kind of
experience about

38:20.365 --> 38:26.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting things done, and who
know how the
capital markets work, if they
can, all together,

38:26.204 --> 38:32.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do that, then I will be the
first one marching
at the front of the line to get
Donald Trump,

38:32.577 --> 38:39.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, reelected and say he
turned out
to be a lot better than anybody
thought.

38:39.984 --> 38:44.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But as somebody
who's known him
and reported on him, you're
skeptical?

38:44.489 --> 38:45.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN: I'm skeptical.

38:45.890 --> 38:48.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm hoping he doesn't turn out
to be the guy
who cheats at golf.

38:48.393 --> 38:50.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: William D. Cohan,
thanks very
much.

38:50.361 --> 38:57.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM COHAN: Thanks for having
me.

38:57.202 --> 39:07.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another in
our Brief
But Spectacular series, where we
ask interesting

39:07.478 --> 39:09.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people to share their passions.

39:09.414 --> 39:14.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from news media
critic and
New York University journalism
professor Jay

39:14.219 --> 39:15.954 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Rosen.

39:15.987 --> 39:20.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He runs the Web site
PressThink.org, and he
offers his views on the state of
journalism

39:20.858 --> 39:22.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the age of Facebook.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAY ROSEN, Professor of
Journalism, New York
University: Twenty-five years
ago, we would

39:24.495 --> 39:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been in a studio somewhere
with 13 people
around.

39:28.600 --> 39:33.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're recording this with a
single cameraman
and his mom, who's holding the
microphone.

39:33.638 --> 39:39.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here, we have got our journalist
in another
city asking questions remotely.

39:39.410 --> 39:45.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's becoming easier to make
media, just at
the same time that the network
of news is

39:45.183 --> 39:52.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expanding to include everyone
with a cell
phone all over the world.

39:52.724 --> 40:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, what I think we really
need is a press
that can sometimes say to us,
hey, you may

40:02.433 --> 40:06.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not think this is interesting,
but it's really
important.

40:06.871 --> 40:09.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Journalists have to give us that
kind of message
sometimes.

40:09.374 --> 40:16.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some people say the problem is
that people
are always listening to voices
that they already

40:16.814 --> 40:18.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
agree with on social media.

40:18.816 --> 40:25.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things journalists
are really struggling
with about Facebook is that it
has, in a way,

40:25.323 --> 40:29.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
replaced their relationship with
users of
the news.

40:29.694 --> 40:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead of going to their
favorite news site,
just find new stories in their
Facebook news

40:35.266 --> 40:36.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
feed.

40:36.501 --> 40:39.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That has given Facebook a huge
role in the
news system.

40:39.570 --> 40:45.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can't really ask Facebook the
kind of questions
we would ask an editor in chief,
because it

40:45.977 --> 40:47.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
doesn't have one.

40:47.745 --> 40:52.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you sign up for a Facebook
account, you
have to agree to this long list
that most

40:52.116 --> 40:53.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people don't read.

40:53.184 --> 40:55.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's thin legitimacy.

40:55.119 --> 40:58.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thick legitimacy is when you
really understand
the deal.

40:58.489 --> 41:04.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, at some point, they may
realize that
thick legitimacy is what they
need to keep

41:04.395 --> 41:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
operating, because people trust
Facebook.

41:08.700 --> 41:12.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They advertise their life on
this platform.

41:12.337 --> 41:17.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, so, trust is actually a
huge part of
the Facebook business.

41:17.508 --> 41:22.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they don't think, in my
opinion, hard
enough about how to maintain
that trust.

41:22.847 --> 41:29.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's really important
for people to
understand that we're not going
to have serious

41:29.253 --> 41:33.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
journalism unless you choose it.

41:33.491 --> 41:39.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Choosing serious journalism is
related to
an even more serious choice we
have, which

41:39.197 --> 41:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is choosing to continue to be a
democracy.

41:42.567 --> 41:45.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democracy is not a spectator
sport.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a participant thing.

41:47.739 --> 41:52.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Jay Rosen, and this
is my Brief
But Spectacular take on
journalism.

41:52.777 --> 41:57.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can watch
additional
Brief But Spectacular episodes
on our Web

41:57.181 --> 41:59.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
site, PBS.org/NewsHour/Brief.

41:59.717 --> 42:05.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally
tonight: remembering
John Glenn, the Mercury
astronaut and former

42:05.723 --> 42:08.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. senator who died today at
95.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We start with this look back.

42:10.328 --> 42:12.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Godspeed, John Glenn.

42:12.196 --> 42:14.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: February 20,
1962.

42:14.832 --> 42:16.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Nine, eight.

42:16.334 --> 42:20.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: An Atlas
rocket fired Friendship
7 into space.

42:20.405 --> 42:26.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And over the next five hours,
John Glenn's
name was indelibly inscribed in
history, the

42:26.110 --> 42:29.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first American to orbit the
Earth circling
the globe three times.

42:29.981 --> 42:33.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN GLENN, NASA Astronaut: Zero
g and I feel
fine.

42:33.451 --> 42:34.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Capsule is turning around.

42:34.852 --> 42:36.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Oh, that view is tremendous.

42:36.587 --> 42:38.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: The honorable John Glenn.

42:38.322 --> 42:39.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

42:39.791 --> 42:41.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It was still
fresh in his
mind half-a-century later.

42:41.826 --> 42:48.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN GLENN: For many, many
thousands of years,
people had looked up and
wondered.

42:48.232 --> 42:54.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They'd been curious about what
was up there.

42:54.172 --> 42:59.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, we must consider ourselves
among the
most fortunate of all
generations, for we

42:59.811 --> 43:03.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have lived at a time when the
dream became
a reality.

43:04.015 --> 43:08.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: John Glenn's
time began
in Ohio, where he was born and
raised.

43:08.853 --> 43:14.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He grew up to be a highly
decorated Marine
fighter pilot in World War II
and Korea.

43:14.091 --> 43:19.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as a military test pilot,
he set a transcontinental
speed record in 1957.

43:19.597 --> 43:23.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Then, space beckoned.

43:23.401 --> 43:30.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That same year, the Soviet Union
stunned the
world with Sputnik, the first
manmade satellite.

43:30.808 --> 43:38.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More Soviet successes followed,
while initial
U.S. unmanned launches met with
repeated failure.

43:38.883 --> 43:43.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Soviets also leaped ahead in
manned flight
with cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin
making the first

43:43.821 --> 43:48.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
orbital flight ever in April
1961.

43:48.960 --> 43:51.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Glenn was still training at that
point.

43:51.429 --> 43:56.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the first astronauts, the
Mercury 7,
he spoke of them at Cape
Canaveral in 2012.

43:56.367 --> 44:01.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN GLENN: That was a real team
we put -- it
was put together back in those
days.

44:01.372 --> 44:07.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while we were competitors,
boy, were we
competitors to try and get the
different flights,

44:07.778 --> 44:12.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
never was there anything anymore
tight than
the brotherhood we had that
supported each

44:12.517 --> 44:14.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one of those flights.

44:14.418 --> 44:19.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Glenn's moment
came in early
1962, when he crammed his
silver-suited frame

44:19.290 --> 44:21.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into the tiny Friendship 7
capsule.

44:21.459 --> 44:23.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN GLENN: We used to joke
about the spacecraft.

44:23.227 --> 44:27.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We said, you didn't climb -- you
didn't get
into it, you actually put it on.

44:27.298 --> 44:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was more like putting on
clothes.

44:29.066 --> 44:34.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was that small, because the
whole thing,
if you spread your arms out like
that, the

44:34.872 --> 44:37.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- you were touching both sides
of the spacecraft.

44:37.642 --> 44:42.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: People around
the world
watched, but few knew the danger
unfolding

44:42.547 --> 44:44.382 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
above.

44:44.415 --> 44:48.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The capsule's automated steering
system jammed
and ground controllers worried
the heat shield

44:48.185 --> 44:50.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was tearing away on reentry.

44:50.855 --> 44:55.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Glenn's life depended on that
shield, but
he told Judy Woodruff in 2012
his job was

44:55.860 --> 44:57.161 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to stay focused.

44:57.194 --> 44:59.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN GLENN: You just keep right
on working
right on through it.

44:59.196 --> 45:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if something is going the
happen, the
worst thing you could do would
be panicky

45:02.366 --> 45:03.868 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in there.

45:03.901 --> 45:06.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I just kept on working as we
had trained,
and everything worked out OK.

45:06.604 --> 45:08.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: OK, does the capsule look
like it's OK?

45:08.973 --> 45:09.941 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Over.

45:09.974 --> 45:11.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Much more than
OK.

45:11.809 --> 45:17.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Glenn returned to Earth an
American hero,
feted with parades and elaborate
receptions.

45:17.448 --> 45:21.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President John F. Kennedy
presented him with
a NASA Service Medal, and, three
days later,

45:21.886 --> 45:23.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he addressed Congress.

45:23.754 --> 45:28.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN GLENN: I am only too aware
of the tremendous
honor that is being show us at
this joint

45:28.559 --> 45:30.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meeting of the Congress today.

45:30.328 --> 45:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has been a great experience
for all of
us on the program and for all
Americans, I

45:35.366 --> 45:37.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
guess, too.

45:37.201 --> 45:41.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm certainly glad to see
that pride in
our country and its
accomplishments are not

45:41.238 --> 45:42.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a thing of the past.

45:42.640 --> 45:46.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The space
program moved
on, and so did Glenn.

45:46.377 --> 45:51.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He resigned from NASA in 1964
and eventually
entered politics.

45:51.515 --> 45:57.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 1974, he was elected to the
U.S. Senate
from Ohio as a Democrat and
became chief author

45:57.722 --> 46:00.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Act.

46:00.458 --> 46:05.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 1984, he made a run for the
White House,
but he withdrew after poor
showings in the

46:05.596 --> 46:07.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
early Democratic primaries.

46:07.331 --> 46:10.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ultimately, he served four terms
in the Senate.

46:10.368 --> 46:12.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Three, two, one.

46:12.069 --> 46:17.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, in 1998,
in his final
months in office, he returned to
space on

46:17.742 --> 46:19.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
board the shuttle Discovery.

46:19.710 --> 46:26.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That earned him another first,
at 77, the
oldest person to fly into space.

46:26.117 --> 46:30.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After his Senate years, Glenn
and his wife,
Annie, worked to promote civics
education,

46:30.221 --> 46:35.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
establishing the John Glenn
College of Public
Affairs at Ohio State University
in Columbus.

46:36.027 --> 46:40.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But his abiding interest in
space was never
far away.

46:40.231 --> 46:44.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The aging astronaut sharply
criticized President
George W. Bush's decision to
phase out the

46:44.969 --> 46:46.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
space shuttle program.

46:46.303 --> 46:50.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: Two, one, zero, and
liftoff, the final
liftoff of Atlantis.

46:50.708 --> 46:57.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The final
flight took place
in 2011, and Glenn voiced his
views in his

46:57.581 --> 46:59.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"NewsHour" interview the next
year.

46:59.550 --> 47:03.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN GLENN: We do not have an
American spacecraft
on which we can go into space to
get our people

47:03.854 --> 47:08.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up there to the International
Space Station,
to do the research it was built
to do.

47:08.225 --> 47:10.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we spent over $100 billion
on that.

47:10.327 --> 47:14.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we should have had a
continuity and a
program that would let us build,
research,

47:14.465 --> 47:18.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that the research we do up
there is of
benefit to everybody right here
on Earth.

47:18.069 --> 47:19.770 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

47:19.804 --> 47:21.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), House
Minority Leader:
We will present a gold medal on
behalf of

47:21.472 --> 47:23.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States Congress to
the honorable
John Glenn.

47:24.008 --> 47:28.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Late in life,
he as still
being honored, receiving the
Congressional

47:28.212 --> 47:34.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gold Medal in 2011, along with
fellow astronauts
Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong and
Michael Collins.

47:34.518 --> 47:40.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in 2012, he was awarded the
Presidential
Medal of Freedom, the nation's
highest civilian

47:40.925 --> 47:42.693 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
honor.

47:42.727 --> 47:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Glenn lived out his final
years in Ohio
after suffering a small stroke.

47:48.799 --> 47:52.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the career and life
of John Glenn,
I am joined by science
correspondent Miles

47:52.136 --> 47:56.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
O'Brien, who came to know Glenn
through his
years of reporting on aviation.

47:56.107 --> 47:59.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Miles, it's the beginning of the
end of an
era.

47:59.577 --> 48:01.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It is, Hari.

48:01.645 --> 48:06.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't help but look at a guy
like that
and say, one of the last of the
great American

48:06.350 --> 48:08.219 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
heroes.

48:08.252 --> 48:14.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a guy who, whatever he
did, he succeeded
to levels few of us can ever
aspire to, and

48:14.658 --> 48:19.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yet, all the while, was one of
the nicest
people you would ever want to
meet, despite

48:19.130 --> 48:21.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his relentless and competitive
nature.

48:21.832 --> 48:23.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a hard mix.

48:23.567 --> 48:26.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he managed to do it, and he
managed to
do it really right to the end.

48:26.537 --> 48:27.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He never really quit.

48:27.705 --> 48:29.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He never retired.

48:29.073 --> 48:30.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He always had a mission.

48:30.241 --> 48:32.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You got to
know him personally.

48:32.076 --> 48:34.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You even flew with him in your
small plane?

48:34.111 --> 48:36.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes, I cooked up
a scheme for
a story.

48:36.714 --> 48:40.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had met him during the 1998
flight on the
shuttle, when I had the
opportunity to cover

48:40.785 --> 48:45.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him and have no less than Walter
Cronkite
as my co-anchor on CNN.

48:45.055 --> 48:47.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I consider myself very lucky to
have had that
experience.

48:47.758 --> 48:52.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, some years later, we were
doing a story
on technology and aviation, and
I got the

48:52.296 --> 48:56.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
idea in my head that it would be
kind of fun
to see what Senator Glenn
thought about the

48:56.867 --> 48:57.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
technology.

48:58.002 --> 48:59.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It happened to be in the
aircraft I owned
at the time.

48:59.804 --> 49:05.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I flew it to Columbus, and I had
John Glenn
get in my airplane and fly with
me.

49:05.342 --> 49:09.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have got to tell you,
Hari, I have never
had a more nervous landing in my
life.

49:09.580 --> 49:12.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as the term in aviation is,
I greased
it.

49:12.683 --> 49:15.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he was -- he could not have
been more
complimentary to me.

49:15.286 --> 49:19.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was the nicest passenger you
could ever
hope for, and yet the most
intimidating at

49:19.290 --> 49:21.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the same time.

49:21.058 --> 49:24.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He's almost a
time capsule
in a way of the relations
between America

49:24.195 --> 49:28.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the world, and what he meant
to the space
program, what he meant to
aviation at the

49:28.165 --> 49:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time, especially in the context
of the Cold
War.

49:30.034 --> 49:31.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Absolutely, Hari.

49:31.802 --> 49:37.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you think of NASA and what
the space
program is all about, it was
kind of a Cold

49:37.107 --> 49:40.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
War projection of soft power of
the United
States.

49:40.144 --> 49:42.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he was the perfect poster
boy for that.

49:42.947 --> 49:50.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was everything that we -- was
considered
the ideal in this country,
small-town ethics,

49:50.855 --> 49:56.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, handsome guy, the
whole -- really
central casting kind of thing.

49:56.260 --> 50:01.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was the guy, somewhat at
least, with some
drama, depicted in "The Right
Stuff" in the

50:01.298 --> 50:06.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mid-'80s, sort of the, for lack
of a better
term, Goody Two-Shoes of the
Mercury 7.

50:06.971 --> 50:10.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While the rest of them might
have been out
carousing late into the night,
he was with

50:10.674 --> 50:17.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his longtime wife, who actually
he met first
in preschool, Annie, and lived a
much more

50:17.982 --> 50:19.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
quiet experience in life.

50:19.783 --> 50:21.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And he went on
to serve
after as well.

50:21.986 --> 50:24.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: He did, indeed.

50:24.121 --> 50:29.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The chapters of his life are
amazing, Marine
Corps fighter pilot in Korea
with numerous

50:29.860 --> 50:39.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kills to his record, set a
cross-country transcontinental
supersonic record as a Marine
test pilot in

50:39.236 --> 50:44.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the '50s, goes on to be the
Mercury 7, then
has this brief chapter as the
president of

50:44.642 --> 50:49.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Royal Crown Cola, then gets into
politics
for 24 years, and then goes on
to build this

50:49.847 --> 50:53.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
amazing public policy school at
Ohio State
University.

50:53.617 --> 50:58.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each chapter, he just rose to
the absolute
top level, and made it always
look effortless,

50:58.822 --> 51:00.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at least as far as I could see.

51:00.291 --> 51:02.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

51:02.059 --> 51:05.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even as we saw in the clips
there, he
was still advocating for a more
active role

51:05.229 --> 51:07.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the space program.

51:07.064 --> 51:10.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You know, when
George Bush
announced the retirement of the
space shuttle,

51:10.801 --> 51:13.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he was calling me a lot.

51:13.537 --> 51:19.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was advocating, in a very
forceful
and clear way, for the United
States still

51:19.043 --> 51:22.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
having the ability to carry its
own astronauts
to space.

51:22.346 --> 51:23.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he wasn't going to let that
go.

51:23.514 --> 51:24.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was very upset about it.

51:24.949 --> 51:28.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was well into his 80s at this
point, but
he was still in the game.

51:28.585 --> 51:30.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

51:30.187 --> 51:32.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know if we have footage,
or if it's
a shot of you and him in a
plane.

51:32.856 --> 51:35.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's see if we can show that to
our audience
as well.

51:35.492 --> 51:39.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, while we're
playing it,
I got to tell you one story I
just heard,

51:39.596 --> 51:41.365 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hari.

51:41.398 --> 51:45.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Annie Glenn, his beloved wife of
more than
70 years, who is 96 and a bit
frail, today,

51:45.869 --> 51:49.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're told, upon hearing the
news, what did
Annie Glenn do?

51:49.473 --> 51:54.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She went to the supermarket to
buy food because
she is anticipating a lot of
guests.

51:54.678 --> 51:56.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Oh.

51:56.213 --> 52:00.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, that tells
you a little
something about her and them.

52:00.050 --> 52:03.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were an inseparable and
wonderful pair.

52:03.821 --> 52:07.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he -- you know, talk about a
life well-lived.

52:08.025 --> 52:08.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What more can you say?

52:08.993 --> 52:10.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where did he go wrong?

52:10.127 --> 52:11.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can't think of it.

52:11.829 --> 52:16.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Miles O'Brien,
thanks so much for joining us
tonight.

52:16.767 --> 52:23.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome.

52:23.941 --> 52:32.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, having known
John Glenn,
I can second everything Miles
said about him.

52:32.416 --> 52:34.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a correction before we go
tonight.

52:34.852 --> 52:39.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We reported earlier that a
stopgap spending
bill includes a waiver for
retired General

52:39.690 --> 52:42.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
James Mattis to serve as defense
secretary.

52:42.693 --> 52:45.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, it's a provision only
to speed up
action.

52:45.763 --> 52:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The waiver itself would still
need congressional
approval.

52:49.666 --> 52:54.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: For more
than two years, an
Egyptian-American humanitarian

52:54.405 --> 52:57.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worker has been held on charges
in Egypt.

52:57.941 --> 53:01.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We explore efforts by her family
and others
to free her.

53:01.578 --> 53:07.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, a columnist considers how
widespread
digitization has created
vulnerabilities for

53:07.317 --> 53:11.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our nation and the need to
better protect
ourselves from cyber-risks.

53:11.955 --> 53:14.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:14.458 --> 53:19.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tune in later
tonight on
"Charlie Rose": a conversation
with Brian

53:19.129 --> 53:21.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Moynihan, CEO of Bank of
America.

53:21.432 --> 53:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:22.599 --> 53:23.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

53:23.600 --> 53:25.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

53:25.302 --> 53:28.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening
with Mark Shields and David
Brooks.

53:28.338 --> 53:34.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

53:34.578 --> 53:38.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
