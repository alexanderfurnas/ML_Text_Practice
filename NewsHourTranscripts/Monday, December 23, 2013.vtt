12:40.199 --> 12:41.560
BUT THERE ARE ALSO SERIOUS      
POTENTIAL DANGERS.              
AND THEREFORE THE IDEA IS TO    

12:41.562 --> 12:43.620
POTENTIAL DANGERS.              
AND THEREFORE THE IDEA IS TO    
FIND A WAY TO BALANCE THESE

AND THEREFORE THE IDEA IS TO    
FIND A WAY TO BALANCE THESE     
TWO INTERESTS IN A WAY THAT

MAXIMIZES THE NECESSARY

AND SO OUR CONCLUSION IS NOT    
THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO

THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO

AND ALSO WE RECOMMEND THAT      
THE GOVERNMENT NOT BE ABLE

AND ALSO WE RECOMMEND THAT      
THE GOVERNMENT NOT BE ABLE      
TO ACCESS THE INFORMATION       

13:12.477 --> 13:13.904
THE GOVERNMENT NOT BE ABLE      
TO ACCESS THE INFORMATION       
WITHOUT OBTAINING A JUDICIAL

16:36.111 --> 16:38.504
A CERTAIN POWERFUL LOGIC TO     
IT.                             
THE IDEA BASICALLY IS IF YOU    

16:38.506 --> 16:39.501
IT.                             
THE IDEA BASICALLY IS IF YOU    
KNOW OR HAVE REASONABLE         

16:39.503 --> 16:40.864
THE IDEA BASICALLY IS IF YOU    
KNOW OR HAVE REASONABLE         
GROUNDS TO BELIEVE THAT SOME    

16:40.866 --> 16:41.827
KNOW OR HAVE REASONABLE         
GROUNDS TO BELIEVE THAT SOME    
FOREIGN TERRORIST OUTSIDE       

16:41.829 --> 16:43.590
GROUNDS TO BELIEVE THAT SOME    
FOREIGN TERRORIST OUTSIDE       
THE UNITED STATES MIGHT BE

16:46.284 --> 16:47.313
CONTACTING SOMEONE INSIDE       
THE UNITED STATES, WE WOULD     
LIKE TO KNOW THAT.              

16:47.315 --> 16:48.676
THE UNITED STATES, WE WOULD     
LIKE TO KNOW THAT.              
AND THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED    

16:48.678 --> 16:49.341
LIKE TO KNOW THAT.              
AND THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED    
TO ENABLE THAT.                 

16:49.343 --> 16:50.703
AND THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED    
TO ENABLE THAT.                 
SO IT'S A PROGRAM THAT DOES     

16:50.705 --> 16:51.734
TO ENABLE THAT.                 
SO IT'S A PROGRAM THAT DOES     
HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF COMMON      

16:51.736 --> 16:53.397
SO IT'S A PROGRAM THAT DOES     
HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF COMMON
