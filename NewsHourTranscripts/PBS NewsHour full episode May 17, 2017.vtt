I'm John Yang.

questions of loyalty

00:11.644 --> 00:16.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some Republicans begin to break
ranks, joining
Democrats calling for an
independent counsel

00:16.750 --> 00:21.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after reports the president
tried to stop
the FBI investigation into his
former national

00:21.855 --> 00:23.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
security adviser.

00:23.356 --> 00:27.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: how this latest bombshell
raises questions
of obstruction of justice.

00:27.961 --> 00:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We break down the law and why
it's not always
a clear offense.

00:32.999 --> 00:38.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And how business between two men
is improving
race relations in Athens,
Georgia.

00:38.138 --> 00:41.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: We have cuisine from

hip-hop,
comedy, singer/songwriters.

00:46.046 --> 00:49.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to be a place for

anyone.

00:49.382 --> 00:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: All that and more on

(BREAK)

00:57.290 --> 01:07.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: We begin with
breaking news.

01:07.700 --> 01:13.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Justice Department has
appointed former
FBI Director Robert Mueller to
oversee the

01:13.339 --> 01:18.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigation into any possible
connections
between the Trump campaign and
Russia in last

01:18.611 --> 01:20.380 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
year's election.

01:20.413 --> 01:24.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For President Trump today, there
was no escape
from the fallout over allegedly
pressuring

01:24.350 --> 01:30.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the previous FBI director, James
Comey, and
about sharing secrets with the
Russians.

01:30.857 --> 01:35.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Talk of obstructing justice and
endangering
national security hung heavy in
the air, even

01:35.929 --> 01:38.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the president spent the day
on the road.

01:38.631 --> 01:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins begins our
coverage.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Things are not always fair.

01:42.068 --> 01:46.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The firestorm
in Washington
clearly on the president's mind
at the Coast

Guard Academy's graduation in
New London,
Connecticut.

01:49.042 --> 01:54.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Look at the way I have been
treated lately,

01:54.481 --> 01:56.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
especially by the media.

01:56.816 --> 02:06.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No politician in history, and I
say this with
great surety, has been treated
worse or more

02:06.159 --> 02:07.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unfairly.

02:07.260 --> 02:09.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He gave this
advice to graduates.

02:09.095 --> 02:15.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You will find that
things happen
to you that you do not deserve
and that are

02:15.435 --> 02:18.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not always warranted.

02:18.271 --> 02:23.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you have to put your head
down and fight,
fight, fight.

02:23.109 --> 02:28.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The president
didn't directly
address the last day's
headlines.

02:28.681 --> 02:33.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those started with this report
from The New
York Times citing unnamed
sources saying,

02:33.620 --> 02:39.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in February, Mr. Trump spoke to
former Director
of the FBI James Comey about an
investigation

02:39.893 --> 02:44.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his adviser Michael Flynn,
and told Comey,
"I hope you can let this go."

02:44.697 --> 02:49.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That reportedly happened a day
after Flynn
was fired as national security
adviser for

02:49.702 --> 02:52.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lying about his contacts with
the Russians.

02:52.805 --> 02:55.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Comey himself was fired last
week.

02:55.308 --> 03:00.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House has denied the
story, insisting
the president never asked anyone
to end any

03:00.513 --> 03:01.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation.

03:02.015 --> 03:06.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it all meant a new round of
shockwaves
across Capitol Hill.

03:06.586 --> 03:10.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats renewed calls for an
independent
commission or a special
prosecutor on the

03:10.924 --> 03:13.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia connection and Trump's
firing of Comey.

SEN.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: The
events of the last two weeks
have shaken my

03:17.230 --> 03:21.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
confidence in this
administration's competence
and credibility.

03:21.301 --> 03:22.368 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:22.402 --> 03:24.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUBEN KIHUEN (D), Nevada: Look,
enough is
enough.

03:24.704 --> 03:30.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump's unchecked and
reckless behavior
is impacting the national
security of the

03:30.743 --> 03:32.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
United States of America.

03:32.579 --> 03:36.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Among
Republicans, Senator
Lisa Murkowski Of Alaska also
joined the call

03:36.349 --> 03:38.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a special counsel at the
Department of
Justice.

03:38.718 --> 03:39.986 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:40.019 --> 03:41.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK ALLEN (R), Georgia: Yes, I
am praying
for the president.

03:41.988 --> 03:44.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Others, like
Georgia Congressman
Rick Allen, indicated concern
for the White

03:44.290 --> 03:45.258 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
House.

03:45.291 --> 03:46.693 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:46.726 --> 03:50.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK ALLEN: How do you endure
all this, so,
and still try to govern?

03:51.030 --> 03:55.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: House Speaker
Paul Ryan is
withholding any conclusion for
now, saying

03:55.235 --> 03:57.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congress has to get to the
bottom of all this.

03:57.303 --> 03:58.504 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: We
need the facts.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is obvious that there are
some people out
there who want to harm the
president.

04:03.276 --> 04:07.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have an obligation to
carry out our
oversight, regardless of which
party is in

04:07.814 --> 04:09.148 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the White House.

04:09.182 --> 04:12.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Alongside those
words, a
sudden flurry of activity.

04:12.285 --> 04:17.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Oversight Committee
Chairman Jason Chaffetz
asked the FBI to send all
memoranda, notes,

04:17.924 --> 04:22.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
summaries and recordings about
contact between
James Comey and the president.

04:22.895 --> 04:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the committee says it hopes
to have Comey
testify next week.

04:26.499 --> 04:31.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Senate Intelligence
Committee is also
asking for Comey to testify, and
the Senate

04:31.371 --> 04:36.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judiciary Committee is now
getting involved,
sending letters to the FBI and
the White House

04:36.976 --> 04:40.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
asking for all memos and
recordings as well.

04:40.913 --> 04:46.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Congressman Justin
Amash of Michigan
went so far as to say, if the
Comey memo is

04:46.119 --> 04:49.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
true, it would be grounds for
impeachment.

04:49.088 --> 04:53.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But California Democrat Adam
Schiff, ranking
member on the House Intelligence
Committee

04:53.426 --> 04:56.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a leading Trump critic, said
it's too
soon to go there.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.531 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:58.564 --> 05:01.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF (D), California: No
one ought
to, in my view, rush to embrace,
you know,

05:01.534 --> 05:05.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most extraordinary remedy,
that involves
the removal the president from
office.

05:05.371 --> 05:10.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile,
Russian President
Vladimir Putin made his own
offer to Congress

05:10.710 --> 05:14.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over reports that President
Trump discussed
highly classified information
with Russian

05:14.580 --> 05:16.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
diplomats last week.

05:16.282 --> 05:18.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin spoke at a news conference
in Sochi,
Russia.

05:18.951 --> 05:23.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): If the U.S.
considers it necessary,

05:23.823 --> 05:27.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we are ready to provide the
Senate and U.S.
Congress with a record of the
conversation

05:27.760 --> 05:29.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between Lavrov and Trump.

05:29.295 --> 05:32.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Putin also
decried what he
called anti-Russian sentiment.

05:32.965 --> 05:35.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Nick
Schifrin covers
Russia.

05:35.635 --> 05:37.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He spoke to us from the Dagestan
region.

05:37.470 --> 05:41.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: President Putin
expressed a
genuine frustration that, in his
view, the

05:41.674 --> 05:45.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington establishment won't
let President
Trump improve the bilateral
relationship.

05:45.978 --> 05:48.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said he was concerned by
Washington's
unpredictability.

05:48.581 --> 05:53.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, he
cracked a joke at
the U.S.' expense, and the video
showed senior

05:53.653 --> 05:55.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Russian officials laughing.

05:55.355 --> 05:59.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a certain schadenfreude
here in seeing
Washington suffer such
turbulence.

05:59.926 --> 06:03.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the senior Russian Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman
put it yesterday: "How do we
live in this

06:04.030 --> 06:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unstable world of information?

06:06.399 --> 06:08.201 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
With pleasure."

06:08.234 --> 06:11.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile, with
the president
back in Washington tonight, the
next act in

06:11.237 --> 06:14.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this political drama is set
tomorrow.

06:14.273 --> 06:19.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's when Deputy Attorney
General Rod Rosenstein
will brief the full Senate over
the firing

06:19.145 --> 06:21.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of James Comey and handling of
the Russia
investigation.

06:22.014 --> 06:26.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, repeating the
breaking news
we reported at the top of the
show, moments

06:26.819 --> 06:30.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago, the Justice Department
announced that
Robert Mueller, who is the
former head of

06:30.757 --> 06:36.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the FBI, is the special counsel
to investigate
connections between the Trump
campaign and

06:36.629 --> 06:39.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Russia during the 2016 campaign.

06:39.265 --> 06:42.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now, we go back to Lisa
Desjardins on Capitol
Hill.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa, have you gotten any
reaction to this
from lawmakers yet?

06:45.705 --> 06:47.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: hat's right.

06:47.507 --> 06:50.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have put out some calls, and
we have a
little bit of reaction from the
House Democrat

06:50.676 --> 06:52.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Leader's office, Nancy Pelosi's
office.

06:53.012 --> 06:57.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say they are furiously
writing a statement,
but they have told me that this
doesn't change

06:57.683 --> 07:02.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their call for an independent
commission,
which is what they were working
on today.

07:02.688 --> 07:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been asking for an
independent counsel
of this sort, but they say they
still want

07:07.293 --> 07:09.095 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more than that.

07:09.128 --> 07:12.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Republicans, our Capitol
Hill producer
Julie Percha just talked to
Representative

07:12.064 --> 07:13.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Peter King of New York.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is on the House Intelligence
Committee.

07:15.067 --> 07:20.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told her that he thinks there
was no allegation
of a crime here, and he's not
sure a special

07:20.606 --> 07:22.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
counsel is needed.

07:22.508 --> 07:25.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, no surprise, John, in this
divided Congress,
we have divided reaction right
now to this

07:25.945 --> 07:27.847 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
announcement.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But is this going to
turn the temperature
down, do you think, on some of
the rhetoric

07:30.049 --> 07:31.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're hearing, especially from
the Democrats?

07:31.784 --> 07:35.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think one
factor here,
in the choice of Robert Mueller,
is that he

07:35.354 --> 07:38.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is very well-known here and very
well-respected
in Congress.

07:38.591 --> 07:43.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That could help Republicans sort
of say that
we think there will be an
up-and-up investigation

07:43.863 --> 07:46.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that could get to the facts of
the Russia
probe.

07:46.666 --> 07:51.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, at the same time, we have
to remember
that could be separate from what
Congress

07:51.270 --> 07:55.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does in this matter of potential
obstruction
of justice at the White House.

07:55.541 --> 07:59.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's where we're seeing a lot
of attention,
especially in the Senate today,
John, a lot

07:59.045 --> 08:03.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of big decisions over how the
Senate goes
forward, and who handles those
questions of

08:03.649 --> 08:08.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what the president did or didn't
tell Mr.
Comey about whether he should
investigate

08:08.454 --> 08:10.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Michael Flynn.

08:10.356 --> 08:13.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, of course, that
is going on,
the Intelligence Committee
calling for documents,

08:13.826 --> 08:15.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Judiciary Committee calling
for documents.

08:15.728 --> 08:17.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where do you think that's going
to head from
here?

08:18.030 --> 08:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There's a key
person to watch,
John.

08:19.899 --> 08:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is Senator Chuck Grassley
of Iowa.

08:22.301 --> 08:25.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No coincidence he was out of the
spotlight
today.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's got a big decision to make.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How hard does he press this
matter?

08:28.307 --> 08:32.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Traditionally, the Judiciary
Committee is
where you would see an
obstruction of justice

08:32.278 --> 08:34.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
investigation or looking into
this.

08:34.680 --> 08:39.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But is that where Republicans
want to go when
it is their own president who is
in the questioning

08:39.485 --> 08:41.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- who is being questioned here?

08:41.287 --> 08:46.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's probably a decision for
Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell, as well as
Chuck Grassley.

08:46.092 --> 08:51.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Mr. Grassley sort of seemed
to go out
of his way today, John, to avoid
reporters.

08:51.297 --> 08:55.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dianne Feinstein, who is the
ranking Democrat
on that committee, said she
absolutely wants

08:55.201 --> 08:57.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judiciary to be a lead committee
on these
questions.

08:57.837 --> 09:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are certainly stepping up
their involvement,
as you said, asking for more
documents today,

09:02.275 --> 09:03.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
along with two other committees.

09:04.010 --> 09:06.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are posting online all of
these developments.

09:06.679 --> 09:10.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's hard to keep track, but,
right now, three
committees asking for documents
involving

09:10.750 --> 09:16.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Comey, and that's in
addition to the two
investigations in Congress in
the Intelligence

09:16.556 --> 09:18.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Committees on Russia.

09:18.491 --> 09:22.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lisa Desjardins on
Capitol Hill
keeping up with these events
that are fast-breaking,

09:22.295 --> 09:25.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you very much, Lisa.

09:25.231 --> 09:29.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Wall
Street had its
worst day since September, amid
investors

09:29.468 --> 09:34.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worries that turmoil engulfing
the president
will block swift passage of his
agenda.

09:34.707 --> 09:41.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost more
than 370 points to close back
near 20600.

09:41.547 --> 09:46.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 158 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
dropped 43.

09:46.953 --> 09:51.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The dollar also slipped again,
wiping out
all its gains since the
election.

09:51.824 --> 09:54.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Max Wolff is watching all this
for the investment
firm 55 Capital.

09:54.860 --> 09:58.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAX WOLFF, 55 Capital: A
significant part
of what's produced the six-month
market rally

09:58.731 --> 10:03.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the notion that we're going
to have radical
deregulation, particularly, but
not exclusively,

10:03.235 --> 10:07.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around financial issues, and
we're going to
have massive tax cuts,
particularly, but not

10:07.607 --> 10:09.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
exclusively, for large
companies.

10:09.408 --> 10:12.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The weaker the president is, the
less likely
you are to get those tax cuts,
and some of

10:12.478 --> 10:15.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those premiums start coming out
of the market.

10:15.715 --> 10:20.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Investors sought
refuge today in
gold and the treasury market.

10:20.286 --> 10:24.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Army Private Chelsea Manning was
released
from prison today, after serving
seven years

10:24.390 --> 10:29.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a 35-year sentence for giving
thousands
of secret documents to
WikiLeaks.

10:29.595 --> 10:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama had granted her
clemency.

10:32.198 --> 10:36.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Manning posted a picture of her
feet, captioned
"First steps of freedom," after
leaving Fort

10:36.602 --> 10:38.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Leavenworth Prison in Kansas.

10:38.471 --> 10:44.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The transgender soldier was
known as Bradley
Manning before transitioning
while in prison.

10:44.176 --> 10:48.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump will hold off
his campaign
promise to move the U.S. Embassy
in Israel

10:48.481 --> 10:50.282 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Jerusalem.

10:50.316 --> 10:55.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Palestinians strongly oppose
it, and now
CNN, Reuters and others report
that Mr. Trump

10:55.621 --> 11:00.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has decided not to announce it
when he's in
Israel next week.

11:00.459 --> 11:04.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reuters quotes a senior U.S.
official as saying
the president still does want to
move the

11:04.797 --> 11:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
embassy from Tel Aviv sometime
in the future.

11:08.334 --> 11:13.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington, D.C., police are
pursuing charges
in the violent attacks on
protesters outside

11:13.606 --> 11:15.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Turkish ambassador's
residence.

11:15.908 --> 11:20.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It happened Tuesday evening as
the Turkish
president was in town.

11:20.513 --> 11:24.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Twelve people were injured, and
two were arrested.

11:24.216 --> 11:29.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Witnesses say that President
Erdogan's security
detail attacked demonstrators,
as police tried

11:29.288 --> 11:31.123 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to intervene.

11:31.157 --> 11:35.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The police chief said today that
diplomatic
immunity will not shield the
Turkish president's

11:35.795 --> 11:37.596 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
guards.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NEWSHAM, Washington, D.C.,
Police Chief:
That's not something we will
tolerate here

11:39.765 --> 11:41.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Washington, D.C.

11:41.600 --> 11:47.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a city where people
should be allowed
to come and peacefully protest.

11:47.039 --> 11:51.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We are going to pursue
everything that's within
our legal power to hold the
folks that were

11:51.243 --> 11:53.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
responsible accountable for
their actions.

11:53.612 --> 11:57.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The State Department
said today
it's communicating its concerns
about the

11:57.750 --> 12:02.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
violence to the Turkish
government in the
strongest possible terms.

12:02.822 --> 12:07.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Arrests of suspected
undocumented immigrants
soared in the early months of
the Trump administration.

12:07.460 --> 12:13.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement
says that more than 41,000
people were arrested

12:13.232 --> 12:16.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from January 22 to April 29.

12:16.635 --> 12:19.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's up 40 percent over a year
ago.

12:19.405 --> 12:25.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the same time, actual
deportations fell
12 percent during the same
period.

12:25.544 --> 12:28.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Crews in New Orleans removed
another Confederate
monument today.

12:28.981 --> 12:32.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Workers used cranes to lift the
statue of
general P.G.T.

12:32.518 --> 12:36.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beauregard off its pedestal in
the early morning
hours.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was erected back in 1915.

12:38.324 --> 12:43.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A statue of Robert E. Lee will
be the last
of four Confederate monuments to
come down.

12:43.763 --> 12:48.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a Texas teenager is the
winner of this
year's National Geographic Bee.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's 14-year-old Pranay Varada.

12:50.870 --> 12:55.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He won the title in a
sudden-death tiebreaker
in Washington today.

12:55.107 --> 13:01.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Varada wins a $50,000
scholarship, a lifetime
membership in the National
Geographic Society,

13:01.313 --> 13:03.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and a trip to the Galapagos
Islands.

13:03.315 --> 13:05.050 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Not bad.

13:05.084 --> 13:08.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
do President
Trump's actions constitute
obstruction of

13:08.921 --> 13:14.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
justice?; I ask Nebraska
Republican Senator
Ben Sasse for his thoughts on
the recent White

13:14.059 --> 13:19.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
House turmoil; the Trump
administration's
overhaul at the Environmental
Protection Agency;

13:19.632 --> 13:31.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

13:31.577 --> 13:36.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The disclosure that President
Trump allegedly
asked Jim Comey to drop an FBI
investigation

13:36.382 --> 13:41.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has raised the question of
whether this may
constitute obstruction of
justice.

13:41.220 --> 13:42.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's plenty of disagreement.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To try to understand this, we
are joined by
Michael Waldman.

13:45.925 --> 13:50.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is president of the Brennan
Center for
Justice at the NYU School of
Law.

13:50.196 --> 13:52.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He also worked for President
Bill Clinton.

13:52.598 --> 13:56.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And William Jeffress, he is a
trial lawyer
who has worked on criminal and
civil cases

13:56.836 --> 13:58.571 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at Baker Botts.

13:58.604 --> 14:02.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of his best known cases was
defending
Scooter Libby, the chief of
staff to former

14:02.775 --> 14:04.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Vice President Dick Cheney.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Jeffress, let me begin with
you.

14:06.612 --> 14:10.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sure you have heard the news
that Bob
Mueller, the former FBI
director, has now

14:10.182 --> 14:16.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been named special counsel in
the case involving
the possible connections between
the Trump

14:16.355 --> 14:19.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign and Russia in last
year's campaign.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's your reaction to that?

14:21.660 --> 14:25.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM JEFFRESS, Baker Botts:
Excellent choice,
highly qualified, very
well-respected.

14:25.731 --> 14:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Couldn't have a better person.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Michael Waldman, how
about you?

14:28.868 --> 14:30.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you think of this?

14:30.569 --> 14:32.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL WALDMAN, President,
Brennan Center
for Justice: It's encouraging
news.

14:32.504 --> 14:34.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is very well-respected.

14:34.440 --> 14:39.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the questions include,
what would
be the scope of his brief and
what is his

14:39.478 --> 14:41.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
level of independence?

14:41.247 --> 14:45.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Presumably, President Trump
isn't going to
ask him, as alleged, for his
loyalty, but

14:45.351 --> 14:50.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is he only going to look at the
potential
collusion during the campaign or
at some of

14:50.923 --> 14:56.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these broader issues that amount
to, if true,
abuse of power and obstruction
of justice?

14:56.362 --> 15:01.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Mr. Jeffress, is
his representation
such that you think this should
put to rest

15:01.300 --> 15:03.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
any questions about this
investigation?

15:03.269 --> 15:07.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM JEFFRESS: I followed his
career very
closely, know him personally.

15:07.072 --> 15:10.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It certainly puts to rest any
question in
my mind.

15:10.075 --> 15:14.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Let's turn now to
this question
of obstruction of justice, and
whether or

15:14.747 --> 15:17.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not what the president has been
doing constitutes
it.

15:17.950 --> 15:23.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
First of all, the legal
definition under the
law, obstruction of justice, Mr.
Jeffress,

15:23.622 --> 15:25.257 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what is it?

15:25.291 --> 15:29.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM JEFFRESS: It's corruptly
endeavoring
to influence an official
proceeding.

15:29.595 --> 15:30.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Corruptly.

15:30.596 --> 15:31.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Corruptly, what does that mean?

15:31.597 --> 15:32.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM JEFFRESS: That's the key
word.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It means for an improper
purpose.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's defined in the law.

15:35.901 --> 15:43.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, one could make a
request of
an FBI agent or, for that
matter, the head

15:43.175 --> 15:44.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the FBI.

15:44.810 --> 15:47.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If not done for an improper
purpose, that
wouldn't be obstruction of
justice.

15:48.013 --> 15:49.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If done for an improper purpose,
it would
be.

15:49.949 --> 15:54.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Michael, anything you
want to add
to that or take away from that?

15:54.053 --> 15:56.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL WALDMAN: Well, I think
that's correct.

15:56.789 --> 16:02.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that, legally, the
president can,
for example, fire the FBI
director is true,

16:02.594 --> 16:05.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but not if it was done for
corrupt purposes.

16:05.431 --> 16:10.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, I have a right to
drive a car,
but not to drive a getaway car.

16:10.269 --> 16:16.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that is the kind of
fact-based question
that prosecutors and juries have
to look at

16:16.375 --> 16:20.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and also that the court of
public opinion
needs to look at.

16:20.346 --> 16:27.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Mueller has a legal brief,
but, ultimately,
as your story showed earlier,
Congress has

16:27.119 --> 16:31.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very significant role to play
in looking
at the broader set of questions,
including

16:31.423 --> 16:33.258 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

16:33.292 --> 16:36.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Then do you think
what the president
has done or alleged to have done
with -- with

16:37.029 --> 16:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
James Comey and his discussions
with Mr. Comey,
does that constitute obstruction
of justice

16:42.167 --> 16:43.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in your mind, Michael?

16:43.869 --> 16:49.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL WALDMAN: Again, assuming
that the
allegations are true, it raises
very serious

16:49.475 --> 16:55.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questions and comes close to the
kind of obstruction
of justice that has led to
impeachment proceedings,

16:55.681 --> 16:57.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for example, against Richard
Nixon.

16:57.649 --> 17:00.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know that he asked Mr. Comey
for his loyalty.

17:00.519 --> 17:04.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that, according to these
news reports,
he pulled him aside, told the
attorney general

17:04.823 --> 17:10.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to leave the room, and asked him
-- as his
supervisor, asked him to drop
the investigation

17:10.295 --> 17:15.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of his national security
adviser, and when
he didn't drop that
investigation, actually

17:15.167 --> 17:21.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asked to expand it, we know that
he fired
Mr. Comey, and then went on
national television

17:21.306 --> 17:25.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to say that the reason in his
mind was -- quote
-- the Trump-Russia thing."

17:25.677 --> 17:31.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are all bits of evidence
that suggest
a very worrisome pattern that
could in fact

17:31.116 --> 17:33.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
amount to obstruction of
justice.

17:33.118 --> 17:37.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's certainly an abuse of power
and a risk,
I would say, to the rule of law.

17:37.322 --> 17:39.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Jeffress what, do
you think?

17:39.324 --> 17:46.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM JEFFRESS: Well, focusing
on the conversation
with Director Comey about
General Flynn, based

17:46.131 --> 17:52.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on what Mr. Trump has said, that
he made that
request because he thought
General Flynn was

17:52.738 --> 17:59.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a good man, and presumably
suffered enough
by being fired, that wouldn't be
a provable

17:59.244 --> 18:01.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
case of obstruction of justice.

18:01.780 --> 18:04.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there are other
hypotheticals.

18:04.116 --> 18:07.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's certainly reason to
investigate.

18:07.753 --> 18:15.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, if Mr. Trump knew
that General
Flynn had incriminating
information on Mr.

18:15.160 --> 18:20.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump having to do with the
Russia investigation
and made this request of Mr.
Comey in order

18:20.199 --> 18:24.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to keep Mr. Flynn -- General
Flynn quiet,
that would be obstruction.

18:24.036 --> 18:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Because that would --
that would
satisfy the corruptly -- acting
corruptly?

18:27.873 --> 18:31.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM JEFFRESS: That would be
an improper
purpose, yes, to keep a witness
quiet.

18:31.243 --> 18:37.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: And, in this
discussion, can a
president, Mr. Jeffress, can a
president be

18:37.616 --> 18:38.584 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
indicted?

18:38.617 --> 18:40.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM JEFFRESS: Not while he's
sitting.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That seems to be settled.

18:42.254 --> 18:48.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He can be impeached and could be
indicted
after being impeached if -- once
he's removed

18:48.760 --> 18:50.496 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from office.

18:50.529 --> 18:53.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And so, Michael, this
becomes not
-- then that becomes a question
of not so

18:53.932 --> 18:59.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much a legal question of what
the law says,
but it becomes a political
question, does

18:59.371 --> 19:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it not, of what Congress says,
what the House
says in drafting a bill of
indictment and

19:04.977 --> 19:09.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the Senate would say in
whether to convict
on that bill.

19:09.414 --> 19:12.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL WALDMAN: I do think
that's exactly
right.

19:12.451 --> 19:17.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had, for example, during
Watergate the
grand jury then named President
Nixon as an

19:17.289 --> 19:23.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unindicted co-conspirator, but
the real action
was during the impeachment
proceedings.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think impeachment is a pretty
strong remedy.

19:26.131 --> 19:31.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would like to start by seeing
meaningful
and public congressional
investigations, whether

19:31.737 --> 19:38.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by a select committee or by a
9/11 Commission-style
independent panel to look into
the very things

19:38.977 --> 19:41.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that Mr. Jeffress has discussed.

19:41.780 --> 19:48.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, we're looking at the
actions by
a hostile foreign power to
undermine our democracy,

19:48.720 --> 19:52.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
potentially the collusion with
one of the
campaigns with that action, and
now we see

19:52.691 --> 20:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what looks like, if it is in
fact the motives
that seem to be in play, a
corrupt effort

20:00.999 --> 20:02.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to undermine that investigation.

20:02.834 --> 20:08.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, even the best of
prosecutors
proceeds in secret and looks to
see whether

20:08.440 --> 20:10.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there's a law broken or not.

20:10.209 --> 20:14.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the public has a reason to
want to know
the broader set of questions and
patterns.

20:14.913 --> 20:19.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it really does come down to
Congress, where
there's more running around,
more action,

20:20.018 --> 20:22.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but I would like to see some
coordinated and
meaningful oversight here.

20:22.921 --> 20:27.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But, Mr. Jeffress, I
take it from
what you said that you think
this all really

20:27.159 --> 20:31.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does depend, then, on whether
Mr. Mueller
is going to investigate about
whether or not

20:31.897 --> 20:37.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is a real link with
General Flynn and
the Russians and whether
President Trump knew

20:37.536 --> 20:38.503 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about that.

20:38.537 --> 20:40.305 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that right?

20:40.339 --> 20:44.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM JEFFRESS: Certainly,
he's going to
investigate what Mr. Flynn said
to the FBI,

20:44.276 --> 20:48.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what he said to Vice President
Pence, what
he -- his actual conversation
with the Russian

20:48.847 --> 20:52.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ambassador, and what did
President Trump know
about all that or have to do
with it?

20:52.818 --> 20:56.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: William Jeffress,
Michael Waldman,
I'm sure we are going to be
talking about

20:56.388 --> 20:59.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this a lot in the future, but
thanks for joining
us.

20:59.925 --> 21:08.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM JEFFRESS: You bet.

21:08.667 --> 21:16.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We turn our focus
back to Capitol
Hill.

21:16.975 --> 21:20.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier this evening, I sat down
with Republican
Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska.

21:20.912 --> 21:25.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We spoke before the Justice
Department announced
it was appointing Robert Mueller
as a special

21:25.584 --> 21:29.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
counsel in this investigation of
the ties
between Russian and the Trump
campaign.

21:30.022 --> 21:34.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We looked at how the Republican
Party's leadership
is handling the fallout, and the
senator's

21:34.326 --> 21:37.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
new book, "The Vanishing
American Adult."

21:37.162 --> 21:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Sasse is a Republican
who has been
vocal for some time about his
opposition to

21:41.833 --> 21:43.035 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mr. Trump.

21:43.068 --> 21:45.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I began by asking for his
response to the
recent events.

21:45.771 --> 21:47.572 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:47.606 --> 21:49.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN SASSE (R), Nebraska: Well,
there's just
a lot we don't know, so let's
first be humble

21:49.975 --> 21:51.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about how little we know.

21:51.677 --> 21:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's very important that we,
those of
us who are called to be public
servants for

21:56.114 --> 22:01.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a time, are constantly thinking
about, what
can we do to rebuild, not
further erode public

22:01.787 --> 22:03.555 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trust?

22:03.588 --> 22:06.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have the institutions of our
democratic
republic that have 9 percent,
and 12 percent,

22:06.391 --> 22:09.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and 15 percent approval rating,
and that's
not sustainable.

22:09.861 --> 22:14.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Federal Bureau of
Investigation is a really
important institution, and we
need to all

22:14.166 --> 22:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want to shepherd it.

22:15.334 --> 22:18.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want it to be protected from
political
influence.

22:18.103 --> 22:22.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want it to not be a place
that the American
people think of as a partisan
agency that

22:22.240 --> 22:23.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they should doubt.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, very critical, when you
have three
branches of government, the
executive branch

22:27.312 --> 22:32.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is where you are going to have
to put your
investigative arm, the FBI, and
your prosecutorial

22:32.150 --> 22:33.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
decision-making, the Department
of Justice.

22:34.019 --> 22:37.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the American people need to
have confidence
that it's insulated from
political and partisan

22:37.422 --> 22:39.124 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decision-making.

22:39.157 --> 22:43.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: You have questioned
-- even in
the campaign, you said you
trusted neither

22:43.628 --> 22:44.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidate.

22:44.629 --> 22:45.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You didn't trust Mr. Trump.

22:45.630 --> 22:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You didn't trust Secretary
Clinton.

22:48.834 --> 22:54.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As your colleagues have learned
more, and
as we have all learned more
about President

22:54.039 --> 22:57.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, have you been satisfied
with the way
your colleagues, and especially
the leadership,

22:57.342 --> 22:58.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have reacted?

22:58.343 --> 23:00.045 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

23:00.078 --> 23:04.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN SASSE: Well, I think both of
these political
parties are living on borrowed
capital.

23:04.649 --> 23:05.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they're exhausted.

23:05.951 --> 23:08.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There aren't clear visions that
either party
has right now.

23:08.553 --> 23:12.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to be clear, I'm the
third or fourth
most conservative guy in the
Senate by voting

23:12.691 --> 23:15.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
record, but I'm not particularly
partisan.

23:15.127 --> 23:18.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We should be having a
conversation between
the two political parties, where
they're each

23:18.263 --> 23:23.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to outdo each other in
terms of having
better ideas to persuade the
American people

23:23.034 --> 23:27.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about what a vision for 10 and
15 years and
20 years into the future should
be for policy-making.

23:27.339 --> 23:30.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, we constantly have a
lesser of two
evils conversation.

23:30.342 --> 23:34.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And right now, both political
parties tend
to act like their main job is to
explain yet

23:34.846 --> 23:36.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
why the other side is worse.

23:36.348 --> 23:38.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's not good enough.

23:38.150 --> 23:42.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: But is the
discussion, the constant
discussion of trying to explain
or defend

23:42.754 --> 23:47.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president, is that getting
in the way
of not only the Republican
agenda, but also

23:47.159 --> 23:48.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this greater discussion that you
talk about?

23:48.693 --> 23:49.661 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

23:49.694 --> 23:51.396 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
BEN SASSE: Yes.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we have a continuum that
should be
Republican vs. Democrat or
conservative vs.

23:54.499 --> 23:58.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
progressive continuum about what
policy-making
the federal government should
do.

23:58.303 --> 24:01.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But most of our policy-making
discussions
are short-termist.

24:01.406 --> 24:04.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We should be having long-term
discussions
about a national security
strategy for the

24:04.743 --> 24:06.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
age of cyber and jihad.

24:06.645 --> 24:10.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We should be thinking about the
portability
of benefits in an era where
average job duration

24:10.982 --> 24:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the next generation is going
to get shorter
and shorter for evermore.

24:14.319 --> 24:17.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's before artificial
intelligence
and machine learning is really
disrupting

24:17.689 --> 24:19.524 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

24:19.558 --> 24:23.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those policy discussions
should still
be subordinate to an even larger
civic conversation

24:23.328 --> 24:24.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about, what does America mean?

24:24.629 --> 24:26.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is our shared narrative?

24:26.498 --> 24:30.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How is the freedom of speech,
press, religion,
and assembly the beating heart
of the American

24:30.635 --> 24:31.603 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experiment?

24:31.636 --> 24:33.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't talk about any of those
things.

24:33.104 --> 24:37.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talk about the blood feud of
Hatfields
and McCoys almost every day.

24:37.108 --> 24:40.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Let me quickly bring
you back to
something a little more
immediate.

24:40.278 --> 24:44.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The -- one of your colleagues,
Lisa Murkowski,
said today it may be time to
start thinking

24:44.850 --> 24:50.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about an independent counsel in
the Russia
investigation involving the
Trump campaign.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are you hearing that more?

24:52.357 --> 24:53.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what do you think about that
idea?

24:53.692 --> 24:55.594 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

24:55.627 --> 24:58.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN SASSE: So, I haven't yet
called for either
a special prosecutor or an
independent counsel,

24:58.196 --> 25:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but I want to distinguish those
terms and
talk about why not.

25:01.566 --> 25:06.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, first of all, independent
counsel, or
a criminal or an investigative
thing that's

25:06.938 --> 25:12.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
based on retrospective problems,
that's one
potential pathway.

25:12.310 --> 25:16.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We also -- we usually use the
word independent
commission or 9/11-style
commission usually

25:16.648 --> 25:21.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to look at not just what's
happened retrospectively,
but what do we need to do to be
prepared for

25:21.486 --> 25:25.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what Russia other and hostile
foreign powers
are going to do with
cyber-attacks against

25:25.624 --> 25:27.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
us in 2018 and 2020?

25:27.893 --> 25:32.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, for the future-looking
thing, we
need to be doing lots more,
because what comes

25:32.197 --> 25:39.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next is far more compelling and
dangerous
attempts to interfere with
America's trust

25:39.437 --> 25:41.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Americans' trust of each
other.

25:41.506 --> 25:46.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the bot technology and the
machine learning
enables even more aggressive
cyber-attacks

25:46.244 --> 25:49.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the future, it's not going to
be against
one party or against the other.

25:49.614 --> 25:53.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going to be a war of all
against all,
where every American is supposed
to doubt

25:53.218 --> 25:54.419 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
each other.

25:54.452 --> 25:56.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin is winning right now with
these kinds
of efforts.

25:56.888 --> 26:01.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to be sure that we're
doing the prospective
looking at how we're going to be
prepared

26:01.226 --> 26:03.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the cyber-attacks of the
future.

26:03.194 --> 26:07.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I believe we also need to --
and this
is why I haven't yet called for
a special

26:07.332 --> 26:10.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
commission or a special
investigator, though
I'm open to those deliberations
-- I haven't

26:10.969 --> 26:15.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yet called for it because I want
to see us
restore trust in the
institutions we currently

26:15.607 --> 26:19.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have, the Senate Intelligence
Committee, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have to shore up these
institutions.

26:20.979 --> 26:24.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not the case that you can
just punt because
of the current mistrust and say,
well, if

26:24.649 --> 26:28.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have a special prosecutor,
that will be
a panacea and everyone will
trust it.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the special prosecutor -- we
don't have
a statute for it now, by the
way.

26:30.922 --> 26:35.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we had to pass a new statute,
usually,
it would be some form of a
three-judge panel.

26:35.160 --> 26:39.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, if they appoint somebody,
then two of
them are going to have been
Democratic nominees

26:39.230 --> 26:42.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and one a Republican or two
Republicans and
a Democrat, and then people are
going to dig

26:42.701 --> 26:43.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into their history.

26:43.835 --> 26:46.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're going to have distrust
all the way
down.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We only have feet of clay.

26:47.906 --> 26:50.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the American people, we need
to come back
together and restore trust in
some of our

26:50.742 --> 26:53.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
extant institutions and plan for
the future.

26:53.478 --> 26:55.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Let's turn to your
book, make your
publisher happy.

26:55.380 --> 26:56.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will talk about your book a
little bit.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's called "The Vanishing
American Adult."

26:58.483 --> 27:02.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You write: "We are living in an
America of
perpetual adolescence.

27:02.287 --> 27:07.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our kids simply don't know what
an adult is
anymore or how to become one."

27:07.158 --> 27:08.126 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Talk about that.

27:08.159 --> 27:10.061 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

27:10.095 --> 27:11.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN SASSE: Well, first of all,
this book is
a -- "The Vanishing American
Adult" is a constructive

27:11.896 --> 27:13.798 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
project.

27:13.832 --> 27:17.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two-thirds of it is about
different habit-forming
enterprises that we should be
dedicating our

27:17.402 --> 27:20.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
13- and our 15- and our
17-year-olds to.

27:20.071 --> 27:21.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a blame-laying book.

27:21.973 --> 27:26.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, if it were, it would be
directed at the
parents and at the grandparents,
not at millennials

27:26.111 --> 27:31.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, because we haven't done a
good job
of helping our kids understand
that scar tissue

27:31.683 --> 27:33.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is something to celebrate.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Scar tissue is the foundation of
future character.

27:35.820 --> 27:40.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, right now, we have come to
believe that
one of the ways to serve our
kids is to protect

27:40.558 --> 27:46.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
them from hardships and
transformational coming-of-age
moments and to protect them from
work.

27:46.731 --> 27:48.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's not what we want.

27:48.500 --> 27:52.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want them to become free to
find meaning
in work and in service to their
neighbor.

27:52.470 --> 27:55.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Senator Ben Sasse,
the book is
"The Vanishing American Adult."

27:55.540 --> 27:56.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

27:56.775 --> 27:57.776 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

27:57.809 --> 28:05.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEN SASSE: Good to be with you.

28:05.316 --> 28:11.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We return to our top
story, the
Justice Department appointing
former FBI Director

28:11.856 --> 28:17.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Robert Mueller as a special
counsel to oversee
their investigation into
coordination, possible

28:17.562 --> 28:21.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coordination between Russia and
the Trump
campaign.

28:21.066 --> 28:23.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're joined now by phone by
John Carlin.

28:23.802 --> 28:27.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He served as chief of staff and
senior counsel
to Robert Mueller.

28:27.839 --> 28:33.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's now an attorney in private
practice specializing
in cyber-security and crisis
management.

28:33.478 --> 28:35.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Carlin, thanks for joining
us.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tell us a little bit about your
former boss.

28:37.449 --> 28:44.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN, Former Justice
Department Official:
I can't think of an American of
higher integrity

28:44.122 --> 28:45.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and experience.

28:45.957 --> 28:53.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is someone legendary who
prosecutors
and agents in the field, who --
a former Marine,

28:53.231 --> 29:02.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spent a career as a prosecutor,
has been nominated
by presidents, including
President Clinton,

29:02.140 --> 29:08.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Bush, and President
Obama, for different
positions, and, throughout his
career, has

29:08.646 --> 29:13.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
earned respect on both sides of
the aisle.

29:13.151 --> 29:16.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And do -- talk about
his independence.

29:16.988 --> 29:20.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was -- you talked about
being legendary.

29:20.725 --> 29:27.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's -- one of the legends
about Robert
Mueller is his threat to resign,
ironically,

29:27.232 --> 29:33.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with then-Deputy Attorney
General James Comey
facing down the Bush
administration.

29:33.872 --> 29:44.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: He's someone who
has a firm belief
in what's right and wrong and
what the appropriate

29:44.449 --> 29:47.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
role of a government official
should be.

29:47.418 --> 29:53.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he's someone who looks
to -- epitomizes
the idea that you should just
follow the facts

29:53.158 --> 30:00.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the law, and has done so in
all the different
steps of his -- of his career.

30:00.598 --> 30:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you have referenced,
he's someone
who, if something appears that
it's outside

30:05.670 --> 30:09.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the law, he won't do it, or, if
it's improper,
he won't do it.

30:09.707 --> 30:13.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's that type of firm
backbone that earned
the respect of so many people
that have worked

30:13.978 --> 30:19.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with him as FBI agents, worked
with him as
prosecutors, and observed him
over the years.

30:19.918 --> 30:22.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's also highly unusual in this
age.

30:22.587 --> 30:27.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's someone who hates the --
and avoids the
limelight.

30:27.225 --> 30:36.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's managed to stay out of
most news
stories and keep an unbelievably
low profile,

30:36.267 --> 30:38.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when you consider what he's done
over his
career.

30:38.770 --> 30:41.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Could you remind us
of that episode?

30:41.706 --> 30:47.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Recount for us that episode with
the showdown
with, I believe, as I recall, it
was White

30:47.879 --> 30:49.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
House counsel Alberto Gonzales.

30:49.981 --> 30:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They wanted to overrule a
Justice Department
finding regarding surveillance,
as I recall.

30:57.722 --> 30:59.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN CARLIN: Yes.

30:59.624 --> 31:05.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And according to public
reporting about what
occurred there, there was a
surveillance program

31:05.530 --> 31:11.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the then attorney general
-- Attorney
General Ashcroft was ill.

31:11.736 --> 31:19.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, and Deputy Attorney General
Jim Comey
had assumed the role of acting
attorney general.

31:19.277 --> 31:26.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And based on the advice he
received from lawyers
at the Office of Legal Counsel,
he found that

31:26.150 --> 31:32.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the program, as it was currently
being run,
wasn't lawful, and so had to be
shut down.

31:32.290 --> 31:39.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he learned about a visit
that was going
to be made by members of the
White House,

31:39.097 --> 31:45.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including the White House
counsel, to Attorney
General Ashcroft in his hospital
bed, and

31:45.403 --> 31:46.838 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was concerned.

31:46.871 --> 31:54.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he asked Director Mueller
to accompany
him to that hospital room.

31:54.078 --> 31:58.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Director Mueller did so.

31:58.049 --> 32:03.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Attorney General Ashcroft said
that, as acting
attorney general, it would be
Comey's decision

32:03.554 --> 32:07.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as to what was lawful or not
lawful.

32:07.158 --> 32:13.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Director Mueller,
kind of consistent
with his career, if the lawyers
at the Justice

32:13.231 --> 32:18.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department say something is not
lawful, then
you can't do it, until you work
out a way

32:18.670 --> 32:20.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it's within the confines of
the law.

32:20.905 --> 32:27.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No matter how important the
program might
be, the law is the law.

32:27.245 --> 32:32.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ironically, the
careers of James
Comey and Robert Mueller once
again intertwined.

32:32.350 --> 32:34.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Carlin, thank you very much
for joining
us.

32:34.319 --> 32:36.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN CARLIN: Thank you.

32:36.054 --> 32:41.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And now we turn to --
continuing
on this story, we turn to
Congressman Adam

32:41.659 --> 32:43.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kinzinger, a Republican of
Illinois.

32:43.728 --> 32:46.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He called today for a special
counsel.

32:46.531 --> 32:52.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Representative Kinzinger, I
presume your -- well,
what's your reaction now to the
appointment

32:52.503 --> 32:54.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of former FBI Director Robert
Mueller?

32:54.739 --> 32:55.907 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

32:55.940 --> 32:56.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM KINZINGER (R), Illinois:
Well, I was
surprised.

32:56.741 --> 32:58.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was surprised in a good way.

32:58.076 --> 32:59.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think this is the right thing
to do.

32:59.811 --> 33:05.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reason I called for it
today, with the
revelations of the supposed memo
yesterday,

33:05.483 --> 33:08.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the questions that have been
arising, I just
came to the realization -- and I
have always

33:08.886 --> 33:13.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said from the beginning the
American people
deserve the facts, whatever they
are, whoever

33:13.491 --> 33:16.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they exonerate or whoever they
indict.

33:16.127 --> 33:18.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The American people deserve
that.

33:18.262 --> 33:20.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this had become way too
political.

33:20.064 --> 33:24.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Any new story, any new piece of
information
that had come out, you know, the
left screams

33:24.268 --> 33:26.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- some on the left mention
impeachment right
away.

33:26.404 --> 33:29.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some on the right would say it's
fake news.

33:29.474 --> 33:30.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And neither is true.

33:30.708 --> 33:33.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we need to get to the bottom
of it.

33:33.177 --> 33:35.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need answers, and we need
them in a nonpartisan
way.

33:35.880 --> 33:41.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my hope is, this is the
beginning of the
process of saying, let's all
tack a deep breath.

33:41.185 --> 33:46.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's aggressively find out the
truth of everything
and the facts, and then we can
move ahead,

33:46.257 --> 33:49.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the American people can have
faith again
in the institutions of
government.

33:49.660 --> 33:54.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Do you think this is
going to turn
the temperature down a little
bit on the Hill,

33:54.699 --> 34:00.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of the boiling controversy
that's been
going on for the past really
couple of weeks

34:00.538 --> 34:01.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now?

34:01.539 --> 34:02.573 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

34:02.607 --> 34:03.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADAM KINZINGER: It's hard to
tell.

34:03.574 --> 34:05.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, truthfully, probably
not a lot.

34:05.276 --> 34:08.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're going to have now an
outlet, I guess,
for this.

34:08.446 --> 34:12.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's -- Congress can say --
there will probably
be these investigations
continuing still in

34:12.517 --> 34:17.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Congress, but the majority
of the focus
will be with the special
counsel's office.

34:17.688 --> 34:20.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this is a very hot-button
issue.

34:20.191 --> 34:24.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And any new revelation that
comes out, people
are angry or people are happy
about what they

34:24.695 --> 34:25.897 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
see or whatever.

34:25.930 --> 34:27.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you're going to continue to
see that dynamic,
I think.

34:27.698 --> 34:31.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think this is going to
continue to drive
news cycles and drive stories.

34:31.736 --> 34:35.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think this is the right
way to go for
the American people, so they can
say -- you

34:35.540 --> 34:40.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, look, notoriously, have a
very low faith
in Congress to be able to do
things in a nonpartisan

34:40.144 --> 34:42.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way, because we're a partisan
body.

34:42.046 --> 34:46.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to be able now to move
forward and say
we want to get to the bottom
with a very honorable

34:46.651 --> 34:48.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American like Mr. Mueller, I
think, is a good
step.

34:48.853 --> 34:54.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Is this any way an
acknowledgment
that the turmoil and sort of the
back-and-forth

34:54.959 --> 34:59.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you saw with the House
Intelligence Committee
trying to investigate this, that
they just

34:59.764 --> 35:04.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could not handle this, that you
had to turn
to someone, an outsider like
this?

35:04.202 --> 35:05.436 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

35:05.470 --> 35:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM KINZINGER: Well, I think,
ultimately,
it's handleable.

35:07.972 --> 35:13.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whether it's the House Intel
or the Senate
Intel Committee, they do this
kind of stuff.

35:13.044 --> 35:14.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have access to the
information.

35:14.612 --> 35:16.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They go through the process.

35:16.347 --> 35:20.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's no doubt, a month or
two ago,
it got very heated, it got very
personal.

35:20.818 --> 35:22.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can't have that on the Intel
Committee.

35:22.753 --> 35:26.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't necessarily know who to
throw stones
at on that, but you can't have
that on the

35:26.724 --> 35:27.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Intel Committee.

35:27.992 --> 35:30.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What you need is a calm,
rational investigation.

35:30.795 --> 35:34.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This, with this special counsel
now, hopefully,
we can get that.

35:34.765 --> 35:37.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, again, there will still be
a lot of passion.

35:37.568 --> 35:39.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Donald Trump is a very
controversial president.

35:39.403 --> 35:43.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People either love him or they
don't love
him, and so you will continue to
have that.

35:43.741 --> 35:47.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think now people can
hopefully rest
assured that the work is going
to be done.

35:47.612 --> 35:50.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they need to understand,
everybody needs
to understand this is going to
be a slow and

35:50.982 --> 35:52.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deliberate process.

35:52.750 --> 35:56.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess I'm hearing it's almost
60 days to
even get a special counsel up
and running.

35:56.687 --> 36:00.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Let me talk you about
the other
controversies that have been
around this week,

36:00.124 --> 36:04.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the -- not -- this was topped
obviously yesterday
by the Comey memo.

36:05.029 --> 36:14.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, before that, we had the
allegations about
President Trump giving Israeli
intelligence,

36:14.172 --> 36:16.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what's reported to be Israeli
intelligence,
to the Russians.

36:17.008 --> 36:17.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you think about that?

36:18.009 --> 36:18.976 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

36:19.010 --> 36:19.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADAM KINZINGER: So, I was
disappointed.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I'm a military pilot.

36:21.846 --> 36:25.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I still serve in the Guard and
fly planes,
and I have been in since
basically after college.

36:25.750 --> 36:30.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we learned early that, when
it comes to
classified information -- I have
a military

36:30.454 --> 36:34.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
classification, as well as a
congressional
classification -- you have to be
very careful

36:34.158 --> 36:35.826 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with that.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the president does have the
right to
declassify information whenever
he wants to.

36:38.763 --> 36:44.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Theoretically, a president could
take everything
Edward Snowden stole and release
that himself.

36:44.569 --> 36:46.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it doesn't make it wise.

36:46.237 --> 36:50.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so if you're going to,
especially with
an adversary, talk about
something that's

36:50.841 --> 36:52.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
classified, you need to do two
things.

36:52.677 --> 36:55.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Number one, talk to the folks
that provided
that information to you and make
sure it's

36:55.980 --> 37:00.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OK, and, secondly, I think put
that through
the brain trust of your national
security

37:00.918 --> 37:05.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group, H.R. McMaster, everybody
else, to say,
hey, I want to reveal this to
the Russians

37:05.590 --> 37:09.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because it may help us in our
fight with ISIS
or whatever reason.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we can go through that
filter, I think
it would have been very
different.

37:11.562 --> 37:16.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it seems like -- I wasn't in
the Oval
Office -- it seems like it was
released willy-nilly.

37:16.867 --> 37:21.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's a very bad
thing, very
dangerous, and hopefully a
lesson learned

37:21.305 --> 37:23.040 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from all this.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: How has all of this
affected your
confidence and trust in the
president?

37:25.977 --> 37:30.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a very early
administration, and we have
had all this turmoil, all these
stories going

37:31.015 --> 37:31.983 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

37:32.016 --> 37:34.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Has this shaken your confidence
at all?

37:34.352 --> 37:36.120 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

37:36.153 --> 37:38.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM KINZINGER: Well, as I have
always said,
I think the policies -- as a
Republican, the

37:38.689 --> 37:43.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policies coming out of this
administration,
the foreign policy, has been
good.

37:43.227 --> 37:47.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The strike on Syria was good,
pushing back
against North Korea.

37:47.164 --> 37:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The words are not.

37:48.966 --> 37:52.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, the tweets, the early
morning kind
of Twitter rampage and some of
these other

37:52.370 --> 37:53.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
things aren't.

37:53.371 --> 37:55.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Does it shake my confidence?

37:55.239 --> 37:59.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, I think that's a pretty
boisterous thing
to say for a member of Congress
to say whether

37:59.977 --> 38:01.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or not their confidence is
shaken.

38:01.579 --> 38:03.381 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I have concerns.

38:03.414 --> 38:08.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I know he has a great team
around him
advising him, and I hope he
takes that advice.

38:08.252 --> 38:11.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is, again -- hopefully,
this special
counsel is the beginning of
bringing the temperature

38:11.756 --> 38:13.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
down a little bit.

38:13.057 --> 38:15.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will always be pretty hot,
but, hopefully,
we can see that.

38:15.793 --> 38:20.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Do you think -- are
you hopeful
that you will and -- you and
your colleagues

38:20.464 --> 38:25.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the House will be able to
focus more on
the Republican agenda now than
on the president's

38:25.670 --> 38:27.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tweets and other things?

38:27.104 --> 38:28.072 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

38:28.105 --> 38:29.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ADAM KINZINGER: Yes.

38:29.106 --> 38:30.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm really hopeful.

38:30.241 --> 38:31.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been hopeful for while
that we can
do that.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, we can walk -- I hate to
use the term,
but we can walk and chew gum out
here.

38:34.345 --> 38:39.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, we can have these
controversies going
on, but, still, today, we just
voted on a

38:39.483 --> 38:42.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bill passed unanimously for
sanctions against
Syria.

38:42.887 --> 38:44.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We can continue to do that work.

38:44.855 --> 38:48.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you have all this
basically dominating
the news cycle, it doesn't give
us an opportunity

38:48.426 --> 38:51.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get our message out, whether
it's health
care, tax reform.

38:51.128 --> 38:55.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, frankly, then the president
of the United
States is not out selling that
agenda, too.

38:55.232 --> 38:58.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it takes away some key
pieces to getting
this done.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, hope springs eternal, and I
have it now.

39:00.871 --> 39:04.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Adam Kinzinger,
representative
from Illinois, thanks so much
for joining

39:04.208 --> 39:05.176 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

39:05.209 --> 39:06.177 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

39:06.210 --> 39:07.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADAM KINZINGER: Any time.

39:07.211 --> 39:09.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Take care.

39:09.113 --> 39:12.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And now we are joined
by ®MD-BO /Matt
Zapotosky from The Washington
Post to talk

39:12.817 --> 39:13.784 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about this.

39:13.818 --> 39:14.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Matt, thanks for joining us.

39:14.952 --> 39:17.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think I probably butchered
your last name.

39:17.488 --> 39:18.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I apologize.

39:18.489 --> 39:20.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

39:20.458 --> 39:23.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Matt, this -- as
recently as yesterday,
the White House was saying there
was absolutely

39:23.894 --> 39:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no need for a special counsel in
this case.

39:28.499 --> 39:30.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From your reporting, what --
what happened?

39:30.901 --> 39:32.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How did this -- what
precipitated all of this?

39:32.903 --> 39:35.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT ZAPOTOSKY, The Washington
Post: I don't
know that the White House always
knows what's

39:35.606 --> 39:38.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going on inside the Justice
Department.

39:38.476 --> 39:42.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, for days now, Rod
Rosenstein, who is
the deputy attorney general, had
just seen

39:42.780 --> 39:46.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his reputation battered over his
role in the
Comey case.

39:47.017 --> 39:51.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, pressure had been
increasing on
both sides, Democrat and
Republican, for the

39:51.789 --> 39:54.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Justice Department to appoint an
attorney
general.

39:54.592 --> 39:58.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sure conversations were
going on that
we're still trying to report on
between him

39:58.496 --> 40:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Bob Mueller, the former FBI
director that
they appointed to be special
counsel.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those obviously came to
fruition today,
though it's really
late-breaking.

40:05.836 --> 40:08.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're still trying to report out
exactly what
happened.

40:08.239 --> 40:13.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But do you think --
we know there
was reporting that Rod
Rosenstein had -- was

40:13.244 --> 40:19.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unhappy that the dismissal of
Comey was put
on him, that the White House was
putting it

40:19.250 --> 40:23.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on him, and that he may have
even threatened
to resign.

40:23.654 --> 40:26.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this a way for him to try to
sort of reclaim
his reputation?

40:26.524 --> 40:29.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATT ZAPOTOSKY: I think
somewhat, you know?

40:29.126 --> 40:35.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, I mean, look, he maybe made
some threats
or said some things to express
his unhappiness

40:35.332 --> 40:40.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the way this went down, but
you can't
read his memo any other way than
to see that

40:40.905 --> 40:42.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he wanted Jim Comey gone.

40:43.007 --> 40:46.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was just a blistering
critique of Jim
Comey.

40:46.777 --> 40:52.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think he saw a lot of the
blowback and
reacted in some ways, and maybe
that is what

40:52.850 --> 40:54.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
led to us where we are right
now.

40:54.251 --> 40:57.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Let's turn to this --
the new development,
Robert Mueller.

40:57.388 --> 41:01.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What -- remind us who he is, his
background,
and what he brings to this.

41:01.192 --> 41:06.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT ZAPOTOSKY: He's a former
FBI director
who is very well-respected in
Washington.

41:06.130 --> 41:11.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just as I sat down, a former
federal prosecutor
I know was texting me saying,
there just could

41:11.335 --> 41:13.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not be a better pick.

41:13.471 --> 41:16.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has a reputation of fierce
independence.

41:16.474 --> 41:22.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he has some military
experience in
his background and, of course,
led the FBI

41:22.546 --> 41:24.381 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for a long time.

41:24.415 --> 41:28.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, and what he will
do now is just
take over this investigation,
take over what

41:28.519 --> 41:30.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Rod Rosenstein would have done.

41:30.821 --> 41:32.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He could bring in his own team.

41:32.156 --> 41:34.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He could use FBI agents.

41:34.158 --> 41:38.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe he knows some from his
time in the bureau,
but just a very well-respected
guy in Washington.

41:38.362 --> 41:40.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Matt, you cover the
Justice Department.

41:40.998 --> 41:47.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's this done to the career
prosecutors,
the career officials, the career
lawyers at

41:47.705 --> 41:48.906 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Justice?

41:48.939 --> 41:50.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the morale been like,
from what you
can gather?

41:50.608 --> 41:52.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT ZAPOTOSKY: I think there's
some frustration.

41:52.576 --> 41:56.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, by and large, people are
just putting
their heads down and working.

41:56.714 --> 42:01.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, there's a very small
number of people,
you know, a very tight circle, I
guess I should

42:01.886 --> 42:04.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say -- I don't know about small
number -- but
on this Russia stuff.

42:04.755 --> 42:08.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the other business of the
Justice Department
is going on.

42:08.893 --> 42:13.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, I don't think anybody
likes the
hit that it's given to the
Justice Department's

42:13.397 --> 42:17.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reputation, but these are career
people who
are going to come in and do
their jobs every

42:17.334 --> 42:19.103 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

42:19.136 --> 42:23.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And do you have any
sense of where
this investigation is, where it
was before

42:23.040 --> 42:24.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this announcement?

42:24.308 --> 42:27.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT ZAPOTOSKY: I would say now
it has probably
slowed down.

42:27.578 --> 42:32.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Bob Mueller now has to
come in, decide
what he needs for a budget,
decide who he's

42:32.883 --> 42:36.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to keep on, and if he
needs to bring
in any new people.

42:36.921 --> 42:41.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't have a crystal-clear
sense of exactly
how far along they were.

42:41.759 --> 42:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the FBI director -- the
former FBI
director said that it had
started in July,

42:46.730 --> 42:51.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that's a pretty small amount
of time for
a counterintelligence case.

42:51.101 --> 42:55.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now, you know, Bob Mueller
is going to
have to come in and wrap his
arms around this

42:55.606 --> 42:57.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and decide where to go from
here.

42:57.675 --> 43:02.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The fact that it is a
counterintelligence
case and sort of the FBI and the
Justice Department's

43:02.146 --> 43:04.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spy hunters, does that make it
different?

43:04.915 --> 43:07.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Or how does that make it
different from a
criminal investigation?

43:07.851 --> 43:10.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT ZAPOTOSKY: Certainly, that
adds sensitivities
to this.

43:10.854 --> 43:14.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You could be talking about
clandestine sources
and methods.

43:14.391 --> 43:18.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You're talking about FBI
counterintelligence
agents who have been involved in
this.

43:18.796 --> 43:22.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is just a little more
sensitive than,
say, a bank robbery, which is
something the

43:22.433 --> 43:24.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FBI also investigates.

43:24.201 --> 43:27.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the end of the day,
that's not to
say it could not produce
criminal charges.

43:27.671 --> 43:30.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I'm not saying we're there
that -- yet
-- excuse me.

43:30.240 --> 43:35.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Even in making this
announcement, Rod Rosenstein
said, said explicitly, look, I
am not saying

43:35.579 --> 43:40.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this because I think we are
ready for a prosecutor
or this is ready for criminal
charges.

43:40.084 --> 43:43.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm just saying it's in the
public interest
that someone outside the Justice
Department

43:43.854 --> 43:44.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
oversee this thing.

43:44.989 --> 43:46.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, we are probably
still months
away?

43:46.357 --> 43:48.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT ZAPOTOSKY: I would guess,
yes.

43:48.192 --> 43:51.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Matt Zapotosky, who
covers the
Justice Department for The
Washington Post,

43:51.895 --> 43:52.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thanks for joining us.

43:52.896 --> 43:54.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT ZAPOTOSKY: Thank you.

43:54.898 --> 43:58.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And now we go back to
Capitol Hill
for a Democratic perspective
this time, Representative

43:58.535 --> 44:03.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Adam Schiff of California, the
ranking member
on the House Intelligence
Committee.

44:03.340 --> 44:05.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Schiff, thanks for joining
us.

44:05.109 --> 44:08.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your reaction to this news that
the Justice
Department has appointed Robert
Mueller as

44:08.946 --> 44:10.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the special counsel in this
case?

44:10.481 --> 44:12.249 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

44:12.282 --> 44:14.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF (D), California:
Well, I think
it's a very positive step, and I
applaud the

44:14.451 --> 44:16.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
choice of Bob Mueller.

44:16.320 --> 44:20.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think he's very widely
respected by people
on both sides of the aisle,
immensely bright,

44:20.958 --> 44:22.660 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
capable person.

44:22.693 --> 44:24.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think it's the right call.

44:24.461 --> 44:27.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is not to say that there
aren't good
career people at the Department
of Justice

44:27.498 --> 44:29.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that could do this.

44:29.299 --> 44:33.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, nonetheless, I think it
will have that
much more credibility in the
public eye by

44:33.504 --> 44:38.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appointing someone in the
special counsel
position that has that added
degree of independence

44:38.242 --> 44:44.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the department, still not
the full independence
that you would have had under
the old statute,

44:44.581 --> 44:49.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
independent counsel statute,
but, nonetheless,
I think a very solid decision.

44:49.319 --> 44:52.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it ought to help
inspire confidence
in what the department is doing.

44:52.890 --> 44:55.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Now, how will this
work with the
investigations on the Hill?

44:56.026 --> 45:01.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Will your committee
investigation continue
in parallel with Mr. Mueller's?

45:01.165 --> 45:02.132 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

45:02.166 --> 45:03.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Yes, absolutely.

45:04.001 --> 45:05.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's very important, I
think, for people
to understand just what this
means and what

45:05.502 --> 45:07.204 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it doesn't mean.

45:07.237 --> 45:10.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The House and Senate
investigations will continue
to go forward.

45:10.107 --> 45:12.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have very important oversight
responsibility.

45:12.209 --> 45:17.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, obviously, if we uncovered
facts that
we think that prosecutors ought
to know about,

45:17.214 --> 45:20.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we would refer that now to the
special counsel.

45:20.250 --> 45:25.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the sense that we may need to
coordinate
our activities, because we have
parallel investigations

45:25.756 --> 45:29.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
running, we would now work with
Mr. Mueller.

45:29.460 --> 45:33.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, none of this stops what's
going on in
the House and Senate.

45:33.764 --> 45:39.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Indeed, if we form an
independent commission,
that also is a completely
separate mission

45:39.303 --> 45:41.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than that by the special
counsel.

45:41.138 --> 45:45.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The special counsel will be
overseeing the
FBI agents who are working the
investigation,

45:45.642 --> 45:49.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the special counsel will be
making decisions,
if it comes to that, whether
charges ought

45:49.780 --> 45:51.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be brought and against whom.

45:51.482 --> 45:55.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And what will your
committee be
asking for, with this disclosure
that Mr.

45:55.652 --> 46:02.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Comey appears to have kept
contemporaneous
memos of his conversations and
dealings with

46:02.426 --> 46:04.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the president throughout this?

46:04.361 --> 46:06.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Will you be seeking those
documents?

46:06.230 --> 46:08.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Will you be seeking testimony
from Mr. Comey?

46:08.165 --> 46:09.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

46:09.566 --> 46:12.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: I think we will in
Congress be
seeking those documents.

46:12.302 --> 46:15.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Indeed, many of the chairs have
already asked
for them.

46:15.606 --> 46:19.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I also think it will be
important for Director
Comey to come and testify once
again, I hope

46:19.610 --> 46:25.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in open session, so that we can
add context
to whatever is in these written
memoranda.

46:25.849 --> 46:30.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there are tapes as well, as
the president
has threatened, we ought to
obtain those.

46:30.687 --> 46:36.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those, in fact, would be the
very best evidence
of the discussions that may have
taken place

46:36.360 --> 46:41.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
along the lines of that New York
Times report
in which it's alleged that the
president asked

46:41.064 --> 46:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Director Comey to drop the
investigation of
Michael Flynn.

46:43.634 --> 46:48.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, all of that work in Congress
by the House
Intelligence Committee, by the
Senate Intelligence

46:48.572 --> 46:51.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Committee and others will go
forth.

46:51.208 --> 46:57.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's just that the FBI
investigation, the
prosecutorial decisions will now
be made by

46:57.181 --> 46:59.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the special counsel, Bob
Mueller.

46:59.149 --> 47:05.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And on that question
of the tapes,
the -- is there going to be any
investigation

47:05.389 --> 47:07.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to determine if there are tapes
to ask for?

47:07.624 --> 47:08.892 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

47:08.926 --> 47:11.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, we do need to
find out
whether there are tapes.

47:11.428 --> 47:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think we need to use
whatever compulsion,
if necessary, to find out.

47:16.166 --> 47:20.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president has obviously
stopped talking
about the tapes, and we don't
know whether

47:20.370 --> 47:26.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was a -- simply a hollow
threat he was
making against Director Comey or
in fact it's

47:26.877 --> 47:29.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
backed up by the existence of
tapes, but we
do need to find out.

47:29.880 --> 47:33.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Where is this -- can
you give us
an update on sort of where your
investigation

47:33.984 --> 47:39.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, where the House committee's
investigation
is, and where it's likely to
proceed in the

47:39.590 --> 47:40.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
immediate future?

47:40.591 --> 47:42.292 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

47:42.326 --> 47:45.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, we are where
you would
expect a large investigation of
this kind

47:45.229 --> 47:46.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to begin.

47:46.630 --> 47:49.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is with a review of an
extraordinary
number of documents.

47:49.433 --> 47:54.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of them are intelligence
assessments
that underlie the intelligence
community's

47:54.037 --> 47:57.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
conclusion about Russian
intervention, about
the Russian motivations.

47:57.107 --> 48:00.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, we're also looking
into the issues
of collusions.

48:00.210 --> 48:03.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Were U.S. persons involved
associated with
the Trump campaign?

48:03.947 --> 48:06.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're inviting witnesses to
provide us documents.

48:06.183 --> 48:08.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're inviting witnesses to come
before the
committee.

48:08.785 --> 48:10.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're scheduling open and closed
hearings.

48:10.854 --> 48:13.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we should have more to say
about that
in the near future.

48:13.457 --> 48:15.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But these are all the steps that
we're taking.

48:15.659 --> 48:19.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we're working
together very well
in a nonpartisan way.

48:19.763 --> 48:24.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Representative Adam
Schiff, top
Democrat on the House
Intelligence Committee,

48:24.067 --> 48:27.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thank you very much.

48:27.771 --> 48:28.739 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

48:28.772 --> 48:32.342 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ADAM SCHIFF: Thank you.

48:32.376 --> 48:39.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Now to the continuing
fallout from
the reports that President Trump
shared highly

48:40.017 --> 48:44.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
classified intelligence with
Russian diplomats
that came from Israel.

48:44.588 --> 48:46.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that.

48:46.356 --> 48:49.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It was The New
York Times
that first reported yesterday
that Israel

48:49.526 --> 48:54.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was the source of that
classified intelligence
about ISIS that President Trump
allegedly

48:54.064 --> 48:55.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
divulged to Russian diplomats.

48:56.033 --> 49:00.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If true, what are the
ramifications, not only
for the political relationship
between the

49:00.637 --> 49:05.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. and Israel, but the close
ties between
the nations' intelligence
services?

49:05.642 --> 49:07.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For that, we turn to Ronen
Bergman.

49:07.511 --> 49:12.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's the intelligence
correspondent for Israel's
largest daily newspaper, Yedioth
Ahronoth.

49:12.883 --> 49:17.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His forthcoming book is called
"Rise and Kill
First: The Secret History of
Israel's Targeted

49:17.721 --> 49:18.822 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Assassinations."

49:18.855 --> 49:20.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he joins me now from Tel
Aviv.

49:20.891 --> 49:26.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ronen, may I first ask you, were
you able
to confirm that this
intelligence that the

49:26.663 --> 49:31.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president allegedly divulged was
in fact from
Israel, and, if so, what the
reaction among

49:31.301 --> 49:32.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Israeli intelligence has been?

49:32.903 --> 49:37.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RONEN BERGMAN, Analyst, Yedioth
Ahronoth:
This is not yet finally
confirmed.

49:37.374 --> 49:42.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's an investigation going
on in Israel,
trying to check which of the
many, many items

49:42.913 --> 49:46.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of intelligence that was
delivered to the
United States during the last
three or four

49:46.550 --> 49:55.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months regarding Syria, the
activity of ISIS,
Russia, Hezbollah, Iran, all
closely guarded

49:55.759 --> 50:02.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Israel, which of these items
were given
by President Trump to Foreign
Minister Lavrov.

50:02.232 --> 50:08.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As per the emotions or the
reactions inside
Israeli intelligence community,
I would say

50:08.839 --> 50:11.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they are ballistic.

50:11.141 --> 50:15.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are many people who are
extremely upset.

50:15.145 --> 50:22.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of them told me, this is
sort of -- this
is a kick, violation in our
sacred trust of

50:22.586 --> 50:27.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
each other, a blunt violation of
everything
the two countries agreed.

50:28.025 --> 50:35.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That person said that maybe the
president
has an authority, as he tweeted,
to deliver

50:35.298 --> 50:40.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. intelligence, but he
doesn't have any
authority to share Israeli
intelligence and

50:40.637 --> 50:44.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intelligence that was shared
with these close
circles of Americans, and just
Americans,

50:44.741 --> 50:46.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with anyone else.

50:46.109 --> 50:48.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President
Trump spoke with
Netanyahu yesterday.

50:48.845 --> 50:51.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Certainly, this must have been
part of that
conversation.

50:51.615 --> 50:57.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RONEN BERGMAN: Well, I don't
know what was
said or not said during that
conversation.

50:57.754 --> 51:04.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
However, Prime Minister
Netanyahu ordered
his staff not to react in any
way to the recent

51:04.895 --> 51:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scandals in the United States,
including the
leakage of information, Israeli
intelligence

51:09.900 --> 51:11.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the Russians.

51:11.668 --> 51:18.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he's -- I think that
Netanyahu is a bit
intimidated of and afraid of
President Trump.

51:18.241 --> 51:24.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Mr. Netanyahu is doing
whatever he can
to play down this affair and not
doing anything

51:24.648 --> 51:27.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that could harm the president's
visit to Israel
next week.

51:27.517 --> 51:31.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In your
reporting, have
you gotten any sense that
Israeli intelligence

51:31.688 --> 51:37.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is now trying to preserve or
protect or somehow
try to cover the intelligence
that they have

51:37.661 --> 51:40.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
already shared with the United
States because
of this?

51:40.530 --> 51:42.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RONEN BERGMAN: Yes, indeed.

51:42.299 --> 51:47.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a risk assessment and
damage assessment
process going on as we speak.

51:47.204 --> 51:55.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the assumption, as in all
intelligence
scandals, is the worst-case
scenario, meaning

51:55.078 --> 51:58.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that much of the information is
in jeopardy.

51:58.515 --> 52:06.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Therefore, steps need to be
taken to minimize
the damage, save the lives
sources and protect

52:06.723 --> 52:10.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the SIGINT, the signal
intelligence sources,
as much as possible.

52:10.527 --> 52:18.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If, indeed, information that is
in the hands
of U.S. intelligence, U.S.
National Security

52:18.101 --> 52:26.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Council, U.S. president is not
safe, that
means that much of the secrets
of Israel,

52:26.343 --> 52:31.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of them secrets that took
years to -- modus
operandi, sources took years to
develop, much,

52:31.348 --> 52:37.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much resources, human lives, are
at risk.

52:37.654 --> 52:45.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the Israeli officials
told me that
he believes that there needs to
be a reassessment

52:45.395 --> 52:51.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of everything that was -- that
will be delivered
to the U.S. from this point on,
until it's

52:51.568 --> 52:56.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proven that the channel, this
pipeline of
information going from Israel to
the United

52:56.806 --> 53:02.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States, and vice versa, of
course, is safe
again and can be trusted 100
percent.

53:02.913 --> 53:06.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nothing less than 100 percent is
not secure.

53:06.216 --> 53:09.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Ronen Bergman,
thank you very, very much for
your time.

53:09.953 --> 53:11.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RONEN BERGMAN: Thank you.

53:11.254 --> 53:12.522 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Have a good day.

53:12.556 --> 53:14.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Once again, our top
story tonight.

53:14.791 --> 53:21.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Justice Department has named
former FBI
