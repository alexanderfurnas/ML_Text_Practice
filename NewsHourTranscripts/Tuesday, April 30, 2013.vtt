AFTER THE 2010 ELECTIONS,

17:38.932 --> 17:39.963
HIS PRESIDENCY, PARTICULARLY
AFTER THE 2010 ELECTIONS,
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR HIM

17:39.965 --> 17:41.030
AFTER THE 2010 ELECTIONS,
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR HIM
TO GET THE CONGRESS TO GO

17:41.032 --> 17:42.397
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR HIM
TO GET THE CONGRESS TO GO
ALONG WITH THE THINGS HE

17:42.399 --> 17:43.030
TO GET THE CONGRESS TO GO
ALONG WITH THE THINGS HE
WANTS TO DO.

17:43.032 --> 17:45.130
ALONG WITH THE THINGS HE
WANTS TO DO.
AND WE THOUGHT PERHAPS AFTER

17:45.132 --> 17:46.263
WANTS TO DO.
AND WE THOUGHT PERHAPS AFTER
THE RE-ELECTION HE WOULD

17:46.265 --> 17:48.163
AND WE THOUGHT PERHAPS AFTER
THE RE-ELECTION HE WOULD
HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE

17:48.165 --> 17:49.197
THE RE-ELECTION HE WOULD
HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE
STRENGTH TO DO THAT.

17:49.199 --> 17:50.697
HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE
STRENGTH TO DO THAT.
BUT VERY QUICKLY WE FELL

17:50.699 --> 17:51.864
STRENGTH TO DO THAT.
BUT VERY QUICKLY WE FELL
BACK INTO THE SAME

17:51.866 --> 17:52.263
BUT VERY QUICKLY WE FELL
BACK INTO THE SAME
DIVISIONS.

17:52.265 --> 17:54.231
BACK INTO THE SAME
DIVISIONS.
AND IT'S HARD FOR HIM TO

17:54.233 --> 17:55.231
DIVISIONS.
AND IT'S HARD FOR HIM TO
OVERCOME THAT.

17:55.233 --> 17:55.931
AND IT'S HARD FOR HIM TO
OVERCOME THAT.

YOU KNOW, RIGHT AFTER THE
ELECTION PEOPLE AROUND THE
PRESIDENT WERE SAYING THIS

18:07.567 --> 18:08.298

THIS IS A RATIFICATION OF
EVERYTHING THAT HE WAS
TRYING TO DO.

18:10.967 --> 18:13.165
EVERYTHING THAT HE WAS
TRYING TO DO.
BUT I THINK IT'S BEEN A

18:13.167 --> 18:14.832
TRYING TO DO.
BUT I THINK IT'S BEEN A
CONFLUENCE OF A BUNCH OF

18:14.834 --> 18:15.731
BUT I THINK IT'S BEEN A
CONFLUENCE OF A BUNCH OF
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES.

18:15.733 --> 18:17.466
CONFLUENCE OF A BUNCH OF
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES.
I THINK A LOT OF THIS HAS TO

18:17.468 --> 18:18.532
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES.
I THINK A LOT OF THIS HAS TO
DO WITH THE PREDICATE THAT

18:18.534 --> 18:19.532
I THINK A LOT OF THIS HAS TO
DO WITH THE PREDICATE THAT
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF

18:19.534 --> 18:20.532
DO WITH THE PREDICATE THAT
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF
ESTABLISHED IN THE FIRST

THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF
ESTABLISHED IN THE FIRST
FOUR YEARS.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.232
ESTABLISHED IN THE FIRST
FOUR YEARS.
HE DOES NOT HAVE GREAT

18:22.234 --> 18:22.866
FOUR YEARS.
HE DOES NOT HAVE GREAT
RELATIONSHIPS ON THE HILL

18:22.868 --> 18:23.933
HE DOES NOT HAVE GREAT
RELATIONSHIPS ON THE HILL
WITH DEMOCRATS OR

18:23.935 --> 18:24.966
RELATIONSHIPS ON THE HILL
WITH DEMOCRATS OR
REPUBLICANS.

18:24.968 --> 18:26.666
WITH DEMOCRATS OR
REPUBLICANS.
AND AT THIS POINT IN TIME HE

18:26.668 --> 18:28.866
REPUBLICANS.
AND AT THIS POINT IN TIME HE
NEEDS TO HAVE LEVERAGE UP ON

18:28.868 --> 18:30.866
AND AT THIS POINT IN TIME HE
NEEDS TO HAVE LEVERAGE UP ON
THE HILL AND HE JUST CAN'T

18:30.868 --> 18:32.100
NEEDS TO HAVE LEVERAGE UP ON
THE HILL AND HE JUST CAN'T
RELY ON RELATIONSHIPS.

18:32.102 --> 18:32.799
THE HILL AND HE JUST CAN'T
RELY ON RELATIONSHIPS.

I THINK HE IS-- HE'S
PARTIALLY RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

19:36.606 --> 19:38.304
I THINK HE IS-- HE'S
PARTIALLY RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
I THINK, YOU KNOW, TO A

19:38.306 --> 19:41.671
PARTIALLY RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
I THINK, YOU KNOW, TO A
CERTAIN EXTENT AS DAN SAID,

19:41.673 --> 19:43.771
I THINK, YOU KNOW, TO A
CERTAIN EXTENT AS DAN SAID,
THE PRESIDENT IS FACING THIS

THE PRESIDENT IS FACING THIS
INCREDIBLE DIVISION.

19:45.107 --> 19:47.071
THE PRESIDENT IS FACING THIS
INCREDIBLE DIVISION.
HE HAS COME UP, HOWEVER,

19:47.073 --> 19:49.472
INCREDIBLE DIVISION.
HE HAS COME UP, HOWEVER,
WITH A FAIRLY REASONABLE

19:49.474 --> 19:50.838
HE HAS COME UP, HOWEVER,
WITH A FAIRLY REASONABLE
STRATEGY WHICH IS TO

WITH A FAIRLY REASONABLE
STRATEGY WHICH IS TO
APPROACH THE SENATE AND

19:52.240 --> 19:53.971
STRATEGY WHICH IS TO
APPROACH THE SENATE AND
ATTEMPT TO MAKE THESE DEALS

19:53.973 --> 19:54.538
APPROACH THE SENATE AND
ATTEMPT TO MAKE THESE DEALS
THROUGH THE SENATE.

19:54.540 --> 19:56.004
ATTEMPT TO MAKE THESE DEALS
THROUGH THE SENATE.
I THINK ON THE IMMIGRATION

19:56.006 --> 19:57.039
THROUGH THE SENATE.
I THINK ON THE IMMIGRATION
BILL IN PARTICULAR.

19:57.041 --> 19:58.738
I THINK ON THE IMMIGRATION
BILL IN PARTICULAR.
HE CAN ESTABLISH A CONDUIT

19:58.740 --> 19:59.772
BILL IN PARTICULAR.
HE CAN ESTABLISH A CONDUIT
AND PUT MORE PRESSURE ON THE

19:59.774 --> 20:00.772
HE CAN ESTABLISH A CONDUIT
AND PUT MORE PRESSURE ON THE
HOUSE REPUBLICANS.

20:00.774 --> 20:02.306
AND PUT MORE PRESSURE ON THE
HOUSE REPUBLICANS.
IN TERMS OF LEGACY, THAT

20:02.308 --> 20:03.905
HOUSE REPUBLICANS.
IN TERMS OF LEGACY, THAT
PARTICULAR ARGUMENT HASN'T

WORKED SO FAR.

>> WELL, I THINK THAT'S
RIGHT.
I THINK IN SOME WAY WAS WE

20:10.675 --> 20:12.139
RIGHT.
I THINK IN SOME WAY WAS WE
HAVE SEEN SINCE THE ELECTION

20:12.141 --> 20:14.107
I THINK IN SOME WAY WAS WE
HAVE SEEN SINCE THE ELECTION
IS A TWO-PRONG STRATEGY

20:14.109 --> 20:15.439
HAVE SEEN SINCE THE ELECTION
IS A TWO-PRONG STRATEGY
WHICH IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

20:15.441 --> 20:16.539
IS A TWO-PRONG STRATEGY
WHICH IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
THAN WHAT HE DID IN 2011.

20:16.541 --> 20:17.873
WHICH IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
THAN WHAT HE DID IN 2011.
I THINK THERE IS STILL AN

20:17.875 --> 20:19.539
THAN WHAT HE DID IN 2011.
I THINK THERE IS STILL AN
EFFORT WORKING THE INSIDE.

20:19.541 --> 20:20.973
I THINK THERE IS STILL AN
EFFORT WORKING THE INSIDE.
AND AS GLENN SAYS MOSTLY

20:20.975 --> 20:21.973
EFFORT WORKING THE INSIDE.
AND AS GLENN SAYS MOSTLY
THROUGH THE SENATE, HOPING

THROUGH THE SENATE, HOPING
TO BREAK THROUGH WITH SOME

20:23.342 --> 20:24.307
THROUGH THE SENATE, HOPING
TO BREAK THROUGH WITH SOME
REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO ARE

20:24.309 --> 20:25.707
TO BREAK THROUGH WITH SOME
REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO ARE
CERTAINLY FRUSTRATED BY THE

REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO ARE
CERTAINLY FRUSTRATED BY THE
INABILITY OF CONGRESS TO DO

20:26.742 --> 20:27.574
CERTAINLY FRUSTRATED BY THE
INABILITY OF CONGRESS TO DO
SOME THINGS.

20:27.576 --> 20:29.207
INABILITY OF CONGRESS TO DO
SOME THINGS.
BUT THERE IS A MORE

20:29.209 --> 20:30.974

EXPERIENCE.

23:22.120 --> 23:24.085

OF THESE THINGS DONE.

23:58.455 --> 23:59.820
GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET SOME

I THINK THEY FEEL THAT RIGHT

23:59.822 --> 24:00.887
OF THESE THINGS DONE.
I THINK THEY FEEL THAT RIGHT
NOW THERE'S A STORY LINE

BECAUSE OF THE GUNS VOTE AND

24:03.623 --> 24:05.354
THAT HAS KIND OF DEVELOPED
BECAUSE OF THE GUNS VOTE AND
BECAUSE OF THIS CHANGE IN

24:05.356 --> 24:08.087
BECAUSE OF THE GUNS VOTE AND
BECAUSE OF THIS CHANGE IN
THE FAA FUNDING, THAT HE'S

GET HIS WAY.

24:10.256 --> 24:12.354
ON THE DEFENSIVE AND CAN'T

I THINK THEIR FEELING IS

24:12.356 --> 24:13.855

I THINK THEIR FEELING IS
IT'S A NICE STORY FOR THE

24:13.857 --> 24:15.255
I THINK THEIR FEELING IS

THEY'VE GOT BIGGER FISH

THEY'VE GOT BIGGER FISH
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO FRY.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.689
THEY'VE GOT BIGGER FISH
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO FRY.
BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE IS

24:19.691 --> 24:21.388
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO FRY.
BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE IS
A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THEIR

24:21.390 --> 24:22.388
BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE IS
A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THEIR
AMBITIONS ARE ON THE BUDGET

24:22.390 --> 24:23.422
A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THEIR
AMBITIONS ARE ON THE BUDGET
AT THIS POINT.

24:23.424 --> 24:24.789
AMBITIONS ARE ON THE BUDGET
AT THIS POINT.
I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THEY

24:24.791 --> 24:27.156

I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THEY
ARE AS AMBITIOUS IN THEIR

ARE AS AMBITIOUS IN THEIR
EXPECTATIONS AS THEY MIGHT
HAVE BEEN BEFORE.

24:29.624 --> 24:31.089
EXPECTATIONS AS THEY MIGHT
HAVE BEEN BEFORE.
SO WE COULD GET SOME

SO WE COULD GET SOME
SOLUTION TO THE BUDGET

THAT.
THEY'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF
SEARCHES.

29:34.410 --> 29:36.642
THEY'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF
SEARCHES.
ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WITH

29:36.644 --> 29:37.909

ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WITH
THE CASE RIGHT NOW IS TRYING

29:37.911 --> 29:39.408

TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY PUT
THE BOMBS TOGETHER.

29:40.777 --> 29:42.475

29:43.178 --> 29:44.876
IT'S STILL SOMEWHAT OF A
MYSTERY.
THEY DID SEARCHES OF THE

29:44.878 --> 29:46.542

AND SO THESE ARE MESSY
THINGS TO PUT TOGETHER.

29:51.678 --> 29:53.376

THINGS TO PUT TOGETHER.
THESE ARE BLACK POWDER

THINGS TO PUT TOGETHER.
THESE ARE BLACK POWDER
BOMBS.

29:53.712 --> 29:55.743

SO IT'S VERY UNUSUAL FOR YOU
NOT TO BE ABLE TO FIND IT

29:56.979 --> 29:58.110
