THAT THESE WERE INDEED THE REAL

03:15.500 --> 03:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THING.

03:15.933 --> 03:20.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ALSO, TODAY I BELIEVE, THE

TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS EFFECTIVELY

03:22.133 --> 03:24.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

03:24.867 --> 03:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RETURNS.

03:25.900 --> 03:26.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVEN'T CHALLENGED ANY OF THE

03:26.767 --> 03:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEMBERS, IN FACT HIS SURROGATES

03:28.300 --> 03:30.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE SAYING THAT THIS SHOWS HIS

03:30.567 --> 03:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENIUS AT FIGURING OUT HOW TO

03:33.633 --> 03:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AVOID PAYING TAXES.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IN LOOKING CAREFULLY THAT

03:37.600 --> 03:38.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE THREE PAGES WHICH TO BE

03:38.967 --> 03:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURE ARE JUST A TINY PORTION OF

03:44.133 --> 03:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT A DONALD TRUMP TAX RETURN

03:45.400 --> 03:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD LOOK LIKE, WE'RE ABLE TO

03:48.800 --> 03:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE THAT HE SHOWED THIS ENORMOUS

03:51.700 --> 03:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOSS OF ROUGHLY $916 MILLION IN

03:57.133 --> 04:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1995, AND THAT UNDER IRS TAX

04:01.000 --> 04:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RULES THEN IN EFFECT, HE COULD

04:03.733 --> 04:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USE SOME IMPORTANT PROVISIONS OF

04:05.933 --> 04:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CODE TO APPLY THAT LOSS

04:11.733 --> 04:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST ANOTHER $916 MILLION IN

04:14.933 --> 04:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAXABLE INCOME.

04:16.633 --> 04:18.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE TAX EXPERTS EXPLAINED

04:18.667 --> 04:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO US IF ONE OF HIS CLIENTS

04:20.033 --> 04:21.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROUGHT HIM A TAX RETURN THAT

04:21.867 --> 04:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKED LIKE THIS IN 1995, HE

04:24.433 --> 04:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD BE SAYING TO HIM

04:28.333 --> 04:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU CAN MAKE

04:31.133 --> 04:33.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
$916 MILLION AND NOT PAY A

04:33.167 --> 04:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SINGLE NICKEL IN TAXES ON THIS.

04:36.700 --> 04:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT DONALD

04:39.333 --> 04:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP DID ANYTHING ILLEGAL OR

04:41.967 --> 04:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPROPER, IT'S REALLY ABOUT HIM,

17:57.267 --> 17:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, WHAT DO THESE CAP DATES HAVE

17:58.533 --> 18:01.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DO TO WIN THAT GIANT PRIZE

18:01.867 --> 18:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKING IN THE TAMPA BAY AREA.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ORLANDO AND TAMPA MEDIA MARKETS

18:11.700 --> 18:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOGETHER DO CONTROL OR CAN HAVE

18:14.033 --> 18:14.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
44% OF THE VOTERS.

18:14.867 --> 18:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT THOSE

18:16.833 --> 18:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO MARKETS ARE ALMOST EVENLY

18:19.100 --> 18:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIVIDED BETWEEN THE PERCENT

18:20.633 --> 18:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGISTERED DEMOCRATS AND

18:21.733 --> 18:24.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE ELECTORATE.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT'S JUST A VERY VERY

18:34.600 --> 18:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPETITIVE GEOGRAPHY.

18:35.700 --> 18:39.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE CALL THE I4 CORRIDOR THE

OFF.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES IT COME DOWN TO THE ECONOMY

18:54.967 --> 18:56.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS IT IS IN SO MANY PARTS OF THE

18:56.567 --> 18:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY AS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

19:00.000 --> 19:01.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLLS HERE STILL SHOW THAT'S THE

19:01.467 --> 19:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERN OF MOST PEOPLE.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF

19:04.700 --> 19:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDIES RECENTLY WHICH SHOW THE

19:06.733 --> 19:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIGH PERCENTAGE OF FLORIDIANS

19:10.133 --> 19:13.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO ONLY MAKE AN AVERAGE OR

19:13.367 --> 19:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELOW AVERAGE WAGES IN TERMS OF

STATE.

19:16.700 --> 19:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND POLLS ARE ALSO SHOW THAT A

19:19.233 --> 19:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARGE PERCENTAGE STILL SAY THAT

19:20.433 --> 19:22.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE FEELING SOME STRESS IN

19:22.967 --> 19:24.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR LIVES FINANCIALLY.

19:24.567 --> 19:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I OFTEN LOOK AT WHEN GAUGING

PEOPLE'S OPINION ABOUT THE

19:28.800 --> 19:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMY SIMPLE THINGS LIKE HOW

19:31.433 --> 19:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE YOU DOING AND THEY'LL SAY

19:34.200 --> 19:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO-SO INSTEAD OF SAY YOU NOTICE

19:36.533 --> 19:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY INCREASES IN THINGS THAT

19:38.700 --> 19:40.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY AFFECT YOUR BOTTOM LINE

19:40.067 --> 19:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ALMOST ALWAYS A VERY GOOD

19:42.133 --> 19:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENCHMARK IS GROCERIES AND

19:43.833 --> 19:45.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROCERY PRICES HAVE GONE UP.

19:45.567 --> 19:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:02.967 --> 20:03.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OF COURSE THE CLIMATE AND

20:03.967 --> 20:05.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ENVIRONMENT ITSELF ARE

20:05.367 --> 20:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABSOLUTELY CLOSELY LINKED WITH

20:07.467 --> 20:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLORIDA'S ECONOMY.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THIS STATE IS ONE WHERE EVEN

20:11.400 --> 20:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUGH WE'VE RECOVERED ON PAPER

20:12.400 --> 20:14.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT

20:14.367 --> 20:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY PERSONALLY DON'T FEEL

20:16.533 --> 20:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
