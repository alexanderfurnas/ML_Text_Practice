HARI SREENIVASAN: And to our
"NewsHour" Shares, something
that caught our eye that may be

00:03.266 --> 00:05.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

00:05.333 --> 00:10.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This year marks the 60th
anniversary of the debut
of a musical oddity,
the Great Stalacpipe

00:11.100 --> 00:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Organ of Virginia's
Luray Caverns.

00:13.566 --> 00:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"NewsHour" recently got a
behind-the-scenes look at the
one-of-a-kind instrument from

00:17.133 --> 00:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those who know it best.

00:18.733 --> 00:22.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Cavern historian John
Shaffer starts us off.

JOHN SHAFFER, Luray
Caverns Corporation: Luray
caverns is home to the
largest musical instrument

00:31.533 --> 00:35.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the world, the
Great Stalacpipe Organ.

00:35.300 --> 00:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it plays the stalactites.

00:40.133 --> 00:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The organ was created
by Leland W. Sprinkle.

00:43.233 --> 00:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Sprinkle toured the caverns
in 1954 with his young son,
and, at that time, the guides

00:50.400 --> 00:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would tap stalactites to
show that the different sizes
give off different tones.

00:54.866 --> 00:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LARRY MOYER, Operations Manager:
What he did was take rubber
mallets and a concept of an

01:01.266 --> 01:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
organ and put it all
together Into an instrument.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Larry Moyer.

01:05.533 --> 01:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I am operations manager for
the Great Stalacpipe Organ.

01:11.966 --> 01:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're actually standing
inside the organ as it plays,
because the stalactites cover

01:16.200 --> 01:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
over three-and-a-half
acres around us.

01:19.333 --> 01:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Basically, we call it
like a player-type piano.

01:22.733 --> 01:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the sheet of plastic is
your song, and as the drum
rotates, the metal brushes fall

01:29.266 --> 01:32.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
into contact through
holes in the plastic
and sends the notes out.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, on occasion, we will
have an organist present.

01:35.533 --> 01:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OTTO PEBWORTH, Organist: A pipe
organ produces its sounds by
forcing air through columns.

01:42.566 --> 01:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we are doing here is,
we are actually playing a
37-note percussion instrument.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Otto Pebworth.

01:50.733 --> 01:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I play the organ here at Luray
Caverns, and I have been playing
pipe organs now for close

01:56.766 --> 02:00.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to 30 years.

02:00.900 --> 02:04.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's very settling,
very soothing.

02:04.566 --> 02:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just have a chance just
to stop and let everything
go quiet and make music.

02:10.733 --> 02:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's what makes
it the nicest thing.

02:12.866 --> 02:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A room like this lends itself
more towards the more peaceful
things like "Moonlight Sonata"

02:22.366 --> 02:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or some of the Bach preludes.

02:26.566 --> 02:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Stalacpipe Organ is a
totally unique instrument
unto itself, and,
because of that, you can

02:38.033 --> 02:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
just hear something that
is just totally natural
and totally special.

02:44.633 --> 02:45.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can't be duplicated.
