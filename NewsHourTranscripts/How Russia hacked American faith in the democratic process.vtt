JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn back
to the Russia investigations
and the issue at their core:

00:05.233 --> 00:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that government's meddling
in the 2016 U.S. election.

00:09.033 --> 00:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How Russian officials made
it happen is the focus of at
least three official probes in

00:16.033 --> 00:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington, but information
about what they did and didn't
do to our voting process and

00:21.033 --> 00:23.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to our confidence in
our election system has
come in fits and starts.

00:23.600 --> 00:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A new cover story for "TIME"
magazine takes a deep dive into
what we know now, connecting

00:29.766 --> 00:33.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the dots of how, why
and how far they went.

00:33.933 --> 00:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's titled "Inside the
Secret Plan to Stop Vladimir
Putin's U.S. Election Plot."

00:40.733 --> 00:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the author, "TIME"
magazine's Massimo Calabresi,
is here with me now.

00:45.133 --> 00:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the program, Massimo.

00:47.266 --> 00:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what you have reported in
this issue of "TIME" is what
we don't know before, how far

00:53.566 --> 00:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the federal government had
gone last year to prevent
damage by the Russians.

00:56.633 --> 01:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MASSIMO CALABRESI, "TIME":
In the days leading up
to the election, the top
federal cyber-security

01:03.633 --> 01:07.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
officials realized that,
for the efforts they
had taken throughout
the election, our voting

01:10.100 --> 01:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
system was still vulnerable, not
to interference with the actual
vote count, but to undermining

01:17.900 --> 01:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the credibility of the vote,
the integrity of the vote,
which is, of course, the purpose

01:21.966 --> 01:26.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of voting to begin with,
to reach a consensus
that the democratic
will of the people has

01:26.233 --> 01:28.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been expressed.

01:28.233 --> 01:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what
was it that the government
was prepared to do?

01:30.766 --> 01:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MASSIMO CALABRESI: Well, they
enumerated in this 15-page
plan some extraordinary steps.

01:34.800 --> 01:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They stipulated at the beginning
that, under most circumstances,
the federal government

01:42.266 --> 01:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would defer to the states
in a cyber-incident,
but in a particularly
bad one, for example,

01:46.966 --> 01:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one that halted voting at a
voting place, they would go
so far as to send armed law

01:52.433 --> 01:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
enforcement, federal
law enforcement agents
to polling places.

01:55.033 --> 01:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were prepared to
deploy active and reserve
military forces in case
of a massive incident.

02:02.866 --> 02:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they also prepared for
counterpropaganda efforts in the
wake of the vote, should false

02:10.466 --> 02:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
information be spread to try
and undermine its credibility.

02:13.300 --> 02:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what had they
seen that caused them to go to
this length before election?

02:20.366 --> 02:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MASSIMO CALABRESI: So,
initially, they saw
one or two states back
in the summer where

02:26.933 --> 02:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Russians had broken
into the voter registration
rolls and meddled around.

02:34.466 --> 02:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the more they looked,
the more they found other
states had been compromised.

02:38.800 --> 02:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they didn't quite know
what the Russians were doing.

02:42.600 --> 02:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Initially, they thought they
might be able to swing the
vote, but they soon concluded

02:46.766 --> 02:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that actual meddling with
the vote count wasn't
going to be possible.

02:51.100 --> 02:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they decided that what
the Russians could do was take
certain actions that would call

02:58.066 --> 03:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into question whether it
had been free and fair, like
interfering with the reporting

03:04.266 --> 03:07.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
systems on election
night, meddling with
voter rolls throughout
the country in ways that

03:10.066 --> 03:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would cause long lines
or, in swing states, might
cause an extraordinary
number of provisional

03:14.366 --> 03:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ballots to be cast.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

03:17.866 --> 03:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Excuse me,
but there were instances
where -- you have
reported, because you have

03:19.800 --> 03:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
written a number of
stories about this, were in
California, for example.

03:23.366 --> 03:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was an instance where a
number of people reported they
had trouble voting because of

03:27.700 --> 03:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how their identity had been
changed in voter registration.

03:30.533 --> 03:32.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MASSIMO CALABRESI:
That's absolutely right.

03:32.766 --> 03:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On primary day in California
in June 2016, the local DA
started getting a bench of calls

03:39.733 --> 03:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from voters saying that they
were not being allowed to vote
because their voter registration

03:43.400 --> 03:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
information had been changed
in the statewide voter
registration database.

03:47.200 --> 03:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The hackers remain unknown in
that case because the state of
California doesn't record the

03:55.133 --> 03:58.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I.P. addresses of computers
that make changes.

03:58.166 --> 04:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, looking back, the federal
officials who were in charge
of defending the vote, in the

04:02.933 --> 04:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
context of the other Russian
intrusions, concluded
that this might have
been a test run by the

04:09.900 --> 04:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russians to show what kind
of disruption they could
cause on Election Day.

04:13.766 --> 04:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And indeed, in this county
in California, the voters
became quite agitated, and the

04:19.633 --> 04:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mystery actually fed the doubt.

04:21.666 --> 04:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I want
to press you on this, because
you're saying that the Russians

04:25.933 --> 04:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were not able -- they weren't
worried that the Russians were
going to be able to change

04:28.800 --> 04:29.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the final vote count.

04:29.833 --> 04:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASSIMO CALABRESI: That's right.

04:31.933 --> 04:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But were able
to get in, in a remarkable
way, into state voter files,

04:36.566 --> 04:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into election systems.

04:38.633 --> 04:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MASSIMO CALABRESI: And this is
what's so important, because the
Russians had over time become

04:41.700 --> 04:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bolder and bolder about their
intrusions, and had not tried
to hide the fact that they

04:46.400 --> 04:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were breaking into systems.

04:48.700 --> 04:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russians are very
skilled cyber-actors, among
the best in the world.

04:51.766 --> 04:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the fact they were remaining
in the open was a clue to the
larger purpose of the operation.

04:59.100 --> 05:01.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's crucial to
keep this in mind.

05:01.500 --> 05:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first and primary goal of
the Russian operation against
the election was to undermine

05:08.133 --> 05:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
American faith in the
democratic process, the
first and abiding goal.

05:14.033 --> 05:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every secondary goal that came
had to first fulfill undermining
our faith in the democratic

05:18.466 --> 05:20.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

05:20.533 --> 05:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what the cyber-security
officials at the White House
and across government at the

05:23.533 --> 05:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FBI and intelligence community
concluded was that these
intrusions were less about the

05:30.566 --> 05:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specific effect that they
could have than they were on
undermining the faith of the

05:35.266 --> 05:37.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Americans in
elections generally.

05:37.300 --> 05:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it appears
that they succeeded, at
least in part, in doing that.

05:40.500 --> 05:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you report that there is
every reason to think that
they may still be engaged in

05:45.500 --> 05:47.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

05:47.033 --> 05:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have an election, governors
election coming up, this year.

05:47.966 --> 05:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASSIMO CALABRESI: That's right.

05:48.966 --> 05:50.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

05:50.666 --> 05:51.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All
of our congressional
elections next year.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASSIMO CALABRESI: That's right.

05:52.266 --> 05:54.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

05:54.300 --> 05:58.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The crucial thing here is,
this is an attack by Russia on
America, not on a particular

05:59.366 --> 06:01.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
candidate or on a
particular party.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their interests are in weakening
the U.S. at home and abroad.

06:07.900 --> 06:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why it's so important
now that we take steps to
try and secure our election,

06:13.700 --> 06:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that this kind of exercise,
propaganda, influence operation
designed to undermine

06:20.466 --> 06:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our faith in the democratic
process here can't
succeed in the future.

06:23.633 --> 06:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how high
up in the Russian government
does the direction of this go?

06:28.333 --> 06:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that at one point
President Obama was reportedly
telling Vladimir Putin, cut

06:33.133 --> 06:34.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it out.

06:34.366 --> 06:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MASSIMO CALABRESI:
Well, that's right.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama famously confronted him
in that photograph of the two
staring at each other icily in

06:39.500 --> 06:42.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
China at a meeting and
told him to cut it out.

06:42.366 --> 06:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The intelligence community
reported publicly in
their assessment in
January that the operation

06:48.533 --> 06:49.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had been approved at
the highest level.

06:49.900 --> 06:51.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And my sources tell
me that means Putin.

06:51.933 --> 06:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it doesn't
get any higher than that.

06:54.666 --> 06:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASSIMO CALABRESI: That's right.

06:56.266 --> 06:59.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
it's a remarkable
collection of stories.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Congratulations on
all this reporting.

07:00.666 --> 07:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I know you're
continuing to work on it.

07:02.766 --> 07:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASSIMO CALABRESI: Thank you.

07:04.166 --> 07:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Massimo Calabresi
with "TIME," thank you.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MASSIMO CALABRESI:
Thanks for having me.
