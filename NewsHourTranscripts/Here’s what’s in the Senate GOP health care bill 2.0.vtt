JUDY WOODRUFF: It is the
Senate Republican health
care bill version 2.0.

00:04.933 --> 00:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party leaders made it public
today, but the path to passage
remained anything but clear.

00:11.133 --> 00:12.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our Lisa Desjardins
begins our coverage.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:14.366 --> 00:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader: So, it's
time to rise to the occasion.

00:16.266 --> 00:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: A
critical moment for
health care and Congress.

00:19.066 --> 00:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
unveiled Senate Republicans'
second-draft bill, hoping it

00:25.233 --> 00:26.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can win the minimum
50 votes he needs.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:28.566 --> 00:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL: The revised
draft improves on the previous
version in a number of ways,

00:31.400 --> 00:36.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
all while retaining the
fundamental goals of
providing stability and
improving affordability.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS:
What has changed?

00:39.033 --> 00:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, it keeps two Obamacare
taxes on the wealthy.

00:42.533 --> 00:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second, it uses that money,
in part, to add more than over
$100 billion in new spending;

00:49.500 --> 00:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$70 billion would go to insurers
to stabilize markets and bring
down out-of-pocket costs,

00:55.266 --> 00:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and $45 billion would
fight the opioid epidemic.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Medicaid, the bill still cuts
future spending significantly,
but does give states more leeway

01:04.433 --> 01:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to expand who is
eligible for the program.

01:07.966 --> 01:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But perhaps the biggest change
is the addition of a proposal
by Texas Senator Ted Cruz.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The so-called Cruz amendment
would let insurers mostly opt
out of all Affordable Care Act

01:19.566 --> 01:21.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
requirements.

01:21.666 --> 01:25.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They could potentially
offer cheaper bare-bones
plans, as long as they
offer a few plans that

01:26.433 --> 01:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
do meet Obamacare standards.

01:29.066 --> 01:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time,
other Republicans are
crafting their own ideas.

01:31.866 --> 01:33.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: Well, you know.

01:35.433 --> 01:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to support Mitch's
effort with his new plan,
but we want an alternative,

01:37.166 --> 01:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and we're going to see
which one can get 50 votes.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're not undercutting Mitch.

01:41.033 --> 01:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's not undercutting us.

01:43.066 --> 01:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Senators
Lindsey Graham of South Carolina
and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana

01:46.666 --> 01:50.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say their amendment would send
more money directly to states.

01:50.566 --> 01:53.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not clear how
much support that has.

01:53.166 --> 01:54.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
As for Democrats:

01:54.166 --> 01:56.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:56.233 --> 01:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: It appears that
little has changed at the core

01:57.900 --> 01:59.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the bill.

01:59.933 --> 02:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Minority Leader
Chuck Schumer says Republicans
will still have a problem

02:03.233 --> 02:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting some key members of
their own party on board.

02:05.966 --> 02:07.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:07.933 --> 02:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Moderate
Republicans looking at this bill
should be able to see that the

02:10.900 --> 02:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
incredibly modest change to
the tax provisions, the small
pot of funding for opioid abuse

02:17.866 --> 02:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
treatment, these other tweaks
around the edges are like a
drop in the bucket, compared to

02:24.166 --> 02:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the bill does to Medicaid,
to seniors, to Americans
with preexisting conditions.

02:31.033 --> 02:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All sides
are now waiting for a pivotal
report, the analysis of the

02:34.933 --> 02:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bill by the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Especially waiting is Wisconsin
Senator Ron Johnson, a key vote.

02:40.433 --> 02:41.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RON JOHNSON (R), Wisconsin:
Show me your math.

02:43.733 --> 02:45.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Show me what the
first baseline was.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Show me what the policy
results in terms of spending.

02:48.733 --> 02:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Republicans
have not yet announced
when they will hold a vote.

02:52.900 --> 02:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Leaders had hoped for next week.

02:55.433 --> 02:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And of the 52 Senate
Republicans, we already
know that two of them
are no-votes on this

02:59.933 --> 03:01.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
latest draft.

03:01.466 --> 03:03.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's Susan Collins of Maine
and Rand Paul of Kentucky.

03:03.966 --> 03:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judy, of course, that means
Mitch McConnell cannot lose
any more Republicans, and there

03:08.266 --> 03:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are many on the fence.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wow.

03:10.733 --> 03:11.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, Lisa, thank you.

03:11.766 --> 03:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, of course, stay here.

03:13.766 --> 03:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to bring in Julie
Rovner, who we know well,
chief correspondent, Washington

03:17.266 --> 03:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
correspondent, for Kaiser
Health News, joining us too.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm going to start
with you, Julie.

03:22.266 --> 03:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there have been some
changes, as Lisa just reported,
to Medicaid, a few, but not

03:28.300 --> 03:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enough to satisfy
these moderates.

03:30.233 --> 03:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What exactly did they do?

03:31.666 --> 03:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER, Kaiser
Health News: That's right.

03:33.066 --> 03:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The moderates have been
unhappy with the Medicaid cuts.

03:35.133 --> 03:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Susan Collins, who, as
we just heard, is already a no,
came out and said, the changes

03:39.766 --> 03:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they would make to
Medicaid go beyond repealing
the Affordable Care Act.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid was expanded in the
Affordable Care Act, but these
changes would actually cap

03:47.300 --> 03:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the program, something
Republicans have been trying
to do since the 1980s.

03:50.933 --> 03:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's for the conservatives.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Moderates are still unhappy.

03:54.733 --> 03:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As Lisa pointed out, there
is a little bit more money
to deal with opioid abuse.

03:58.233 --> 04:01.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They can get out of
the caps if there's a
public health emergency.

04:01.100 --> 04:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But those are pretty
much all the changes
that they have made here.

04:03.333 --> 04:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how is
all this going over, Lisa?

04:05.266 --> 04:06.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

04:06.633 --> 04:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are a lot of big
question marks on Capitol Hill.

04:08.733 --> 04:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that you have got
the same question marks
on the right and the left.

04:12.166 --> 04:16.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They tried to bring in
moderates, and including
giving them the ability
to increase -- the

04:16.933 --> 04:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
states could increase who
can be under Medicaid.

04:19.566 --> 04:23.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's not as much money
to do it, so you would have
to make a choice between the

04:23.066 --> 04:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number of people you could cover
under Medicaid and how much you
would give them in benefits.

04:30.066 --> 04:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't really address
questions of the overall need
for health care some of these

04:32.366 --> 04:34.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
moderates have.

04:34.900 --> 04:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now,
Julie, we heard in Lisa's
report the reference to
what Senator Ted Cruz

04:38.166 --> 04:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has wanted, has to do with
giving states more options.

04:41.733 --> 04:44.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Describe exactly
what that involves.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: Well,
Senator Cruz and a number
of the conservatives
in the House too have

04:46.666 --> 04:49.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
complained that one of
the biggest problems
with the Affordable
Care Act is that people

04:49.733 --> 04:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who buy their own insurance are
finding themselves paying much
more, more both in premiums and

04:54.466 --> 04:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in out-of-pocket spending.

04:55.466 --> 04:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he wants to help people.

04:57.533 --> 04:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But basically the way he would
do it is, he would say, for
healthy people, if you want

04:59.966 --> 05:04.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to buy fewer benefits,
you can do that, and you
would get less coverage.

05:04.533 --> 05:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that, in fact, is what
they would do in this bill.

05:07.900 --> 05:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The problem, according to the
insurance industry and a lot of
others who oppose it, is that

05:11.933 --> 05:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it would make coverage for sick
people pretty much unaffordable.

05:15.266 --> 05:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would leave only sick
people in those plans that
offer all the benefits.

05:22.233 --> 05:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the people who are lucky
enough to get tax credits, and
they have lowered the threshold,

05:24.800 --> 05:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those people would be mostly
protected from those increases.

05:27.966 --> 05:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But people who are buying their
own insurance and make too much
money to get those tax credits

05:32.833 --> 05:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would bear the brunt of those
very much higher premiums.

05:36.566 --> 05:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that's a big worry about
how this might play out.

05:39.200 --> 05:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, and
the leadership was making
this gesture in Senator Cruz's

05:43.133 --> 05:44.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
direction.

05:44.133 --> 05:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How is it going over?

05:46.200 --> 05:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: These were
intense negotiations to
put this in the bill today.

05:48.233 --> 05:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Judy, if you actually read
the bill online, the entire
Cruz amendment is in brackets.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Literally, it is in brackets.

05:55.466 --> 05:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Republican leadership
confirmed that means
it's not final.

05:57.966 --> 05:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It could still be taken out.

05:59.166 --> 06:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It could still be revised.

06:01.300 --> 06:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one other tricky piece of
choreography with all of this,
multiple sources have told

06:04.366 --> 06:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me that they are going to get a
score from not CBO -- just from
CBO, but also the Department

06:10.500 --> 06:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Health and Human Services.

06:11.866 --> 06:14.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which is a very
unusual step on this.

06:14.433 --> 06:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are going to see what
the Department of Health and
Human Services think the Cruz

06:17.266 --> 06:19.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
amendment will mean.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And all of this is kind
of adding new questions
to the process as well.

06:21.933 --> 06:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Presumably
not knowing what the
department is going to say.

06:25.133 --> 06:27.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that right?

06:27.033 --> 06:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or do they assume the department
is going to come in and
say this is a good thing?

06:28.566 --> 06:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS:
That, we don't know.

06:30.233 --> 06:32.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We know there have
been conversations
for weeks with CBO.

06:32.033 --> 06:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CBO has known the general
outlines of these bills.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Have they had those
conversations with HHS as well?

06:37.033 --> 06:38.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa, I
want to stay with you.

06:40.333 --> 06:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have been following this
day after day after day since
the Senate went home for recess.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have now come back.

06:47.066 --> 06:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the political calculus
on the part of the Republican
leadership in the Senate?

06:49.700 --> 06:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think it
comes down to one fact, that
they feel they campaigned on

06:53.533 --> 06:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this and that they have to at
least give it their greatest
try or have to show themselves

06:59.400 --> 07:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as trying as hard as possible.

07:01.433 --> 07:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, it does look like
it's going to be very difficult
to get the votes for this

07:03.433 --> 07:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to pass, but it also looks
like they will hold that vote,
even if it fails, to show

07:08.200 --> 07:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their voters, we tried and
this is as far as we could get.

07:11.433 --> 07:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there is pressure from
both conservatives an moderates
to go both different directions.

07:15.933 --> 07:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what making
this goal of reforming and
replacing Obamacare impossible.

07:19.633 --> 07:21.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Julie -- excuse me.

07:21.666 --> 07:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Julie, you have done your
own share of reporting
on this for a long time.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What are you seeing
as to where this goes?

07:26.133 --> 07:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: I see exactly
what Lisa said, that they're
caught between this promise that

07:30.166 --> 07:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they made to repeal and replace
the Affordable Care Act and
their ability to do it, which

07:34.666 --> 07:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is difficult to find consensus
within their own conference.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think they're going
to sort of run out the
string as much as they can.

07:41.633 --> 07:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bigger problem is, even if
they get something through the
Senate, then it will have to go

07:44.500 --> 07:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back to the House.

07:46.566 --> 07:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So whether you could actually
get something through both
chambers in any kind of timely

07:49.266 --> 07:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
way remains a big open question.

07:51.533 --> 07:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then we
heard, Lisa, the president
saying that he would be angry if

07:55.400 --> 07:56.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Senate doesn't
get this done.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to be honest, sources I talk
to, Republicans, aren't sure the
president has helped-, because

08:01.600 --> 08:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as much as he's behind
the scenes sometimes
encouraged them, when
he's gone and criticized

08:06.233 --> 08:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the House bill later on, for
example, as being mean, they're
worried that if they join forces

08:12.600 --> 08:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with him, that later he might
say something different.

08:14.566 --> 08:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, overall, it's
important to just remember the
broad contours of this bill.

08:16.866 --> 08:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are a lot of
details, a lot of changes.

08:18.933 --> 08:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as much as it deals with
the Affordable Care Act, this
bill in its heart is also a

08:22.633 --> 08:24.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Medicaid reform bill.

08:24.266 --> 08:27.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That was something they
didn't have to add to
this, but they did.

08:27.700 --> 08:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in doing that, they lost
a lot of moderate votes.

08:30.333 --> 08:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're keeping with
that because Republicans
feel like it's important,
but that was a big

08:33.933 --> 08:37.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
gamble that they took
in actually putting two
bills together here.

08:37.166 --> 08:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, my
producer is trying to tell
me something about senators.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Maybe there is new
some information?

08:41.866 --> 08:43.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

08:43.100 --> 08:44.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ...
watch, particularly.

08:44.333 --> 08:46.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: I
think that's right.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to watch a lot of
key senators this week.

08:48.133 --> 08:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's look at five very quickly.

08:49.633 --> 08:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.

08:51.133 --> 08:53.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We talked to him today.

08:53.166 --> 08:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mike Lee of Utah, he's not
happy with the Cruz amendment
as written, even though was

08:56.066 --> 08:57.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one of its authors
at the beginning.

08:57.466 --> 08:59.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Shelley Moore Capito
of West Virginia.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Dean Heller of Nevada,
he's interesting.

09:00.966 --> 09:04.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
His governor today said
he has great concerns
about the bill as it is.

09:04.966 --> 09:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, Lisa Murkowski
of Alaska, she had said she
didn't like where this is

09:09.666 --> 09:11.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
going.

09:11.166 --> 09:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're waiting to hear
from all five of those.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They can't lose
any one of those.

09:13.766 --> 09:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's just the beginning
lineup of questions.

09:15.800 --> 09:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I know the two of
you are going to keep monitoring
it every minute of every

09:19.633 --> 09:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
day until we know
what the answer is.

09:22.233 --> 09:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins, Julie
Rovner, thank you both.

09:24.166 --> 09:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIE ROVNER: Thank you.
