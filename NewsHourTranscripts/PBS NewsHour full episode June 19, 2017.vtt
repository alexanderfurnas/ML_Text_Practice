The court also struck

changes.

03:12.566 --> 03:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUNO RODRIGUEZ, Cuban

Trump's policy constitutes
a setback in bilateral

03:15.666 --> 03:17.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
relations.

03:17.166 --> 03:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The announced measures will not
serve their intended purposes.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Quite on the contrary, they
will impose restrictions
on citizens' freedoms,
they will cost taxpayers

03:28.700 --> 03:30.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more money.

03:30.666 --> 03:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The foreign
minister also said that the U.S.

moral basis" to demand the

British media named the suspect
as 47-year-old Darren Osborne,
who was living in wales.

03:55.933 --> 03:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fatima Manji from Independent

03:59.833 --> 04:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FATIMA MANJI: Pulled out of a
van and pinned down, moments
after he appeared to drive it

04:08.633 --> 04:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into a crowd, injuring Muslim
worshipers who just left
mosque in Finsbury Park.

04:14.966 --> 04:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amid commotion, he's
bundled into police custody.

04:18.366 --> 04:23.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And watch this reaction
as he sits down, a
wave for the cameras.

04:23.133 --> 04:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Events began as an elderly
man had collapsed, and a group
were giving him first aid.

04:30.100 --> 04:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The van plowed through
them, and then hit others
walking on the street.

04:34.133 --> 04:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The victims are thought
to be different ages and
races, but all Muslim.

04:38.700 --> 04:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: There was quite a
few people around him
trying to restrain him
and so forth, waiting

04:44.833 --> 04:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the police to arrive.

04:46.366 --> 04:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there were also people who
were trying to rip him apart.

04:49.300 --> 04:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they were people who
were saying, no, wait
for the police to arrive.

are no other suspects

04:56.933 --> 05:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that this man wasn't
known to security service.

05:00.266 --> 05:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's being held on
suspicion of the commission,
preparation or instigation
of terrorism, including

05:06.066 --> 05:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
murder and attempted murder.

05:08.066 --> 05:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
By early afternoon, the
prime minister had arrived.

05:10.933 --> 05:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

terrorist attack that
took place last night

05:17.400 --> 05:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was an evil act, born
out of hatred, and it has
devastated a community.

05:21.966 --> 05:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm pleased to have been
here today to see the
strength of that community.

05:25.833 --> 05:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FATIMA MANJI: But as she
left, she was heckled with
chants of "May must go.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
"

05:33.333 --> 05:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Extra police patrols have now
been promised to protect Muslim
communities, particularly

05:35.800 --> 05:38.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
while Ramadan, the month
of fasting, is ongoing.

05:41.433 --> 05:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Manchester, the attack on
London Bridge, the attack on
Westminster Bridge are all an

05:48.433 --> 05:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attack on our shared values,
our shared values of tolerance
and freedom and respect, and

05:53.600 --> 05:55.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we will not allow these
terrorists to succeed.

05:55.966 --> 06:00.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FATIMA MANJI: Meanwhile,
the flowers are laid,
the candles lit, another
terror attack, another

06:01.933 --> 06:02.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tribute.

06:05.033 --> 06:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One man did die
on the scene, but it wasn't
clear whether it was a direct

06:09.333 --> 06:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
result of the attack.

06:11.400 --> 06:16.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also today, a man in
Paris was killed after
ramming a car carrying
explosives into a police

06:17.033 --> 06:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
vehicle on the Champs Elysees.

06:18.533 --> 06:20.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No one else was hurt.

06:20.666 --> 06:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

high-rise apartment building
fire in London has risen

06:25.333 --> 06:27.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to 79.

06:27.400 --> 06:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

06:31.766 --> 06:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Across West London, a
moment of silence was held
today for the victims.

06:36.233 --> 06:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

from the previous year, mostly

07:14.300 --> 07:16.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
due to the civil
war in South Sudan.

07:16.333 --> 07:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, in the Mediterranean,
U.N. officials say nearly 130

start.

07:34.233 --> 07:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So says the U.K. negotiator
David Davis, who formally began
negotiations with his E.U.

East after the U.S. shoots

08:03.933 --> 08:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down a Syrian jet;
my conversation with
President Trump's attorney;
rescuing and empowering

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
victims of human
trafficking; and much more.

08:26.200 --> 08:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The downing of a Syrian
air force fighter jet by an
American strike aircraft is just

08:33.133 --> 08:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the latest flash point that
perhaps signals a deepening
American involvement in Syria's

08:36.966 --> 08:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
many-sided civil war.

today for Sunday's downing
of a Syrian warplane.

GEN.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH DUNFORD, Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chairman: We made every
effort to warn those individuals

08:54.800 --> 08:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not to come any closer, and then
the commander made a judgment
that there was a threat to

08:59.100 --> 09:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the forces that we were
supporting and took action.

09:02.433 --> 09:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only actions that we
have taken against pro-regime
forces in Syria, and there have

09:06.733 --> 09:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been two specific incidents,
have been in self-defense.

JOHN YANG: Earlier this month,
the U.S. struck pro-Assad
forces approaching an important

09:14.100 --> 09:19.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
U.S.-British special
forces base in At Tanf
in Southeastern Syria.

09:21.500 --> 09:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In response to Sunday's
shoot-down, Russia,
which backs Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad,

09:26.366 --> 09:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said it now considers all U.S.
aircraft in the region a threat.

09:30.633 --> 09:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a statement, the Defense
Ministry said: "All flying
objects, including planes and

09:37.600 --> 09:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drones of the international
coalition, detected west of the
Euphrates will be followed by

09:41.866 --> 09:45.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russian air defense
systems as targets."

09:45.400 --> 09:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia also said it suspended
a military hot line with the
U.S. designed to coordinate

09:50.133 --> 09:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
air missions in the region.

09:52.666 --> 09:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov called for dialogue.

09:55.666 --> 09:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign
Minister (through translator):
We call on everybody to avoid

09:59.266 --> 10:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unilateral actions, to
respect, I stress once
again, Syria's sovereignty.

10:04.100 --> 10:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Pentagon
said it's repositioning
jets over Syria to ensure
the safety of American

10:09.866 --> 10:11.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
air crews.

10:11.400 --> 10:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All this further complicates the
already messy picture in Syria.

10:15.400 --> 10:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In recent weeks, U.S.
forces have ramped up
airstrikes to back the
so-called Syrian Democratic

10:22.266 --> 10:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Forces, or SDF, a rebel
coalition battling ISIS around
its stronghold in Raqqa.

10:28.133 --> 10:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syrian President Assad, backed
by Russia, has used jets to
support pro-regime groups

10:33.633 --> 10:35.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the same area.

10:35.700 --> 10:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Said to be battling ISIS,
those fighters have also
clashed with the SDF.

10:41.300 --> 10:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Further complicating matters,
Iran's supports for Assad.

10:43.933 --> 10:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yesterday, Iran's
military launched its own
missile strike on ISIS
positions, in retaliation

10:50.666 --> 10:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the group's attack
in Tehran two weeks ago.

10:53.466 --> 10:56.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang.

10:56.366 --> 11:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more
on yesterday's shoot-down,
and the wider picture of a
very complex battlefield,

11:02.466 --> 11:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm joined now by Andrew Exum.

11:04.633 --> 11:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was deputy assistant
secretary of defense for Middle
East policy from 2015 to 2016,

11:11.100 --> 11:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and is now a contributing
editor at "The Atlantic."

11:13.933 --> 11:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Faysal Itani, he's a senior
fellow in the Rafik Hariri
Center for the Middle East

11:19.666 --> 11:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the Atlantic Council.

11:20.966 --> 11:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a Washington think tank.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, gentlemen, thank
you both for joining us.

11:24.733 --> 11:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a complicated
battlefield we're talking about.

11:27.266 --> 11:29.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Faysal Itani, I'm going
to start with you.

11:29.566 --> 11:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Given that, was this inevitable
that this was going to happen,
or should the U.S. been

11:33.600 --> 11:35.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
able to avoid it?

11:35.566 --> 11:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI, Atlantic Council's
Rafik Hariri Center for the
Middle East: Well, I think

11:37.600 --> 11:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's very difficult to get
the Syrian regime to behave in
accordance with any external

11:40.466 --> 11:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
powers, understand and
come to an agreement over.

11:43.333 --> 11:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was clearly a case of the
regime behaving in a manner that
probably upset the Russians,

11:47.600 --> 11:49.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
may or may not have
upset the Iranians.

11:49.300 --> 11:50.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm not sure.

11:50.566 --> 11:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And certainly the United
States didn't like it.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the regime will continue
to behave in that manner
and I think we're going to

11:55.800 --> 11:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
continue to have to either
react or back down or ignore it.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will talk
about that in just a moment.

12:01.200 --> 12:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Andrew Exum, in your view, was
this inevitable, it was going
to happen just because of the

12:07.133 --> 12:09.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
kind of war that is
being fought there?

12:09.166 --> 12:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM, Former U.S. Deputy
Assistant Secretary of Defense:
Well, I think what Faysal

12:11.300 --> 12:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said is very wise, and that
often we have seen the tail
wag the dog with respect to

12:16.300 --> 12:18.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Syrian regime and
its external sponsors.

12:18.266 --> 12:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Often, they have not carried
out what Russia or Iran
would like them to do.

12:22.766 --> 12:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I think that's very wise.

12:24.766 --> 12:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would also say, however, that
where we are in the military
campaign against the Islamic

12:28.933 --> 12:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State means that U.S. and
other coalition forces are
going to be in closer proximity

12:34.766 --> 12:37.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Syrian regime forces.

12:37.400 --> 12:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, you know, the legal
and policy assumptions
that underpin the U.S.
and coalition war against

12:44.433 --> 12:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Islamic State was that the
Syrian regime couldn't exert
any type of sovereignty east,

12:49.433 --> 12:51.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where the Islamic
State has been.

12:51.433 --> 12:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's beginning to change,
and the coalition is starting
to spread out as well.

12:54.166 --> 12:58.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, unfortunately, you're
seeing those forces in greater
proximity, and I expect you are

12:58.166 --> 13:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to see more of these
incidents in the future.

13:00.266 --> 13:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that your
expectation, that this is just
getting more complicated by the

13:04.166 --> 13:06.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
day, practically?

13:06.266 --> 13:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI: I think we're
getting closer to our primary
objectives towards ISIS, which

13:09.333 --> 13:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is to take a certain amount
of core territory in Eastern
Syria and especially around the

13:14.033 --> 13:16.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Raqqa province.

13:16.133 --> 13:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, yes, physically, it brings
us in greater proximity, but
it also poses a threat to the

13:19.300 --> 13:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regime that we may end up
actually handing over very
important strategic territory to

13:26.333 --> 13:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our own allies, whether
it's Arabs or most likely
the Kurdish-dominated SDF.

13:28.366 --> 13:29.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that includes
water resources.

13:29.766 --> 13:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It includes oil resources.

13:31.766 --> 13:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so now that the regime
has stabilized the west enough
to be able to throw forces

13:38.433 --> 13:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elsewhere, and Iran has as
well, then they're coming in
our direction, and I don't think

13:41.133 --> 13:42.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we have a long-term
plan for that.

13:42.666 --> 13:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I do want
to ask you both about that.

13:45.233 --> 13:47.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, Andrew Exum,
I was struck today.

13:47.600 --> 13:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russians came -- right out
of the box, they were saying
they're now going to target

13:51.900 --> 13:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any U.S. plane -- I'm sorry --
any plane by the U.S. coalition
that goes into a certain

13:58.500 --> 14:00.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
area.

14:00.233 --> 14:04.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is this just ripe for
either another strike
or miscalculation?

14:05.633 --> 14:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW EXUM: Yes and no.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yes, of course,
this is worrying.

14:10.033 --> 14:13.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think it's going to
be a real concern to
our coalition partners.

14:13.466 --> 14:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a pretty robust
integrated air defense
system over most of Syria.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is not a fun thing
to fly around and through.

14:20.366 --> 14:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their air defenses are actually
not as strong in the east.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russia also cut off the
deconfliction hot line.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I wouldn't read
too much into that.

14:30.366 --> 14:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have done it before.

14:32.466 --> 14:36.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It in Russia's interests
to be able to deconflict
our air operations,
just as much as it is

14:38.266 --> 14:40.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in the interests of
the United States and
the coalition partners.

14:40.300 --> 14:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I suspect that, once the
temperatures cool a little
bit, that those deconfliction

14:44.366 --> 14:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
channels will be up
and running again.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But, obviously, it's worrying.

14:48.166 --> 14:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Russians, of course,
will use this as an opportunity
to convince the Americans

14:51.566 --> 14:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we need to be working
closer together in Syria,
which is something that we have

14:56.066 --> 14:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been, for obvious reasons,
quite resistant to do.

14:58.300 --> 14:59.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

14:59.833 --> 15:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Faysal Itani, this does pull
the U.S. closer in, doesn't it?

15:02.100 --> 15:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI: I think what
we have tried to do so far in
the war is, we have tried to

15:06.366 --> 15:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of tiptoe around the
western part of the country,
the war in the west, what we

15:10.633 --> 15:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
call the civil war usually in
our discourse, and focus on
the war that we wish to fight,

15:15.366 --> 15:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which is the war against ISIS.

15:17.366 --> 15:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think this is a sign that,
actually, as far as the
players with the most at stake

15:21.066 --> 15:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here, Iran and the Syrian
regime, are concerned,
these are not separate wars.

15:25.200 --> 15:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is all war over
territory and over resources
and over influence.

15:30.166 --> 15:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we are having to
come to a conclusion, that we're
stumbling into it somewhat, but

15:36.033 --> 15:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think we will get there.

15:37.700 --> 15:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it
possible, Andrew Exum,
to separate the two?

15:40.133 --> 15:43.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANDREW EXUM: Well, I
think Faysal is right.

15:43.166 --> 15:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the one hand, I think the
regime still has quite a lot
of consolidation to do in

15:50.166 --> 15:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Western Syria, but I think
Faysal is correct in that the
regime still yearns after the

15:54.800 --> 15:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
oil and gas resources that
are in the east of Syria.

15:57.400 --> 16:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, quite frankly, the
regime's Iranian backers want
some sort of land bridge into

16:02.200 --> 16:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraq, which is why the Euphrates
River Valley is so important
to perhaps not as much as

16:09.266 --> 16:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the regime, but certainly
to its Iranian supporters
and to Hezbollah as well.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, yes, to Faysal is right.

16:14.766 --> 16:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The strategic geography does
not end in Western Syria.

16:18.133 --> 16:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It extends to the east as well.

16:20.266 --> 16:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to ask
both of you if it's clear to
you -- Faysal Itani, to you

16:24.233 --> 16:26.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
first.

16:26.200 --> 16:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it clear to you what the
goal of the U.S. mission
right now is in Syria?

16:33.200 --> 16:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI: Well, the official
goal is clear enough, which
is, we're there to defeat ISIS,

16:38.200 --> 16:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to displace it from Raqqa
and other territories.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What exactly the territorial
scope of that is, is not clear.

16:43.666 --> 16:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what we're actually doing
as this conflict evolves and
unfolds and more dimensions are

16:50.033 --> 16:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
added to it, no, I don't
think -- it's not clear to me.

16:52.166 --> 16:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't even know if it's
clear to us, to be honest with
you, because I don't know how

16:55.633 --> 17:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important we think it
is to compete with the
Iranians and the Syrian
regime over this territory

17:01.833 --> 17:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and over influence
in post-ISIS Syria.

17:03.033 --> 17:04.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It seems like we
haven't made a decision.

17:04.500 --> 17:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you answer
that question, Andrew Exum?

17:07.100 --> 17:09.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANDREW EXUM: Well, I
think largely the same.

17:09.666 --> 17:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will say that the
United States has first
off had a legal basis and
has had policy agreement

17:15.066 --> 17:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on defeating the Islamic State.

17:17.100 --> 17:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that's been where the U.S.
military and its coalition
partners have been focused.

17:21.266 --> 17:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There has not been consensus
or even a legal basis to carry
that fight over to the Assad

17:27.700 --> 17:29.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
regime.

17:29.766 --> 17:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think the United States
and its coalition partners have
some real hard choices going

17:34.400 --> 17:36.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forward.

17:36.333 --> 17:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when I say coalition
partners, I don't just mean the
international community, but

17:38.000 --> 17:40.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean the partners
on the ground as well.

17:40.266 --> 17:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, when they defeat
the Islamic State -- and the
Islamic State is going to

17:44.066 --> 17:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be defeated -- or is the United
States fine with the territory
that's been won back from

17:50.533 --> 17:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Islamic State falling into
the hands of the Assad regime?

17:52.433 --> 17:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that an appropriate or
acceptable policy outcome?

17:55.533 --> 18:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it's not, then I think
some decisions are going to
have to be made quite quickly.

18:00.100 --> 18:05.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Otherwise, we're going
to end up stumbling
into a broader conflict
without a clear strategy

18:06.133 --> 18:08.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to win that conflict.

18:08.200 --> 18:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And wrapping
up, Faysal Itani, how urgent
is it that the U.S. make these

18:12.833 --> 18:15.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decisions?

18:15.333 --> 18:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI: Very
urgent, because these
things that you saw today
and have been happening

18:17.366 --> 18:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the -- actually over the
past few weeks, and they haven't
been happening only as sort

18:20.066 --> 18:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of airstrike incidents.

18:21.933 --> 18:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was actually a
ground attack on our
partners in Northern Syria.

18:25.966 --> 18:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a bit scared that it hasn't
-- it doesn't appear to have
actually been wrapped up yet

18:30.400 --> 18:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as a strategic discussion.

18:31.966 --> 18:33.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean
by the administration.

18:33.433 --> 18:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI: By the United
States government, yes.

18:35.466 --> 18:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly,
Andrew Exum, how do you see the
pressure on the administration

18:40.733 --> 18:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to make this decision?

18:42.866 --> 18:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM: Well, I think
there are competing voices
within the administration.

18:45.766 --> 18:50.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think the military has
been almost myopically
focused on defeating the
Islamic State, because

18:51.900 --> 18:53.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's the mission
they have been given.

18:53.900 --> 18:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there are also some
strong voices within the
administration that would like

18:57.233 --> 19:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to broaden this conflict in
order to focus on Iran and
Iran's proxies in Syria.

19:03.266 --> 19:06.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's quite
dangerous, obviously.

19:06.166 --> 19:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That could be especially
dangerous to get in that type
of escalation without having

19:09.833 --> 19:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the forces on the ground.

19:12.366 --> 19:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is also no
consensus with the United
States' international
partners regarding that

19:17.333 --> 19:19.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
goal.

19:19.300 --> 19:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think, unfortunately,
the administration has
yet to make up its mind.

19:22.766 --> 19:25.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nothing
simple about this one.

19:25.166 --> 19:29.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Andrew Exum, Faysal
Itani, thank you both.

19:29.566 --> 19:34.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FAYSAL ITANI: Thank you.

19:38.600 --> 19:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
continues to be nagged by
possible links between Russia

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and his associates and questions
over whether Mr. Trump has tried
to shut down that investigation.

19:54.033 --> 19:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last week, the Russia story
took another turn when reports
surfaced that special counsel

19:57.766 --> 20:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Robert Mueller is investigating
the president himself.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I spoke a short while
ago to Jay Sekulow.

20:03.033 --> 20:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a member of President
Trump's legal team and chief
counsel for the American Center

20:08.766 --> 20:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for Law and Justice.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I began by asking if
the special counsel has
informed Mr. Trump that
he's under investigation.

20:14.033 --> 20:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW, Attorney For
Donald Trump: No, he has not.

20:16.100 --> 20:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There has been no information
given by the special counsel
informing the president that

20:20.666 --> 20:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he is under investigation.

20:21.666 --> 20:23.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's been consistent.

20:23.766 --> 20:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, we have received nothing
about an investigation of the
president of the United States.

20:27.566 --> 20:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as you
acknowledged yesterday,
it is possible that
the president could be

20:31.533 --> 20:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under investigation and
just simply not have been
informed by it -- about it.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW: Well, I mean,
but here's the reality.

20:38.566 --> 20:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not something
that's happened in a vacuum.

20:41.066 --> 20:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is -- there's
been discussions about
this Russian probe and
committees of the Congress

20:45.033 --> 20:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking at this for nine months,
with -- producing no evidence
about Russian collusion.

20:49.033 --> 20:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, while it's true I can't
read the mind of a special
counsel, we have received no

20:56.033 --> 20:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
notification of an investigation
or a pending investigation or
a preliminary investigation

21:00.666 --> 21:02.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or anything else.

21:02.700 --> 21:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what I can say is what we
know is the president right
now is not investigation,

21:07.700 --> 21:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has not been investigation,
and is not under investigation.

21:09.766 --> 21:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you saying
the stories that have been
printed in The Washington Post

21:13.200 --> 21:15.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and other news
organizations are false?

21:15.333 --> 21:20.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAY SEKULOW: Well,
The Washington Post
story was based on five
anonymous sources where

21:21.466 --> 21:23.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they didn't even
identify the agency.

21:23.433 --> 21:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you have that report coming
out from The Washington Post
which I believe is false.

21:28.266 --> 21:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the -- ABC reported
that they had received from
their sources information that

21:33.233 --> 21:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in fact the special
counsel had not opened an
investigation of the president.

21:37.933 --> 21:42.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, again, I don't know
where these sources are
coming from, but we have
not had any information

21:45.533 --> 21:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the special counsel
or anyone else, for that
matter, that the president
is under investigation.

21:47.633 --> 21:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, setting
that aside, when the president
told Lester Holt a few weeks

21:52.400 --> 21:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago at that interview that he
had what he called the Russia
thing on his mind when he

21:59.833 --> 22:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fired then FBI Director
James Comey and when
he said to Russian
diplomats around the same

22:04.533 --> 22:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time that it relieved pressure
on him to fire James Comey,
what was he referring to?

22:09.700 --> 22:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW: Well, the president
engaged in a deliberative
process that went on for a

22:12.933 --> 22:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number of weeks evaluating
the performance of James Comey
as the FBI director, and that

22:19.900 --> 22:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
culminated in a number of
discussions that took place
within the White House.

22:22.433 --> 22:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ultimately, the attorney
general of the United
States and the deputy
attorney general recommended

22:26.100 --> 22:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the president the
removal of James Comey, and
James Comey was removed.

22:30.666 --> 22:33.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now, that's just fact.

22:33.166 --> 22:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What other thoughts the
president had going into that,
how long he'd been considering,

22:36.800 --> 22:41.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I wasn't privy to that,
but normal deliberative
process and they look
at a variety of issues.

22:41.666 --> 22:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Regarding the Russia
situation, I would like to
say something, Judy, here.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Look, this is a bit
of a witch-hunt.

22:48.366 --> 22:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It really is a witch-hunt.

22:50.433 --> 22:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This investigation from the
Congress has been going for nine
months into this Russia probe.

22:55.033 --> 22:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And members of the Senate
and House from right,
left and center said
so far there's been no

22:59.133 --> 23:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
evidence of collusion.

23:01.233 --> 23:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When the intelligence officers
were asked, is there evidence
of collusion on this, no

23:04.433 --> 23:06.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
evidence of collusion.

23:06.333 --> 23:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We didn't include evidence
because we haven't
seen that evidence.

23:08.900 --> 23:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is a situation
that I think is basically
like a factual scenario
that's almost being

23:15.233 --> 23:17.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
made up.

23:17.300 --> 23:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the president is responding
the way presidents respond, in
that this is not consuming his

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not consuming an hour.

23:23.700 --> 23:26.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's trying to and is
successfully governing.

23:26.633 --> 23:29.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think what we have
to look at, there is
now a special counsel.

23:29.800 --> 23:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The special counsel will
evaluate whatever the
special counsel evaluates.

23:34.166 --> 23:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the American people are
being penalized in this as well.

23:36.900 --> 23:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it continues to drag on.

23:38.666 --> 23:39.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:39.666 --> 23:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW: Yes, go ahead.

23:40.933 --> 23:42.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But let
me just step in here.

23:42.166 --> 23:43.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You -- the president's
called it a witch-hunt.

23:43.400 --> 23:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have said it's a witch-hunt.

23:44.966 --> 23:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And yet you have said
it should go forward.

23:47.466 --> 23:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you believe, if the president
believes it's a witch-hunt,
does he believe that the

23:51.233 --> 23:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whole thing should stop, that
the special counsel, Robert
Mueller, should step aside

23:55.533 --> 24:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and either let somebody else
take this over or just say,
I'm not going to do this?

24:00.500 --> 24:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW: Well, now, the
president hasn't said that the
special counsel can't do his

24:05.200 --> 24:07.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

24:07.266 --> 24:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What the president has said
consistently is - - in fact,
when he -- in that Lester Holt

24:10.033 --> 24:13.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
interview, if you
remember, if you look
at the full transcript,
he acknowledged that,

24:13.700 --> 24:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by firing James Comey and
removing him from the director
of the FBI, that it would extend

24:18.400 --> 24:19.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this investigation.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

24:20.400 --> 24:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW: He said that.

24:21.933 --> 24:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, he knew the consequence,
so to speak, of his action.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He took the action because
he thought it was in the best
interest of the United States,

24:25.866 --> 24:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as did his attorney
general and deputy attorney
general and others.

24:28.433 --> 24:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that we're -- when
I say the phrase witch-hunt,
when the president is talking

24:32.833 --> 24:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about a witch-hunt, this whole
frenzy that developed and,
again, with everybody coming

24:37.333 --> 24:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forward on all of these
committees says so far they have
seen nothing in, like I said,

24:41.166 --> 24:42.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an investigation
going on nine months.

24:42.633 --> 24:44.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, the special counsel
has been appointed.

24:44.966 --> 24:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the special counsel will
ultimately do their job.

24:47.066 --> 24:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at the end of that special
counsel's job, we will see
that there is nothing against

24:51.600 --> 24:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president, as I
suspected the entire time.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think the legal
team without question
is confident of that.

24:57.800 --> 25:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Judy, the witch-hunt aspect
of this is just the nature of
what's going on with multiple

25:02.366 --> 25:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
committees simultaneously,
now a special counsel.

25:05.366 --> 25:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, what else are you going
to add to the mix to make it?

25:08.600 --> 25:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, by the way, when you have
a special counsel and you have
those committees going, as you

25:12.433 --> 25:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know -- you have been watching
it a long time - - when you
have those going simultaneously,

25:16.033 --> 25:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it raises a whole host of issues
of conflicts and everything
else that are going to have

25:19.566 --> 25:20.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be looked at.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
two quick questions.

25:22.866 --> 25:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the president believes this
is a witch-hunt, if you and his
other attorneys believe that,

25:25.633 --> 25:30.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and yet, at the same
time, you're saying the
probe should go forward,
there is a contradiction

25:32.333 --> 25:34.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

25:34.833 --> 25:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you saying it should
go forward unfettered, that
there will be cooperation
from the president?

25:37.833 --> 25:40.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Or are you saying there
is going to be some
kind of resistance
because you think it's

25:40.700 --> 25:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an illegitimate investigation?

25:42.800 --> 25:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW: Well, look, the
president has said that --
has given no indication that

25:46.966 --> 25:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's not going to
cooperate, if there's
anything to cooperate on.

25:50.133 --> 25:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, let me be clear on that,
because you raise a really
important point, and that is

25:54.766 --> 25:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is multiple aspects
to this Russian probe,
as it has been described.

25:58.866 --> 26:02.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, we will -- the
president is not saying
stop the Russian probe.

26:02.800 --> 26:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The witch-hunt aspect of
this is this media-created
frenzy of unnamed sources
saying it's targeting

26:10.066 --> 26:12.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the president.

26:12.100 --> 26:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, of course, then you
had the contradictory source
from ABC saying it wasn't.

26:15.733 --> 26:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is the
witch-hunt aspect of
this, leaking information.

26:19.900 --> 26:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Agents -- I mean, how
does it make the American
people feel that supposed
investigators involved

26:24.066 --> 26:28.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in this Russian probe
are leaking information
anonymously without even
defining what agency

26:28.433 --> 26:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're from to The
Washington Post?

26:30.300 --> 26:32.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That shouldn't be OK.

26:32.333 --> 26:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It shouldn't be any more
OK than James Comey doing
the same thing, by the way.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

26:36.866 --> 26:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But I believe you
have acknowledged the fact that
the president did fire James

26:39.000 --> 26:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Comey, the FBI director, who
at that time was overseeing
this investigation, the fact

26:42.500 --> 26:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the president made those
comments to Lester Holt, to
the Russian diplomats about

26:47.466 --> 26:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relieving pressure, the
appearance is that the president
wanted to do what he could to

26:51.766 --> 26:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
get this investigation
off his back.

26:53.933 --> 26:56.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JAY SEKULOW: I think --
I don't think that's at
all what the case is.

26:56.766 --> 27:00.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think the president
removed James Comey for
a number of reasons.

27:00.766 --> 27:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, many left of center were
calling for the removal of
James Comey just about a year

27:05.400 --> 27:06.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

27:07.400 --> 27:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Excuse me.

27:09.866 --> 27:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president said the
reason was, at least
what he told Lester Holt,
was the Russia thing

27:14.700 --> 27:16.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was on his mind when
he fired James Comey.

27:16.733 --> 27:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW: Well, but look
at -- when you say the Russian
thing is on his mind, look

27:19.833 --> 27:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the way the probe was
handled on Hillary Clinton.

27:22.433 --> 27:27.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This was an individual,
James Comey, who didn't
handle a very important
investigation properly.

27:28.833 --> 27:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And left, right and center
have acknowledged it.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when the president was
talking about the way the Russia
probe is, that, as it moves

27:33.333 --> 27:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forward, it is handled
properly, not the way it was
handled under James Comey.

27:37.433 --> 27:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jay Sekulow,
representing President
Trump, thank you very much.

27:43.300 --> 27:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW: Thanks, Judy.

27:50.466 --> 27:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:54.933 --> 27:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Georgia's special
election tomorrow, a look
at the most expensive

28:00.866 --> 28:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
House race in U.S. history.

28:02.866 --> 28:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: More than three
million migrant workers every
year, most of them women, leave

28:09.700 --> 28:13.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
their countries to work
as domestic laborers,
often in conditions some
say border on slavery.

28:15.033 --> 28:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Human trafficking is especially
grave in the Persian Gulf
and the Middle East.

28:19.300 --> 28:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro begins his report
from the West African nation of

28:24.066 --> 28:25.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Cameroon.

28:25.233 --> 28:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's part of his series
Agents for Change.

28:27.833 --> 28:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: They're
able to laugh at it now in a
workshop setting, but the skit

28:38.233 --> 28:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
these women are watching
depicts experiences
that are all too real.

28:45.233 --> 28:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These women are all survivors
from time spent in Persian
Gulf and Middle East countries

28:50.800 --> 28:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where they were domestic
workers, victims of an industry
the U.N. and rights groups

28:54.800 --> 28:58.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
say is rife with human
trafficking and abuse.

28:58.333 --> 29:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Three years ago, Francisca
Awah was working as a secretary
in Cameroon and helping her

29:04.700 --> 29:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mother sell vegetables.

29:06.533 --> 29:10.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She had a new baby and
with her fiance wanted
to build a nest egg.

29:10.700 --> 29:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Awah, who has a college
degree, jumped at what she
thought was a teaching job offer

29:15.400 --> 29:18.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Kuwait for 10 times
her salary in Cameroon.

29:18.933 --> 29:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She paid the sponsoring
agency $500, plus airfare.

29:23.200 --> 29:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But almost as soon as she landed
in Kuwait, she knew something
was wrong, an experience

29:29.766 --> 29:31.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
familiar to many in
this audience and
acted out in the skit.

29:31.566 --> 29:33.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: You no like, you
give me $6,000, you go
back to your country.

29:33.533 --> 29:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The bait and
switch, an agent or trafficker
demanding large sums if

29:39.966 --> 29:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they weren't satisfied with
their job or pay, in Francisca
Awah's case, not teaching, but

29:45.833 --> 29:47.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cleaning.

29:47.900 --> 29:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCISCA AWAH, Trafficking
Survivor: He started telling me,
you're going to work with me as

29:50.533 --> 29:52.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a maid.

29:52.033 --> 29:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You will take care of my two
children and the house chores.

29:54.066 --> 29:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Awah says
she complained and asked for
her passport back, so she could

29:57.466 --> 29:59.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
return home.

29:59.366 --> 30:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Although it's illegal, workers'
passports are routinely
confiscated by employers.

30:05.700 --> 30:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The employer's wife refused,
saying she had paid the agency
$2,000 for her services.

30:10.833 --> 30:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCISCA AWAH: And the lady
was so angry that she pointed
at the television and told

30:13.666 --> 30:15.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
me that, Francisca,
you know something?

30:15.266 --> 30:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You are like that television.

30:16.266 --> 30:17.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You are a commodity.

30:17.266 --> 30:18.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I bought you.

30:18.533 --> 30:20.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You need to pay back my
money before you leave.

30:20.066 --> 30:22.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
She had bought you?

30:22.166 --> 30:24.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FRANCISCA AWAH: Yes.

30:24.266 --> 30:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Then, one
day, Awah saw a news report
about an organization, Freedom

30:28.100 --> 30:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For All, headed by an American
woman named Katie Ford.

30:31.433 --> 30:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATIE FORD, Freedom For All:
And she said, please help me.

30:34.766 --> 30:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There are many in
much worse situations.

30:38.333 --> 30:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Please help us all.

30:39.833 --> 30:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Indeed,
Awah's story is far from unique.

30:42.466 --> 30:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each year, more than three
million women worldwide
are forced into servitude
as domestic workers.

30:49.533 --> 30:52.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ford was shocked
when she learned the
extent of the problem.

30:52.400 --> 30:55.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KATIE FORD: Why aren't
we calling this slavery?

30:55.633 --> 31:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's people being forced to
work without pay, without
an ability to escape.

31:00.566 --> 31:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Katie
Ford is the former CEO of the
renowned Ford Modeling Agency.

31:07.400 --> 31:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her parents started the business
in 1946, and represented
such high profile models as

31:13.566 --> 31:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Elle Macpherson and Naomi
Campbell, bringing standards to
an industry notorious for taking

31:18.133 --> 31:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
advantage of young women.

31:20.133 --> 31:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ford was the first agency
to insist that models
be paid a fair wage.

31:23.933 --> 31:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE FORD: They made sure
the client paid, and they made
sure the models were protected.

31:31.500 --> 31:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is the first
picture of her I saw.

31:34.633 --> 31:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Just as her
parents did for their models,
Katie Ford says she wanted

31:38.866 --> 31:41.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to advocate for
domestic workers.

31:41.266 --> 31:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her goal was to form
partnerships with
governments, employers and
human rights organizations.

31:48.400 --> 31:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the first places
she started was Kuwait,
an oil-rich state of
nearly four million people

31:53.766 --> 31:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where foreigners outnumber
native Kuwaitis by 2-1.

31:57.866 --> 32:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the only country in the
Persian Gulf region to even
acknowledge there's a problem

32:02.400 --> 32:04.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with domestic workers.

32:04.400 --> 32:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kuwait became the first country
in the Gulf region to pass a
law that attempts to protect

32:08.366 --> 32:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rights of domestic workers,
requiring at least one day
off a week, for example,

32:13.300 --> 32:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and setting the maximum number
of hours worked per week.

32:16.766 --> 32:17.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not much.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That maximum is 72 hours.

32:19.966 --> 32:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the law doesn't specify
that the worker be allowed out
of the home on that day off.

32:26.900 --> 32:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And many, in fact, are forced
to remain in their employer's
home on their day off.

32:30.900 --> 32:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Kuwait government has
established a shelter,
with a capacity for 500,
where foreign domestic

32:38.133 --> 32:41.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
workers can escape
abusive employers.

32:41.833 --> 32:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were given a rare tour
of the facility by its
director, Falah al Mutairi.

32:45.433 --> 32:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FALAH AL MUTAIRI, Shelter
Director (through translator):
The services that are provided

32:49.600 --> 32:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
include legal services,
social, cultural and
emotional help if needed.

32:53.833 --> 32:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When it comes to deciding
what the next step is, it's
up to the individual herself.

32:56.733 --> 32:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Does she want to
stay in the country?

32:59.233 --> 33:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's when we discuss options.

33:00.966 --> 33:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ninety percent of the
women want to go back
to their home countries.

33:03.500 --> 33:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Since the
shelter opened two-and-a-half
years ago, nearly 8,000 women

33:10.500 --> 33:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have passed through, waiting
for passports to be returned,
trying to find the means to

33:13.500 --> 33:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
buy return tickets, sorting
out various legal problems.

33:17.766 --> 33:22.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We spoke with five
women from countries as
diverse as Madagascar,
Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka,

33:23.933 --> 33:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nepal and the Philippines.

33:25.533 --> 33:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All said they were either
unpaid or severely underpaid.

33:30.100 --> 33:33.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Many were lured here
under false pretenses.

33:33.100 --> 33:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nineteen-year-old
Hassanatu Bangura says her
parents thought they were
sending her to college.

33:37.833 --> 33:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HASSANATU BANGURA, Trafficking
Survivor: I think I'm
going to start school.

33:41.100 --> 33:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we go to the office, and she
said that I'm going to work.

33:44.633 --> 33:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BIBI NASSER AL SABAH, Social
Work Society of Kuwait: We
have a domestic labor law, but

33:46.933 --> 33:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we don't have clear punishments
or punishments that are enough
to make an employer stop.

33:53.600 --> 33:57.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Bibi
Al Sabah is a member of
Kuwait's ruling family.

33:59.400 --> 34:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twelve years ago, she founded
an organization designed to
get workers legal help, also,

34:04.300 --> 34:07.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
she says, to change the
culture, and attitudes
toward domestic workers.

34:07.233 --> 34:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BIBI NASSER AL SABAH: We're
rich people, and we can afford
to have people working for us.

34:14.733 --> 34:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, with this idea, a
lot of people eventually
just lost track of how
humans should behave.

34:23.166 --> 34:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It became part of the culture
now to have workers everywhere.

34:30.166 --> 34:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so people forget that
they're humans and forget that
these people are -- have lives

34:34.500 --> 34:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and have children and
have their dignity.

34:36.533 --> 34:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Falah Al
Mutairi acknowledges that more
reforms need to happen, but he's

34:41.966 --> 34:44.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
convinced that Kuwait
has turned a corner.

34:44.500 --> 34:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he says that, to truly
eradicate the problem,
traffickers must be
held accountable in the

34:49.933 --> 34:52.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
workers' countries.

34:52.400 --> 34:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FALAH AL MUTAIRI (through
translator): Because
of sovereignty issues,
Kuwait cannot track

34:55.066 --> 34:56.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
down criminals in
other countries.

34:56.866 --> 34:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It can't do anything about
people outside its jurisdiction.

34:59.466 --> 35:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Francisca
Awah isn't sure she can stop
the traffickers either, but she

35:06.966 --> 35:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is trying to help the
desperate economic plight
of women in low-income
countries like Cameroon.

35:12.466 --> 35:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After being rescued by Katie
Ford 18 months ago, the two
women have teamed up to form

35:16.400 --> 35:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a career training
program for women in this
West African country

35:20.366 --> 35:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCISCA AWAH: I wish
that the girls should be
like empowered personally.

35:23.600 --> 35:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They should learn to do
something within their country.

35:26.533 --> 35:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Last fall,
Awah led a workshop with 34
young women who fled abusive

35:33.133 --> 35:34.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
work situations in
the Middle East.

35:34.933 --> 35:39.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They were learning how
to finance and start
their own businesses.

35:41.866 --> 35:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It included field trips to
restaurants and markets to
learn from other entrepreneurs

35:46.900 --> 35:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and team-building exercises.

35:47.700 --> 35:49.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: You wake up.

35:49.500 --> 35:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You clean everywhere, OK?

35:51.533 --> 35:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Gatherings
like these have helped women
overcome, even laugh at

35:58.566 --> 36:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their traumatic experiences, and
maybe, they say, spread the word
to other would-be trafficking

36:03.233 --> 36:05.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
victims.

36:05.800 --> 36:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
this is Fred de Sam
Lazaro in Kumba, Cameroon.

36:10.633 --> 36:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fred's
reporting is a partnership
with the Under-Told
Stories Project at the

36:16.800 --> 36:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
University of St.
Thomas in Minnesota.

36:23.733 --> 36:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the most expensive race in
history to fill a seat in the
U.S. House of Representatives.

36:34.500 --> 36:38.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it's in a
district consistently
Republican for decades.

36:38.433 --> 36:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Newt Gingrich was the
congressman for Georgia's
6th District for 20 years.

36:42.833 --> 36:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was most recently vacated
by Tom Price when he was tapped
to be secretary of health

36:47.633 --> 36:49.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and human services.

36:49.666 --> 36:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Democrats are pinning
their hopes and lots of their
money on a young candidate.

36:55.366 --> 36:57.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins
brings us up to speed.

36:57.066 --> 37:01.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: More
than $50 million, that's
how much has been spent.

37:03.366 --> 37:05.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The special election
between Democrat Jon
Ossoff and Republican
Karen Handel in suburban

37:05.533 --> 37:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Atlanta has drawn outsized
national attention because, in
some ways, it hinges on a name

37:11.266 --> 37:13.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not on the ballot.

37:13.200 --> 37:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Divisions over President
Trump have Democrats
thinking they have a chance.

37:15.966 --> 37:17.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We break it down now
with Andra Gillespie.

37:17.900 --> 37:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a political science
professor at Emory
University in Atlanta.

37:21.533 --> 37:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Greg Bluestein, a
reporter with The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution
and native of Georgia's

37:26.400 --> 37:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
6th Congressional District.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you both for joining us.

37:30.833 --> 37:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to start this by
looking at the extraordinary
numbers involved in
this race, the dollar

37:35.633 --> 37:37.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
figures.

37:37.666 --> 37:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From what we know, as of the
reports at the end of May,
the Democrat in this race, Jon

37:40.400 --> 37:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ossoff, had brought in $23
million, Republican Karen Handel
$4.5 million, but outside groups

37:47.200 --> 37:48.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
$25 million.

37:48.366 --> 37:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let me start with you, Greg.

37:50.700 --> 37:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How close is this race,
quickly, and why is there
so much spending here?

37:53.933 --> 37:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG BLUESTEIN, The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution: Yes,
this race is neck and neck.

37:56.200 --> 37:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Most public polls show
Ossoff within a one-
or two- or three-point
lead, within the margin

37:59.933 --> 38:02.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of error.

38:02.100 --> 38:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You talk to six different
analysts down here, you will
get six different opinions.

38:04.233 --> 38:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it really could be either
way tomorrow, when we have the
final vote -- $42 million-plus

38:10.566 --> 38:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has now been spent on just ads
alone, many of them negative.

38:13.666 --> 38:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, district residents have
been pummeled and metro
Atlanta residents at large have

38:17.000 --> 38:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been pummeled with ads about
this race, which means there is
a very slim number of undecided

38:21.566 --> 38:23.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
voters here.

38:23.066 --> 38:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Andra, what
is happening here politically?

38:25.066 --> 38:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this just the extent of
spending everywhere, or is there
something different about this

38:28.166 --> 38:30.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
race that has brought
in so much money?

38:30.266 --> 38:33.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDRA GILLESPIE, Emory
University: Well, unlike
a midterm election,
where you have hundreds

38:33.133 --> 38:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of congressional races going
on simultaneously, both parties
have been able to focus on each

38:38.033 --> 38:40.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
individual special
race at a time.

38:40.100 --> 38:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And because this was the most
competitive of the special
elections that have been held

38:43.533 --> 38:46.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this spring, it garnered
the most attention.

38:46.400 --> 38:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so campaign spending
and campaign fund-raising
are in part a signal
about how competitive

38:52.000 --> 38:53.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a race is.

38:53.666 --> 38:55.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, in that respect,
it's not surprising that
this race broke records.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS:
Unbelievable race.

38:57.800 --> 39:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have had even another
turn of events here in the last
week with the congressional

39:00.633 --> 39:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shooting that happened
outside of Washington that
is now entering this race.

39:04.166 --> 39:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we saw, as you
mentioned, the ad war, Greg.

39:06.466 --> 39:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The ad war has brought
about a new ad in this race.

39:08.766 --> 39:10.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's play a clip of it.

39:10.666 --> 39:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Now the unhinged left
is endorsing and applauding
shooting Republicans.

39:18.333 --> 39:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
When will it stop?

39:19.800 --> 39:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It won't if Jon Ossoff
wins on Tuesday.

39:22.500 --> 39:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I don't want
to necessarily talk about
that ad itself, but this idea,

39:25.833 --> 39:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Greg, of whether that shooting
could affect this race.

39:28.966 --> 39:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have heard Republicans in
Georgia think that it might.

39:31.733 --> 39:34.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, apparently, the
people who made that
ad think that it could.

39:34.200 --> 39:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG BLUESTEIN: Yes, and we
have also had both candidates
and their campaigns condemn

39:38.666 --> 39:41.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the ad and call for
it to be taken down.

39:41.300 --> 39:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's being talked about in the
district, but I don't know how
much it will actually influence

39:45.633 --> 39:47.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
any votes.

39:47.133 --> 39:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As we mentioned earlier, there
are so few undecided voters.

39:49.166 --> 39:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this ad is targeting, I
think, Karen Handel supporters,
obviously, who go to the polls

39:55.400 --> 39:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for her, and many of them
are already locked in.

39:57.400 --> 40:01.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Early voting has already
exceeded 140,000, so
the majority of the
voters who will show

40:03.266 --> 40:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up, who will end up
casting ballots have
already cast their ballots.

40:05.400 --> 40:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I'm not sure how much it
will change the race, but it
certainly is something we're

40:07.166 --> 40:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all talking about down here.

40:09.133 --> 40:11.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Do you
think that will affect
voting at all, the shooting?

40:11.166 --> 40:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: I think that
this type of ad, especially
an independent expenditure

40:14.366 --> 40:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like this, is a reflection
of how parties don't control
certain types of politics as

40:19.966 --> 40:22.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much anymore.

40:22.533 --> 40:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this shows one of the
negative consequences of
allowing outside groups
to be able to spend

40:25.500 --> 40:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
money in these types of races.

40:27.466 --> 40:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, they go off-script
and they do things that actually
the campaigns themselves

40:30.766 --> 40:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would actually reject and find
actually more harmful than good.

40:34.100 --> 40:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Greg, I saw
you nodding about off-script.

40:36.233 --> 40:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, someone who likes
to go off-script, of
course, is President Trump.

40:39.033 --> 40:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He actually has participated
in this race, in fact tweeting
just today in support of

40:42.833 --> 40:44.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republican Karen Handel.

40:44.833 --> 40:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's really been the sort of
subtext with this entire race.

40:47.566 --> 40:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much do you think
President Trump is a factor?

40:49.933 --> 40:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is this a test of President
Trump's approval right now?

40:53.033 --> 40:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREG BLUESTEIN: He is no
doubt -- undoubtedly a factor.

40:55.933 --> 41:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every time some local
candidates or operatives
try to say that he's
not, we just point to

41:02.933 --> 41:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the fact that he has -- not
only has he sent a string of
tweets out, but he's recorded

41:06.533 --> 41:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
robo-calls, he's come down
and stumped with Karen Handel.

41:10.433 --> 41:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So has Vice
President Mike Pence.

41:12.100 --> 41:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So he is without a doubt a
major factor in this race.

41:14.866 --> 41:18.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And really the only reason why
Democrats really think they
can win this is because of the

41:18.266 --> 41:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
narrow margin that he won
the district by in November.

41:21.533 --> 41:23.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: And
let's talk about that.

41:23.033 --> 41:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are going to show some
more numbers about that.

41:24.866 --> 41:25.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's amazing to me.

41:25.866 --> 41:27.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Look at this.

41:27.966 --> 41:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mitt Romney won this district
by 23 points and, as you say,
President Trump just by one.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Andra, I want to ask you.

41:33.800 --> 41:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have these two candidates
who represent somewhat of a
conservative view and a liberal

41:37.100 --> 41:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
view, but lately they have
moved toward the middle.

41:39.300 --> 41:40.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Who are they trying
to appeal to?

41:40.933 --> 41:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who will decide this race?

41:42.966 --> 41:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: In particular,
both campaigns have tried to
reach out to suburban women

41:46.033 --> 41:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voters, so particularly
college-educated white women.

41:49.333 --> 41:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen super PACs in
support of Karen Handel mention
that she would be the only

41:53.566 --> 41:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
woman in Georgia's
congressional delegation.

41:55.633 --> 42:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have seen Jon Ossoff play
the Planned Parenthood card,
noting that when Karen Handel

42:02.466 --> 42:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was an executive at the Susan G.
Komen Foundation, she allegedly
helped get Planned Parenthood

42:07.533 --> 42:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
defunded to help fit a
certain political agenda.

42:09.700 --> 42:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so if there is some
moderate-leaning even Republican
women who might be uncomfortable

42:14.566 --> 42:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with playing abortion politics
with, say, breast cancer, that
might be a way to demobilize

42:20.733 --> 42:22.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that constituency
and help his cause.

42:22.200 --> 42:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It is
one heck of a race, guys.

42:24.333 --> 42:28.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Andra Gillespie and Greg
Bluestein, I'm jealous
I'm not down there, but
thank you for joining

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREG BLUESTEIN: Thank you.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: Thank you.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And from Georgia
to Washington's Pennsylvania
Avenue, the political stakes

42:35.300 --> 42:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are high this week, a
perfect time for Politics
Monday with Tamara Keith
of NPR and Amy Walter

42:41.966 --> 42:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of The Cook Political Report.

42:43.933 --> 42:45.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you both.

42:45.100 --> 42:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A lot to talk about.

42:46.566 --> 42:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amy, let's talk about that
6th District race in Georgia.

42:50.400 --> 42:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of people are saying
it is a referendum of a
sort on the president.

42:54.866 --> 42:56.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you see it?

42:56.966 --> 42:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes, we're going to
read a lot into one race and

42:59.466 --> 43:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
overinterpret one race.

43:01.633 --> 43:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, obviously, because of the
amount of money that's been
spent on it and the fact that

43:04.633 --> 43:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the national media has
descended on it, we don't
really have a choice.

43:07.533 --> 43:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there are going to
be a couple of narratives
that come out of this.

43:10.733 --> 43:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Democrats are able to win
here on Tuesday, the message
being sent is not just one about

43:17.766 --> 43:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, but it is saying that
in Republican districts, even
districts that went Republican

43:23.066 --> 43:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
slightly for Trump, are now
in danger for Republicans.

43:26.533 --> 43:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So this probably expands the
playing field for Democrats.

43:30.233 --> 43:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're going to now try to get
and try to involve themselves
in many more districts

43:34.666 --> 43:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that are traditionally
Republican.

43:36.500 --> 43:39.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If a Republican wins,
it says, you know what?

43:39.900 --> 43:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This anger among Democrats,
the enthusiasm among Democrats,
while it is playing a national

43:47.066 --> 43:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
role, it is not translating
into districts that still
have a slight Republican lean.

43:51.933 --> 43:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It means that Republican
voters haven't abandoned -
- not that they just didn't
abandon the president,

43:56.366 --> 43:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but they're not
abandoning congressional
Republicans at this point.

43:59.466 --> 44:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only other person
that this is a referendum
on is Nancy Pelosi.

44:03.533 --> 44:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been more ads in
this district run against
Nancy Pelosi, Republican Karen

44:07.200 --> 44:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Handel, as well as other
groups, trying to make this
referendum from a liberal member

44:11.833 --> 44:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from San Francisco to paint
Jon Ossoff as out of touch
with the suburban district.

44:17.700 --> 44:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's running as a moderate.

44:18.900 --> 44:19.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She pops
up, Nancy Pelosi...

44:19.833 --> 44:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: In a lot of ads.

44:21.066 --> 44:22.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In
a lot of races.

44:22.566 --> 44:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Tamara, what do you see
are the factors at play here?

44:25.933 --> 44:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Well, so the president
tweeted this morning in support

44:29.266 --> 44:31.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Karen Handel.

44:31.433 --> 44:34.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then he did it again
this afternoon with a
series of tweets also
going after Jon Ossoff

44:34.566 --> 44:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for not living in the district,
which is a true thing.

44:37.533 --> 44:40.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jon Ossoff doesn't
live in the district.

44:40.233 --> 44:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Karen Handel is not running
away from President Trump.

44:43.966 --> 44:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He held a fund-raiser with her.

44:45.766 --> 44:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her campaign tweeted out a
fund-raising e-mail today.

44:48.733 --> 44:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The headline on it was, did you
see what Trump just tweeted?

44:53.533 --> 44:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So she's not separating
herself from the president.

44:57.166 --> 44:59.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She is running with
President Trump.

44:59.733 --> 45:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so we will see what voters
in that district think of it.

45:04.133 --> 45:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a very narrow victory that
President Trump had in 2016
in that district, even though

45:10.366 --> 45:12.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it was designed to be
a safe Republican seat.

45:12.833 --> 45:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot
of interpreting going
to be going on tomorrow
night and into Wednesday

45:16.433 --> 45:17.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and maybe even later.

45:17.633 --> 45:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Oh, absolutely.

45:18.633 --> 45:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We love narratives.

45:19.633 --> 45:21.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Come on.

45:21.133 --> 45:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Political narratives, it's
what we live for, Judy.

45:22.066 --> 45:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have got to keep doing this.

45:23.333 --> 45:25.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:25.433 --> 45:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking
of narratives, what was your
take, Amy, on what Jay Sekulow

45:27.666 --> 45:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had to say, the president's
attorney we talked
to a few minutes ago?

45:31.033 --> 45:32.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

45:32.033 --> 45:34.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

45:34.133 --> 45:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we heard in his interview
with you that seemed to be a
little bit different from what

45:36.700 --> 45:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we heard over the weekend
was the acknowledgment
that, while Jay Sekulow
said over the weekend

45:43.200 --> 45:47.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the president's not
being investigated, what
he acknowledged with
you was, we don't know

45:47.600 --> 45:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for sure that he's not being --
to the best of our knowledge,
I think, was the term that

45:51.033 --> 45:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he used, the president is
not being investigated.

45:54.233 --> 45:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think, as an overall take
on where we're going on Russia,
I don't think we're moving

46:00.433 --> 46:01.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very far.

46:01.900 --> 46:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It feels like we're kind of just
running in place constantly.

46:04.600 --> 46:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know that the special counsel
is doing its investigation.

46:07.333 --> 46:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know that the Senate
is doing an investigation.

46:09.733 --> 46:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's unlikely that the Senate
is going to - - even the Senate
itself is going to be done

46:13.366 --> 46:17.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by the end of the year,
nonetheless what Robert
Mueller, counsel, is
going to have by then.

46:17.800 --> 46:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you read
this based on your reporting at
the White House and elsewhere

46:21.533 --> 46:23.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this town?

46:23.633 --> 46:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, so, I have
been reporting on the legal
team that President Trump has

46:26.733 --> 46:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assembled, which includes
Jay Sekulow, who he is really
the face and the voice of the

46:33.666 --> 46:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
legal team, but he is not
necessarily the person that will
be representing the president.

46:40.166 --> 46:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is the public face because
what he has actually specialized
in is religious freedom

46:45.933 --> 46:46.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cases.

46:46.933 --> 46:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's argued extensively...

46:48.133 --> 46:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Before
the Supreme Court.

46:49.633 --> 46:51.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: ... before
the Supreme Court.

46:51.933 --> 46:55.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Marc Kasowitz is another
attorney who is sort
of the lead attorney.

46:55.966 --> 46:59.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He doesn't have a
criminal law background.

46:59.666 --> 47:04.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's basically Donald
Trump's attorney, and
had been for years.

47:04.333 --> 47:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's someone that the
president listens to, and that
is why he's a key part of the

47:08.500 --> 47:10.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
team.

47:10.933 --> 47:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they just
brought on another
lawyer who has Washington
experience and has some

47:15.366 --> 47:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
white-collar-type experience.

47:17.433 --> 47:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So the team is preparing
for the president to
be under investigation
by the special counsel

47:23.200 --> 47:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even if they aren't saying
that he is under investigation
by the special counsel, even

47:25.300 --> 47:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they aren't saying that
he is under investigation
by the special counsel,

47:27.733 --> 47:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to turn
both of you - - there is so
much to talk about, but I want

47:30.233 --> 47:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to turn you now, Amy, to the --
what's going on in the Senate
and the Congress over health

47:34.866 --> 47:36.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care reform.

47:36.866 --> 47:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know the House passed
a reform bill to basically
undo the Obamacare.

47:42.233 --> 47:44.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's been sitting in the
Senate week after week.

47:44.300 --> 47:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans are working behind
closed doors to try to come
up with a version that will

47:50.166 --> 47:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be more acceptable to them.

47:51.866 --> 47:56.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Democrats are now in
revolt, as much as they
can be in the minority.

47:57.600 --> 47:58.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where is that going?

47:58.266 --> 48:00.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

48:00.400 --> 48:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It sounds like what they want
to do is use a parliamentary
procedure to basically slow

48:02.833 --> 48:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
business in the
Senate to a crawl.

48:05.300 --> 48:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not that they can make much
change to the bill itself, but
they want to put a spotlight

48:09.033 --> 48:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the way that this bill is
being handled, just as you
pointed out, the fact that it's

48:12.466 --> 48:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being written behind doors, that
Democrats aren't part of the
process, that, quite frankly,

48:16.000 --> 48:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a whole bunch of Republican
senators have no idea
what's in the bill.

48:19.600 --> 48:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also want to keep the
spotlight on the health care
bill because the House-passed

48:22.733 --> 48:24.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one is so unpopular.

48:24.566 --> 48:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not even
particularly popular
among Republicans voters.

48:27.666 --> 48:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the more attention that
Democrats can put on that,
as well as the way that it's

48:32.300 --> 48:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being -- the bill itself,
as well as the way the
bill is being handled,
they think politically

48:37.900 --> 48:40.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is a winner.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, then, finally, they
are saying to their own
constituents, we are
trying to do something

48:42.966 --> 48:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about health care, but we're
not -- this is the only thing
that we can do, because we're

48:47.200 --> 48:49.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not in the majority.

48:49.233 --> 48:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only thing we can
try to do is some of this
procedural maneuvering.

48:50.733 --> 48:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you
know about what's happening?

48:52.466 --> 48:54.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:54.500 --> 48:58.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: What I know about
what happening is that, in the
Senate, the votes that were

48:58.166 --> 49:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supposed to happen tonight
were actually pushed
off because of weather.

49:01.666 --> 49:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, Chuck Schumer went
to the floor of the Senate
and did a -- sort of began the

49:08.566 --> 49:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
process, tried to get unanimous
consent to demand that there
be a hearing on this bill.

49:13.733 --> 49:17.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the majority leader,
Mitch McConnell, said
he objected to that.

49:17.933 --> 49:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They went around and
around and around.

49:21.333 --> 49:23.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democrats don't have a
lot that they can do.

49:23.433 --> 49:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is happening behind closed
doors, which means they can't
make an argument on substance

49:27.800 --> 49:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and policy, so they're making
an argument on procedure,
which is harder to make.

49:34.866 --> 49:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The majority
leader in the Senate, Mitch
McConnell, has said he wants

49:38.533 --> 49:40.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to get a vote on this
by the 1st of July.

49:40.200 --> 49:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

49:42.266 --> 49:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They really, really want
to get this behind them,
move through this process.

49:44.500 --> 49:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember, they can't move ahead
on the things they also want
to move ahead on, like tax

49:48.600 --> 49:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reform, until this is done.

49:50.300 --> 49:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this
has been held up for,
as we say, a long time.

49:53.333 --> 49:56.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: They wanted
to get it done in Easter
was the first deadline.

49:56.366 --> 49:58.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, there's nothing
unusual about that.

49:58.033 --> 50:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It took Democrats a long time
to get Obamacare through.

50:00.100 --> 50:01.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They wanted to get
it through in 2009.

50:01.966 --> 50:04.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It took them until 2010
to finally pass it.

50:04.800 --> 50:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bigger question is, what
does that bill look like and
then, if implemented, how do

50:10.966 --> 50:12.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Americans -- how does
it affect Americans?

50:12.633 --> 50:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Because this
is one-sixth of the economy.

50:15.266 --> 50:17.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is not small stuff.

50:17.733 --> 50:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There
will be a lot of reaction
as the Republican
Senate version emerges,

50:20.533 --> 50:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which it hasn't done yet.

50:21.633 --> 50:22.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

50:22.633 --> 50:24.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

50:24.600 --> 50:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tamara
Keith, Amy Walter, Politics
Monday, thank you both.

50:28.100 --> 50:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

50:32.100 --> 50:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

50:36.066 --> 50:41.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now
to a "NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught
our eye that might be

50:41.833 --> 50:44.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a growing movement to
fix items, instead of throwing
them out and buying new ones.

50:49.500 --> 50:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At MIT, a graduate started
Fixit Clinics eight years ago,
and now they're held all across

50:54.733 --> 50:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the country to teach people
how to do repairs themselves.

50:57.500 --> 51:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From PBS station WGBH in
Boston, Tina Martin reports.

51:02.133 --> 51:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: A toaster, a
tripod and a kettle, all
broken and in need of some TLC.

51:09.166 --> 51:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're in the right place.

51:10.666 --> 51:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER MUI, MIT Grad: This
is Fixit Clinic number 207.

51:12.800 --> 51:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have had a bunch of
Fixit Clinics all across
the United States.

51:15.733 --> 51:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: MIT grad Peter
Mui started the clinics in 2009
to help people learn to help

51:22.033 --> 51:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
themselves and the
environment in the process.

51:23.566 --> 51:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER MUI: And 52 tons of
e-waste diverted from landfill.

51:27.933 --> 51:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, not even just diverted, not
upcycled or not recycled, but
actually returned to service

51:34.233 --> 51:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for their originally
intended use.

51:36.333 --> 51:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a sense that they
don't have a choice when
it goes -- when it breaks.

51:39.133 --> 51:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is no repair people
left anymore to do this stuff.

51:41.866 --> 51:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: The clinics are
free and held three to four
times a month at libraries and

51:45.866 --> 51:48.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
community centers
across the country.

51:48.133 --> 51:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Peter Mui and his team of
volunteer coaches train people
like Abby Fox (ph), whose kettle

51:53.900 --> 51:55.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is out of commission.

51:55.466 --> 51:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Under normal conditions,
you go like this, it goes click.

51:57.966 --> 52:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it also turns blue and
then it should boil the water.

52:00.166 --> 52:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: She and I put on
goggles to learn about how to
get it back up and running.

52:04.566 --> 52:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Part of getting the kettle
back together is pulling it
apart and testing electricity.

52:11.366 --> 52:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER MUI: But you understand
that anything we do here
could make it worse.

52:13.400 --> 52:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: That warning aside,
the process is time-consuming,
and there's a chance nothing

52:17.233 --> 52:19.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can be done.

52:19.766 --> 52:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Fixit team prides
itself in resurrecting
even the toughest
electronics, like Jeannie

52:24.666 --> 52:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fink's (ph) classic radio,
which belonged to her father.

52:26.633 --> 52:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: His initials are
actually still on the back
of the part that we took off.

52:34.600 --> 52:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he has since passed away,
but it had been sitting on a
shelf in my home for the longest

52:38.333 --> 52:39.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

52:39.833 --> 52:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: The bell sounds,
and the music is playing again.

52:46.300 --> 52:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took about an hour
for Jeannie and her Fixit
coach to make it happen.

52:49.700 --> 52:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: So you think you
can fix something in your
house by yourself now?

52:52.633 --> 52:54.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:54.300 --> 52:56.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: I think I'm more
confident to at least
try to troubleshoot.

52:56.733 --> 52:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Abby Fox's
kettle was a different story.

52:59.500 --> 53:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The repair took all day, but,
in the end, it was another
Fixit Clinic success story.

53:06.166 --> 53:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Tina Martin in Boston.

53:09.533 --> 53:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I could
spend a couple of weeks there.

53:11.800 --> 53:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have got a lot of things
at home that need fixing.

53:14.500 --> 53:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online
right now: In traditional
beer brewing, only two
species of yeast have

53:20.633 --> 53:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
supposedly been used
over the last 600 years.

53:23.733 --> 53:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, a lab in North Carolina
may have found a third in the
strangest place, on wasps and

53:30.600 --> 53:32.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bees.

53:32.600 --> 53:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can get the whole story
of Bumblebeer on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:39.466 --> 53:40.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Now you know.

53:40.566 --> 53:41.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:41.466 --> 53:42.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:42.933 --> 53:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again
right here tomorrow evening.

53:45.000 --> 53:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you,
and we will see you soon.
