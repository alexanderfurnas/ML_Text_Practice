GWEN IFILL: Good
evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: The Taliban gains
ground in a key strategic
district

00:13.513 --> 00:18.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Afghanistan, while American
troops are killed in an attack
near the largest U.S.

00:18.018 --> 00:21.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
military facility
in the country.

00:21.121 --> 00:24.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Monday, we talk politics and
look at some of highlights

00:24.725 --> 00:29.263 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
from the latest
Democratic debate.

00:29.263 --> 00:35.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And a look at the
new bluegrass musical "Bright
Star" by comedian Steve Martin

00:35.936 --> 00:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and musician Edie Brickell.

00:38.505 --> 00:44.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE MARTIN, "Bright Star": My
part of the song was written on
the banjo. And the banjo

00:44.144 --> 00:50.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lays out a certain way for the
melodies to be played. And --
but I also like the sound

00:50.984 --> 00:54.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the banjo for this musical,
because I find the banjo very
provocative.

00:54.021 --> 00:57.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:57.090 --> 01:03.363 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:03.363 --> 01:17.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. military
has suffered its worst single
day in Afghanistan in a
year-and-a-half.

01:17.344 --> 01:22.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Six soldiers were killed and two
wounded today in a Taliban
attack. It was the strongest

01:22.416 --> 01:27.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sign yet of the militants'
resurgence. We will have details
and a full report on the

01:27.087 --> 01:31.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state of the fight against the
Taliban right after the news
summary.

01:31.224 --> 01:36.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: President Obama now
says there's legitimate
criticism of his efforts to
battle

01:36.596 --> 01:41.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Islamic State group. In a
year-end interview with NPR
airing today, he said he's
failed

01:41.969 --> 01:47.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to keep the public fully
informed about thousands of
airstrikes and recaptured
territory. The

01:47.107 --> 01:50.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president also urged Americans
to keep the threat in
perspective.

01:50.577 --> 01:54.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: While I
understand why people are
worried,

01:54.881 --> 01:58.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most damage they can do,
though, is if they start
changing how we live and what
our

01:58.318 --> 02:06.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
values are. And part of my
message over the next 14 months
or 13 months that I remain

02:06.626 --> 02:11.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in office is to just make sure
we remember who we are and make
sure that our resilience,

02:11.498 --> 02:15.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
our values, our unity
are maintained.

02:15.202 --> 02:19.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The president also
criticized Republican
presidential candidates who've

02:19.873 --> 02:24.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accused him of not doing enough
to fight terror. He said it's
important not just to shoot,

02:24.344 --> 02:26.847 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
but to aim.

02:26.847 --> 02:31.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The man who
allegedly bought the weapons
used in the San Bernardino
shootings

02:31.985 --> 02:38.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was ordered held without bond
today. Enrique Marquez is
accused of conspiring to aid
terrorists,

02:38.525 --> 02:43.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
among other federal charges.
Authorities say he bought the
assault-style rifles that Syed

02:43.363 --> 02:48.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Farook and Tashfeen Malik fired
at a holiday party, killing 14
people.

02:48.869 --> 02:54.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The first of six
Baltimore police officers in the
Freddie Gray case will go

02:54.341 --> 03:00.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on trial next June 13 for a
second time. A judge set the new
date today for officer William

03:00.347 --> 03:05.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Porter on manslaughter, assault
and other charges. His first
trial ended last week in

03:05.652 --> 03:10.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a hung jury. Gray died in
custody last April, touching off
violent protests.

03:10.791 --> 03:16.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: World soccer
moved to rid itself today of two
leaders engulfed in a corruption

03:16.696 --> 03:22.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scandal. The leader of the
sport's governing body, FIFA,
Sepp Blatter and his heir
apparent,

03:22.469 --> 03:26.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were banned for eight years. It
stems from a payment of more
than $2 million that's now

03:26.373 --> 03:29.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
part of a criminal probe.

03:29.176 --> 03:33.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Steve Scott of Independent
Television News has our report.

03:33.980 --> 03:40.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE SCOTT: Unshaven, with a
plaster covering the
after-effects of some minor
surgery, Sepp

03:40.587 --> 03:45.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Blatter fought his way through
the attention to deliver a
typically defiant message
shortly

03:45.358 --> 03:48.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after hearing of his
eight-year ban.

03:48.895 --> 03:57.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH "SEPP" BLATTER, Former
President, FIFA: I'm really
sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry
that

03:57.471 --> 04:06.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am still somewhere a punching
ball, that I am sorry that I am,
as president of FIFA,

04:06.847 --> 04:13.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this punching ball, and I'm
sorry for pro football. But I'm
also sorry about me.

04:13.820 --> 04:20.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE SCOTT: Sepp Blatter claims
the 1.3 million pounds payment
to Michel Platini in 2011 was

04:20.427 --> 04:26.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of a salary deal between
the pair in 1998. Platini,
Blatter's adviser at the time,

04:26.867 --> 04:32.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agreed to take some of the wages
then and guest the rest later.
Blatter claims the 2011

04:32.706 --> 04:37.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
payout settled that debt, but
FIFA rules that it breached its
ethics code, as the payment

04:37.744 --> 04:43.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wasn't correctly accounted
for in FIFA's books.

04:43.717 --> 04:48.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Platini, the consequences of
today's verdict could not be
worse. Six months ago, the
front-runner

04:48.889 --> 04:55.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take over the presidency,
that ambition now looks dead. He
said today: "The FIFA ethics

04:55.829 --> 04:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
commission's procedure against
me is a true mockery. It was
orchestrated to tarnish my

04:59.166 --> 05:02.802 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reputation."

05:02.802 --> 05:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While Blatter will now not get
the dignified handover of power
he so wanted, muted or not,

05:08.141 --> 05:10.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he won't give up.

05:10.443 --> 05:16.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH "SEPP" BLATTER: But I
will fight. I will fight for me
and I will fight for FIFA.

05:16.783 --> 05:21.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Suspended eight years, for what?
But I will be back. Thank you.

05:21.688 --> 05:26.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Switzerland's
attorney general is
investigating the case. They're
also looking

05:26.326 --> 05:30.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into alleged corruption in
FIFA's award of the next two
World Cup finals to Russia and

05:30.397 --> 05:32.532 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Qatar.

05:32.532 --> 05:37.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Rescuers in Southern
China have spent a second day
digging through a mudslide,

05:37.771 --> 05:43.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
searching for 85 missing people.
Buildings crumbled as a pile of
excavated dirt and construction

05:43.410 --> 05:49.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
waste, 330 feet high, collapsed
Sunday at an industrial park in
Shenzhen. It buried

05:49.950 --> 05:55.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
or damaged 33 buildings,
including factories, offices and
dormitories. At least 16 people

05:55.322 --> 05:58.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were injured, but no deaths
have been confirmed yet.

05:58.992 --> 06:04.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Spain braced
today for weeks of political
limbo, after no party won
outright

06:04.497 --> 06:10.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Sunday's election. The ruling
Conservatives celebrated winning
the most votes, but failed

06:10.003 --> 06:15.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to keep their majority in
Parliament. And left-wing
parties are refusing to join in

06:15.275 --> 06:21.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a coalition. Spain has been
roiled by a backlash over
austerity and by unemployment
that tops

06:21.414 --> 06:26.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
20 percent. The country's stock
market dropped 3 percent today
on the election outcome.

06:26.586 --> 06:31.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, gay and bisexual men
will be able to donate blood

06:31.524 --> 06:36.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the first time in nearly 30
years. The Food and Drug
Administration ended the ban

06:36.529 --> 06:41.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, saying it's not needed to
prevent the transmission of the
AIDS virus. The new policy

06:41.768 --> 06:46.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still bars donations by men who
have had sex with other men
within the previous 12 months.

06:46.940 --> 06:51.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Wall Street
managed to recover a little of
its losses from last week.

06:51.745 --> 06:58.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 123 points to close above
17250. The Nasdaq rose

06:58.618 --> 07:03.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
nearly 46 points, and
the S&amp;P 500 added 15.

07:03.323 --> 07:09.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the
"NewsHour": U.S. and NATO troops
killed in Afghanistan;

07:09.562 --> 07:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats divided over how to
fight ISIS; why health care
co-ops are shutting down;

07:13.733 --> 07:19.072 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

07:19.072 --> 07:33.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: Afghanistan
and the deaths of six Americans,
amid a renewed Taliban
offensive.

07:33.887 --> 07:38.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happened near Bagram air
field, outside Kabul, when a
suicide bomber drove a
motorcycle

07:38.291 --> 07:42.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into a joint U.S.-Afghan patrol.

07:42.862 --> 07:50.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Bagram attack was even worse
than this one last August, when
three American security

07:50.370 --> 07:56.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guards died in a suicide attack
in Kabul. And it came just three
days after Secretary

07:56.176 --> 07:59.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Defense Ash Carter
was in Afghanistan.

07:59.612 --> 08:03.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: We have made gains
that will put Afghanistan

08:03.983 --> 08:10.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a better path. More work lies
ahead, and the national security
of both our nations

08:10.523 --> 08:19.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
remains very much at stake. But
we will succeed. The Taliban's
advances in some parts of the

08:19.432 --> 08:23.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country, even if only temporary,
underscore that this is a tough
fight, and it's far from

08:23.036 --> 08:25.305 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
over.

08:25.305 --> 08:32.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Indeed, Taliban
fighters are pressing the Afghan
army hard across the country.

08:32.412 --> 08:38.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In late September, the militants
managed a three-day takeover of
Kunduz, a provincial

08:38.118 --> 08:43.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
capital in the north. And now
government forces are falling
back in Helmand Province in the

08:43.323 --> 08:45.825 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
south.

08:45.825 --> 08:52.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials there say the Taliban
seized the strategically
important Sangin district last

08:52.265 --> 08:57.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night. More than 90 Afghan
soldiers were killed in Helmand
in two days of fighting. But
some

08:57.704 --> 09:01.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at least still sounded defiant.

09:01.107 --> 09:06.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
operation is going on by Afghan
security forces in this

09:06.546 --> 09:09.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
area. The enemies cannot defeat
us. We have a strong resolve to
defeat them and defend

09:09.582 --> 09:12.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our country, Afghanistan.

09:12.919 --> 09:18.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And they will
have American help for a while
longer. Two months ago,
President

09:18.825 --> 09:24.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama reversed course and
announced that some 5,500 U.S.
troops will stay in Afghanistan

09:24.697 --> 09:28.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
beyond 2016.

09:28.968 --> 09:34.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Late today, Defense Secretary
Carter said the Bagram attack is
a "painful reminder"

09:34.307 --> 09:39.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the dangers U.S. troops face
in Afghanistan. And in a related
development, the U.N. Security

09:39.946 --> 09:44.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Council voted unanimously today
to extend sanctions against the
Taliban for 18 more

09:44.684 --> 09:46.986 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
months.

09:46.986 --> 09:51.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on the situation in
Afghanistan, we turn now to
freelance journalist Sune Engel

09:51.090 --> 09:55.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rasmussen in Kabul. I spoke
with him a short while ago.

09:55.061 --> 09:58.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thanks very much for joining us.

09:58.331 --> 10:03.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did this suicide bomber get
close enough to these American
troops to kill them? What

10:03.837 --> 10:05.605 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happened?

10:05.605 --> 10:07.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUNE ENGEL RASMUSSEN, Freelance
Journalist: Well, the American
troops were carrying out

10:07.841 --> 10:15.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a patrol on foot close to Bagram
with a unit of Afghan national
police. And as they were

10:15.181 --> 10:20.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
walking, the suicide bomber
drove up to them on a motorbike
laden with explosives and then

10:20.453 --> 10:23.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rammed into them and
detonated himself.

10:23.623 --> 10:30.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that killed six American
soldiers, is what we're hearing,
and injured another three

10:30.129 --> 10:36.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and injured three Afghan police.
So, it didn't seem that
difficult for him to get close
to

10:36.369 --> 10:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the soldiers apparently because
they were walking on foot.

10:39.172 --> 10:44.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it common for
U.S. or other NATO troops to be
so vulnerable that way so

10:44.577 --> 10:47.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
close to this big air base?

10:47.847 --> 10:50.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUNE ENGEL RASMUSSEN: Well, I
don't know the details of how
vulnerable they were, but I

10:50.950 --> 10:55.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
know they are conducting
patrols, not just U.S. soldiers,
but also soldiers from other

10:55.588 --> 10:59.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nations around Bagram.

10:59.158 --> 11:02.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is something they have
doing for a long time and will
probably continue to

11:02.729 --> 11:06.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do as part of their, train,
advise and assist mission, where
they go out with Afghans and

11:06.799 --> 11:09.269 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
assist them on the ground.

11:09.269 --> 11:17.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know
that there are something like
9,800 U.S. troops in Afghanistan

11:17.343 --> 11:24.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right now. What is their mission
right now? Is it to defend? Is
it to go after the Taliban?

11:24.617 --> 11:27.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How would you describe it?

11:27.287 --> 11:33.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUNE ENGEL RASMUSSEN: Well, NATO
and the U.S. call it a train,
advise and assist mission.

11:33.092 --> 11:37.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, broadly speaking, that means
training the Afghan security
forces to take over security

11:37.230 --> 11:42.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
themselves. Advising is often
also on the ground, for example,
with Afghan special forces,

11:42.969 --> 11:46.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when they try to the districts
in, for example, southern
Helmand province or in Kunduz,
which

11:46.205 --> 11:50.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fell a couple of months ago.

11:50.009 --> 11:56.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there's the assist
part, which is a little more
difficult to define exactly

11:56.015 --> 12:01.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what that is, but that is, for
example, fighting underground
alongside Afghan troops. Now,

12:01.187 --> 12:04.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. military says they
don't conduct their own
operation~s, but they are
assisting

12:04.357 --> 12:06.993 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Afghans.

12:06.993 --> 12:15.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're also carrying out
airstrikes. They're also
fighting a counterterrorism
mission,

12:15.234 --> 12:20.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as they say here. Now, that
sometimes veers into what the
rest of us might define as
counterinsurgency,

12:20.273 --> 12:27.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where they actually go out and
they do patrols in villages that
they think are influenced

12:27.647 --> 12:31.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
-- or where there is a
terrorism presence.

12:31.050 --> 12:36.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I ask because I
think Americans don't hear as
much about what's going on in

12:36.255 --> 12:40.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Afghanistan. But you mentioned
Helmand province in the south.
The Taliban is putting up quite

12:40.793 --> 12:43.262 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
a serious fight
there, aren't they?

12:43.262 --> 12:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUNE ENGEL RASMUSSEN: They are.
And they have been doing for
quite a while now.

12:46.766 --> 12:52.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Taliban launched what they
call a spring fighting season in
the spring, but it's been

12:52.238 --> 12:57.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going pretty much continually
since then for almost a year
now. Sangin has been contested

12:57.010 --> 13:00.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a couple years actually, but
it hasn't been as bad as we have
seen over the past

13:00.346 --> 13:05.284 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
48 hours now.

13:05.284 --> 13:09.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lashkar Gah, the provisional
capital in Helmand, looks
seriously threatened now, as it
hasn't

13:09.989 --> 13:15.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
done at any point actually
during the war. The Taliban have
managed to take a lot of

13:15.194 --> 13:21.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
districts surrounding the
capital. And that's also why we
have seen a recent arrival of

13:21.434 --> 13:28.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both the U.S. and U.K. special
forces in Helmand to help out
the Afghans secure the province.

13:28.174 --> 13:34.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eventually, the Afghans will
have to take control of security
themselves, but both the

13:34.514 --> 13:39.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regular Afghan forces, but also
the special Afghan forces, which
are actually quite competent

13:39.185 --> 13:43.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fighting, are stretched in the
province, as it looks now.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, very tough,
especially as we get so close to
Christmas.

13:46.626 --> 13:50.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sune Engel Rasmussen,
we thank you.

13:50.329 --> 14:00.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SUNE ENGEL RASMUSSEN:
You're welcome.

14:00.873 --> 14:09.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And now it is time
for Politics Monday, following a
busy campaign weekend.

14:09.148 --> 14:12.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Political director Lisa
Desjardins catches us up,
starting with the strong
contrasts

14:12.318 --> 14:16.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that emerged in Saturday's
Democrat debate.

14:16.089 --> 14:22.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The Democrats
walked in ready to talk
security. Topic one: how to
fight

14:22.528 --> 14:26.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Islamic State. Former
Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton argued the U.S. must
move

14:26.599 --> 14:30.303 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad out.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: We will
not get the support on the
ground

14:32.305 --> 14:39.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the
fighters there who are not
associated with ISIS, but

14:39.045 --> 14:43.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whose principal goal is getting
rid of Assad, don't believe
there is a political, diplomatic

14:43.649 --> 14:47.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
channel that is ongoing.
We now have that.

14:47.987 --> 14:50.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Clinton's
main rival, Vermont Senator
Bernie Sanders, said any focus

14:50.790 --> 14:53.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on Assad is a distraction.

14:53.659 --> 14:56.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate: Yes, of
course, Assad is a terrible
dictator.

14:56.462 --> 15:02.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think we have got to get
our foreign policies and
priorities right. The immediate

15:02.101 --> 15:08.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- it is not Assad who is
attacking the United States. It
is ISIS.

15:08.441 --> 15:12.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That was an
opening for former Maryland
Governor Martin O'Malley, a
distant

15:12.311 --> 15:15.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
third in the polls, to take
his own swipe at Clinton.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN O'MALLEY (D),
Presidential Candidate: I
believe that we need to focus on
destroying

15:18.317 --> 15:22.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIL. That is the clear and
present danger. But we shouldn't
be the ones declaring that

15:22.655 --> 15:25.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Assad must go.

15:25.424 --> 15:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Even as her
fellow Democrats differed with
Clinton, some Republican
candidates

15:30.096 --> 15:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agreed with her approach. On
CBS' "Face the Nation" Sunday,
Florida Senator Marco Rubio

15:34.367 --> 15:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called for helping Syrian
rebels oust Assad.

15:37.837 --> 15:40.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate: The
argument that Assad, and we have
no vested

15:40.807 --> 15:42.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interest, and he's not an enemy
of America is wrong. For
example, Assad is the reason

15:42.842 --> 15:45.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
why there's a refugee crisis.

15:45.411 --> 15:50.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And in a
YouTube video today, another
anti-Assad candidate, South
Carolina

15:50.349 --> 15:55.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Lindsey Graham, again
stressed the issue, even as he
dropped out of the race.

15:55.822 --> 15:59.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC),
Presidential Candidate: I'm
suspending my campaign, but
never my commitment

15:59.258 --> 16:02.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to achieving security through
strength for the American
people.

16:02.728 --> 16:06.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Of course,
security wasn't the only topic
at Saturday's debate. Candidates

16:06.399 --> 16:08.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
talked Wall Street as well.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: Should corporate
America love Hillary Clinton?

16:10.570 --> 16:11.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON:
Everybody should.

16:11.003 --> 16:11.370 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

16:11.370 --> 16:14.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

16:14.006 --> 16:19.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I want
to be the president for the
struggling, the striving and the
successful.

16:19.145 --> 16:23.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I also want to create jobs,
and I want to be a partner with
the private sector.

16:23.049 --> 16:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Hillary and
I have a difference. The CEOs of
large multinationals

16:29.222 --> 16:32.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may like Hillary. They ain't
going to like me and Wall Street
is going to like me even

16:32.391 --> 16:34.260 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
less.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But the two
rivals did have a moment of
detente following news that the

16:37.897 --> 16:41.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sanders staff had accessed
secret Clinton data.

16:41.567 --> 16:45.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Not only do
I apologize to Secretary
Clinton, and I hope we can work

16:45.638 --> 16:50.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together on an independent
investigation from day one. I
want to apologize to my
supporters.

16:50.376 --> 16:54.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is not the type of
campaign that we run.

16:54.080 --> 17:00.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I very
much appreciate that comment,
Bernie. It really is important

17:00.253 --> 17:03.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that we go forward on this.

17:03.089 --> 17:07.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The debate drew
more than eight million viewers.
That was on the Saturday

17:07.159 --> 17:10.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before Christmas. That's less
than half the number that tuned
in for the prime-time GOP

17:10.796 --> 17:12.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
showdown last Tuesday.

17:12.698 --> 17:16.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Lisa Desjardins.

17:16.302 --> 17:21.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For more about all
this, I'm joined by our Politics
Monday panel, Amy Walter of

17:21.374 --> 17:23.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Cook Political Report, and
joining us tonight from New
Hampshire, Tamara Keith of

17:23.843 --> 17:25.144 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
NPR.

17:25.144 --> 17:29.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tam, you're on the trail, so
we're going to start with you.

17:29.081 --> 17:34.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's start by saying farewell
today to Lindsey Graham. What
did he or not bring to this
race?

17:34.887 --> 17:40.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Lindsey Graham was the
hawkish candidate on defense.

17:40.526 --> 17:45.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He also was in favor of
immigration reform,
comprehensive immigration
reform, including

17:45.731 --> 17:51.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a path to citizenship, which is
-- what he was selling is
basically not what primary

17:51.871 --> 17:55.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voters were buying on the
Republican side this time
around.

17:55.942 --> 18:00.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just have a quick story
from New Hampshire, from --
about a month ago, I was here.
And

18:00.713 --> 18:05.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was here to cover a Donald
Trump event at this hotel, and
the line to get into that

18:05.851 --> 18:11.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
event was winding around the
hotel. And then I walk into the
hotel restaurant, and Lindsey

18:11.691 --> 18:15.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Graham is sitting alone in the
restaurant basically surrounded
by a line of people going

18:15.795 --> 18:17.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to see Donald Trump.

18:17.997 --> 18:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I had something like
that happen with George~ Pataki
once. I saw him sitting

18:21.033 --> 18:23.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
alone in a restaurant in the
middle of a big moment.

18:23.602 --> 18:24.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: But that sort of sums it
all up, doesn't it?

18:24.337 --> 18:26.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: It does.

18:26.072 --> 18:29.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Right? The candidate
who came into the race to be the
candidate that at

18:29.608 --> 18:34.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
least is not going to be the
nominee, but at least he wanted
to inject these issues

18:34.080 --> 18:36.182 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into the debate.

18:36.182 --> 18:39.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, to be fair, we're talking a
lot about immigration and we're
talking a lot about

18:39.719 --> 18:43.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national security, but not
necessarily in the ways that
Lindsey Graham would like
Republicans

18:43.322 --> 18:45.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be talking about them.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Or perhaps he has a
couple of supporters in North
Carolina who can be of

18:46.525 --> 18:47.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
help to other candidates.

18:47.426 --> 18:49.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Absolutely.

18:49.328 --> 18:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about the
debate, that interesting moment
where, Amy, Bernie Sanders

18:54.633 --> 18:56.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and Hillary Clinton kind
of kissed and made up.

18:56.135 --> 18:56.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What was that?

18:56.836 --> 18:58.671 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

18:58.671 --> 19:04.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I think it was a very
smart decision for Bernie
Sanders' campaign to stop this

19:04.443 --> 19:10.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
controversy before it even
began. This started late on
Friday, where the DNC said,
we're

19:10.549 --> 19:16.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cutting off access to the Bernie
Sanders campaign to our joint
voter file database because
there

19:16.255 --> 19:20.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is evidence that his campaign
accessed Hillary Clinton's data
and may be holding on to it

19:20.126 --> 19:22.428 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now.

19:22.428 --> 19:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a kerfuffle. Got a
little dramatic. They since have
worked things out. It's not

19:27.633 --> 19:34.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
completely over at this point,
but I think it was smart for the
Sanders' campaign, which

19:34.040 --> 19:41.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is -- and Sanders himself, who
positioned himself as honest and
authentic, and just

19:41.180 --> 19:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come right out and say, listen,
I apologize, it's not who we
are. Let's go talk about the

19:44.784 --> 19:48.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issues that we know he wants to
talk about, income equality.

19:48.154 --> 19:51.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, Tam, let's
talk about what the distinction
between what the candidates

19:51.457 --> 19:55.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say and what their staffs say,
because there was some really
harsh rhetoric being exchanged

19:55.895 --> 20:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
among the staff that wasn't as
sweet and apple pie as what
happened between Bernie Sanders

20:00.533 --> 20:02.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Hillary Clinton on stage.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Absolutely.

20:05.271 --> 20:12.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That harsh rhetoric was in full
force in the spin room before
and after the debate. And,

20:12.078 --> 20:18.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in fact, just because the
candidates out on stage said
sorry and I accept, more or
less,

20:18.684 --> 20:23.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just within the last hour, I got
an e-mail from Sanders' campaign
manager, a new statement,

20:23.923 --> 20:29.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
calling on the Clinton campaign
to support that independent
review.

20:29.728 --> 20:35.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the Sanders' campaign isn't
really letting this go, and I
think this Clinton campaign

20:35.201 --> 20:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
isn't really letting it go
either. And the remarkable thing
about the Sanders campaign

20:40.439 --> 20:48.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that campaign got access to
and took data that wasn't theirs
and they have remarkably

20:48.447 --> 20:52.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turned it around and made it the
establishment, the Democratic
National Committee trying to

20:52.451 --> 20:54.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
keep Sanders down.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask you, Tam.
What's true and what's not and
does it matter? It's a

20:57.456 --> 21:00.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pretty obscure fight.

21:00.359 --> 21:05.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It's an extremely
obscure fight. Most people
didn't even know that this voter

21:05.898 --> 21:12.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
file existed. And even fewer
people have any idea how it
works.

21:12.538 --> 21:18.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a very small select
people that know how it works.
But it does -- the theft
potentially

21:18.711 --> 21:24.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of data does create this image
of sort of cloak and dagger
politics that we sort of

21:24.917 --> 21:28.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
imagine when we think of
underhanded politics.

21:28.687 --> 21:32.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's like every bad
movie you have ever seen about
politics out of Hollywood.

21:32.591 --> 21:37.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, that is
probably true. But it's actually
more fundamental than that,

21:37.029 --> 21:40.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is, this is the voter
information. This is the most
important thing that any
candidate

21:40.065 --> 21:40.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has, right?

21:40.566 --> 21:42.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

21:42.801 --> 21:48.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And they all have
something unique about what
their strategy is to win these

21:48.007 --> 21:51.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
two states, especially
Iowa and New Hampshire.

21:51.644 --> 21:57.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when another campaign sees
your playbook, that can be very
damaging.

21:57.049 --> 22:01.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: When this becomes a
one-on-one fight between Hillary
Clinton and Bernie Sanders,

22:01.020 --> 22:03.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
standing on the side there was
Martin O'Malley, who seems to
have a hard time getting any

22:03.889 --> 22:06.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
traction on the debate
stage and off, Amy.

22:06.825 --> 22:09.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, there's not
really a lane for Bernie
Sanders.

22:09.828 --> 22:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We started this campaign knowing
a couple of things. The
Republican electorate, what

22:14.433 --> 22:17.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they wanted was very different
than what the Democratic
electorate said they wanted out

22:17.536 --> 22:21.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of a nominee. Republican
electorate said, we don't like
Washington, we don't like the

22:21.440 --> 22:26.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
establishment, we don't like the
idea of having another Bush
necessarily.

22:26.612 --> 22:30.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats felt very different.
They liked the idea of
experience. They were very happy

22:30.749 --> 22:36.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a Clinton, another Clinton
potentially in the White House,
so not that easy lane

22:36.455 --> 22:42.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there for Martin O'Malley. And
he hasn't been able to capture
the aspirational message,

22:42.461 --> 22:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Barack Obama did in 2007
and like Bernie Sanders has been
able to do this time around.

22:47.900 --> 22:52.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Tamara, both
Republicans and Democrats have
spent a lot of time in this
campaign

22:52.838 --> 22:57.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about America's role in
the world. And on that -- just
on that point, there really

22:57.109 --> 23:01.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was a distinction to be drawn
between Hillary Clinton and
Bernie Sanders and actually from

23:01.080 --> 23:02.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Republicans as well.

23:02.815 --> 23:07.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, and
also Martin O'Malley.

23:07.019 --> 23:12.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both O'Malley and Sanders came
back to this idea a couple of
times in the debate that

23:12.992 --> 23:18.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, they say, may
be a little too quick to support
regime change. And O'Malley

23:18.998 --> 23:23.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
even mentioned Libya
as an example.

23:23.135 --> 23:28.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then you take that to the
Republican side, and Marco Rubio
is more in favor of regime

23:28.874 --> 23:36.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change and wants Assad out,
where Ted Cruz and Rand Paul are
less interventionist. So,

23:36.315 --> 23:38.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there is a divide and it's
a pretty interesting one.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It is interesting
and it crosses parties.

23:40.486 --> 23:41.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's the thing.
And it crosses party lines.

23:41.353 --> 23:43.022 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

23:43.022 --> 23:47.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It's not often that
you say Hillary Clinton and
Marco Rubio agree on something,

23:47.593 --> 23:52.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or -- and this is even stranger
-- Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders
agree more on the role

23:52.731 --> 23:58.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of America in terms of foreign
policy toward Syria than Hillary
Clinton and the rest of

23:58.070 --> 23:59.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the field.

23:59.938 --> 24:03.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Last debate of the
year, finally. And as we get
into the holidays, things kind

24:03.676 --> 24:04.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of freeze in place.

24:04.510 --> 24:06.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: They do.

24:06.478 --> 24:10.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Tamara, what do
you have a sense of is going to
happen next? Or are we

24:10.449 --> 24:15.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just waiting until mid-January,
when everybody gets revved up
again?

24:15.020 --> 24:19.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I think it will be
a little bit before mid-January,
but, yes, I think

24:19.992 --> 24:23.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that things do sort
of freeze in place.

24:23.028 --> 24:29.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the real question for Bernie
Sanders becomes, can he win New
Hampshire? And that -- the

24:29.368 --> 24:35.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
polls show it's close. And can
he win Iowa? That's less close.
He's going to be working

24:35.541 --> 24:39.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very hard in both of those
states, because they are
critical to him making a case
that

24:39.745 --> 24:41.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he is a strong opponent
to Hillary Clinton.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.082 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Amy?

24:43.082 --> 24:47.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: And on the
Republican side, I think going
into the end of this year, Ted

24:47.586 --> 24:51.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cruz looks like the front-runner
at this point. I would argue the
person...

24:51.790 --> 24:53.525 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: The
person -- well...

24:53.525 --> 24:56.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes. I would say the
person that is best positioned,
how about that, to...

24:56.829 --> 25:00.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: To take down
the actual front-runner?

25:00.032 --> 25:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: To take down the
person who is at the front of
the national poll, yes, named

25:01.100 --> 25:02.468 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

25:02.468 --> 25:04.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You don't consider
Donald Trump to be the
front-runner?

25:04.737 --> 25:09.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I consider him to be
a front-runner, but I do not
consider him to be likely to

25:09.208 --> 25:09.608 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be the nominee.

25:09.608 --> 25:11.710 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

25:11.710 --> 25:16.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have a challenge for both of
you for the post-Christmas
Politics Monday. Put on your

25:16.749 --> 25:21.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Santa hats. You can put your
Santa sweaters away. I know you
planned to where them tonight.

25:21.553 --> 25:24.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And tell us what happens during
this little hammocked period
between Christmas and New

25:24.189 --> 25:25.824 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Year's.

25:25.824 --> 25:27.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't have to answer me now.
Going to come back to you with
that again next Monday.

25:27.559 --> 25:28.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Give you some time
to think about it.

25:28.494 --> 25:29.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: All right.

25:29.828 --> 25:35.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Have a happy
holiday, both of you.

25:35.567 --> 25:40.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Thank you.

25:40.939 --> 25:46.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Happy holidays.

25:46.378 --> 25:51.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

25:51.283 --> 25:57.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": The
Obama administration protects
two breeds of African lions;
what

25:57.022 --> 26:02.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a drought revealed in Nevada's
Lake Mead; and Steve Martin's
musical of love and redemption

26:02.227 --> 26:04.496 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the South.

26:04.496 --> 26:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, the demand for
health insurance and concerns
over choice.

26:10.102 --> 26:15.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The federal government reported
higher demand this year for
people trying to enroll on
insurance

26:15.107 --> 26:20.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exchanges for coverage. Six
million had signed up by last
week for coverage that begins
next

26:20.646 --> 26:24.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
month. More than two million
of them were new customers.

26:24.183 --> 26:29.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in 11 states, there's one
change that's complicating the
picture this year: Half of

26:29.488 --> 26:33.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the state-run health co-ops
were forced to shut down.

26:33.959 --> 26:38.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Mary Jo
Brooks looks at what happened in
Colorado.

26:38.530 --> 26:45.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY JO BROOKS: It's been a
tough year for 36-year-old
Jessica Peck, a Denver attorney

26:45.170 --> 26:49.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and divorced mother of two. Peck
suffers severe vascular and
neurological ailments which over

26:49.741 --> 26:53.946 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the years led to
soaring medical bills.

26:53.946 --> 26:59.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2014, she signed up with a
brand-new health insurance
company called Colorado
HealthOP.

26:59.618 --> 27:03.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: The co-op provides health
insurance that is built around
all needs.

27:03.322 --> 27:07.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARY JO BROOKS: It was a
nonprofit co-op formed under the
Affordable Care Act and funded
with

27:07.926 --> 27:12.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
loans from the federal
government. Peck says she chose
it because the price was right.

27:12.331 --> 27:16.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSICA PECK, Colorado: At least
50 percent in terms of premiums
and out-of-pocket co-pays

27:16.068 --> 27:17.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the year before.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARY JO BROOKS: Fifty percent.

27:18.937 --> 27:23.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSICA PECK: Fifty percent. So
this cost saving was a
difference. When I was at my

27:23.041 --> 27:30.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sickest of being able to pay my
bills, to be able to put gas in
my car, and at one point

27:30.516 --> 27:33.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
having the difference in
premiums was probably the only
thing that kept me afloat.

27:33.852 --> 27:38.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY JO BROOKS: At her sickest
last year, Peck was forced to
have her right leg amputated

27:38.290 --> 27:44.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and was hospitalized for more
than 23 days. Peck is the first
to admit that the co-op

27:44.863 --> 27:49.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wasn't perfect, including some
billing errors she is still
trying to sort out. But she was

27:49.001 --> 27:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dismayed when she heard the news
that the co-op was being shut
down.

27:52.905 --> 27:57.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSICA PECK: Now I have to go
back into a marketplace of
players that I have worked

27:57.142 --> 28:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with before, the big, big guys
out there, who hurt me before,
who sent me to collections

28:02.281 --> 28:07.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on bills, who denied care that
was absolutely 100 percent
essential. And I have to go back

28:07.486 --> 28:11.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into that marketplace and pay
twice as much as what I'm paying
right now.

28:11.623 --> 28:16.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colorado HealthOP was one of 23
co-ops started around the
country as a concession to
Democrats

28:16.261 --> 28:22.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who wanted the ACA to include an
alternative to private insurers.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michele Lueck heads up the
policy research group Colorado
Health Institute.

28:25.437 --> 28:28.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELE LUECK, Colorado Health
Institute: There were a number
of politicians and legislators

28:28.340 --> 28:34.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who wanted to have a government
choice, something like Medicare
that people could opt into.

28:34.813 --> 28:39.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when that wasn't politically
feasible, an olive branch
essentially that was offered

28:39.751 --> 28:45.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the left was this idea of
creating co-ops, that this would
be something that was owned

28:45.390 --> 28:49.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and operated by the people
who needed it the most.

28:49.394 --> 28:55.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY JO BROOKS: Offering some of
the lowest-priced plans in the
state, the co-op quickly became

28:55.067 --> 29:01.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very popular. By 2015, it had
83,000 policy holders, which
represented 40 percent of all

29:01.239 --> 29:05.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
policies sold on the
Colorado health exchange.

29:05.277 --> 29:10.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, it was tough to compete
against long-established
companies. For one thing, most
of the patients

29:10.749 --> 29:14.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who signed up with the co-op had
been previously uninsured, which
meant they had greater needs.

29:14.987 --> 29:17.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CEO Julia Hutchins.

29:17.389 --> 29:20.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA HUTCHINS, CEO, Colorado
HealthOP: People who signed up
for health insurance in 2014

29:20.225 --> 29:26.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had a lot of pent-up demand. And
it wasn't hospital care. These
are procedures. When

29:26.431 --> 29:31.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're uninsured or underinsured
for a long time and then have
insurance, there is a lot

29:31.503 --> 29:36.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of care that needs to be
provided. So we spent more on
claims in our first year than we
projected.

29:36.141 --> 29:40.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY JO BROOKS: The government
was supposed to offset costs of
those high-risk patients,

29:40.212 --> 29:44.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the Republican-led Congress
sharply curtailed funding. In
October, the administration
announced

29:44.983 --> 29:50.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it would only be able to pay 13
percent of the $3 billion it
owed insurers across the

29:50.289 --> 29:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country. Colorado HealthOP
was counting on $40 million.

29:53.925 --> 29:56.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT LLOYD, Colorado Division
of Insurance: And when that
money did not come in, that's

29:56.128 --> 29:59.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what really put them under.

29:59.398 --> 30:03.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY JO BROOKS: Scott Lloyd with
the Colorado Division of
Insurance said without the
federal

30:03.635 --> 30:07.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money, the co-op didn't have
enough capital on hand to be
recertified.

30:07.239 --> 30:12.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT LLOYD: If your capital
drops to a certain point, it's
called mandatory control level,

30:12.678 --> 30:17.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so we're mandated as a state to
take control of an entity when
that capital drops below

30:17.249 --> 30:21.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that. We can't wait around to
see if it turns are going to
around, because the longer you

30:21.119 --> 30:23.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wait, the worse the
situation could become.

30:23.755 --> 30:26.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA HUTCHINS: When we heard
the news, we -- I really felt
sick to my stomach.

30:26.958 --> 30:30.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY JO BROOKS: In spite of the
news, Hutchins was confident
they could raise the needed

30:30.462 --> 30:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money elsewhere. She had three
interested investors, but didn't
have the cash in hand

30:35.500 --> 30:41.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to meet the insurance deadline.
So at the end of the year, the
co-op will shut down.

30:41.006 --> 30:44.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of the 80 employees have
already begun packing up the
office.

30:44.710 --> 30:47.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA HUTCHINS: It's unfortunate
that we were part of a health
care program that's been

30:47.345 --> 30:51.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so politicized. We were
orphaned by politics.

30:51.216 --> 30:52.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARY JO BROOKS: Who are
you most angry at?

30:52.050 --> 30:53.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIA HUTCHINS: Obama.

30:53.485 --> 30:56.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARY JO BROOKS: Why?

30:56.488 --> 31:02.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA HUTCHINS: Because so many
different ways that the
administration made the
Affordable

31:02.027 --> 31:04.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Care Act work, but they really
abandoned the co-op program at
the time when it was most

31:04.696 --> 31:06.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
important.

31:06.531 --> 31:11.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY JO BROOKS: In fact, more
than half of the co-ops
nationwide have announced they

31:11.269 --> 31:20.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are shutting down. That has left
members scrambling to find new
policies for next year.

31:20.145 --> 31:24.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At health fairs like this one in
Littleton, Colorado, insurance
companies are trying to

31:24.049 --> 31:28.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attract those members, but their
higher-cost plans are a tough
sell.

31:28.653 --> 31:29.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICIA PUTNAM, Colorado:
Everybody has these $6,000,
$7,000 max out of pockets. And
when

31:29.755 --> 31:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're on disability, you can't
-- you don't have $6,000, $7,000
to pay every year.

31:30.088 --> 31:33.058 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
MAN: It is a
compromise, isn't it?

31:33.058 --> 31:42.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICIA PUTNAM: It's not
compromise for me, because I
don't have that.

31:42.801 --> 31:49.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY JO BROOKS: So, what could
the co-ops have done
differently? Michele Lueck says

31:49.708 --> 31:53.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perhaps they shouldn't have
relied so heavily on the
government.

31:53.145 --> 31:58.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELE LUECK: Other states,
like Connecticut and New Jersey
and Maine, didn't rely on that

31:58.517 --> 32:05.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money. They thought that they
had higher premiums to create
the necessary reserves, but they

32:05.023 --> 32:08.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't rely on this promised
payment from the federal
government. And those are the

32:08.660 --> 32:11.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ones, by and large, that are
still in existence today.

32:11.897 --> 32:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY JO BROOKS: But Julia
Hutchins says she's not sure
anything could have helped.

32:15.300 --> 32:20.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JULIA HUTCHINS: It says
something when you have a local
company who was doing all the

32:20.906 --> 32:26.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right things and was still able
to offer the lowest cost and
said to be profitable, and

32:26.178 --> 32:30.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we couldn't figure out how
to navigate the powers that be
in health insurance to

32:30.415 --> 32:32.517 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
survive.

32:32.517 --> 32:37.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's important to recognize that
this isn't just a co-op story.
This is a small health

32:37.389 --> 32:42.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan story. And we really
haven't seen any good solutions
to reduce costs from the big

32:42.627 --> 32:43.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
health plans.

32:43.528 --> 32:46.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: These have
larger premiums.

32:46.231 --> 32:50.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY JO BROOKS: Coloradans will
get another chance to experiment
with an alternative health

32:50.435 --> 32:54.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insurance plan next November,
when they vote on a ballot
measure that would create a
statewide

32:54.339 --> 32:57.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
single-payer insurance system.

32:57.609 --> 33:01.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Denver, I'm Mary Jo Brooks
for the "PBS NewsHour."

33:01.379 --> 33:16.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Next: The Obama
administration today took steps
in this country to protect

33:16.394 --> 33:19.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lions in Africa under the
Endangered Species Act.

33:19.798 --> 33:22.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has that.

33:22.100 --> 33:26.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service listed Central
and West African lions

33:26.671 --> 33:32.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as endangered, generally
prohibiting importation of lion
trophies from that region into
the

33:32.043 --> 33:36.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Lions in Southern and
Eastern Africa are now
classified as threatened, which
will

33:36.081 --> 33:40.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allow U.S. trophy imports only
under certain conditions.

33:40.986 --> 33:45.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The move comes five months after
an American hunter killed a lion
named Cecil outside a

33:45.724 --> 33:50.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national park in Zimbabwe, and
almost five years after U.S.
conservation groups petitioned

33:50.295 --> 33:53.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for greater protections
for lions.

33:53.598 --> 33:56.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more, I am joined by Daniel
Ashe, director of the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service.

33:56.434 --> 33:58.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL ASHE, Director, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service: Thank you,
Jeff.

33:59.604 --> 34:02.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why now? Is it
right to see the killing of
Cecil as a kind of game changer

34:02.507 --> 34:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that galvanized public attention
and now government action?

34:06.645 --> 34:10.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL ASHE: Well, we have been
considering the listing of the
lion for more than five

34:10.448 --> 34:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years. We were petitioned under
the Endangered Species Act, so
that's been our responsibility.

34:14.219 --> 34:21.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we proposed listing the lion
back in October of 2014, before
the controversy over Cecil

34:21.526 --> 34:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the lion, but Cecil and that
controversy certainly have
galvanized public emotions about
lions

34:28.466 --> 34:30.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and I think brings us
to where we are today.

34:30.068 --> 34:33.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Advocacy groups
have wondered what took so long.

34:33.538 --> 34:37.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL ASHE: Well, we are a
scientific organization. And
we're dealing with what many
scientists

34:37.175 --> 34:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
call the sixth mass extinction.

34:40.345 --> 34:44.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So we have many, many
priorities, a lot of work under
the Endangered Species Act. This

34:44.516 --> 34:51.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is one of those things. And we
have had lots of comment and
lots of science to pore through.

34:51.156 --> 34:55.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why would a U.S.
-- explain this to people. Why
would a U.S. law or a

34:55.493 --> 34:59.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
designation have such a big
impact on what happens in Africa
and in what ways would it

34:59.364 --> 35:01.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have an impact?

35:01.499 --> 35:05.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL ASHE: That's one of the
great successes of the U.S.
Endangered Species Act is that

35:05.503 --> 35:11.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it projects U.S. leadership
into world conservation.

35:11.710 --> 35:18.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The economy of the United States
oftentimes causes species'
extension and decline. But,

35:18.917 --> 35:24.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this case, we can use the
power of the U.S. economy and
our position as a trade leader

35:24.089 --> 35:27.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to influence conservation
of species like the lion.

35:27.692 --> 35:31.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Explain the
distinction that I mentioned
here between them and the
reasons

35:31.363 --> 35:34.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the distinction between
putting some lions on the
endangered list and some on the
threatened

35:34.099 --> 35:35.734 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
list.

35:35.734 --> 35:40.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL ASHE: So, the law allows
us to protect subspecies, as
well as species. And so the

35:40.672 --> 35:46.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
science tells us that there are
two species of lion, one, the
Asiatic line.

35:46.611 --> 35:52.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What used to be considered
Asiatic lion closely related to
lions in Northern and Western
Africa,

35:52.217 --> 35:58.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then another distinct
subspecies in Southern and
Eastern Africa.

35:58.089 --> 36:02.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But why not go
further? Why not go further with
the other species?

36:02.293 --> 36:08.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL ASHE: Well, the one
species, Panthera leo leo, is --
only 900 of them remain in

36:08.299 --> 36:13.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the wild, so severely endangered
and in very small populations.

36:13.905 --> 36:22.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other subpopulation, leo
melanochaita, is -- there are
about 17,000 to 20,000 of

36:22.347 --> 36:24.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them in the wild. So, they're in
better condition. And some of
those populations have actually

36:24.783 --> 36:27.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been increasing during
the last decade.

36:27.552 --> 36:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, that raises
the question, how dire is the
population problem? What is

36:30.655 --> 36:33.925 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the real problem
here at the core?

36:33.925 --> 36:37.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL ASHE: Well, at the core,
this problem is human conflict
with lions.

36:37.529 --> 36:43.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're seeing human and human
economies occupying the same
habitat that lions need

36:43.868 --> 36:49.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to prosper. And so, as
populations increase and become
more affluent in Africa, we're

36:49.374 --> 36:54.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seeing more conflict with lion.
And so the future for lion is
bleak at this point in

36:54.879 --> 36:59.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time and we could be looking at
a future where there is nothing
called a lion in the wild,

36:59.584 --> 37:03.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
unless we take important
actions. And that's what we're
doing today.

37:03.855 --> 37:08.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The hunting
industry, of course, has argued
for a long time that, A,
~hunting

37:08.460 --> 37:13.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can be controlled, and, B, that
the money that comes from these
hunts provide resources

37:13.765 --> 37:18.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for conservation in countries
that often do not have enough
money, enough funds.

37:18.503 --> 37:22.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL ASHE: And that argument
in general is a good argument.
And we see that here in

37:22.807 --> 37:27.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the United States, where
hunting, well-regulated and
managed hunting, can ensure
prosperous

37:27.312 --> 37:30.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wildlife populations.

37:30.515 --> 37:35.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think, in Africa -- and as
we think about the plight of the
lion and the drastic

37:35.453 --> 37:43.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
declines that~ we have seen, I
like to think of a Zimbabwean
proverb that says, until the

37:43.495 --> 37:50.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
side of the lion can be told,
the story of the hunt always
glorifies the hunter.

37:50.768 --> 37:55.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we need to do in the
United States is, we need to do
better. The United States

37:55.740 --> 38:00.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
needs to do better and can do
better. The hunting industry
needs to do better and can

38:00.745 --> 38:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do better. And the American
hunter in particular needs to do
better and can do better. And

38:05.049 --> 38:09.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our listing today, we think, is
going to provide that kind of
incentive.

38:09.854 --> 38:12.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Daniel Ashe,
director of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, thanks so

38:12.090 --> 38:14.526 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

38:14.526 --> 38:25.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANIEL ASHE: Thank you, Jeff.

38:25.737 --> 38:34.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As the drought
drags on in the Western part of
the country, Lake Mead

38:34.445 --> 38:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Nevada is sitting with water
at its lowest point since the
1930s. But there has been

38:40.552 --> 38:45.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one silver lining of late for
that area: Lake Mead has been
revealing some of its deepest

38:45.023 --> 38:48.326 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
secrets as the
water levels drop.

38:48.326 --> 38:51.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Sandra
Hughes has the story.

38:51.829 --> 38:57.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA HUGHES: On a cloudy day
in Nevada, this boat and its
passengers launch into Lake

38:57.669 --> 39:06.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mead. They're on a treasure
hunt, not for gold or silver,
but history. And it's all

39:06.110 --> 39:09.314 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
because of the
devastating drought.

39:09.314 --> 39:12.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEL SILVERSTEIN, Diver: The
lake is down almost 150 feet
from when we started diving

39:12.483 --> 39:17.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it. And what's that's done is,
it's exposed other dive sites to
it.

39:17.589 --> 39:22.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA HUGHES: The bathtub ring
around Lake Mead shows how low
the manmade reservoir has

39:22.694 --> 39:29.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dropped from its high point of
1,220 feet above sea level. Some
30 million people in

39:29.934 --> 39:36.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. rely on the water
system from the Western
reservoirs, from Arizona to
California

39:36.140 --> 39:41.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Mexico, and some of the
country's most productive
agricultural lands.

39:41.679 --> 39:46.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Already, communities have been
put on water restrictions. In
Las Vegas, you can not have

39:46.551 --> 39:51.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grass in your front yard. In Los
Angeles, water prices are going
up and watering is

39:51.656 --> 39:55.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
assigned to certain
days of the week.

39:55.994 --> 40:04.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the drought has had an
upside: It's made sights
accessible that were never seen
before.

40:04.936 --> 40:09.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because the water level is so
low now, these underwater
history hunters, who are just
recreational

40:09.741 --> 40:16.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
divers, are going to scuba dive
in Lake Mead to see a vintage
B-29 bomber from World War

40:16.714 --> 40:21.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
II that crashed in 1948. The war
was ending, but the bomber was
on a mission when it crashed

40:21.719 --> 40:25.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into the water at
230 miles an hour.

40:25.323 --> 40:29.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The crew survived, but the
bomber sank to the bottom.

40:29.360 --> 40:33.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICK SMITH, Diver: The
instrument they were testing was
considered secret, and so

40:33.364 --> 40:37.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
information about the crash,
although the locals kind of knew
about it, nobody really

40:37.468 --> 40:42.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
knew exactly where or what. The
information was considered
classified until 1998, when

40:42.006 --> 40:48.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was declassified. And then
divers began looking for it and
ultimately found it.

40:48.413 --> 40:53.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just a few years ago, the
average recreational scuba diver
couldn't visit this site.

40:53.051 --> 40:57.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA HUGHES: But the severe
drought level water means
recreational diver Cindy Shaw

40:57.188 --> 40:59.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
(ph) can now see the
wreck for herself

40:59.691 --> 41:02.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CINDY SHAW, Diver: I'm
just really jazzed.

41:02.727 --> 41:06.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SANDRA HUGHES: Joel
Silverstein's company has the
only Park Service permit to take
a

41:06.964 --> 41:13.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
limited number of divers to see
the sunken bomber. The National
Park Service wants to

41:13.037 --> 41:18.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
keep the location of the bomber
quiet. Very few people will get
to see what lies below

41:18.042 --> 41:21.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these waters.

41:21.879 --> 41:27.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's because it's been at the
bottom of Lake Mead for almost
70 years and is very

41:27.051 --> 41:33.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vulnerable. Three of the engines
flew off on impact. Still, there
is so much to see,

41:33.658 --> 41:38.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where the pilot sat, the control
panel. It's an underwater
chapter of history that cannot

41:38.629 --> 41:40.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be touched.

41:40.932 --> 41:44.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL SILVERSTEIN: Some of the
areas are actually made of
fabric and extremely thin
aluminum.

41:44.802 --> 41:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you could just touch it and
it could pop right in. And so
the goal is to not touch

41:48.239 --> 41:49.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it at all.

41:49.640 --> 41:52.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDRA HUGHES: What was
the best part about it?

41:52.276 --> 41:55.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CINDY SHAW: When we first
dropped down, you couldn't see
the whole plane this time. But

41:55.646 --> 42:01.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we dropped down by that tail.
And the tail is just -- it's
like 12 feet, 15 feet up.

42:01.853 --> 42:08.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then you look into the
cockpit and you see the pilot's
seat and the steering wheel

42:08.159 --> 42:11.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it's just like, oh, my gosh,
this is where those guys were
when this happened. It's so

42:11.596 --> 42:12.397 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cool.

42:12.397 --> 42:14.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDRA HUGHES: It's like
going back in time?

42:14.999 --> 42:19.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CINDY SHAW: It is. It's like
you're back there, and you're
not just on a plane wreck.
You're

42:19.837 --> 42:24.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
living part of like, wow, here
is where they had to climb out.
This is their legacy.

42:24.776 --> 42:30.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA HUGHES: Sometimes, dives
are murky because this is a
lake. Other times, the sun

42:30.681 --> 42:37.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shines bright enough to reveal a
view of the entire aircraft from
nose to tail.

42:37.221 --> 42:45.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The B-29 bomber is not the only
artifact that's been revealed by
receding waters. Lake Mead

42:45.163 --> 42:56.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a manmade reservoir, formed
after the Depression-era
construction of the Hoover Dam.
It was created

42:56.140 --> 42:59.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to help serve the Western
United States with water.

42:59.076 --> 43:08.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When the dam was completed in
1936, areas of Nevada and
Arizona were flooded to store

43:08.186 --> 43:13.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
water, burying entire towns
like St. Thomas, Nevada.

43:13.324 --> 43:16.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So where we're walking right
now, would we be underwater?

43:16.761 --> 43:18.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTIE VANOVER, National Park
Service: At certain points in
the reservoir's history,

43:18.896 --> 43:20.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this would be a point where
would be underwater.

43:20.965 --> 43:25.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA HUGHES: The ruins of what
was originally a Mormon outpost
created by Brigham Young

43:25.036 --> 43:30.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
himself have emerged. St. Thomas
started as a cotton farming
community.

43:30.274 --> 43:34.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is the tallest
structure that is left?

43:34.212 --> 43:37.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTIE VANOVER: That's right.
There were taller structures
that were constructed back

43:37.548 --> 43:41.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then, but this is the tallest
remaining structures. This wall
hasn't fallen yet. So, this is
kind

43:41.986 --> 43:45.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of iconic St. Thomas, and
it's the ice cream parlor.

43:45.990 --> 43:51.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA HUGHES: After the Mormons
moved out, prospectors and
outlaws moved in.

43:51.262 --> 43:54.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTIE VANOVER, Nevada: The
stories and the history that we
hear, that it was like

43:54.031 --> 43:59.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an Old West movie. It wasn't
necessarily safe. It was the
guys out here with their guns,

43:59.337 --> 44:01.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and there was some heavy
drinking. There was
prostitution. There was a mix of
things that

44:01.072 --> 44:03.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happened in this area.

44:03.407 --> 44:09.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA HUGHES: But by the early
1890s, a community had emerged.
Then, in 1936, the Hoover Dam

44:09.180 --> 44:11.182 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was completed.

44:11.182 --> 44:14.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTIE VANOVER: Most were
opposed to it. They weren't
looking forward to moving up

44:14.852 --> 44:17.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after everything they had
settled here, the community and
families that they had built

44:17.655 --> 44:21.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here, but some of them stayed
until the very last end.

44:21.025 --> 44:24.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA HUGHES: Then the water
came, and St. Thomas was no
more.

44:24.962 --> 44:27.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTIE VANOVER: Some of them
were stubborn and they didn't
want to go.

44:27.398 --> 44:33.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA HUGHES: People were paid
for their property, but not
their memories. And as this

44:33.004 --> 44:39.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drought continues and Lake Mead
recedes, more evidence of a long
buried era may yet be uncovered.

44:39.744 --> 44:52.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Sandy Hook in Lake Mead, Nevada.

44:52.089 --> 45:10.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight: Cue
the banjo, as two leading
entertainers make their first

45:10.207 --> 45:13.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
foray into musical theater.

45:13.511 --> 45:21.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We go back to Jeff, who has our
look at the Broadway-bound
"Bright Star."

45:21.752 --> 45:33.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A good story to
tell and to sing, that's the
idea behind "Bright Star,"

45:33.698 --> 45:39.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a new musical set in North
Carolina in the 1940s with
flashbacks to the 1920's.

45:39.437 --> 45:45.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Based on a true story, it
involves hidden identities,
youthful coming of age, tragedy

45:45.776 --> 45:51.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
along with humor, and, of
course, love lost and found. But
unlike most musicals, this

45:51.682 --> 46:01.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one features a bluegrass-style
band complete with banjo.

46:01.592 --> 46:06.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now at Washington, D.C.'s
Kennedy Center after an initial
run in San Diego, it's the
creation

46:06.063 --> 46:08.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Steve Martin and
Edie Brickell.

46:08.399 --> 46:14.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE MARTIN, "Bright Star": We
both grew up on musicals. We
love their emotion and

46:14.772 --> 46:20.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their melodies, and we got this
brain -- harebrained idea to
write one ourselves.

46:20.745 --> 46:22.980 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
JEFFREY BROWN:
Let's make a show.

46:22.980 --> 46:25.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDIE BRICKELL, "Bright Star": In
the tradition of the ones that
we love so much.

46:25.716 --> 46:28.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You didn't come
to it with much experience, or
any experience.

46:28.386 --> 46:33.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDIE BRICKELL: No, just a great
love. And I think, if you pay
attention to what you

46:33.357 --> 46:37.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
love and try to write the way
that you love, then maybe you
will come up with something

46:37.628 --> 46:41.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that you love and others
will love as well.

46:41.866 --> 46:47.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Steve Martin, now
70, is one of the most acclaimed
entertainers of our

46:47.872 --> 47:01.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
era, a comedian, actor, writer,
and banjo-playing musician.

47:01.085 --> 47:10.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Edie Brickell, 49, a veteran
singer-songwriter, first rose to
fame in the late 1980s for her

47:10.461 --> 47:21.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work with the folk rock band New
Bohemians. The two collaborated
on the 2013 Grammy-winning

47:21.305 --> 47:28.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
album "Love Has Come for You." A
follow-up, "So Familiar," the
basis for "Bright Star"

47:28.045 --> 47:30.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
came out this fall.

47:30.614 --> 47:37.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE MARTIN: And we have loved
really every minute of it.

47:37.121 --> 47:40.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At the Kennedy
Center recently, I asked how the
collaboration works.

47:40.858 --> 47:45.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDIE BRICKELL: Every way you can
imagine. But it started out with
Steve sending me his

47:45.096 --> 47:50.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
banjo tunes. And I would just
walk around my kitchen and sing
to them, until I -- until

47:50.634 --> 47:52.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a song emerged. And...

47:52.470 --> 47:55.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just walk
around in the kitchen?

47:55.106 --> 47:58.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDIE BRICKELL: It was like
somebody turned a projector on
in my mind. I would see images.

47:58.943 --> 48:02.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all I had to do was say what
it is that I saw and then make
it rhyme and have rhythm

48:02.813 --> 48:03.380 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and melody.

48:03.380 --> 48:04.882 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:04.882 --> 48:08.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you got to
have a musical theater with a
banjo in it?

48:08.385 --> 48:13.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE MARTIN: My part of the
song was written on the banjo.
And the banjo lays out a certain

48:13.891 --> 48:21.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way for the melodies to be
played. And -- but I also like
the sound of the banjo for this

48:21.432 --> 48:25.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
musical, because I find the
banjo very evocative. It's not a
bluegrass musical at all.

48:25.870 --> 48:32.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you combine the banjo with
the cello and the violin and the
viola, you have the

48:32.743 --> 48:35.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
punctuation of the banjo and
these long, long notes of the
strings, and I think it's a
really

48:35.780 --> 48:37.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
good sound.

48:37.348 --> 48:40.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What is it about
the banjo that you love?

48:40.918 --> 48:49.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE MARTIN: I find it to be
almost two things
simultaneously, very emotional
and melancholy

48:49.160 --> 48:59.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and, at the same time,
hard-driving and representing
incredible joy.

48:59.403 --> 49:12.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What was it like
for you to put these songs into
the characters' voices?

49:12.183 --> 49:17.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDIE BRICKELL: It's more fun for
me, because I have watched
people all my life. I'm not

49:17.488 --> 49:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a very good dinner companion,
because it's hard for me to pay
attention to the person

49:20.558 --> 49:22.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in front of me. I'm always
looking at other tables and
making up stories about people

49:22.927 --> 49:25.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
based on their body language.

49:25.329 --> 49:31.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just have always done
that. So, it's great to be given
the opportunity to let that

49:31.468 --> 49:39.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
side of my imagination come
forth and express what I believe
people are feeling and thinking.

49:39.376 --> 49:46.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Steve Martin has
written plays before, but a
musical, the mix of dialogue

49:46.550 --> 49:51.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and singing, how to convey the
story is a different matter.

49:51.055 --> 50:01.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE MARTIN: The rule that we
actually went in is, you can't
have two characters fall

50:01.198 --> 50:16.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in love and talk about it, and
then sing about the same thing.
That's really been fun to

50:16.981 --> 50:23.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do. It's really about listening
to the audience and trying to
fathom what they're
understanding,

50:23.354 --> 50:27.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what they're going through, what
they're liking, and what they're
maybe bored by.

50:27.491 --> 50:31.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This idea of
what's conveyed through
language, through words,
dialogue,

50:31.729 --> 50:37.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and what's conveyed through the
songs, so, falling in love
should happen during the song?

50:37.401 --> 50:41.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDIE BRICKELL: Well, I always
loved that you are 16 going on
17 song and that moment that

50:41.272 --> 50:42.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they're...

50:42.139 --> 50:44.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: "The
Sound of Music."

50:44.141 --> 50:46.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDIE BRICKELL: Yes. I love it.
That's the one that breaks my
heart, because it's so

50:46.010 --> 50:50.514 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
beautiful and so
sweet. I love it.

50:50.514 --> 50:56.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I woke up one morning
realizing, we need a song like
that. We need our 16 going

50:56.120 --> 51:00.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on 17 moment. And so those
little epiphanies helped direct
the sense of writing.

51:00.457 --> 51:05.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There is much
tenderness in "Bright Star." It
has a jarring tragedy at

51:05.162 --> 51:12.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its core, but also an almost
old- fashioned sweetness.

51:12.670 --> 51:21.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of our culture today is
not sweet. It's sort of crass
and crude, and it's certainly

51:21.712 --> 51:24.081 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
loud and fast.

51:24.081 --> 51:29.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE MARTIN: I think Edie and I
think alike in that regard, is
that want to -- wanted

51:29.386 --> 51:38.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make something that was
touching. And we have a very --
that's not to say it's
saccharine,

51:38.696 --> 51:41.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because we have a very
shocking ending to act one.

51:41.665 --> 51:46.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we both feel that the
shock value through language is
really not that shocking

51:46.270 --> 51:48.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
anymore at all.

51:48.973 --> 51:52.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDIE BRICKELL: I have grown
weary of the vulgarity in our
culture, and I wanted to respect
the

51:52.576 --> 51:58.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
innocence that I think still
exists and is alive in all of
us, just to honor it again

51:58.749 --> 52:04.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and revisit it, with joy and
adulthood. I don't think
adulthood means that you have

52:04.054 --> 52:07.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get crude and vulgar.

52:07.458 --> 52:12.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Comedian, actor,
novelist, playwright, musician,
now musical theater.

52:12.730 --> 52:16.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is this -- is it a
restless mind or is it...

52:16.266 --> 52:19.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE MARTIN: No, it's just -- I
think it's just one thing leads
to another. If you write

52:19.770 --> 52:23.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a play, you think, well, maybe I
can write a play with music, you
know?

52:23.674 --> 52:29.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: After its run at
the Kennedy Center, "Bright
Star" heads to Broadway in

52:29.380 --> 52:31.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
February.

52:31.348 --> 52:41.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Jeffrey Brown.

GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online: remembering the
archaeologist who devoted his
life to

52:59.209 --> 53:05.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the ancient city of Palmyra.
Khaled Al-Asaad was killed in
August by the Islamic State

53:05.115 --> 53:10.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after its forces took over the
city. A new poem celebrates his
work uncovering some of

53:10.087 --> 53:14.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Palmyra's greatest treasures.
