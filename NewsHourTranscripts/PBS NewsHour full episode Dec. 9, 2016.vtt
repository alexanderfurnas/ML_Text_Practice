JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.407 --> 00:10.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
President-elect
Trump pushes his priorities
while back on

00:10.611 --> 00:16.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the stump, eying another New
York investment
bank executive for a key
economic spot.

00:16.450 --> 00:22.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: the power of lies -- a
look at the rise
of fake stories on the Internet,
and their

00:22.222 --> 00:23.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very real consequences.

00:23.790 --> 00:24.758 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Then:

00:24.791 --> 00:25.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Get back!

00:25.792 --> 00:27.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Aye, ma'am!

00:27.594 --> 00:31.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Part two of our
series, looking
at the first generation of
Marine women who

00:31.899 --> 00:33.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want combat jobs.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Will they meet the standards and
pass the
tests?

00:35.669 --> 00:37.504 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT NELLER, Marine Corps
Commandant: It
doesn't matter who you are,
where you're from,

00:40.540 --> 00:42.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how much money you have got.

00:42.342 --> 00:48.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's two types of people in
combat, those
that can, and those that you
worry about.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.683 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's it.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

00:51.785 --> 00:56.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
analyze a week
of new names proposed for the
coming Trump

00:56.356 --> 00:59.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
administration, as they remember
John Glenn.

00:59.159 --> 01:06.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:06.700 --> 01:09.436 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:09.469 --> 01:18.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
president-elect has been
out and about again today,
taking his victory

01:18.845 --> 01:20.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
celebration to two more states.

01:20.981 --> 01:25.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, he's mulling
more names
for his administration.

01:25.585 --> 01:32.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was this
afternoon's
destination for the Trump thank
you tour.

01:32.326 --> 01:38.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He used it to stump for
Republican John Kennedy
in a U.S. Senate runoff election
tomorrow.

01:38.332 --> 01:41.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: If you
go to the polls, he's going to
win.

01:41.835 --> 01:44.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you don't go to the polls,
he's not going
to win.

01:44.171 --> 01:49.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if he doesn't win, I have
got myself a
problem in Washington, because
we have -- it's

01:49.376 --> 01:51.044 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pretty close.

01:51.078 --> 01:56.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A Kennedy win
would give the
GOP 52 seats in the Senate next
year.

01:56.516 --> 02:02.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump also met today with
the leader of
the Republican House majority,
Speaker Paul

02:02.289 --> 02:04.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ryan, before leaving New York.

02:04.091 --> 02:05.959 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: We
had a great meeting to talk
about our transition.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're very excited about getting
to work and
hitting the ground running in
2017 to put

02:10.063 --> 02:11.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this country back on track.

02:11.932 --> 02:16.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With that in
mind, the president-elect
is pressing to fill out his
Cabinet.

02:16.970 --> 02:22.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to reports today,
Representative
Cathy McMorris Rodgers of
Washington state

02:22.242 --> 02:27.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the choice for secretary of
the interior,
and the president of investment
bank Goldman

02:27.681 --> 02:32.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sachs, Gary Cohn, will head the
National Economic
Council.

02:32.152 --> 02:37.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He would be the third Goldman
alumnus in a
top Trump administration post.

02:37.958 --> 02:44.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But former New York Mayor Rudy
Giuliani removed
himself from consideration for
any post.

02:44.064 --> 02:47.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he wasn't interested in
anything other
than secretary of state.

02:47.567 --> 02:55.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I'm here today for
one main
reason: to say thank you to the
great, great

02:55.976 --> 02:57.511 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people of Iowa.

02:57.544 --> 02:59.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:59.346 --> 03:03.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last night, in
Des Moines,
the president-elect appeared
with his pick

03:03.917 --> 03:08.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for ambassador to China, Iowa
Governor Terry
Branstad.

03:08.355 --> 03:17.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: With Terry on our
side, I know
we will succeed in bringing our
jobs back.

03:17.964 --> 03:24.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I also know that China,
who's been so
tough and so competitive, and,
frankly, dealing

03:24.071 --> 03:29.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with people that didn't get it,
but I will
tell you what, we're going to
have mutual

03:29.409 --> 03:31.244 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
respect.

03:31.278 --> 03:35.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, Mr.
Trump indicated
today he may ban Pentagon
officials who work

03:35.148 --> 03:40.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on weapons programs from ever
taking jobs
with military supply companies.

03:40.654 --> 03:45.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, the president-elect's
focus is on
Grand Rapids, Michigan, the
fourth stop on

03:45.826 --> 03:48.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his so-called thank you tour.

03:48.829 --> 03:54.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also today, final figures showed
the Trump
campaign raised about $340
million for the

03:54.234 --> 03:56.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
primaries and the general
election.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton raised $580
million.

03:58.605 --> 04:04.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
White House announced
President Obama has ordered a
full review

04:04.211 --> 04:07.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of cyber-attacks during the
presidential campaign.

04:07.414 --> 04:12.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A number of Democrats have
complained that
Russian hacking was aimed at
aiding Donald

04:12.819 --> 04:14.521 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

04:14.554 --> 04:17.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a presidential spokesman
said this is
not an effort to challenge the
outcome of

04:17.624 --> 04:19.392 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the election.

04:19.426 --> 04:23.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Senate struggled today
to finish
a spending bill that would fund
the government

04:23.563 --> 04:25.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for four months.

04:25.232 --> 04:30.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coal state Democrats delayed the
measure,
as a federal shutdown loomed at
midnight.

04:30.470 --> 04:35.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They demanded that the bill
extend benefits
for retired coal miners for a
full year, while

04:35.775 --> 04:39.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans urged them accept a
shorter extension
for now.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.114 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: My
intention is that the miner
benefits not expire

04:43.383 --> 04:44.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at the end of April next year.

04:44.851 --> 04:48.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As I just said, I'm going to
work with my
colleagues to prevent that.

04:48.922 --> 04:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this is a good time to take
yes for an
answer.

04:52.459 --> 04:53.793 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:53.827 --> 04:54.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE MANCHIN (D), West Virginia:
We tried to
basically negotiate.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We tried to find compromise.

04:56.596 --> 04:58.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We tried to find a pathway
forward.

04:58.965 --> 05:02.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's been hard for me to see a
pathway forward
right now.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I'm going to have to oppose.

05:04.938 --> 05:09.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The bill would
keep the government
operating through late April.

05:09.843 --> 05:14.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president of South Korea was
impeached
and stripped of her powers
today.

05:14.581 --> 05:20.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Park Geun-hye is implicated in
an influence-peddling
scandal that's brought millions
of people

05:20.353 --> 05:21.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into the streets.

05:21.855 --> 05:25.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our chief foreign affairs
correspondent, Margaret
Warner, has the story.

05:25.392 --> 05:30.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Roars of
celebration erupted
in Seoul as news of the
impeachment reached

05:30.864 --> 05:32.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the streets.

05:32.666 --> 05:37.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thousands of protesters had
camped outside
Parliament, anticipating the
vote to strip

05:37.037 --> 05:39.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Park of her powers.

05:39.439 --> 05:44.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It won support from both the
opposition and
Park's own party, leaving her to
accept the

05:44.444 --> 05:46.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inevitable.

05:46.313 --> 05:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PARK GEUN-HYE, South Korea
President (through
translator): I deeply apologize
to our citizens

05:50.150 --> 05:54.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for causing such a big national
confusion
amid national security and
economic concerns

05:54.854 --> 05:56.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
due to my carelessness.

05:56.590 --> 06:01.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Park's
impeachment is the
culmination of a months-long
scandal that

06:01.995 --> 06:04.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sparked enormous public outcry.

06:04.698 --> 06:10.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It stems from accusations that
she granted
special favors and access to
Choi Soon-sil,

06:10.637 --> 06:12.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a longtime confidant.

06:12.505 --> 06:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's also accused of arranging
for Choi to
receive classified documents.

06:16.977 --> 06:22.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Choi has been indicted on
charges of using
her influence to bully
businesses into donating

06:22.282 --> 06:26.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nearly $70 million to her
charity.

06:26.119 --> 06:30.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Park denies any
criminal wrongdoing,
but her standing in public
opinion polls has

06:30.991 --> 06:33.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
plunged to just 4 percent.

06:33.893 --> 06:38.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The drama has raised concerns
that North Korea,
with its active nuclear weapons
development

06:38.932 --> 06:44.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
program, might try to take
advantage of political
troubles in the South, where
nearly 30,000

06:44.170 --> 06:45.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. troops are stationed.

06:45.972 --> 06:47.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK TONER, State Department
Spokesman: We're
going to continue to meet all
our alliance

06:47.841 --> 06:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commitments, especially with
respect to defending
against the threats we have seen
emanating

06:52.912 --> 06:54.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from North Korea.

06:54.714 --> 06:58.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: For now,
President Park's
duties will fall to the prime
minister, while

06:58.084 --> 07:04.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Korea's constitutional
court decides
whether to uphold her ouster.

07:04.190 --> 07:06.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

07:06.793 --> 07:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A Dutch court
convicted anti-Islam
lawmaker Geert Wilders of hate
speech today.

07:13.300 --> 07:19.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The judges found Wilders
illegally targeted
the Moroccan minority in the
Netherlands with

07:19.039 --> 07:22.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insults, and incited others to
discriminate
against them.

07:22.809 --> 07:25.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wilders called the verdict
totally insane.

07:25.679 --> 07:31.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His party narrowly leads in
polls ahead of
national elections next March.

07:31.151 --> 07:36.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, thousands of civilians
fled the
fighting in Eastern Aleppo, as
the army closed

07:36.289 --> 07:38.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the noose on rebel fighters.

07:38.425 --> 07:41.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Heavy air bombardment and ground
fighting
raged again.

07:41.594 --> 07:47.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syrian military officials
claimed that they
now control about 85 percent of
the rebel

07:47.100 --> 07:48.968 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
enclave.

07:49.002 --> 07:53.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the U.N. General
Assembly approved
a nonbinding resolution
demanding an immediate

07:53.406 --> 07:55.141 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cease-fire.

07:55.175 --> 08:00.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The World Anti-Doping Agency
reports that
Russian cheating on drug tests
is even more

sweeping than already known.

08:02.515 --> 08:08.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Findings released today say it
involves more
than 1,000 Russian athletes in
more than 30

08:08.121 --> 08:09.889 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sports.

08:09.923 --> 08:14.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The agency concludes that the
cheating and
cover-up go back to at least
2011, and the

08:14.227 --> 08:19.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
report's author says that Russia
corrupted
the 2012 London Olympic Games on

RICHARD MCLAREN, Report Author:
For years,
international sports
competitions have been

08:24.237 --> 08:27.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hijacked by the Russians.

08:27.140 --> 08:31.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coaches and athletes have been
playing on
an uneven field.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sports fans and spectators have
been deceived.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's time that stops.

08:37.550 --> 08:43.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The head of
Russia's Anti-Doping
Commission called the report out
of date,

08:43.623 --> 08:48.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pointing to reforms taken since
the cover-up
was first discovered.

08:48.128 --> 08:53.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, a federal
jury in Charleston,
South Carolina, watched the
videotaped confession

08:53.333 --> 08:55.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Dylann Roof.

08:55.201 --> 09:00.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The self-described white
supremacist is accused
of shooting nine black church
members to death

09:00.240 --> 09:02.108 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in June 2015.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The FBI recorded the confession.

09:04.778 --> 09:10.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On it, Roof says: "I had to do
it because
somebody had to do it."

That sweeping recall of Takata
air bag inflators
will end up affecting 42 million
vehicles

09:16.122 --> 09:17.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the U.S.

09:17.791 --> 09:21.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration
issued the new projection today.

09:21.895 --> 09:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also said that only 12.5
million of the
inflators have been replaced so
far.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The devices can explode with too
much force
and spew metal shards.

09:31.971 --> 09:35.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Wall Street rallied again
for more record
closes.

09:35.175 --> 09:40.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 142
points to finish near 19757.

09:40.647 --> 09:45.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 27, and the S&amp;P
500 added
13.

09:45.785 --> 09:52.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the real-world
effects of fake news stories
online; a boot

09:52.692 --> 09:57.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
camp where female recruits
seeking combat
jobs must meet the same
standards as men;

09:57.964 --> 10:03.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the housing crisis that
contributed to the
Oakland warehouse fire; plus,

10:13.713 --> 10:18.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and David Brooks analyze a full
week of news.

10:18.718 --> 10:23.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was a week where the
problems of so-called
fake news, often just a name for
an out-and-out

10:23.323 --> 10:30.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lie or unproven claim, were
evident once again,
and this time led to alarming
consequences.

10:30.997 --> 10:36.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan joins us from
our New York
studio tonight with a look at
the latest concerns

10:36.069 --> 10:38.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the beginning of a periodic
series on the
subject.

10:38.972 --> 10:43.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Viral
conspiracy theories
masquerading as news spread at
incredible

10:43.977 --> 10:48.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speeds throughout the election
cycle across
social platforms like Facebook,
Reddit, Twitter

10:48.715 --> 10:55.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and 4chan, but on December 4
came a very real
measure of their impact.

10:55.088 --> 10:59.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A 28-year-old man from North
Carolina man
entered Comet Ping Pong pizza in
Washington,

10:59.959 --> 11:04.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
D.C., armed with an assault
rifle, claiming
he wanted to -- quote --
"self-investigate"

11:04.397 --> 11:06.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a fast-spreading theory.

11:06.699 --> 11:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Edgar Maddison Welch, seen here
with his arms
up, was intrigued by the totally
false conspiracy

11:12.205 --> 11:17.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
theory that the pizzeria was
part of a child
abuse ring led by Hillary
Clinton and her

11:17.577 --> 11:19.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
former campaign manager.

11:19.646 --> 11:23.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After aiming at an employee and
discharging
a weapon, he surrendered to
authorities.

11:23.816 --> 11:26.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Luckily, everyone inside escaped
unharmed.

11:27.020 --> 11:31.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, more fallout from
what has been
dubbed as Pizzagate: The Trump
transition

11:31.558 --> 11:36.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
team removed Michael Flynn Jr.,
the son of
the man president-elect Trump
wants as his

11:36.129 --> 11:41.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national security adviser, after
it became
clear that Flynn Jr. was
retweeting this and

11:41.868 --> 11:44.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other conspiracies.

11:44.504 --> 11:49.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, herself the
target of other
lies spread over the Web
repeatedly, weighed

11:49.075 --> 11:51.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in during one of her few public
appearances
since the election.

11:51.844 --> 11:55.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, Former
U.S. Secretary
of State: It's now clear that
so-called fake

11:55.315 --> 11:59.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
news can have real-world
consequences.

11:59.085 --> 12:02.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This isn't about politics or
partisanship.

12:02.956 --> 12:07.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lives are at risk, lives of
ordinary people
just trying to go about their
days, to do

12:07.694 --> 12:10.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their jobs, contribute to their
communities.

12:10.597 --> 12:14.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Technology
companies like
Facebook and Google say they are
working to

12:14.767 --> 12:17.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tackle the proliferation of fake
news.

12:17.937 --> 12:22.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One way has been to decrease the
incentives
for advertising that appears on
these sites.

12:22.642 --> 12:25.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sheryl Sandberg, the COO of
Facebook, on Thursday's
"Today Show":

12:25.912 --> 12:29.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, Facebook:
We have taken
important steps, but there is a
lot more to

12:29.248 --> 12:31.017 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that people don't want
to see hoaxes
on Facebook and we don't want to
see hoaxes

12:33.620 --> 12:35.321 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Facebook.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: According to a
BuzzFeed
News investigation, many fake
news sites are

12:38.491 --> 12:44.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
built purely for profit,
sometimes even created
by opportunistic teens in
far-off places like

12:44.197 --> 12:49.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Macedonia, regardless of the
content, because
more clicks lead to more
dollars.

12:49.402 --> 12:54.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is motivating the rise of
fake news,
and what tools are tech
companies developing

12:54.273 --> 12:56.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to stop its spread?

12:56.042 --> 12:59.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As part of a series of
conversations, I'm
joined by Marc Fisher of The
Washington Post,

12:59.846 --> 13:05.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who wrote one of the deeper
dives into how
this baseless story spread so
fast and how

13:05.284 --> 13:07.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it almost ended in tragedy.

13:07.120 --> 13:11.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marc, this is one of the first
stories that
I think drew a connection for
people that

13:11.090 --> 13:13.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
virtual hoaxes have real-world
consequences.

13:13.826 --> 13:15.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARC FISHER, The Washington
Post: Well, they
absolutely do.

13:15.628 --> 13:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we saw this when a gunman
walked into
the pizza place that was the
subject of this

13:20.667 --> 13:27.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
false rumor about a supposed sex
ring that
Hillary Clinton and John
Podesta, her campaign

13:27.040 --> 13:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chairman, were running in a
residential neighborhood
pizza place in Washington, D.C.

13:31.978 --> 13:36.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we were able to do was
to kind of
trace this back to patient zero,
looking back

13:36.249 --> 13:39.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to, how did this spread and why
did it spread?

13:39.485 --> 13:44.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And what we found was a
combination of people
who had a profit motive and
people who were

13:44.090 --> 13:49.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really quite innocently running
across this
story and deciding that it was
concerning

13:49.095 --> 13:51.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to them and they wanted to know
more about
it.

13:51.297 --> 13:54.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's one of
the things
people are going to wonder
about.

13:54.300 --> 13:57.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you not see the falsehood
in this?

13:57.537 --> 13:59.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Or how do you press share?

13:59.439 --> 14:03.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or how do you end up kind of
perpetrating
this lie further and further?

14:03.943 --> 14:05.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What were the answers that
people were giving
you?

14:05.745 --> 14:09.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC FISHER: You know, I think
there is a
tendency to dismiss the people
who spread

14:09.882 --> 14:15.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these stories as uneducated or
simply not
understanding the technology
they're dealing

14:15.388 --> 14:16.355 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Anything but the case.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They tend to be quite educated
people.

14:19.258 --> 14:22.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They tend to be people who are
very well-connected
online.

14:22.862 --> 14:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what they're stumbling into
sometimes,
first of all, there's kind of a
loss of trust.

14:28.201 --> 14:32.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you look at the whole
diminution of
trust across society about
government, about

14:32.872 --> 14:37.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the news media, people are
looking for alternative
ideas and alternative sources.

14:37.810 --> 14:42.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why they are open to
these kinds of
stories that they find online.

14:42.148 --> 14:46.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, once they find them,
what I found
in talking to the people who
spread the message

14:46.185 --> 14:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most widely is that they were
kind of caught
up in the fun of this.

14:50.456 --> 14:55.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To them, it was kind of a game,
a serious
game, because they thought they
were saving

14:55.061 --> 15:00.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children who were being held in
this underground
sex ring, but kind of a game,
where they were

15:00.133 --> 15:02.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really enjoying the hunt.

15:02.802 --> 15:08.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that thrill of the chase is
really very
similar to what's most
satisfying about doing

15:08.641 --> 15:11.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
journalism, but without the
responsibility
part.

15:11.277 --> 15:16.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the part where they
say, well -- you
know, it's reminiscent of what
Silicon Valley

15:16.449 --> 15:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
executives used to say years
ago, that the
Internet is a self-correcting
mechanism.

15:21.120 --> 15:25.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of the people who were
involved in this
believe that, and they're really
not keeping

15:25.725 --> 15:30.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it front of mind the real-world
damage, such
as a gunman showing up to
conduct his own

15:30.963 --> 15:32.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation.

15:32.732 --> 15:35.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what
you're kind of
describing is almost a
large-scale game of

15:35.601 --> 15:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Clue" being played by thousands
of people.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm aging myself with the
reference to that
game.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But tell us a little bit more
about the people
who are doing this for a profit
motive.

15:42.341 --> 15:44.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARC FISHER: Well, there is that
side of things.

15:44.844 --> 15:48.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so some people are doing it
for political
reasons and some people are
doing it for profit.

15:48.815 --> 15:55.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you find some of these -- an
extraordinary
amount of the traffic online
about Pizzagate,

15:55.354 --> 16:00.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this rumor, was going through
odd places,
Vietnam, Macedonia.

16:00.660 --> 16:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's going on there is that
people are setting
up sites and setting up bots,
which are essentially

16:07.900 --> 16:14.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
algorithms that are used to
spread a message
or to retweet something many,
many times.

16:14.140 --> 16:19.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they do this because the
more they can
get people coming to their site,
the more

16:19.979 --> 16:24.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advertising revenue they get
from the big
social media companies.

16:24.650 --> 16:31.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is a profit that can be
made by taking
something, however fantastic or
incredible,

16:31.791 --> 16:36.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and putting it out there in such
a way that
it goes viral, and then all of
that Web traffic,

16:36.429 --> 16:39.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of those clicks turn out to
-- translate
into dollars.

16:39.398 --> 16:43.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, just
recently, Facebook
and Google tried to take a
little bit of those

16:43.936 --> 16:46.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dollar incentives away from
these fake news
sites.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, other than that, what else
are they doing?

16:48.941 --> 16:50.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What else can they do?

16:50.209 --> 16:52.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARC FISHER: Well, they can do a
lot more
than they're doing.

16:52.578 --> 16:56.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reason we're able to say
that is,
we look across the ocean to
Europe, where

16:56.148 --> 17:02.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are doing more, under
pressure from governments
there that don't have our same
system of First

17:02.255 --> 17:07.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amendment guarantees and don't
have the kind
of freedom that our Internet
companies have

17:07.994 --> 17:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a result of the exemption
that absolves
them from responsibility for the
content that

17:13.933 --> 17:15.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they have on their sites.

17:15.534 --> 17:18.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's from the 1996
Telecommunications Act.

17:18.437 --> 17:23.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Europe, without those legal
strictures,
there is a different kind of
legal system

17:23.242 --> 17:29.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
involved where these companies
are now being
required to remove derogatory
material about

17:29.181 --> 17:31.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people from their sites.

17:31.117 --> 17:32.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're having to do that.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they clearly know how to do
that.

17:34.553 --> 17:39.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They choose not to in this
country, in part
because it's very expensive to
have editors

17:39.258 --> 17:44.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and producers going through and
making sure
that the material that is on
their site is

17:44.196 --> 17:45.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
responsible.

17:46.032 --> 17:50.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Internet companies tend to
say, that is
not our responsibility, this is
purely a matter

17:50.336 --> 17:54.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for the users to express
themselves however
they wish.

17:54.407 --> 17:58.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you think about the rest
of our economy,
there is no other product, there
is no other

17:58.277 --> 18:03.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
news product or even physical
product where
the maker says, we have no
responsibility

18:03.950 --> 18:05.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for what we make.

18:05.551 --> 18:07.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is just the nature of our
commerce.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We expect companies that produce
things to
take responsibility.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, how does
it change the
landscape of journalism?

18:13.626 --> 18:18.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is definitely a line of
thought that
says just by us labeling this --
quote, unquote

18:18.531 --> 18:22.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "fake news," instead of
outright lies or
conspiracy theories, that we're
elevating

18:22.768 --> 18:25.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it to a status of respect and
credibility
that it doesn't deserve.

18:25.438 --> 18:30.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the idea of yellow
journalism has
existed since the late 1800s.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It helped us get into the
Spanish-American
War.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARC FISHER: Sure.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And conspiracy theories have
been around since
the dawn of civilization.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's biblical admonitions
against them.

18:41.220 --> 18:44.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that's always been there,
probably
always will be.

18:44.123 --> 18:49.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the problem is not really
the fake news
or the speech itself.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The problem is the way it's
being spread.

18:51.297 --> 18:56.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's being spread more quickly
and more widely
through technology than ever
before.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the part that we
haven't gotten
a handle on.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, what is the role for
traditional journalism?

19:00.840 --> 19:06.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, fact-checking,
obviously trying
to build up our credibility, so
that people

19:06.746 --> 19:10.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do see that there are places
that can be trusted.

19:10.049 --> 19:15.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we do happen to live in a
time when trust
is at a relative low.

19:15.721 --> 19:20.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have seen this in periods
of economic
trouble and political trouble in
our country,

19:20.359 --> 19:25.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after the Kennedy assassination
and now after
the 2008 crash.

19:25.264 --> 19:30.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, during those periods,
people do look
for alternative sources, and
that's what's

19:30.469 --> 19:32.271 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happening now.

19:32.304 --> 19:34.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Marc Fisher of
The Washington Post, one of many
conversations

19:34.707 --> 19:36.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we will be having on this topic.

19:36.509 --> 19:42.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thanks so much for joining us.

19:42.782 --> 19:46.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARC FISHER: Thank you.

19:46.986 --> 19:53.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last night, we
introduced you
to three female pioneers, young
women who

19:53.192 --> 19:58.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are trying to enter the newly
opened combat
positions in the U.S. Marine
Corps.

19:58.297 --> 20:02.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These roles had been blocked to
women for
generations, but not anymore.

20:02.701 --> 20:07.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question now, will they meet
the same
rigorous standards as men to
serve on the

20:07.673 --> 20:09.208 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
front lines?

20:09.241 --> 20:13.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Producer Dan Sagalyn and
correspondent William
Brangham continue our story.

20:14.013 --> 20:21.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Eighteen-year-old Rebekah
Wolff is three weeks into Marine
Corps boot

20:21.420 --> 20:25.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
camp at Parris Island, South
Carolina.

20:25.891 --> 20:30.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's one of the few young women
who want
to enter the combat positions
that for years

20:30.229 --> 20:32.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have been shut to women.

20:32.231 --> 20:36.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She wants to be an air defense
gunner, to
shoot Stinger missiles.

20:36.268 --> 20:40.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, first, it's the basics of
knife-fighting.

20:40.172 --> 20:47.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Hey, we see how slashing
that partner
right down the center of their
chest, right?

20:47.313 --> 20:48.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARINE RECRUITS: Yes, sir!

20:48.314 --> 20:49.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Vertical slash!

20:49.615 --> 20:52.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: These early
weeks of boot
camp are tough.

20:52.151 --> 20:54.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Recruits are still getting used
to the rigors
of Marine training.

20:54.987 --> 20:59.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't sleep much, and many
haven't been
away from home for this long.

20:59.358 --> 21:02.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Recruit Wolff admits she's
having a hard time.

21:02.061 --> 21:04.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I know it's still early in your
training.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you feel like you're
doing?

21:05.531 --> 21:10.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REBEKAH WOLFF, Marine Corps
Recruit: I feel
like I could do better.

21:10.769 --> 21:17.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was a lot better at home,
probably because
I get a lot more sleep and I eat
a lot more

21:17.710 --> 21:19.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than what I do here.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What have you
been telling
mom and dad back home?

21:21.347 --> 21:26.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBEKAH WOLFF: In all honesty, I
tell my mom
and dad that I want to come home
and that

21:26.552 --> 21:27.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I can't wait to see them.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: If you could
choose, would
you go home right now?

21:30.256 --> 21:31.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REBEKAH WOLFF: No, sir.

21:31.757 --> 21:34.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I came here to become a Marine.

21:34.426 --> 21:36.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm going to leave as a
Marine.

21:36.395 --> 21:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We met two
other female
recruits who also want to go
into these newly

21:41.233 --> 21:43.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
opened combat positions.

21:43.969 --> 21:47.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twenty-one-year-old Victoria
Golab-Meyer wants
to be a combat engineer.

21:47.173 --> 21:49.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VICTORIA GOLAB-MEYER, Marine
Corps Recruit:
And the fact that there's so
many women now

21:49.608 --> 21:56.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are excited to try it and
know that women
have a place somewhere, it's
worth fighting

21:56.682 --> 21:58.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for, to say the least.

21:58.617 --> 22:03.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And
18-year-old Lacey Elkins
wants to operate a tank or an
amphibious assault

22:03.556 --> 22:05.257 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vehicle.

22:05.291 --> 22:09.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LACEY ELKINS, Marine Corps
Recruit: I like
to experience new things, and I
don't like

22:09.094 --> 22:10.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
being comfortable.

22:10.095 --> 22:12.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Comfortable just kind of sets
you nowhere.

22:12.231 --> 22:17.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As we reported
previously,
the Marines didn't want women
serving in certain

22:17.603 --> 22:22.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
combat positions, arguing it
would make them
a less effective fighting force.

22:22.107 --> 22:24.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they were overruled by the
secretary of
defense.

22:24.977 --> 22:30.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the Marines say orders are
orders, and
they're now working hard to
integrate women.

22:30.282 --> 22:35.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing they have done is to
establish physical
standards for each combat
position, and they

22:35.221 --> 22:39.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are the same for men and women,
one standard
that everyone has to meet.

22:39.925 --> 22:41.427 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

22:41.460 --> 22:43.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT NELLER, Marine Corps
Commandant: This
is physically demanding stuff.

22:43.462 --> 22:46.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, we're talking carrying
heavy loads.

22:46.732 --> 22:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're not riding around.

22:47.800 --> 22:48.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We're walking.

22:48.801 --> 22:51.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Marine Corps infantry is
light infantry.

22:51.403 --> 22:53.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And the load is heavy.

22:53.472 --> 22:57.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: General Robert
Neller is
the commandant of the Marine
Corps, the service's

22:57.576 --> 22:59.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
highest military officer.

22:59.578 --> 23:04.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says equal standards for men
and women
is an important step to making
integration

23:04.917 --> 23:05.884 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.686 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT NELLER: It doesn't matter
who you are,
where you're from, how much
money you have

23:09.989 --> 23:12.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
got, the color of your skin,
your religion.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.493 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Nobody cares.

23:14.526 --> 23:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's two types of people in
combat, those
that can, and those that you
worry about.

23:21.166 --> 23:22.901 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's it.

23:22.935 --> 23:27.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And if women
pass those
standards and meet all those
requirements,

23:27.172 --> 23:28.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you're not worried about them?

23:28.173 --> 23:29.141 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

23:29.174 --> 23:30.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT NELLER: No.

23:30.175 --> 23:31.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're Marines.

23:31.176 --> 23:32.144 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Do your job.

23:32.177 --> 23:34.046 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CODY MORRIS, Marine Corps: How
quickly you
move directly translates to
their survivability.

23:35.748 --> 23:39.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Combat veteran
Sergeant
Cody Morris oversees basic
warrior training

23:39.852 --> 23:41.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Parris Island.

23:41.253 --> 23:45.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says equal standards are
crucial, but he
worries they won't last.

23:45.958 --> 23:51.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He echoed a concern we heard
from many, that
if enough women don't pass these
standards,

23:51.297 --> 23:52.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they will be lowered.

23:52.531 --> 23:54.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

23:54.233 --> 23:56.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CODY MORRIS: I guarantee the
transition and
them being able to mesh together
would be

23:56.802 --> 24:01.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot easier if we knew that,
oh, you completed
a 20-mile hike with this much
weight and this

24:01.707 --> 24:02.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much time?

24:02.708 --> 24:03.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So did I.

24:03.909 --> 24:05.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what matters most to
the people
that I know.

24:05.678 --> 24:08.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It isn't so much that you're a
male and I'm
a female and you're this and
you're that.

24:08.747 --> 24:13.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's that the mission is hard,
and I need
everybody to be able to
accomplish it, and

24:13.118 --> 24:15.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not just to meet some diversity
criteria.

24:15.087 --> 24:20.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We talked with
some current
Marines and some former Marines
who say, OK,

24:20.059 --> 24:23.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these jobs are now open to
women, and that
somewhere down the road there's
going to be

24:23.529 --> 24:29.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some pressure brought to bear on
the Corps
to lower those standards to
guarantee that

24:29.435 --> 24:31.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more women get into these jobs.

24:31.537 --> 24:32.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that going to happen?

24:32.538 --> 24:33.505 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT NELLER: Not on my watch.

24:35.374 --> 24:39.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have heard the secretary of
defense and
the secretary of the Navy say,
we're not going

24:39.278 --> 24:40.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to lower the standard.

24:40.279 --> 24:42.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have established the
standards.

24:42.614 --> 24:44.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They know what the standards
are.

24:44.316 --> 24:49.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if any standard we set was
causing high
attrition or high injury rate of
anybody,

24:49.121 --> 24:50.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then that's probably something
you want to
look at.

24:50.789 --> 24:52.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, right now, that's not the
case.

24:52.758 --> 24:57.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So far, of the
12,000 women
who've enlisted in the Marines
in the last

24:57.563 --> 25:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three years, only 150 have
chosen to apply
for these combat jobs.

25:01.934 --> 25:07.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And of those, only 53 about, one
in three,
passed these tougher standards.

25:07.973 --> 25:11.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rest failed, dropped out or
are still
in training.

25:11.643 --> 25:15.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More broadly, women also get
injured more
often than men at boot camp, and
they drop

25:15.948 --> 25:19.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out at double the rate of men.

25:19.318 --> 25:25.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To some, this is all evidence
that putting
women into combat roles is a bad
idea.

25:25.157 --> 25:28.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Retired Colonel Mary Reinwald
spent 27 years
in the Marines.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She now edits "Leatherneck"
magazine, a magazine
for the Marine community.

25:31.997 --> 25:33.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

25:33.799 --> 25:35.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY REINWALD (RET.), Marine
Corps: Women
break, physically break down at
a much greater

25:35.768 --> 25:37.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
level than our male
counterparts.

25:37.536 --> 25:38.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's just reality.

25:38.737 --> 25:42.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can a -- women carry the same
load as a man?

25:42.141 --> 25:47.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And loads in Iraq and
Afghanistan were as
much as 70, 80 pounds, if not
more, depending

25:47.112 --> 25:48.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on what the mission was.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's the
full battle gear.

25:49.114 --> 25:50.482 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

25:50.516 --> 25:52.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY REINWALD: That's the full
battle gear,
and more in some cases.

25:52.718 --> 25:56.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, how long would I have
lasted with
something like that, again, as
much heart

25:56.155 --> 25:57.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as I may have had?

25:57.656 --> 25:58.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that's really not the issue.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's, when did my body start to
break down?

26:00.459 --> 26:01.427 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.228 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATE GERMANO (RET.), Marine
Corps: I would
say that if there's one woman
out of 1,000

26:05.063 --> 26:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who can make that move and move
into the ground
combat job, then why should she
be denied

26:10.068 --> 26:11.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that opportunity?

26:11.870 --> 26:14.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Retired
Lieutenant Colonel
Kate Germano commanded the
female battalion

26:14.807 --> 26:20.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Parris Island, but she was
fired in 2015
for creating a -- quote --
"hostile command

26:20.045 --> 26:21.213 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
climate."

26:21.246 --> 26:24.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says she was pushing to
improve recruit
training.

26:24.082 --> 26:29.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says the reason so many
women drop out
and so many fail to pass the new
combat standards

26:29.888 --> 26:34.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that the Marines haven't
raised the bar
high enough for women.

26:34.193 --> 26:40.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you would argue that it's
lowered expectations
of women over the years that has
driven this

26:40.933 --> 26:45.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disparity, not some inherent
inability on
behalf of women?

26:45.070 --> 26:46.038 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

26:46.071 --> 26:47.539 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

26:47.573 --> 26:49.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATE GERMANO: Absolutely,
absolutely lowered
expectations for females.

26:49.241 --> 26:52.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I would say is that
there is a lot
of data to support that
conclusion.

26:52.845 --> 26:58.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As proof,
Germano says she
was able to dramatically improve
female marksmanship

26:58.450 --> 26:59.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Parris Island.

26:59.451 --> 27:00.419 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.287 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

27:02.321 --> 27:05.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATE GERMANO: We were able to
take an initial
qualification rate of 67 percent
for the women,

27:05.257 --> 27:08.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compared to high 80s and 90
percent for male
workers.

27:08.961 --> 27:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were able to take that low
percentage and
bring it to right under 92
percent in less

27:14.466 --> 27:15.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than a year.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that was not through any
extra training.

27:18.337 --> 27:24.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It wasn't through any
pre-recruit training,
screening.

27:24.076 --> 27:29.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was strictly through changing
the expectation
that women could shoot and that
they should

27:29.448 --> 27:31.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be expected to shoot well.

27:31.483 --> 27:35.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Germano says
those high
expectations should trickle down
to better

27:35.854 --> 27:40.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conditioning of recruits before
boot camp,
like we saw Rebekah Wolff doing
here this

27:40.559 --> 27:44.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
summer, as well as recruiting
stronger women
to begin with.

27:44.263 --> 27:45.230 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

27:45.264 --> 27:46.632 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAJ.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA MANESS, Marine Corps: We
have to look
for a better product.

27:48.467 --> 27:53.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America has to look and give us
what we're
looking for here, and that's a
college athlete.

27:53.238 --> 27:57.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Sergeant Major
Angela Maness,
the highest ranking enlisted
officer at Parris

27:57.709 --> 28:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Island, says the Marines are
setting high
standards and have started a new
initiative

28:02.314 --> 28:03.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to recruit stronger women.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.418 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAJ.

28:06.451 --> 28:08.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA MANESS: So, when we have
a solid foundation
coming here already, with muscle
already attached

28:08.987 --> 28:13.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to her body, it's not going to
be that difficult
to get her trained to the level
that we need

28:13.926 --> 28:15.694 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her.

28:15.727 --> 28:18.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A few weeks
after we first
met the three recruits, we
checked back at

28:18.564 --> 28:19.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
boot camp.

28:19.731 --> 28:22.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, something is different since
the last
time I saw you.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LACEY ELKINS: Yes, I became a
United States
Marine.

28:25.437 --> 28:26.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Congratulations.

28:26.438 --> 28:28.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LACEY ELKINS: Thank you.

28:28.206 --> 28:34.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Private 1st
Class Lacey
Elkins passed her combat fitness
test with

28:34.746 --> 28:35.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
flying colors.

28:35.981 --> 28:37.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She got some of the highest
scores of her
platoon.

28:37.849 --> 28:44.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She will now train to operate
amphibious assault
vehicles.

28:44.122 --> 28:48.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And after completing the
grueling two-day
crucible at the end of boot
camp, Private

28:48.727 --> 28:52.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Victoria Golab-Meyer received
her Marine insignia.

28:52.431 --> 28:57.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In this emotional ceremony, she
officially
becomes a U.S. Marine.

28:57.369 --> 29:03.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She also passed her combat
fitness test and
will move on to be a combat
engineer.

29:04.009 --> 29:11.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But recruit Rebekah Wolff still
had to pass
her test, and today is the
make-or-break day.

29:11.316 --> 29:16.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To get into her chosen combat
job, she has
to run half-a-mile in a certain
period of

29:16.355 --> 29:22.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
time, press a 30-pound
ammunition can over
her head at least 60 times in
two minutes.

29:22.861 --> 29:30.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right after, there's a timed
course that involves
crawling on all fours, running
with 60 pounds

29:30.702 --> 29:38.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of weight in her hands, and
carrying another
recruit on her back, all this
against the

29:38.276 --> 29:39.244 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
clock.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Wolff didn't make it.

29:40.445 --> 29:48.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her scores were close, but not
good enough.

29:48.587 --> 29:53.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three weeks later, Wolff still
graduated and
became a U.S. Marine, but she's
now been assigned

29:53.725 --> 30:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a different non-combat
position.

30:01.600 --> 30:05.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead of shooting Stinger
missiles, she
will be coordinating the
movement of equipment,

30:05.570 --> 30:07.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
supplies and people.

30:07.939 --> 30:13.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Parris Island, South
Carolina.

30:13.445 --> 30:19.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And William joins
me now.

30:19.051 --> 30:22.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William, a remarkable story
here.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's talk about Rebekah Wolff.

30:23.388 --> 30:25.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She goes through boot camp.

30:25.123 --> 30:26.091 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She finishes.

30:26.124 --> 30:27.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She graduates.

30:27.125 --> 30:29.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But she doesn't qualify for
combat.

30:29.594 --> 30:30.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How disappointed was she?

30:30.996 --> 30:33.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Initially, she
was very,
very disappointed.

30:33.165 --> 30:36.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The day that she failed, she was
crushed.

30:36.301 --> 30:38.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now she says she's not so
crushed.

30:38.503 --> 30:43.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's important to say Rebekah
missed this
test by just a hair.

30:43.108 --> 30:46.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In those drills that we saw her
doing, that
ammo can lift, where she has to
lift the weight

30:46.945 --> 30:49.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over her head, she missed it by
one.

30:49.147 --> 30:52.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That long, extended race at the
end, she missed
that by 22 seconds.

30:52.951 --> 30:58.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, and then also, 10 days
hater, after that
test, she was back home, out of
boot camp.

30:58.156 --> 31:02.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She was diagnosed with
bronchitis and said
she had been feeling sick all
along.

31:02.360 --> 31:06.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, she was disappointed
initially, but now
she's a Marine.

31:06.398 --> 31:09.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's proud to have gotten
through boot camp,
which is no small feat in and of
itself.

31:09.735 --> 31:13.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she is going to go on and is
being trained
in North Carolina right now.

31:13.071 --> 31:15.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the Marines
don't care
if you're sick, right?

31:15.607 --> 31:18.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Marine
ethos is, suck
it up.

31:18.443 --> 31:23.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Basically, if you're feeling
crummy, you're
not feeling so good, life is
hard, boot camp

31:23.715 --> 31:25.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is hard, tough it out.

31:25.617 --> 31:31.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So this entire
exercise, allowing
women to qualify for combat in
the Marines,

31:31.656 --> 31:35.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
this was ordered by the
secretary of defense
under President Obama.

31:35.360 --> 31:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know very well that Donald
Trump has expressed
a different point of view.

31:39.164 --> 31:47.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His incoming defense secretary,
General James
Mattis, is not a believer in
women in combat.

31:47.038 --> 31:48.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is expected here?

31:48.240 --> 31:50.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, how much could this
whole thing change?

31:50.075 --> 31:51.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's the
$64,000 question.

31:51.877 --> 31:55.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think all the women who are in
the Marine
Corps and the Marine community
more broadly

31:55.347 --> 31:57.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are looking very closely at what
is going
to happen.

31:57.482 --> 32:02.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you said, the secretaries of
defense under
Obama pushed this order, and
they pushed it

32:02.220 --> 32:04.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against the resistance of the
Marine Corps.

32:04.790 --> 32:06.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now we have a new secretary
of secretary
of defense.

32:06.992 --> 32:11.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what one orders, another one
can just
simply do away with.

32:11.363 --> 32:16.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you know, General James
Mattis is
himself going to be a former
Marine.

32:16.701 --> 32:19.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has been very strongly
against this position.

32:19.704 --> 32:22.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He thinks it is weakening the
Marine Corps.

32:22.073 --> 32:28.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He likened it to asking a
football team to
suddenly take on 10, 15, 20
percent female

32:28.647 --> 32:31.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
players and go ahead and play.

32:31.082 --> 32:34.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he says you could imagine
everyone would
laugh at that idea, but that's
what you're

32:34.486 --> 32:36.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
asking the Marine Corps to do.

32:36.054 --> 32:38.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, he's very strongly against
it.

32:38.156 --> 32:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And whether he overturns or not,
it's still
not clear, but he is not a fan.

32:42.127 --> 32:46.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally, you
talked to
so many women who were going
through boot

32:46.531 --> 32:48.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
camp, William.

32:48.233 --> 32:52.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think their reaction
would be
if the Defense Department says,
we're going

32:52.838 --> 32:55.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to undo the -- or the Marines,
if the Marines
undo this?

32:55.707 --> 32:58.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I think there
would be an
enormous amount of
disappointment amongst

32:58.877 --> 33:01.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the female recruits and now the
female Marines
that we spoke to.

33:01.713 --> 33:03.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think they went into it.

33:03.682 --> 33:04.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They want to serve their
country.

33:04.950 --> 33:07.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They saw this as a final barrier
that was
breaking.

33:07.485 --> 33:10.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they were deeply proud to
take on these
jobs.

33:10.856 --> 33:14.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People who are outside of the
Marine Corps,
for instance, Lieutenant Colonel
Kate Germano,

33:14.759 --> 33:18.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who we talked to in our report,
she said,
if they were to do this -- and
they're not

33:18.563 --> 33:22.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure that they're going to -- it
would be
a huge blow to the morale of
women.

33:22.734 --> 33:27.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would reinforce the idea, she
says, that
exists in some corners of the
Marine Corps

33:27.939 --> 33:30.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that women are second-class
citizens.

33:30.642 --> 33:34.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Others think they're probably
not going to
want to take this fight on, they
will simply

33:34.813 --> 33:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let the standards stay high, and
that not
that many women will make it
through, and

33:39.651 --> 33:41.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the policy will just
continue.

33:41.586 --> 33:47.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's just
been a remarkable
look inside something that we
really almost

33:47.225 --> 33:50.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
never get a chance to see.

33:50.161 --> 33:51.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know we're going to
continue to follow
this.

33:51.963 --> 33:53.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham, thank you.

33:53.732 --> 33:58.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thank you.

33:58.703 --> 34:08.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A week after the
deadly fire
at an artists warehouse space in
Oakland,

34:08.513 --> 34:13.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California, known as the Ghost
Ship killed
36 people, fire departments
around the country

34:13.818 --> 34:17.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are investigating so-called
live-work spaces.

34:17.222 --> 34:21.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are places often inhabited
by artists
and low-income residents.

34:21.593 --> 34:27.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's ever less affordable
housing today
in many metro areas, pushing
people to new

34:27.232 --> 34:29.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
measures and extremes.

34:29.301 --> 34:32.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And again to Hari, who's been
working with
our team on this story.

34:33.004 --> 34:38.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RACHEL SAXER, Artist: Everybody
is watching
us in all the other cities.

34:38.376 --> 34:40.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's like becoming a national
crisis.

34:40.412 --> 34:44.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In art
warehouses across
Oakland, people are anxious
their way of life

34:44.916 --> 34:46.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is under threat.

34:46.351 --> 34:50.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RACHEL SAXER: All the survivors
live warehouses
or occupy warehouses.

34:50.422 --> 34:54.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're all grieving, and
people who are
survivors are now at risk for
losing their

34:54.426 --> 34:56.294 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
home.

34:56.328 --> 34:58.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Fears of a
backlash from
city inspectors and property
owners are beginning

34:58.863 --> 35:00.732 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to materialize.

35:00.765 --> 35:05.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA SCRIVANI, Artist: This
week, my leaseholder
told me the landlord was scared
of people

35:05.203 --> 35:09.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
living in our space and has
asked anybody
living there to move out by
January 3.

35:10.008 --> 35:13.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Painter and
photographer
Angela Scrivani has been living
and working

35:13.511 --> 35:16.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this Oakland art studio for
the past eight
years.

35:16.915 --> 35:21.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's asking city officials to
differentiate
between a dwelling that's unsafe
vs. one that's

35:21.886 --> 35:23.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just not permitted properly.

35:23.688 --> 35:26.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA SCRIVANI: A lot of the
spaces that
I have been in where we didn't
pull permits

35:26.558 --> 35:32.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to build the areas in which we
live and work,
we built them to code.

35:32.364 --> 35:41.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's such a desperate situation
that we were
willing to take the risk and
hoped that it

35:41.106 --> 35:42.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wouldn't come to this.

35:42.941 --> 35:46.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Oakland is not
alone in
cracking down on buildings not
zoned for residents.

35:46.845 --> 35:53.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
L.A., Dallas, Nashville and New
Haven have
all put landlords and tenants on
notice to

35:53.284 --> 35:57.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clear out buildings that might
be substandard
living conditions.

35:57.455 --> 36:00.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Baltimore is taking it a step
further.

36:00.425 --> 36:05.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Que Pequeno is a multimedia
artist.

36:05.497 --> 36:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had been living in this
building known
as the Bell Foundry until
earlier this week.

36:09.434 --> 36:13.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Monday, the city evicted him
and nine other
artists without warning.

36:13.138 --> 36:16.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUE PEQUENO, Artist: Bell
Foundry is just
an example of what's going to
happen to, like,

36:16.775 --> 36:21.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more spaces like this, in
Baltimore -- not
only in Baltimore, but, like, in
different

36:21.279 --> 36:22.747 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cities.

36:22.781 --> 36:25.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Artists could
live, work
and party at the Bell Foundry.

36:25.283 --> 36:29.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was also a sanctuary for the
LGBTQ community
and artists of color, according
to Pequeno.

36:30.021 --> 36:34.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUE PEQUENO: My next move,
hopefully, is to
find a new safe space for black
and brown

36:34.192 --> 36:37.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
artists, for black and brown
people in Baltimore,
from Baltimore.

36:37.362 --> 36:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Bell
Foundry was never
zoned for residential use, and
it was unsafe,

36:42.634 --> 36:47.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
according to Kathleen Byrne, who
is responsible
for permits and code enforcement
in Baltimore's

36:47.305 --> 36:49.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
housing department.

36:49.074 --> 36:50.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN BYRNE, Baltimore
Housing Department:
It was an accident waiting to
happen.

36:50.775 --> 36:55.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were tons of flammables
and combustibles,
as well as debris located.

36:55.180 --> 36:58.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it just -- it warranted
imminent danger.

36:58.616 --> 37:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it wasn't just a matter of
not getting
the proper permit.

37:02.120 --> 37:05.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even with the
wakeup call
in Oakland, these safety issues
are nothing

37:05.957 --> 37:07.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
new for Baltimore.

37:07.826 --> 37:11.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN BYRNE: It's probably
every code enforcement
official's worst nightmare, what
happened

37:11.963 --> 37:13.164 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Oakland.

37:13.198 --> 37:17.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But these are things that we
deal with on
a daily basis.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're just not in the public
eye.

37:18.937 --> 37:21.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Bell
Foundry's closure
has put other Baltimore artists
on high alert

37:21.473 --> 37:23.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that their spaces could be
targeted.

37:23.508 --> 37:25.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
®MD-BO /STEWART WATSON, Area 405:
I'm terrified.

37:25.043 --> 37:27.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I feel like someone's going to
take it away.

37:27.078 --> 37:32.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stewart Watson
owns Area
405, a massive mixed-use space
converted from

37:32.150 --> 37:34.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a 19th century factory.

37:34.452 --> 37:37.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Watson spent 14 years getting
the building
up to code.

37:37.388 --> 37:39.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEWART WATSON: The sprinkler
system happened
pretty quickly.

37:39.757 --> 37:45.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The firewalls and the stairwells
was within
the first couple of years.

37:45.230 --> 37:47.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the other things have taken
time.

37:47.565 --> 37:52.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, updating electrical
and things like
that has taken -- has taken a
long time.

37:52.871 --> 37:56.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's a
process, she says,
must be done to keep artists
safe.

37:56.474 --> 38:10.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEWART WATSON: Not providing
safety for the
people who entrust their lives
to you is unconscionable.

38:10.255 --> 38:14.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People trust me with their
lives, and I don't
take that lightly.

38:14.092 --> 38:18.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Because many
artists lack
the resources to operate safe
spaces, the

38:18.863 --> 38:23.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Greater Baltimore Cultural
Alliance advocates
on their behalf.

38:23.101 --> 38:24.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Executive director Jeannie Howe:

38:24.869 --> 38:26.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEANNIE HOWE, Executive
Director, Greater
Baltimore Cultural Alliance: One
of the most

38:26.104 --> 38:28.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
frequent calls we get is a
search for space
of some kind.

38:28.773 --> 38:35.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have put together a
couple of tools
that help match folks with
available space.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We value this community
tremendously.

38:37.615 --> 38:42.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We value these artists and we
value their
contributions to the city.

38:42.387 --> 38:44.289 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
.

38:44.322 --> 38:49.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Robbie Kowal
has been producing
major outdoor music parties in
San Francisco

38:49.694 --> 38:51.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for 19 years.

38:51.629 --> 38:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says that if cities are
serious about retaining
their artists, they need to
recognize that

38:55.900 --> 38:57.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
art spaces are critical.

38:57.635 --> 39:01.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBBIE KOWAL, Concert Promoter:
These warehouse
spaces are the only places where
they can

39:01.806 --> 39:07.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
afford to not only live, but pay
that second
rent to actually have a studio
to create their

39:07.345 --> 39:09.180 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

39:09.214 --> 39:12.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And he warns
that regulatory
effort could drive artists into
more dangerous

39:12.083 --> 39:13.318 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
spaces.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBBIE KOWAL: Artists will find
another place
to make art.

39:15.420 --> 39:20.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I would just advise the
public officials
to concentrate on harm reduction
over code

39:20.825 --> 39:21.793 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
compliance.

39:21.826 --> 39:22.794 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

39:22.827 --> 39:24.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a very big difference.

39:24.696 --> 39:27.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's what
San Francisco
does when it comes to regulating
live performance

39:27.198 --> 39:28.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
spaces.

39:28.466 --> 39:30.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jocelyn Kane heads the city's
Entertainment
Commission.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOCELYN KANE, San Francisco
Entertainment
Commission: We are much safer
than other cities,

39:33.071 --> 39:36.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where people are somewhat scared
to come to
government.

39:36.241 --> 39:42.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have tools that we use in
our toolbox
to allow people to consider
using, like, an

39:42.180 --> 39:46.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out-of-the-box crazy space to do
an event
that would be unique or
different.

39:47.018 --> 39:50.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we can sort of guide
them through
in a way that feels safe to
them.

39:50.388 --> 39:54.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Kane says that
since many
artists rely on income from live
performances,

39:54.659 --> 39:58.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's important they have easy
access to spaces
where they can safely host these
events.

39:59.030 --> 40:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOCELYN KANE: I'm sitting in
City Hall.

40:01.399 --> 40:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm a part of government, and
I'm trying to
be an advocate as much as
possible, within

40:05.837 --> 40:08.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the confines of what we call
responsible hospitality.

40:08.640 --> 40:13.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stewart
Watson, owner of
Area 405 in Baltimore, hopes
more artists

40:13.711 --> 40:16.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will also be able to invest in
safe spaces.

40:16.314 --> 40:18.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEWART WATSON: I want artists
to buy places.

40:18.850 --> 40:21.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I want them to fix them.

40:21.219 --> 40:27.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't want them to think that
living in
places that are not fixed up is
OK.

40:27.992 --> 40:31.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And that's
just what Que
Pequeno is climbing toward.

40:31.462 --> 40:34.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

40:34.766 --> 40:46.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to the
analysis of Shields
and Brooks.

40:46.044 --> 40:50.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

40:51.349 --> 40:54.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, let's talk about the Trump
Cabinet.

40:54.052 --> 40:58.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that Rudy Giuliani's
out, took himself,
they said, out of consideration.

40:58.056 --> 41:05.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have got several names,
Mark, of people
who are in at Labor, at the EPA,
HUD, Housing

41:05.363 --> 41:10.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Urban Development, Small
Business, and
they all seem to be people who
don't necessarily

41:10.902 --> 41:15.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agree with what the mission of
these agencies
has been during the Obama
administration.

41:15.406 --> 41:17.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are we to make of them?

41:17.108 --> 41:22.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: We have to make of
them they're
very personal choices by Donald
Trump.

41:22.947 --> 41:29.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ben Carson is a world-renowned
pediatric neurosurgeon,
400 surgeries a year.

41:29.954 --> 41:31.189 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Surgeon General?

41:31.222 --> 41:32.190 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

41:32.223 --> 41:34.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Housing and Urban Development.

41:34.092 --> 41:36.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he's owned several houses.

41:36.227 --> 41:37.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's lived in a house.

41:37.228 --> 41:38.529 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:38.563 --> 41:41.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't know what
the other
qualifications are.

41:41.833 --> 41:50.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Particularly interesting to me
was, after
he met -- the president-elect
with Al Gore,

41:50.108 --> 41:54.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
probably the most prominent
environmental
voice in the entire Democratic
Party, he then

41:54.512 --> 42:00.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chose the Oklahoma attorney
general, Scott
Pruitt, to be director of the
Environmental

42:00.551 --> 42:01.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Protection Agency.

42:01.853 --> 42:04.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think protection is a key word
there.

42:04.455 --> 42:11.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you think of pristine
preservation
of America, you immediately
think of Tulsa

42:11.562 --> 42:12.530 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Oklahoma.

42:12.563 --> 42:13.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:13.564 --> 42:14.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Be careful, my
birthplace.

42:14.565 --> 42:15.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:15.700 --> 42:16.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I know it's your
birthplace,
Judy.

42:16.567 --> 42:17.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But let's be very frank about
it.

42:17.568 --> 42:19.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It hasn't -- it's not a vanguard
state.

42:19.737 --> 42:23.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not a forefront state in
environmental
protection.

42:23.875 --> 42:31.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a state that has been very
big on fracking,
that has had 907 earthquakes in
the last year,

42:31.249 --> 42:38.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is more than they had in
the last 35
years, under fracking, a
3.0-magnitude.

42:38.089 --> 42:44.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would say, if he's not a
denier of climate
change, then Attorney General
Pruitt is certainly

42:44.295 --> 42:45.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a serious skeptic.

42:45.930 --> 42:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I don't know if there's a
pattern here.

42:49.267 --> 42:50.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Maybe David can figure it out.

42:50.334 --> 42:51.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pattern?

42:51.402 --> 42:52.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I rise to the
defense of Oklahoma.

42:52.336 --> 42:53.304 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:53.337 --> 42:54.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

42:54.338 --> 42:56.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm glad to have one of you.

42:56.040 --> 42:57.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And it's exactly
the sort of
coastal condescension toward the
beauties

42:57.442 --> 43:01.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Tulsa that has created the
Trump phenomenon
in the first place.

43:01.078 --> 43:05.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, agencies and these
issues, whether
it's environmental or labor
issues, they have

43:05.249 --> 43:07.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- it's a tradeoff.

43:07.118 --> 43:11.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Democrats in environmental
agencies tend
to favor -- be more sensitive to
environmental

43:11.589 --> 43:12.857 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
harm.

43:12.890 --> 43:15.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Republicans tend to be more
sensitive
to business harm.

43:15.259 --> 43:17.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I don't know if they're
going against
the mission of the agencies.

43:17.094 --> 43:20.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just a different set of
priorities, and
it's legitimate.

43:20.064 --> 43:25.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has picked the more
extreme versions
of all Republicans so far, the
more aggressive.

43:25.470 --> 43:30.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the thing to watch
out for is,
I could totally paint a scenario
where Trump

43:30.608 --> 43:32.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
runs an authoritarian regime.

43:32.477 --> 43:36.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can totally paint a scenario
where he has
no control over his own
government.

43:36.781 --> 43:39.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's in part because of
his attention
span problems, but in part
because running

43:40.017 --> 43:41.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an agency is very hard.

43:41.752 --> 43:44.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cabinet secretaries often have
no control
over their agency.

43:44.822 --> 43:49.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it becomes doubly hard when
you're really
out of opinion with the people
who actually

43:49.660 --> 43:51.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
work in the agency.

43:51.562 --> 43:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it becomes triply hard, as I
think may
happen, a lot of people will
leave the government.

43:54.899 --> 43:58.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of people in a
lot of these
sorts of places that are
weighing, do I really

43:59.003 --> 44:00.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want to serve here?

44:00.404 --> 44:02.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have certainly heard from
people who
say, I really don't.

44:02.406 --> 44:06.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, I'm a career person, I
respect the political
process, but I just don't feel
comfortable

44:06.110 --> 44:07.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
working here anymore.

44:07.111 --> 44:08.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It's a reasonable
point.

44:08.412 --> 44:11.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do want to say one thing about
the secretary
of labor.

44:11.048 --> 44:15.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just wish once, when they pick
a secretary
of labor, they would say, gee,
who's the best

44:15.887 --> 44:17.355 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
boss in America?

44:17.388 --> 44:19.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who has great relations?

44:19.056 --> 44:20.124 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:20.157 --> 44:22.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He runs two,
what, food companies.

44:22.293 --> 44:30.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He runs -- no, and
he's been
-- his relations with workers
are not a hallmark

44:30.034 --> 44:31.035 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of his career.

44:31.068 --> 44:34.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's been very successful in
maximizing profit.

44:34.672 --> 44:38.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is no particular
encomiums to him
about...

44:38.709 --> 44:41.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We should say,
his name is
Andy Puzder.

44:41.712 --> 44:44.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Andy Puzder -- to
his relationship
with his workers.

44:44.782 --> 44:49.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aaron Feuerstein, who was head
of Malden Mills
at Lawrence, Massachusetts, when
the mill

44:49.520 --> 44:54.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
burned down, the first thing he
did was to
keep all his employees on the
payroll for

44:54.525 --> 44:56.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
60 days while he rebuilt on the
spot.

44:56.193 --> 44:58.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't take the insurance or
go offshore.

44:58.563 --> 45:07.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or Dan Price in Seattle at

who cut his own salary by 90
percent to give

45:07.238 --> 45:10.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everybody a 70 percent --
$70,000 minimum
wage.

45:10.408 --> 45:15.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, just once, I would like
to have somebody
who says, I really do care about
workers.

45:16.013 --> 45:24.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Puzder has been very
successful franchising
Hardee's and Carl's Jr., but
there's no particular

45:24.455 --> 45:27.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
record of his consideration or
concern for
workers.

45:27.625 --> 45:31.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, the other
point that
was made about Linda McMahon,
who was chosen

45:31.796 --> 45:34.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for the Small Business
Administration, she's
a billionaire with her husband.

45:34.765 --> 45:38.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They were wrestling --
professional wrestling
entrepreneurs.

45:38.102 --> 45:42.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the question is, there
are now four
or five billionaires in the
Trump Cabinet.

45:43.007 --> 45:45.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do we think that's just the way
it's going
to be?

45:45.643 --> 45:49.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, he likes his
fellow billionaires,
assuming he is one.

45:49.547 --> 45:53.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think, generally, populist
movements
don't -- are not against
billionaires.

45:53.317 --> 45:55.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are not against self-made
billionaires
in particular.

45:55.720 --> 46:00.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're certainly not -- the
Trump movement
is certainly not hostile to
professional wrestling.

46:00.291 --> 46:05.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they tend to be suspicious
is professionals
and what they see as the
managerial class.

46:05.262 --> 46:09.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if he picked a lot of people
who went
to Harvard Law School, worked in
the academy,

46:09.400 --> 46:12.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worked in the media, then I
think his supporters
would be restless.

46:12.903 --> 46:18.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they're not -- they're
sensitive to people
they think are looking down upon
them, basically

46:18.943 --> 46:20.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the professional class.

46:20.845 --> 46:24.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I don't think it's
entirely inconsistent
that -- or out of spirit of his
movement to

46:24.949 --> 46:26.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have these Linda McMahon-type
people.

46:26.817 --> 46:28.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark?

46:28.586 --> 46:32.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Ike had nine
millionaires and
a plumber in his Cabinet, Martin
Durkin, the

46:32.757 --> 46:33.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president of a plumbers union.

46:33.991 --> 46:35.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Eisenhower.

46:35.559 --> 46:37.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Eisenhower did.

46:37.628 --> 46:39.630 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
It is.

46:39.664 --> 46:45.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the -- Goldman Sachs is
probably over-represented,
considering it was part of the
vast conspiracy

46:45.169 --> 46:49.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Hillary Clinton to rob the
United States
of its sovereignty, according to
candidate

46:49.540 --> 46:51.108 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

46:51.142 --> 46:56.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now he's finding that
they're a personnel
supplier for his administration.

46:56.313 --> 47:00.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The other thing
we saw a little
bit more of this week, David,
was this continuation

47:00.685 --> 47:08.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Donald Trump tweeting
criticism of Boeing
aircraft over the cost, what he
says may be

47:08.426 --> 47:13.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the cost overrun for the new Air
Force One,
and then getting into a spat
with a local

47:13.597 --> 47:17.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
union president in Indiana who
had said, you
know, you're not really going to
be saving

47:17.702 --> 47:20.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as much jobs at the Carrier
Corporation as
you said you were.

47:20.905 --> 47:22.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

47:22.873 --> 47:25.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A friend of mine who's a
political strategist
in town said to me, you know,
half my conversations

47:25.242 --> 47:29.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are about the dissent of fascism
in America,
and maybe that is going to
happen, and then

47:29.480 --> 47:33.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
half are normal policy
discussions about how
to reform health care.

47:33.284 --> 47:37.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the Trump administration
could go off
in both directions.

47:37.188 --> 47:40.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We could be seeing something
entirely new,
something entirely
authoritarian, something

47:40.591 --> 47:44.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that looks more like Ukraine or
Russia than
anything we're used to seeing
here.

47:44.528 --> 47:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these tweets are to me one
of the telltale
signs of whether we're going off
in that direction.

47:49.133 --> 47:54.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he's just tweeting about a
union guy, then
he's just being the bully we
have seen.

47:54.105 --> 48:00.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if he uses the power of the
presidency
to back up some of those tweets
and he's really,

48:00.478 --> 48:05.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really coming down with a hammer
on people
he doesn't like using the power
of the presidency,

48:05.249 --> 48:07.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then we're seeing something very
new and very
different.

48:07.218 --> 48:09.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's too soon to tell
whether he is going
to start doing that, but that,
to me, would

48:09.920 --> 48:12.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be an indicator of something
very troubling,
if he does that as president.

48:12.656 --> 48:14.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you see?

48:14.558 --> 48:18.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Well,
cyber-bullying, the emphasis
on bullying here, going after
Chuck Jones,

48:18.395 --> 48:23.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president of Local 1999 of
the Steel Workers,
is punching down.

48:23.734 --> 48:29.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's somebody in a powerful,
omnipotent position
punching somebody who's a lot
less important,

48:29.573 --> 48:36.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and putting them not only as the
object of
ridicule, but open threats that
Chuck Jones

48:36.247 --> 48:40.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has received as a consequence of
the president
doing this -- president-elect
doing this.

48:40.351 --> 48:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he just doesn't seem to
grasp or understand,
Mr. Trump, the majesty and the
power of the

48:47.124 --> 48:49.026 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
office.

48:49.059 --> 48:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Bob Dallek, the
presidential historian,
very respected, said that this
behavior is

48:55.933 --> 48:58.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
beneath the dignity of the
office.

48:58.068 --> 48:59.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it really is.

48:59.937 --> 49:05.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think he grasps it
and understands
it, the Boeing thing being one
example, where

49:05.676 --> 49:09.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you can move stock by just an
idle comment.

49:09.513 --> 49:11.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it's intimidating.

49:11.315 --> 49:12.449 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's silencing.

49:12.483 --> 49:14.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a chilling effect.

49:14.518 --> 49:16.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's decidedly
unpresidential.

49:16.120 --> 49:17.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, go ahead.

49:17.855 --> 49:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: To a lot of
people, it just
seems like an active presidency,
like he's

49:20.591 --> 49:22.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being active on behalf of the
American people.

49:22.560 --> 49:28.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do think, oh, the Carrier
thing, I hated
it as a policy matter, but at
least he's hammering

49:28.232 --> 49:29.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- he's saving jobs.

49:29.233 --> 49:30.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's doing stuff.

49:30.234 --> 49:31.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama never did any of this
stuff.

49:31.702 --> 49:33.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
People have a different
conception of what
the presidency should be.

49:33.571 --> 49:35.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: But it isn't
Carrier.

49:35.039 --> 49:36.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm talking about tweeting.

49:36.040 --> 49:37.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

49:37.842 --> 49:39.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I'm talking about
tweeting against
an individual and holding that
individual

49:39.743 --> 49:44.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- like Jeff Zeleny of CNN,
terrific reporter,
holding him up to ridicule for
doing his job.

49:44.481 --> 49:47.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and in
connection with
that, I want to ask you quickly,
we did a

49:48.018 --> 49:52.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
segment, Hari did an interview
about this
earlier in the show, Mark, about
the -- we

49:52.890 --> 49:54.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
call it fake news.

49:54.692 --> 49:57.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we were just sitting here
saying that
doesn't do justice to what's
been going on.

49:57.161 --> 49:58.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Lying.

49:58.162 --> 49:59.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's lies that
are out there.

49:59.163 --> 50:00.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Right.

50:00.164 --> 50:01.999 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

50:02.032 --> 50:03.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Flynn --
General Michael
Flynn, who has been chosen to be
the president's

50:03.868 --> 50:08.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national security adviser, his
son was actively
tweeting, repeating some of
these stories

50:08.539 --> 50:14.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that were completely false about
a pizza place
in Washington being a place
where there was

50:14.778 --> 50:21.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a pedophile ring going on
involving Hillary
Clinton and her chief of staff.

50:21.151 --> 50:25.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A man from North Carolina --
this was all
in the news last week -- comes
to Washington

50:25.256 --> 50:27.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with a gun, shoots it inside.

50:27.458 --> 50:29.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a family place.

50:29.493 --> 50:34.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It's a family
place, where -- Comet
Ping Pong, where -- pizza --
where my 10-year-old

50:34.865 --> 50:40.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
granddaughter, Frances (ph), I
attended her
10th birthday party there
recently in the

50:40.271 --> 50:42.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
back room with the ping-pong.

50:42.273 --> 50:45.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It very much of a family -- it
has great pizza.

50:45.542 --> 50:46.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a very popular place.

50:46.944 --> 50:49.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a total fabrication.

50:49.513 --> 50:50.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's worse than a fabrication.

50:50.981 --> 50:53.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a slur and a libel.

50:53.250 --> 50:58.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This -- Alex Jones is involved
in this, the
radio personality, talks about
Hillary Clinton

50:58.956 --> 51:00.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
murdering young children.

51:00.391 --> 51:01.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

51:01.525 --> 51:03.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I mean, it just
has to be confronted.

51:03.394 --> 51:07.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought Marc Fisher did a
great job
in The Washington Post, and he
with his interview

51:07.965 --> 51:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with Hari, in shooting it down.

51:10.034 --> 51:13.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you have got to spend all
your time
shooting this stuff down,
Judy...

51:13.203 --> 51:15.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

51:15.072 --> 51:20.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Somebody wrote a story about me
where I allegedly
called for Donald Trump's
assassination.

51:20.377 --> 51:27.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was a long 1,500-word,
very carefully
written piece of reportage,
where I allegedly

51:27.051 --> 51:29.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gave an interview to a radio
station that
doesn't exist.

51:29.687 --> 51:34.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was like being in a
different, alternative
-- alternative universe in a
novel, like some

51:34.525 --> 51:39.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other novel, when, suddenly, the
effects come
back and hit me in real life.

51:39.063 --> 51:43.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's troubling is the
professionalism
with which it's done and how
distrust of the

51:43.200 --> 51:47.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
media then leads to this extreme
naivete,
where people will believe
anything.

51:47.071 --> 51:48.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

51:48.939 --> 51:52.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're all used to
people stretching
the truth in what we do in
journalism, but

51:52.309 --> 51:54.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's just -- it's beyond the
pale.

51:54.545 --> 51:56.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Just 40 seconds left, Mark.

51:56.447 --> 52:00.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Glenn, we lost a great
American hero
yesterday.

52:00.517 --> 52:02.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What did he represent to this
country?

52:02.519 --> 52:08.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Twenty-three years
as a Marine
jet pilot, combat pilot, 149
missions in two

52:08.692 --> 52:13.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wars, first American to orbit
the Earth, at
a time when the United States
was feeling

52:14.031 --> 52:17.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- more than that, it gave the
country a lift.

52:17.668 --> 52:22.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, most of all, all he was
about, he was
everything that he seemed to be
and more.

52:22.973 --> 52:24.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was the genuine article.

52:24.742 --> 52:32.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The thing, Judy, to remember
about John Glenn
is that he had had the ultimate
in praise

52:32.483 --> 52:33.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and national attention.

52:33.917 --> 52:35.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He was an icon.

52:35.285 --> 52:37.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All he wanted to do -- he didn't
need validation.

52:37.588 --> 52:38.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He didn't need an ego fix.

52:38.989 --> 52:40.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All he wanted to do was public
service.

52:40.524 --> 52:41.492 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And he did it.

52:41.525 --> 52:43.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he was a great senator and a
great American.

52:51.535 --> 52:53.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

about war have changed over the
last 20 years.

And that's the "NewsHour" for
