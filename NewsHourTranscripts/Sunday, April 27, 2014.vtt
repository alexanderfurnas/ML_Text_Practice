THEY'VE BEEN LOCKED OUT OF THI

08:11.633 --> 08:13.467
MARKET BY VARIOUS THINGS AND ONE

08:13.467 --> 08:15.800
THING THEY'VE BEEN LOCKED OUT IS

08:15.800 --> 08:18.467
BY A TIGHT LENDING STANDARD AN

08:18.467 --> 08:19.300
WE'RE HEARING ABOUT CREDIT

08:19.300 --> 08:22.167
EASING AND IT'S STILL PRETTY

08:22.167 --> 08:23.967
DARN TOUGH TO GET ONE.

08:23.967 --> 08:25.767
ALSO, THEY'RE BEING LOCKED OUT

08:25.767 --> 08:27.567
BY HIGH PRICES AND INVENTORIES

08:27.567 --> 08:29.767
ARE PRETTY LOW SO PRICES ARE

08:29.767 --> 08:30.800
GETTING BID UP

08:30.800 --> 08:32.633
A LOT OF BUYERS ARE MILLENNIAL

08:32.633 --> 08:34.300
AND IF YOU'RE PAYING OFF STUDENT

08:34.300 --> 08:36.600
DEBT THAT'S VIFRPA YOU WILLY THE

08:36.600 --> 08:37.500
EQUIVALENT OF A MORTGAGE PAYMENT

08:37.500 --> 08:39.333
AND SO IT'S HARD TO TAKE O

08:39.333 --> 08:40.633

UKRANIAN HIGH CULTURE WA

17:06.033 --> 17:08.733
SOMETHING THAT WAS PRIZED IN THE

17:08.733 --> 17:10.367
SOVIET PERIOD.

17:10.367 --> 17:13.767
IT WAS A MIX BETWEEN RUSSIAN

17:13.767 --> 17:15.767
KIND OF LOOKING DOWN ON TH

17:15.767 --> 17:17.667
UKRAINIANS AS THEIR LITTLE

17:17.667 --> 17:19.233
BROTHERS AND AT THE SAME TIM

17:19.233 --> 17:20.567
CELEBRATING THE HIGH CULTURE

17:20.567 --> 17:21.467
PARTICULARLY IN THE SOVIET

17:21.467 --> 17:21.833
PERIOD

17:21.833 --> 17:23.900
>> WHEN THE SOVIET UNION CAM

17:23.900 --> 17:26.167
APART IN THE '90s UKRAINE BECAME

17:26.167 --> 17:27.133
AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY

17:31.900 --> 17:33.633
IN THE SOVIET PERIOD LOTS OF

17:33.633 --> 17:35.133
PEOPLE STUDIED IN MOSCOW AND

17:35.133 --> 17:38.867
THEN WERE SENT TO OTHE

17:38.867 --> 17:40.100
REPUBLICS AND THEY MET SPOUSES

17:40.100 --> 17:42.067
THERE AND PUT DOWN ROOTS AND

17:42.067 --> 17:43.667
THIS WAS A COMMON WAY FO

17:43.667 --> 17:45.667
RUSSIANS AND UKRAINIANS GIVE

17:45.667 --> 17:48.367
THE SIMILARITIES IN THE LANGUAGE

17:48.367 --> 17:49.933
TO INTERMARRY AND TO HAVE LETS

17:49.933 --> 17:53.667
OF FAMILIAL TIES

THROUGHOUT UKRAINE'S

18:17.333 --> 18:18.167
STRIVE BETWEEN UKRAINIANS AN

18:18.167 --> 18:18.500
RUSSIANS

18:18.500 --> 18:20.333

18:20.333 --> 18:22.200
FOR ALL OF THE CLEAVAGES BETWEEN

18:22.200 --> 18:25.300
EAST AND WEST IN UKRAINE, FOR 23

18:25.300 --> 18:27.733
YEARS, UKRAINE MANAGED TO GOVERN

18:27.733 --> 18:29.633

OF CORRUPTION AND VERY POOR,

SCALE THAT WE ARE CURRENTL

18:41.000 --> 18:41.233
SEEING

18:57.033 --> 18:59.300
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER THOS

19:11.733 --> 19:14.367
IF PUTIN IS BEHIND ALL OF THIS

19:14.367 --> 19:15.867
WHAT'S MOTIVATING HIM?

19:15.867 --> 19:18.233
>> TO GET INTO PUTIN'S MIND READ

19:18.233 --> 19:19.067
WHAT HE READS.

19:19.067 --> 19:23.767

19:24.767 --> 19:27.467
SHE WROTE A PIECE ON HOW EARLY

19:27.467 --> 19:29.500
20th CENTURY, THE PHILOSOPHERS

19:29.500 --> 19:32.067
MAY BE INFLUENCING PUTIN'S

19:32.067 --> 19:32.767
ACTIONS.

19:32.767 --> 19:34.400
WRITING IS A SIGN TO RUSSIAN

19:34.400 --> 19:35.600
REGIONAL GOVERNORS TO READ

19:35.600 --> 19:38.567
THEY SAY THAT RUSSIA IS

19:38.567 --> 19:42.333
HISTORICALLY, VERY POWERFU

19:42.333 --> 19:43.500
CIVILIZATION THAT HAS THIS GOA

19:43.500 --> 19:47.467
OF PRESERVING ITS TRADITIONA

19:47.467 --> 19:49.133
VALUE AND DEFINING ITSEL

AGAINST THE AGGRESSION OF TH

19:55.100 --> 19:56.933
TRADITIONAL INFLUENCE SUCH A

19:56.933 --> 19:58.733
UKRAINE, FOR EXAMPLE, AND WE CAN

19:58.733 --> 19:59.833
SEE PUTIN IS FOLLOWING THA

19:59.833 --> 20:01.733
PRETTY CLOSELY

20:01.733 --> 20:06.633
>> HE'S OFFERING THIS NEW IDEA

20:06.633 --> 20:07.933
THAT IS IDENTIFIED AS TH

20:07.933 --> 20:09.167
RUSSIAN LANGUAGE AND PEOPLE WITH

20:09.167 --> 20:12.467
THE RUSSIAN CULTURE AND IT

20:12.467 --> 20:14.767
SOUNDED LIKE HE'S TRYING T

20:14.767 --> 20:14.967
RE-CREATE.

20:14.967 --> 20:16.867
>> WHICH IS IN MIND OF WHA

20:16.867 --> 20:18.967
PRESIDENT PUTIN TOLD FORME

YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, GEORGE

20:22.333 --> 20:24.700
UKRAINE IS NOT EVEN A COUNTRY.

20:24.700 --> 20:26.667
>> THAT ALSO FITS CLOSELY WITH

20:26.667 --> 20:31.167
PUTIN'S RECENT REMARKS IN

20:31.167 --> 20:31.967
CALL-IN PROGRAM.

THAT'S AN ARC LARGING CHANGE AND

20:58.133 --> 21:00.333
THAT'S JUST ONE SMALL POINT IN

21:00.333 --> 21:01.500
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND THAT HE'

21:01.500 --> 21:03.867
GIVING UP, BUT IT SEEMS TO BE

21:03.867 --> 21:04.633
JUSTIFICATION TO THE RUSSIAN

PEOPLE ABOUT TAKING FURTHE

21:06.700 --> 21:08.067
AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS

21:19.800 --> 21:20.967
QUESTION OF ALL WHETHER THOS
