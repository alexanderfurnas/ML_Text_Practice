HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan. Judy
Woodruff is away.

00:09.276 --> 00:13.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Winter wallops the East Coast.
High winds, and heavy snow

00:13.513 --> 00:17.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have cities from North Carolina
to New York shutting down.

00:17.417 --> 00:23.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: a clash over how to handle
a rise in feral cats in
communities across America.

00:23.257 --> 00:28.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY, "Reveal":
Take Antioch, California, about
40 miles east of San Francisco.

00:28.128 --> 00:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The town is home to about 17,000
strays, one cat for every six
citizens.

00:32.933 --> 00:35.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And it's
Friday. David Brooks and Ruth
Marcus are in to analyze the
week's

00:35.669 --> 00:36.970 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
news.

00:36.970 --> 00:43.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:43.477 --> 00:47.614 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:47.614 --> 00:57.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A blizzard is
bearing down tonight on
Washington, D.C., and states to

00:57.224 --> 01:01.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the north and south. The snow
moved in this afternoon,
shutting down schools,
government

01:01.862 --> 01:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and transportation, and
canceling thousands of flights,
forecasters warning that, by
this

01:06.233 --> 01:11.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time tomorrow, they will be
measuring in feet, instead of
inches.

01:11.738 --> 01:16.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With store shelves nearly empty,
and road crews gearing up,
millions across the Eastern

01:16.176 --> 01:20.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. waited for the worst.
Forecasters are predicting one
of the biggest storms ever

01:20.647 --> 01:26.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Mid-Atlantic especially,
with up to three inches of snow
an hour. As the wall

01:26.253 --> 01:30.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of weather closed in, blizzard
warnings or watches went up from
Arkansas and Tennessee,

01:30.624 --> 01:35.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through Washington and as
far north as New York.

01:35.262 --> 01:39.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About six inches of snow fell
overnight in the Little Rock,
Arkansas, area, breaking

01:39.232 --> 01:44.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a record set more than 20 years
ago. It shut down schools and
state government offices.

01:44.604 --> 01:49.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in North Carolina, the snow
started falling before sunrise,
triggering a number of fatal

01:49.710 --> 01:51.411 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wrecks.

01:51.411 --> 01:54.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. PAT MCCRORY (R), North
Carolina: Where I'm seeing the
accidents is where it looks

01:54.414 --> 02:01.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like it's a safe road, and
people are speeding, and because
they assume it's safe, because

02:01.021 --> 02:05.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they don't see snow on the
roads. And that's our greatest
concern right now.

02:05.192 --> 02:09.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: North Carolina
declared a state of emergency,
along with Tennessee,

02:09.396 --> 02:13.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Virginia, Maryland, and
Pennsylvania. So did the
nation's capital, sitting
squarely in

02:13.734 --> 02:17.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the blizzard's bullseye, with
estimates that more than two
feet of snow will fall.

02:17.738 --> 02:21.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MURIEL BOWSER (D), Mayor of
Washington, D.C.: I want to be
very clear with everybody. We

02:21.308 --> 02:28.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see this as a major storm. It
has life and death implications,
and all the residents

02:28.849 --> 02:32.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the district of Columbia
should treat it that way. We
have a forecast that I don't

02:32.652 --> 02:35.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
think we have had in 90 years.

02:35.655 --> 02:39.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In a bid to
beat the storm, the federal
government closed all its
Washington

02:39.593 --> 02:43.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
offices at noon. And for the
first time, the city's entire
subway system planned to close

02:43.730 --> 02:46.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the weekend.

02:46.967 --> 02:52.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, all the major
airlines issued waivers for the
weekend, allowing passengers to
rebook

02:52.773 --> 02:57.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and avoid the storms. The snow
and high winds are expected to
continue into Sunday, amid

02:57.744 --> 03:01.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
warnings of more than a billion
dollars in damage. So far, at
least five people have

03:01.715 --> 03:05.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
died in storm-related accidents.

03:05.952 --> 03:10.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the day's other news, bad
weather off the Greek islands
caused one of the worst migrant

03:10.791 --> 03:16.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tragedies yet. At least 46
people, including 17 children,
drowned when two wooden boats

03:16.663 --> 03:21.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
capsized as they tried to cross
from Turkey. So far, dangerous
winter weather conditions

03:21.968 --> 03:26.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have not stopped the surge of
people trying to reach Europe by
boat. But the rising fatalities

03:26.039 --> 03:30.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make this the deadliest
January on record.

03:30.744 --> 03:35.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The prime minister of Iraq now
says criminal gangs may have
abducted three Americans in

03:35.415 --> 03:39.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Baghdad for ransom. But he also
says it is not yet clear they
were kidnapped at all.

03:39.886 --> 03:43.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The three disappeared in
Baghdad last Saturday.

03:43.523 --> 03:46.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider
al-Abadi spoke in Davos,
Switzerland, today, where he's
attending

03:46.126 --> 03:48.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the World Economic Forum.

03:48.562 --> 03:52.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAIDER AL-ABADI, Iraqi Prime
Minister: I have to rely on the
information I have. A, we don't

03:52.899 --> 03:56.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
know if they have been
kidnapped. They're missing.
We're still looking for them.
There

03:56.603 --> 04:02.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were not demands so far. I don't
believe there is any political
thing out of this, because

04:02.642 --> 04:06.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what political gain would
anybody get from that?

04:06.346 --> 04:10.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Other Iraqi
officials and some Western
security sources have said two

04:10.250 --> 04:14.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shiite militias are the top
suspects in the abductions.

04:14.654 --> 04:18.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea announced today it
has detained an American college
student. He is identified

04:18.692 --> 04:23.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as 21-year-old Otto Frederick
Warmbier from the University of
Virginia. He had been in

04:23.730 --> 04:28.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country on a five-day tour.
North Korean state TV made the
announcement. It said Warmbier

04:28.435 --> 04:32.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is accused of committing
unspecified -- quote -- "hostile
acts" and allegedly plotting to

04:32.439 --> 04:35.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
destroy the country's unity.

04:35.041 --> 04:39.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The U.S. State Department said
it is looking into the report.

04:39.579 --> 04:44.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Somalia, at least 20 people
died overnight when Islamist
gunmen attacked a popular
beachside

04:44.718 --> 04:49.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
restaurant. It happened in
Mogadishu, and the Islamist
group Al-Shabaab claimed
responsibility.

04:49.022 --> 04:54.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The attackers set off bombs and
then opened fire on diners,
triggering an hours-long gun

04:54.528 --> 05:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
battle with security forces. It
wasn't clear how many gunmen
were among the dead.

05:00.500 --> 05:05.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tunisia's government imposed a
nationwide curfew today in a bid
to halt violent demonstrations

05:05.772 --> 05:11.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
over youth unemployment.
Tensions flared this week after
a young job seeker was
electrocuted

05:11.344 --> 05:15.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when he climbed a transmission
tower in protest. Unemployment
in the North African nation has

05:15.982 --> 05:21.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
worsened since the 2011
revolution that launched the
Arab Spring.

05:21.454 --> 05:26.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And back in this country, Wall
Street rallied as oil pushed
back above $32 dollars a barrel.

05:26.526 --> 05:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 210 points to close above
16090. The Nasdaq rose

05:32.766 --> 05:37.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nearly 120 points, and the S&amp;P
500 added 38. Overall, the
market scored its first weekly

05:37.470 --> 05:40.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gains of the year.

05:40.774 --> 05:46.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Brooks and Marcus, as the race
for the White House intensifies;

05:46.313 --> 05:52.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking to the skies for a
possible new planet; a big push
so no child is left offline; how

05:52.953 --> 06:10.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to control a spike in feral cats
across America; and much more.

06:10.103 --> 06:13.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turning to the race for the
White House, it's crunch time
for the candidates on the
campaign

06:13.640 --> 06:19.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
trail, with only 10 days
remaining until caucus-goers
gather to make their choices in
Iowa.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The front-runners are using
tried-and-true tactics to turn
votes in their favor.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Political director Lisa
Desjardins reports.

06:25.986 --> 06:32.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Voting day gets
closer, and, what do you know,
the race suddenly gets sharper.

06:32.492 --> 06:36.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In each party, the two
front-runners, previously
friendly, are going on the
attack.

06:36.997 --> 06:43.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For Republicans, the Ted
Cruz-Donald Trump detente has
exploded into shots fired.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: Cruz is going down.
He is going down. No,

06:45.372 --> 06:48.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's having a hard time. He
looks like a nervous wreck.

06:48.975 --> 06:51.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate: Donald
has been an active supporter. He
gave

06:51.911 --> 06:54.447 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
$100,000 to the
Clinton Foundation.

06:54.447 --> 06:58.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And in the last
day, the candidates have each
launched new ads, each

06:58.118 --> 07:02.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
arguing the other is not
a real conservative.

07:02.656 --> 07:07.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's play, immigration. His
ad raises Cruz's past support of
some legal status for the

07:07.961 --> 07:09.696 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
undocumented.

07:09.696 --> 07:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ: I want
immigration reform to pass, and
that allows those who are here
illegally

07:13.633 --> 07:15.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to come in out of the shadows.

07:15.835 --> 07:19.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Cruz's ad plays
a different card, pointing to
Trump's defense of eminent

07:19.739 --> 07:23.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
domain. That's the taking of
private land for development or
roads.

07:23.943 --> 07:28.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: It made him rich, like
when Trump colluded with
Atlantic City insiders to
bulldoze

07:28.315 --> 07:31.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the home of an elderly widow.

07:31.151 --> 07:36.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Their fight for
the nomination is now suddenly a
fight for the soul of the

07:36.056 --> 07:41.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican Party. This week, Bob
Dole, former Senate Republican
leader and presidential

07:41.027 --> 07:48.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nominee, blasted Cruz, saying he
would mean cataclysmic and
wholesale losses for the party.

07:48.535 --> 07:53.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cruz has said that's a sign that
Washington is scared of him.
Other conservatives see

07:53.073 --> 07:58.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Trump as more alarming.
"National Review" magazine, a
conservative icon, etched its

07:58.611 --> 08:04.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cover with the words "Against
Trump," inside, sharper words
still. Editors wrote that "Trump

08:04.651 --> 08:09.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a political opportunist, that
he knows approximately as much
about national security

08:09.356 --> 08:14.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as he does about the nuclear
triad, which is to say almost
nothing."

08:14.194 --> 08:18.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also wrote that "Trump has
shown no interest in
conservative issues, limiting
government,

08:18.365 --> 08:21.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reforming entitlements
or the Constitution."

08:21.434 --> 08:25.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, for his part, was equally
stinging, tweeting back that
"'The National Review'"

08:25.872 --> 08:30.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a failing publication
that has lost its way.

08:30.176 --> 08:35.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meantime, with the Democratic
race suddenly tighter, Hillary
Clinton is pushing her national

08:35.315 --> 08:38.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security credentials in a new
ad, and she's going after Bernie
Sanders' for wanting
government-run

08:38.985 --> 08:41.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
health care after Obamacare.

08:41.888 --> 08:45.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: I don't
want to rip up this
accomplishment

08:45.592 --> 08:50.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and begin this contentious
debate all over again. That's
where I disagree with my
esteemed

08:50.397 --> 08:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opponent, Senator Sanders.

08:53.233 --> 09:03.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Sanders is
getting attention for this more
thematic, ad. It portrays a

09:03.143 --> 09:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
movement of regular working
Americans. The images have been
criticized for a lack of

09:08.381 --> 09:14.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
diversity, in a race where
Sanders trails with
African-Americans.

09:14.087 --> 09:18.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the trail, the Vermont
senator is stepping up his
criticism, this morning pointing
to

09:18.091 --> 09:23.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Social Security. He'd like to
raise taxes on the wealthy to
expand it. It is closing

09:23.797 --> 09:28.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
argument time, 10 days until
Iowa, tight races on both sides.
That also means time for closing

09:28.134 --> 09:30.103 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
punches.

09:30.103 --> 09:33.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Lisa Desjardins.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And now to the
analysis of Brooks and Marcus.
Judy spoke with them

09:35.742 --> 09:38.111 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
earlier today.

09:38.111 --> 09:42.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that is New
York Times columnist David
Brooks and Washington Post

09:42.148 --> 09:44.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
columnist Ruth Marcus.
Mark Shields is away.

09:44.717 --> 09:47.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you both.

09:47.921 --> 09:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as we just heard, a new
front has opened up in this
battle inside the Republican
Party.

09:52.792 --> 09:57.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David, you have this iconic
magazine of the conservative
movement, "The National Review,"

09:57.997 --> 10:02.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going after Donald Trump, saying
he's a menace to conservatism.
He's coming back. Where is

10:02.101 --> 10:03.336 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this headed?

10:03.336 --> 10:06.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, the
split is interesting.

10:06.506 --> 10:11.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's sort of between people who
are more ideologically- or
philosophically-minded and those
who are

10:11.411 --> 10:17.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more rogue- and chaos-minded.
And so the rogue side is Sarah
Palin going with Trump. The

10:17.250 --> 10:20.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people who are more
ideologically conservative,
whether it's "National Review"
or the Wall

10:20.253 --> 10:22.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Street Journal editorial page,
are suspicious of Trump because
he's ideologically all over

10:22.856 --> 10:25.925 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the place.

10:25.925 --> 10:30.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's sort of breaking
down on that line, a little
elite, populists, so the talk

10:30.363 --> 10:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
show folks are a little more --
a lot more pro-Trump than the
print folks. And so that's

10:33.733 --> 10:35.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the breakdown.

10:35.902 --> 10:42.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I happen to think that, in
voters' minds, that the last
four years have made Republicans

10:42.575 --> 10:49.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
less conservative. The economic
stress and the economic crisis
have made them think,

10:49.215 --> 10:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want somebody on my side. And
they are a little more willing
to tolerate government

10:53.152 --> 10:55.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than they were, say, 10 years
ago. And so I think -- and
they're willing to tolerate

10:55.788 --> 10:58.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a little more chaos than
they were 10 years ago.

10:58.458 --> 11:02.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think, if it's ideology
vs. chaos, I think chaos
probably wins.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which is good
news for Donald Trump, if that
is the way it works.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.031 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

11:05.031 --> 11:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
do you see this?

11:06.866 --> 11:09.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Well, I think
breakdown might be the operative
word.

11:09.969 --> 11:16.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is also this division
really between various pieces of
the Republican establishment.

11:16.376 --> 11:22.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The conservative Republican
establishment, as exemplified by
"National Review," is freaking

11:22.649 --> 11:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out, I think, is the technical
term, about the Trump menace,
and that's the word that

11:26.853 --> 11:30.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"National Review" used, menace.

11:30.023 --> 11:36.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Washington establishment and
the party establishment is
freaking out about Cruz,

11:36.763 --> 11:42.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because they see, strangely,
Trump as -- some of them do --
we heard from Bob Dole this

11:42.735 --> 11:49.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week -- Trump as more electable
than Cruz. They do not want to
have no shot at a third

11:49.676 --> 11:53.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
term in the White -- they don't
want to have a third Democratic
term in the White House.

11:53.379 --> 11:57.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, so,
but where does it go?

11:57.216 --> 12:04.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David, you're saying that
Republicans are less tolerant or
less warm to the idea of

12:04.123 --> 12:08.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conservatism. They're willing to
tolerate some chaos. But does
that mean -- does that

12:08.027 --> 12:11.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
automatically mean that Trump
prevails over these other
establishment candidates?

12:11.764 --> 12:15.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Not automatically.

12:15.001 --> 12:20.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm still hoping the
establishment will get off their
rear ends and actually do
something

12:20.039 --> 12:24.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and act like an establishment
and rally behind one candidate.
But you have to say right now,

12:24.143 --> 12:27.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given all the things that have
happened this weekend -- and,
remember, a lot can still

12:27.146 --> 12:31.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happen between now and the
caucuses. The final week is like
70 percent of the campaign.

12:31.951 --> 12:38.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You could see massive swings.
And so you're looking for magic.
Who has magic right now?

12:38.491 --> 12:42.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And given all the things that
have happened, I don't think Bob
Dole gives Trump a lot of

12:42.295 --> 12:45.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
magic, but Sarah Palin gives
him a little. And to me...

12:45.298 --> 12:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You do think so?

12:47.367 --> 12:51.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: ... the vibe feels
a little like, if there is any
magic there, Trump has

12:51.170 --> 12:55.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a little of that magic, and
Cruz, even in the polls, is
falling slightly.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
the Sarah Palin endorsement?

12:58.011 --> 13:03.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: So, as a general
matter, endorsements don't
matter very much.

13:03.850 --> 13:09.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this one, from that low
baseline, matters a little more
than most. First of all, once

13:09.989 --> 13:14.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again, Donald Trump managed to
take attention away from
everybody else, including Ted
Cruz,

13:14.227 --> 13:16.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who needs the attention more,
put it on him, Donald Trump.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For several days.

13:17.563 --> 13:21.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: For several
days, and also Sarah Palin.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Also, to the extent that
endorsements matter, they matter
because they're validators of

13:25.805 --> 13:30.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something that voters may still
have a question about. With
Donald Trump -- and this is the

13:30.543 --> 13:35.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
argument Ted Cruz has been
making -- the question is, is he
a real conservative, can you
really

13:35.114 --> 13:39.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trust him to be a conservative,
not the guy with New York
values?

13:39.986 --> 13:45.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With Sarah Palin, who may not be
convincing to Republicans inside
the Beltway, she can

13:45.425 --> 13:50.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speak pretty convincingly to
voters in Iowa who, remember,
were for Rick Santorum four

13:50.363 --> 13:52.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
years ago.

13:52.198 --> 13:56.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But she also --
David, there are some voters who
say they absolutely don't

13:56.035 --> 13:59.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
trust her and don't
care what she thinks.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And this is why we
shouldn't hand Trump the
nomination. There is a ceiling

14:02.809 --> 14:07.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there. There is a real ceiling
there, especially as we get into
the more diverse states.

14:07.847 --> 14:14.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think, once you get an
establishment candidate, a
moderate candidate, what we now

14:14.454 --> 14:18.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
call moderate, Trump is still
very -- extremely vulnerable as
we get there. If you look at

14:18.891 --> 14:22.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- if you try to break down the
party into lanes, which may not
be valid anymore, but

14:22.495 --> 14:28.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's still 40, 50 percent who
are either moderate, have some
mixture of conservative

14:28.901 --> 14:32.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and liberal positions, who are
just party regulars, not
particularly ideological.

14:32.071 --> 14:35.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those people, that's why
Romney has won. That's why
McCain has won. That's why Dole

14:35.575 --> 14:39.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has won nominations. That's why
W. ran with compassionate
conservatism. They're still

14:39.979 --> 14:44.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there. They haven't disappeared.
The party is radicalized,
clearly, but Trump and Cruz

14:44.884 --> 14:46.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are both still vulnerable if
there's a single alternative.

14:46.786 --> 14:47.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well...

14:47.420 --> 14:47.754 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

14:47.754 --> 14:49.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

14:49.989 --> 14:53.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: David said "once
you get," and I think that's the
operative term, because

14:53.626 --> 15:00.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how in this time with super PACs
and so many candidates still
running in that -- for that

15:00.199 --> 15:04.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moderate establishment, maybe
not moderate, but certainly
establishment mantle, how does

15:04.170 --> 15:06.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that sort itself out?

15:06.506 --> 15:11.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's going to be difficult to
do. There is some -- a degree of
-- that can't be denied

15:11.611 --> 15:16.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of anti-Trump animus even with
the Republican Party. I have
heard it. I was with a bunch

15:16.949 --> 15:21.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of voters at a Ted Cruz event in
New Hampshire earlier this week,
and I was surprised at

15:21.320 --> 15:24.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the number of them who were not
shopping between Cruz and Trump.
Trump was totally off their

15:24.824 --> 15:26.426 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
list.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: One of the other
thing is the ads they're running
against each other.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I was
going to ask you about it.

15:30.696 --> 15:35.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so I think the
Trump ads, they -- I mean,
personally, I find them
extremely

15:35.268 --> 15:39.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
noxious. They're extremely
anti-immigrant. And they attack
Cruz on two grounds, first,

15:39.539 --> 15:43.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that he's insufficiently
anti-immigrant, and, second,
that he's kind of squirrelly and
there

15:43.509 --> 15:46.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are some images of him talking
to FOX News looking a little
squirrelly, and that he's

15:46.078 --> 15:47.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
opportunistic.

15:47.046 --> 15:49.515 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Squirrelly, meaning?

15:49.515 --> 15:53.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: That he
flip-flops, which he sort of did
on the immigration issue. He
took

15:53.553 --> 15:55.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about a week when the
immigration reform was passing
to try to find the right
position

15:55.955 --> 15:59.225 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for himself.

15:59.225 --> 16:04.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that's the inauthenticity
and opportunism, where he's
weak. Cruz is hitting back with

16:04.230 --> 16:09.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an ad charging Trump with being
a ruthless businessman. I don't
think that is an effective

16:09.001 --> 16:13.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attack line. Donald Trump,
people sort of like that. And
so, if you just look at the

16:13.472 --> 16:15.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two, the way they're ramping up
their campaigns right now,
again, Trump has a little
advantage

16:15.341 --> 16:17.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the ad wars, I would say.

16:17.844 --> 16:21.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we haven't
talked much about ads in this
campaign, Ruth.

16:21.013 --> 16:25.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in the last hours before
people vote, are these going to
make any difference?

16:25.351 --> 16:30.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Well, there have
not been really kind of breakout
ads that have galvanized

16:30.489 --> 16:34.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attention in this campaign
more than in previous ones.

16:34.293 --> 16:38.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there was an interesting one
that was just released last
night from the Bernie Sanders

16:38.331 --> 16:43.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign, with which had this
very morning in America, if you
don't mind my using that

16:43.736 --> 16:45.338 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
phrase...

16:45.338 --> 16:46.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From
Ronald Reagan.

16:46.305 --> 16:52.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: ... with regard to
Bernie Sanders, tone to it. It
had zero message. From the

16:52.011 --> 16:57.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guy who has a very crisp and
explicit message, it's just
Simon and Garfunkel America song

16:57.817 --> 17:02.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with pictures of Bernie
Sanders and rapturous voters.

17:02.321 --> 17:06.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Could something
like that work? Because we're
seeing a much tougher race,

17:06.659 --> 17:09.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not as tough as what the
Republicans are engaging in, but
we're seeing a much tougher race
now

17:09.228 --> 17:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between Clinton and Sanders.

17:12.365 --> 17:16.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: I watched it a few
times. I have to say, it made me
smile. And it made me also

17:16.369 --> 17:20.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
kind of have flashbacks
to Barack Obama 2008.

17:20.573 --> 17:26.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think Hillary Clinton may
be having some flashbacks now as
well, because, as with

17:26.312 --> 17:31.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Barack Obama, Sanders has turned
his campaign into quite a
movement. You see it with the

17:31.217 --> 17:35.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voters in New Hampshire. And you
see it with the polls in New
Hampshire.

17:35.288 --> 17:40.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not that he has -- he
can afford to run that ad,
because it's not as if he

17:40.760 --> 17:44.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lacks a message. Voters know
clearly what his message is.

17:44.096 --> 17:47.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But he also went
after her, David, in that debate
on Sunday night on several

17:47.934 --> 17:53.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things, including the speaking
fees she collected from Wall
Street, from the big financial
firms.

17:53.873 --> 17:57.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that something that
gains traction for him?

17:57.777 --> 18:01.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Among his voters
who think Wall Street is the
epicenter of evil, I think it

18:01.147 --> 18:03.115 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

18:03.115 --> 18:09.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also had an interesting
debate about health care reform.
And that was her making

18:09.455 --> 18:13.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an incremental argument, we have
got to make our changes
gradually, and him making a
radical

18:13.492 --> 18:14.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
argument. And so it was
interesting. That was a
substantive, real argument about
how

18:14.961 --> 18:18.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you change any system.

18:18.097 --> 18:23.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, again, I'm going to go back
to the magic -- or maybe a
better word is charisma. Some

18:23.336 --> 18:27.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaigns have charisma at
certain moments, and some
campaigns are flat in certain
moments.

18:27.340 --> 18:32.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, in part, like that
ad, Sanders has a little more
charisma to her -- his campaign,

18:32.511 --> 18:34.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton a little lacking in
charisma. And that's sort of
important, because people just

18:34.513 --> 18:38.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gravitate in final days.

18:38.384 --> 18:43.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even though he's
talking -- essentially, the
argument is whether you just
wipe away

18:43.522 --> 18:46.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to what we have done and you go
to a single-payer health care
system, which most Americans say

18:46.993 --> 18:49.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they don't want, right, or...

18:49.328 --> 18:53.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Well, it really is
this argument about
practicality.

18:53.132 --> 18:57.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of the things that's
interesting is there is actually
a parallel argument going

18:57.003 --> 19:02.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on in the Republican and
Democratic campaigns. So,
Hillary Clinton says, I'm the
pragmatist,

19:02.441 --> 19:07.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a progressive, but I'm a
pragmatic one. I know how to get
results. What he's saying,

19:07.413 --> 19:12.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
maybe it's a great idea in
theory, but he will never be
able to put it in practice.

19:12.218 --> 19:18.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Oddly enough, Donald Trump is
making that same argument
against Ted Cruz. He is saying,

19:18.357 --> 19:22.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ted Cruz, it can't -- well,
first of all, he's a little
squirrelly and maybe he's not

19:22.728 --> 19:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really a conservative, and look
at this squirrelly answer on
immigration, but, also, Ted Cruz

19:27.833 --> 19:30.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can't get anything done in
Washington because he doesn't
know how to get along with
anybody,

19:30.336 --> 19:33.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and he's too extreme.

19:33.305 --> 19:37.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so there is that sort of
practicality argument that is
emerging on both sides.

19:37.943 --> 19:41.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is
interesting, because you see
Bill Clinton out there, David,
making

19:41.080 --> 19:42.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some of these same arguments.

19:42.481 --> 19:44.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, Ruth, you saw him
on the trail this week.

19:44.450 --> 19:48.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: I was with him. I
was having a little flashback
down memory lane. Bill

19:48.054 --> 19:51.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton talked about stopping
off at the Dunkin' Donuts.

19:51.257 --> 19:56.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does he have the
same -- does he bring the same
weight, gravitas to this

19:56.695 --> 19:59.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
campaign that he did in
the past, do you think?

19:59.465 --> 20:02.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. He's still
good. He's still a master at
arguing, master at making the

20:02.334 --> 20:04.703 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
case.

20:04.703 --> 20:09.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's a lot of residual
good will toward him. What's
striking to me is how, even he

20:09.375 --> 20:14.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ran as a -- and really governed
as a moderate, he still has
personal good will.

20:14.680 --> 20:18.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other thing that's going on
is -- and I think this is also
helping Sanders in New

20:18.551 --> 20:22.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hampshire -- and, again, I
wouldn't bet on him to win the
nomination -- but helping him,

20:22.354 --> 20:27.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanders, a little residual
resentment among Democratic
primary voters about Obama, and

20:27.493 --> 20:32.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his being more centrist than
they would like, especially in
the first, say, six years.

20:32.098 --> 20:37.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they're a little more
suspicious of moderation and are
more willing to take a

20:37.036 --> 20:38.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
flyer on a guy who may
not be that pragmatic.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you see that?

20:41.273 --> 20:46.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: I actually felt a
lot of Obama love still there in
New Hampshire among the

20:46.412 --> 20:49.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
voters that I talked to.

20:49.582 --> 20:54.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think Bill Clinton,
especially among Democratic
primary voters and especially in

20:54.787 --> 21:01.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New Hampshire, which was a state
that has showered both Clintons
with love and success

21:01.193 --> 21:03.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- well, you know, he didn't win
the New Hampshire primary, but
he came in second -- is a
valuable

21:03.896 --> 21:05.764 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tool.

21:05.764 --> 21:10.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the really important
question for us all to be
thinking about going forward

21:10.569 --> 21:14.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, what if? What if what once
seemed unimaginable happens,
Bernie Sanders wins both Iowa
and

21:14.340 --> 21:14.740 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
New Hampshire?

21:14.740 --> 21:16.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right. Right.

21:16.509 --> 21:21.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: The Clinton
campaign argument is the
demographic fire wall of
minority voters

21:21.514 --> 21:26.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in South Carolina and beyond.
The Sanders campaign argument is
the kind of magic that

21:26.852 --> 21:30.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David's been talking about and
whether people will be --
whether that demographic
firewall

21:30.823 --> 21:34.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is as strong as the Clinton
campaign thinks it is.

21:34.326 --> 21:36.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Less than 30
seconds. I was going to ask you
about foreign policy, the

21:36.729 --> 21:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran story, prisoner swap. We
won't have time for that, but it
is striking that, just a

21:40.833 --> 21:43.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
month ago, we were talking about
ISIS, the terrorist threat, and
that seems to be off

21:43.536 --> 21:45.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the page.

21:45.704 --> 21:50.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It will be back.
You never escape it. And I think
the Middle East is more
destabilized

21:50.176 --> 21:54.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now than in our lifetimes. It
will be back when some incident
happens.

21:54.213 --> 21:57.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: It will be back.
And it's still very much a
front-and-center part of the
discourse

21:57.716 --> 21:59.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the Republican
primary election.

21:59.218 --> 22:00.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Voters
are bringing it up.

22:00.586 --> 22:03.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Voters are bringing
it up and candidates are
bringing it up.

22:03.522 --> 22:06.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ruth Marcus,
David Brooks, thank you both.
And good luck in the storm

22:06.258 --> 22:06.659 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this weekend.

22:06.659 --> 22:07.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: Thank you.

22:07.059 --> 22:07.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Thank you.

22:07.393 --> 22:11.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Same to you.

22:11.931 --> 22:23.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Next: a big
finding and discovery in space
that has astronomers and

22:23.809 --> 22:26.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
plenty of other people excited.

22:26.412 --> 22:28.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has
our conversation.

22:28.981 --> 22:33.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Nine planets in
the solar system, right? That's
what most of us grew up
thinking.

22:33.619 --> 22:39.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, that ended in 2006, when
Pluto was downgraded to a dwarf
planet.

22:39.625 --> 22:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now comes news that there
might be a ninth planet after
all. Researchers at the
California

22:43.829 --> 22:49.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Institute of Technology found
evidence of a planet with a mass
10 times that of Earth.

22:49.568 --> 22:53.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the Caltech astronomers,
Mike Brown, joins us now. And I
will add that he is also

22:53.973 --> 22:57.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
known as the chief culprit in
lowering Pluto's status. His
memoir is titled "How I Killed

22:57.876 --> 23:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Pluto and Why It Had It Coming."

23:01.213 --> 23:04.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, sort of making amends
here I guess, Mike Brown?

23:04.583 --> 23:07.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE BROWN, California Institute
of Technology: You know, it's --
I don't think of it that

23:07.653 --> 23:11.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way. I think of it as, this is
something I have been working at
for 20 years, and Pluto

23:11.624 --> 23:14.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was just collateral
damage along the way.

23:14.960 --> 23:19.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so
let's be as clear as we can
about what you have done here.
You

23:19.565 --> 23:24.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have not seen this new planet,
right? This is something you
surmise. Explain to us.

23:24.603 --> 23:27.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE BROWN: Yes, that's
absolutely right, and it's
important to know that we -- no
one

23:27.072 --> 23:30.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has actually seen
this planet yet.

23:30.009 --> 23:37.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we have done is felt it,
or, more precisely, we have seen
its gravitational effect on the

23:37.216 --> 23:42.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most distant things in the solar
system. And from those
gravitational effects, we can
tell

23:42.788 --> 23:47.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it must be out there. And
this is the same way that
Neptune, for example, was
discovered,

23:47.760 --> 23:51.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by its gravitational effects on
Uranus. So, there's a long
history of this sort of
astronomy.

23:51.463 --> 23:55.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're seeing
gravitational effects on several
-- I gather, six small

23:55.234 --> 23:56.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bodies out there?

23:56.435 --> 23:59.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE BROWN: There is actually
quite a big collection.

23:59.571 --> 24:03.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are six that are doing one
thing. There are five more that
are doing something else.

24:03.509 --> 24:07.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there's another eight
doing something. When you put
them all together, it's a pretty

24:07.546 --> 24:12.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big population that are going in
directions and moving in ways
that they shouldn't be

24:12.184 --> 24:15.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing unless there is something
organizing the whole pattern.

24:15.654 --> 24:17.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, this is -- I
don't know if this is a silly
question, but this is what

24:17.890 --> 24:24.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
confused me. If you can see --
or can see those bodies, why can
you not see the planet,

24:24.797 --> 24:26.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if you know those bodies
are there for sure?

24:26.832 --> 24:30.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE BROWN: Yes, so that's
a really good question.

24:30.536 --> 24:35.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The planet -- the effect of the
planet can be felt by probably
many thousands of bodies

24:35.874 --> 24:39.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are out there. We have only
found the first score of them.
But there must be many

24:39.845 --> 24:44.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thousands out there. So it's a
lot easier to look in a random
direction in space and

24:44.483 --> 24:49.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see something that has been
affected by this planet than to
immediately go and find it.

24:49.855 --> 24:54.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, right now, we know the
orbital path of the planet
through the sky, but we don't
know

24:54.760 --> 24:58.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where in the orbital path it is,
so we're setting out on a grand
search to try to find

24:58.063 --> 24:59.631 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

24:59.631 --> 25:02.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so what --
if it is a planet, what do --
what else you know about

25:02.668 --> 25:08.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it in terms of size, mass, why
it's so far away from the other
known planets?

25:08.674 --> 25:13.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE BROWN: It's actually --
having not seen it, we actually
know quite a good bit about

25:13.746 --> 25:16.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it, or we have inferred
quite a good bit about it.

25:16.849 --> 25:21.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we know that it's about 10
times the mass of the Earth. It
has to be that big to have

25:21.387 --> 25:25.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had the gravitational influence
over such a long distance that
it has. And at 10 times

25:25.958 --> 25:28.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the mass of the Earth, that
makes it a little bit smaller
than Neptune.

25:28.961 --> 25:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we think it's probably a
miniature Neptune. It's probably
a gas giant like Neptune. It

25:34.533 --> 25:41.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has no solid surface, just a gas
surface. And it has this crazy
elliptical orbit. It

25:41.240 --> 25:46.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
takes 10,000 to 20,000 years to
go around the sun. And the
closest it ever gets to the

25:46.311 --> 25:53.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sun is about 20 billion miles,
which, to put it in context, is
-- it's something like five

25:53.185 --> 25:57.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
times further than the
distance that Pluto is right.

25:57.055 --> 26:01.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But on that 10,000-year journey
around the sun, it goes out to
100 billion miles, which

26:01.760 --> 26:06.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is about 25 times the distance
of Pluto. So, it's really quite
a long ways out there and

26:06.331 --> 26:08.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on quite an extended orbit.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is not, of
course, the first time that
astronomers have suspected

26:12.805 --> 26:18.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the presence of a phantom planet
at the outer edges of the solar
system, right? There is

26:18.710 --> 26:21.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reason to be more
confident this time?

26:21.280 --> 26:25.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE BROWN: Yes, so, actually,
the idea that there is another
planet out beyond Neptune

26:25.784 --> 26:30.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or beyond Pluto, when Pluto was
a planet, has a long and, I
would say, fairly sordid

26:30.355 --> 26:32.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
history over the past
hundred years, really.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

26:34.927 --> 26:38.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE BROWN: Every time
astronomers would see something
that they didn't quite
understand

26:38.730 --> 26:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the outer part of the solar
system, the immediate thing that
everybody jumps to is

26:41.233 --> 26:43.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
must be a planet.

26:43.368 --> 26:48.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you can go back really over
the last century and read all
these different accounts of why

26:48.073 --> 26:52.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there must be a planet. Every
single one of them has turned
out to be wrong. Usually,

26:52.911 --> 26:55.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's that the data they were
looking at were incorrect.
Sometimes, they were
misinterpreting

26:55.914 --> 26:59.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
data. But they have
always been wrong.

26:59.184 --> 27:03.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're saying, yes, for 100
years, everybody's been wrong,
but we're, of course, right.

27:03.422 --> 27:04.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

27:04.990 --> 27:08.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Of course. I
will go with you for now.

27:08.227 --> 27:15.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, also, this made me think
about, and for the layman, how
this kind of science is done.

27:15.801 --> 27:23.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right? This is always a mix of
theory and observing, that they
both work hand in hand?

27:23.008 --> 27:26.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE BROWN: Yes, this has
actually been -- that mix is
personified in the two of us
have been

27:26.612 --> 27:28.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
working on this problem.

27:28.981 --> 27:33.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's me. I'm primarily an
observational astronomer. I look
at the sky and try to figure

27:33.886 --> 27:38.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out what's going on. My
colleague, who I think did the
heavy lifting here, is
Konstantin

27:38.757 --> 27:45.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Batygin. He is a theorist. He
understands the gravitational
dynamics in gory detail.

27:45.531 --> 27:49.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he and I are four doors down
from each other at Caltech. And
we would be running

27:49.935 --> 27:54.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back and forth across the
hallways for the past two years,
really. I would bring in some

27:54.039 --> 27:58.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more observational constraints.
He would think about it, put it
in the computer, write the

27:58.243 --> 28:01.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
equations. We would talk to
each other. We would argue.

28:01.413 --> 28:06.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's -- these two different
viewpoints, I think, were
critical to really making this

28:06.385 --> 28:09.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
realization that there has
to be this planet out there.

28:09.021 --> 28:13.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so what
happens next? How will
scientists verify its existence?

28:13.825 --> 28:16.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you ultimately
have to see it?

28:16.562 --> 28:20.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIKE BROWN: You have to see it.

28:20.165 --> 28:25.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, any good scientist is
going to be skeptical, because
it's a pretty big claim.

28:25.971 --> 28:30.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And without the final evidence
that it's real, there is always
that chance that it's not.

28:30.208 --> 28:35.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, everybody should be
skeptical. But I think it's time
to mount this search.

28:35.180 --> 28:41.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, we like to think of it
as, we have provided the
treasure map of where this ninth

28:41.053 --> 28:47.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
planet is, and we have done the
starting gun, and now it's a
race to actually point your

28:47.092 --> 28:52.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
telescope at the right spot in
the sky and make that discovery
of planet nine.

28:52.130 --> 28:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Mike
Brown of Caltech, thanks so
much, and good luck.

28:55.233 --> 29:03.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MIKE BROWN: Thank you.
It's been a pleasure.

29:03.508 --> 29:15.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tonight: an
innovative solution to bridging
the digital divide for students.

29:15.988 --> 29:19.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Too frequently, kids and their
parents in rural low-income
communities don't have access

29:19.992 --> 29:24.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the Internet and high-quality
learning technologies. But, in
California, a unique

29:24.896 --> 29:31.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
project is providing free home
access to the Web in one of the
nation's poorest districts.

29:31.136 --> 29:34.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Much of the footage for this
story was shot by teenagers who
are part of our Student
Reporting

29:34.940 --> 29:39.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Labs network, in collaboration
with PBS SoCal in Southern
California.

29:39.044 --> 29:42.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The correspondent
is David Nazar.

29:42.247 --> 29:47.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID NAZAR: Thirty minutes west
of the wealthy suburbs of Palm
Springs is a desert oasis

29:47.519 --> 29:52.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
best known its annual Coachella
Valley Music and Arts Festival.

29:52.858 --> 29:57.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But behind the parties and
concerts stretches a vast and
isolated landscape, home to the

29:57.863 --> 30:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
second poorest school district
in the country, where most
families live below the poverty

30:01.533 --> 30:04.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
line and struggle
just to pay the rent.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARRYL ADAMS, Superintendent,
Coachella Valley Unified School
District: We have some of the

30:06.405 --> 30:11.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poorest of the poor in our
country, very economically
challenged, and 100 percent of
our students

30:11.176 --> 30:16.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are on free and reduced lunch.
Some of them living at trailer
home parks that some have

30:16.148 --> 30:21.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been condemned recently, or some
in railroad, abandoned railroad
cars. It's just unbelievable,

30:21.053 --> 30:23.288 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
some of the
challenges they face.

30:23.288 --> 30:28.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID NAZAR: Coachella Valley
Unified School District
Superintendent Darryl Adams
believes

30:28.260 --> 30:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the right use of technology is
critical for the families in
this area, like Norma Olivas

30:32.164 --> 30:35.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and her daughter, Anisa Perez.

30:35.167 --> 30:41.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NORMA OLIVAS, Mother: I do see
students sometimes struggling,
and, right now, sometimes, some

30:41.206 --> 30:45.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the kids struggling to get
school, to do certain things.
And I wouldn't want my daughter

30:45.377 --> 30:48.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go through any that. I
wouldn't want her to be a
dropout.

30:48.847 --> 30:54.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID NAZAR: When Adams took the
job in 2011, the graduation rate
was 70 percent, according

30:54.152 --> 30:58.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the district. One of his key
initiatives was to get every
student an iPad and Wi-Fi

30:58.190 --> 31:01.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
service, but he knew
it would be challenge.

31:01.326 --> 31:06.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARRYL ADAMS: We have 1,250
square miles to cover, larger
than the state of Rhode Island.

31:06.798 --> 31:10.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when we out there were spots
in every which way, students
weren't connected, we

31:10.135 --> 31:13.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said, well, how can we
get them connected?

31:13.004 --> 31:16.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so one of the ways, we said,
look, we got 100 buses. Let's
put Wi-Fi routers on

31:16.541 --> 31:21.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those buses. And let's park
them where the need is.

31:21.046 --> 31:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID NAZAR: Finding the funding
for this fleet of buses was no
easy tasks. Nevertheless,

31:26.418 --> 31:33.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in 2012, the community voted for
and passed Measure X, a nearly
$45 million school bond

31:33.325 --> 31:37.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to fund the Mobile Learning
Initiative over 10 years. They
called the program Wi-Fi on

31:37.295 --> 31:39.397 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Wheels.

31:39.397 --> 31:46.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANISA PEREZ, Student: In the
bus, it's kind of cool that we
have Internet, because when

31:46.238 --> 31:51.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the project is due the next day,
we can actually spend time to do
it.

31:51.376 --> 31:54.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID NAZAR: Completing
assignments was difficult for
Anisa before getting her iPad
and Wi-Fi

31:54.446 --> 31:57.082 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
service at home.

31:57.082 --> 32:01.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NORMA OLIVAS: We would have to
travel actually to go in, go to
the library, get the books

32:01.419 --> 32:07.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she needed to look up the
information and go home. I don't
make a lot of money, but

32:07.692 --> 32:11.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will do whatever it takes to
make sure she does get a better
education.

32:11.930 --> 32:17.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID NAZAR: Adams is doing
whatever he can to make sure
that the 20,000 students in his

32:17.135 --> 32:21.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
schools, 98 percent Hispanic and
about 10 percent undocumented,
develop the skills they

32:21.206 --> 32:23.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
need to graduate.

32:23.575 --> 32:27.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARRYL ADAMS: So we realized
that we had to provide this to
our students in order for

32:27.679 --> 32:30.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them to compete in
the 21st century.

32:30.615 --> 32:34.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID NAZAR: Installing solar
panels on rooftops of the school
buses to power the
state-of-the-art

32:34.886 --> 32:39.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Wi-Fi routers was a
solution proposed by Adams.

32:39.357 --> 32:43.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARRYL ADAMS: Being a musician
by trade -- I was a music
teacher from L.A. Unified when

32:43.495 --> 32:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I started out 30 years ago --
and, as a musician, you're
always creating and thinking of
different

32:47.766 --> 32:51.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ways to do things or to play
things or to hear things.

32:51.369 --> 32:55.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I brought that to my
career in education. And I have
had some difficulty in the past,

32:55.273 --> 33:00.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because some people weren't
really kind of ready for Adams'
crazy ideas. But this district

33:00.312 --> 33:04.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was. And just about anything we
do that's maybe different and is
good for kids, we go

33:04.416 --> 33:06.685 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with it.

33:06.685 --> 33:10.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID NAZAR: CVUSD's director of
technical services, Israel
Oliveros, provides the technical

33:10.789 --> 33:13.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
support for the entire district.

33:13.458 --> 33:14.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISRAEL OLIVEROS, Director of
Technical Services, Coachella
Valley Unified School District:

33:14.292 --> 33:18.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We run power through a conduit
that is already existing on the
bus. It goes through the front

33:18.964 --> 33:23.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the bus. That's where the
router is located. Then we do
have the antennas pointed in
different

33:23.168 --> 33:26.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
directions. For the students,
that will cover a 150-foot
radius.

33:26.638 --> 33:30.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID NAZAR: The school
districts allows a few of these
buses to be parked throughout

33:30.876 --> 33:35.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the East Valley overnight. For
students, it's a lifeline to the
outside world.

33:35.647 --> 33:40.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARRYL ADAMS: We wanted to
ensure that students have 24/7
access to the Internet, because

33:40.819 --> 33:46.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
learning doesn't stop at
the end of the school day.

33:46.524 --> 33:52.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID NAZAR: Megan Smith is the
chief technology officer of the
United States. It's her job

33:52.197 --> 33:56.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to advise the president on
technology and innovation that
will improve the future.

33:56.835 --> 33:59.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEGAN SMITH, U.S. Office of
Science and Technology Policy:
Coachella is an incredibly
creative

33:59.204 --> 34:04.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
idea. Being able to flip the
classroom and be involved in --
have video at home, instead

34:04.509 --> 34:09.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the classroom has a lecture.
So, a lot of work to do in the
rural areas.

DAVID NAZAR: There are federal
programs in place to help
provide Wi-Fi to rural school

34:13.585 --> 34:19.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
districts, like the FCC's E-rate
program, which provides about
$1.5 billion each year

34:19.457 --> 34:24.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to schools. However, census data
shows that there are still five
million households with

34:24.496 --> 34:27.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school-age children who are not
effectively connected to the
Internet.

34:27.265 --> 34:29.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Smith says that has to change.

34:29.234 --> 34:33.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEGAN SMITH: There is a lot of
creativity that American people
have.

34:33.371 --> 34:36.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so whether it's going to
come from a school district, a
municipal leader, or one of our

34:36.574 --> 34:41.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national players, we need
everybody in on this game
working on it. It's a very, very

34:41.446 --> 34:46.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important, fundamental resource
for all of our people. And it
drives our economy. And

34:46.017 --> 34:49.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it drives our community
and our interconnections.

34:49.387 --> 34:54.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID NAZAR: With Adams at the
wheel, the graduation rate
jumped from 70 percent to

34:54.526 --> 34:58.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
80 percent. Now the
superintendent has aspirations
beyond students getting their
homework done.

34:58.797 --> 35:02.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He wants to connect everyone
in the East Valley.

35:02.334 --> 35:07.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARRYL ADAMS: Because we found
that we had a problem with some
of the third-party Internet

35:07.472 --> 35:12.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
service provider companies not
willing to go into some of the
areas where we serve.

35:12.744 --> 35:17.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in the long run, we would
like to become our own Time
Warner or our own Cox
Communication

35:17.382 --> 35:21.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and provide this for our
students. It's too crucial for
them to have this access for us

35:21.419 --> 35:23.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not to go down this path.

35:23.722 --> 35:28.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID NAZAR: Anisa recognizes
that technology and the Wi-Fi on
Wheels program is playing

35:28.059 --> 35:31.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a vital role in her education.

35:31.463 --> 35:36.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANISA PEREZ: I want to do this
for my mom, because my mom
didn't really get to finish

35:36.334 --> 35:40.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school. So that's what motivates
me to actually do -- to finish
school and complete my work

35:40.538 --> 35:43.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and get the job I want.

35:43.375 --> 35:47.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NORMA OLIVAS: I would want her
to have a better life than what
I have right now. I would want

35:47.779 --> 35:55.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her to do really, really good in
school, so she can get all these
ideas that she wants,

35:55.420 --> 36:00.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nice restaurants, different
things like that. That's one
thing she always wants to do,
travel.

36:00.458 --> 36:03.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's what she's
hoping to go for.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Two of our
Student Reporting Labs, Etiwanda
High School and West Ranch

36:14.139 --> 36:18.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
High School, traveled to the
Coachella Valley to shoot the
video for this story.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For a behind-the-scenes look at
their journey and how the

the Web site at
studentreportinglabs.com.

36:40.665 --> 36:44.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now a story about cats, not
the ones living in homes, but
stray and feral cats that live

36:44.069 --> 36:46.704 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
outside.

36:46.704 --> 36:50.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By some estimates, there are 80
million feral cats in this
country. And the question of

36:50.675 --> 36:54.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how to control them is sparking
controversy. Animal rights
activists, who want to save

36:54.813 --> 36:59.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stray cats, say there is an
alternative to euthanizing feral
cats, a method they say

36:59.651 --> 37:05.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will control the cat population
that's more humane and
effective. But will it work.

37:05.356 --> 37:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Adithya Sambamurthy from our
partner "Reveal" at the Center
for Investigative Reporting

37:07.792 --> 37:11.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has the story.

37:11.029 --> 37:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY, "Reveal":
Americans have long been
obsessed with cats in
commercials,

37:14.833 --> 37:18.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cartoons and, of course,
on the Internet.

37:18.803 --> 37:25.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for every cat in our homes,
there's a stray one on the
loose, roaming parking lots,

37:25.243 --> 37:30.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alleyways, fields and backyards.
They're everywhere, and,
increasingly, it's a problem.

37:30.949 --> 37:35.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Take Antioch, California, about
40 miles east of San Francisco.
The town is home to about

37:35.453 --> 37:40.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
17,000 strays, one cat
for every six citizens.

37:40.825 --> 37:43.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At the local animal shelter,
Monika Helgemo is overwhelmed.

37:43.862 --> 37:47.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MONIKA HELGEMO, Animal Shelter:
This one's here obviously is
saying, pet me, pet me.

37:47.132 --> 37:56.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This cat here, see the ears
go back? That's a feral cat.

37:56.841 --> 37:58.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: Feral cats
like this one are basically wild
animals, and so they're

37:58.810 --> 38:01.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not candidates for adoption.

38:01.346 --> 38:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MONIKA HELGEMO: We will do what
we can and see if we can find a
place for her and go

38:05.049 --> 38:08.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
live her life. If not, we're
going to end up having to put
her to sleep, euthanize her.

38:08.987 --> 38:14.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: Antioch is
typical. There are an estimated
80 million stray and feral

38:14.425 --> 38:19.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cats in the U.S. Traditionally,
the only way to deal with this
overpopulation was to euthanize

38:19.731 --> 38:25.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them. More than a million cats
are killed in animal shelters
every year. And that's

38:25.003 --> 38:28.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
made some cat lovers so mad,
they have gotten organized.

38:28.039 --> 38:30.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTIVIST: Are you guys ready
to save some more cats?

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

38:32.977 --> 38:37.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: This is a
national gathering of feral cat
advocates near Washington, D.C.

38:37.515 --> 38:41.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's hosted by Alley Cat Allies.
They run a network of a
quarter-million activists that

38:41.419 --> 38:44.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fight for feral cats.

38:44.022 --> 38:45.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BECKY ROBINSON, Founder and
President, Alley Cat Allies: We
changed the community. We
brought

38:45.123 --> 38:51.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
neighbors together. We
changed cat care forever.

38:51.763 --> 38:57.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: Becky
Robinson is the founder and
president of Alley Cat Allies.

38:57.502 --> 39:04.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She helped pioneer a population
control method called trap,
neuter, return, or TNR.

39:04.075 --> 39:06.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead of killing them, it's
about sterilizing cats and
letting them live the rest of
their

39:06.077 --> 39:08.513 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lives outdoors.

39:08.513 --> 39:12.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BECKY ROBINSON: Trap, neuter,
return for feral cats works. And
what we mean when we say it

39:12.817 --> 39:17.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
works is that it stops the
breeding of a cat, so there's no
more litters of kittens.

39:17.789 --> 39:22.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: In Antioch,
Susan Smith shows me how trap,
neuter, return is done.

39:22.694 --> 39:27.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's supported by Alley Cat
Allies, and she's trying to get
the city to embrace TNR.

39:27.365 --> 39:35.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN SMITH, Activist: I'm going
to bait the trap with some wet
food, and then some tuna,

39:35.340 --> 39:39.811 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some albacore.

39:39.811 --> 39:45.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: The cats
are spayed or neutered at a
local clinic, given rabies
shots,

39:45.850 --> 39:50.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the tips of their ears are
removed to show that they have
been fixed.

39:50.521 --> 39:57.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then Smith returns them back to
the streets where they were
trapped. She continues to

39:57.629 --> 40:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feed them in what are known as
cat colonies. The feeding is
key. Without it, she couldn't

40:02.467 --> 40:07.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attract other cats in the area
to trap them and get them fixed.

40:07.672 --> 40:13.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TNR is catching on. More than
400 cities and counties have
adopted this method over the

40:13.077 --> 40:18.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
past 25 years. Even pet products
retailers have signed on,
creating nonprofits that have

40:18.149 --> 40:22.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
donated millions of
dollars to TNR groups.

40:22.820 --> 40:26.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bryan Kortis spent the last five
years managing TNR grants for
PetSmart Charities.

40:26.691 --> 40:31.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRYAN KORTIS, PetSmart
Charities: PetSmart Charities,
in wanting to end cat
overpopulation,

40:31.229 --> 40:35.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has embraced trap, neuter,
return as the most effective way
to make that happen.

40:35.199 --> 40:38.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: TNR's
expansion alarms wildlife
conservation groups.

40:38.836 --> 40:41.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GRANT SIZEMORE, American Bird
Conservancy: This is an emerging
conservation crisis.

40:41.839 --> 40:44.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: Grant
Sizemore directs the invasive

40:44.909 --> 40:47.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Bird Conservancy in
Washington, D.C.

40:47.545 --> 40:53.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GRANT SIZEMORE: There were zero
domestic cats in North America
in 1492, which means that

40:53.151 --> 40:58.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we now have well over 100
million invasive predators
roaming the landscape, killing
wildlife.

40:58.723 --> 41:02.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: Sizemore
cites a study from the
Smithsonian Conservation Biology

41:02.093 --> 41:07.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Institute that estimates cats
kill around 2.4 billion birds
and 12.3 billion mammals

41:07.365 --> 41:10.668 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every year.

41:10.668 --> 41:14.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Jekyll Island in Southern
Georgia, Dr. Sonia Hernandez and
her research team are

41:14.739 --> 41:19.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seeing this from the cats'
perspective. They're putting
cameras on cats.

41:19.344 --> 41:23.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. SONIA HERNANDEZ, University
of Georgia: So far, we have been
able to collar 31 cats.

41:23.948 --> 41:27.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that a majority of them
do hunt, despite the fact that
they get fed.

41:27.719 --> 41:32.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: The cat
camera footage shows that even
well-fed cats in TNR programs

41:32.457 --> 41:41.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hunt anything they can get their
paws on. They're just hard-wired
to hunt. And the food

41:41.265 --> 41:45.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
used to attract the cats and
trap them also draws in other
predators that can cause
problems.

41:45.670 --> 41:50.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Raccoons, skunks, and possums
compete with the cats for food.

41:50.541 --> 41:55.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. SONIA HERNANDEZ: We want to
be very careful that we don't
encourage a lot of wildlife

41:55.646 --> 42:02.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
coming together, sharing
pathogens, and then potentially
bringing that to people.

42:02.687 --> 42:06.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: Back in
Antioch, California, public
health concerns prompted the
city to

42:06.290 --> 42:09.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
propose a ban on feeding
cats on public property.

42:09.427 --> 42:12.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: The cats are not
the villains in this.

42:12.263 --> 42:14.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: There
was stiff opposition.

42:14.665 --> 42:19.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GIRL: They don't deserve to
starve. They deserve to have a
right to live.

42:19.804 --> 42:23.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I'm not afraid of a cat
urinating on my foot. I'm afraid
of the meth heads that

42:23.307 --> 42:26.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
go around my building
and threaten me.

DR. JULIE LEVY, Operation
Catnip: How are things going
over here?

42:30.515 --> 42:33.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: Dr. Julie
Levy is a professor of
veterinary medicine and is
considered the

42:33.751 --> 42:40.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
preeminent feral cat researcher
in the country. She runs one of
America's largest trap, neuter,

42:40.458 --> 42:45.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
return programs. It's called
Operation Catnip, and it
receives support from PetSmart
Charities.

42:45.863 --> 42:50.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. JULIE LEVY: I'm very
confident we're going to see
this nationally as a successful
model

42:50.435 --> 42:52.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for cat population control.

42:52.970 --> 42:57.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: In many
ways, Operation Catnip is the
best-case scenario for trap,

42:57.275 --> 43:01.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
neuter, return. It's
well-funded, with a steady
stream of volunteers.

43:01.045 --> 43:06.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when a population biologist
analyzed Operation Catnip's
numbers, the results came up
short.

populations were not
significantly going

43:10.254 --> 43:15.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down. And that's probably the
single take-home lesson here.

43:15.293 --> 43:19.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: Dr. Patrick
Foley teaches at California
State University in Sacramento.

43:19.964 --> 43:24.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says there's no proof TNR
reduces large populations of
cats. They just reproduce too

43:24.202 --> 43:26.370 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
quickly.

43:26.370 --> 43:31.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. PATRICK FOLEY: Imagine
introducing a single pregnant
female cat to an island. She
could

43:31.008 --> 43:34.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
produce three female kittens,
plus herself, by the end of the
year. That means the population

43:34.846 --> 43:39.784 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
will multiply by
four in one year.

43:39.784 --> 43:45.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, next year, if the same
thing happens, then there will
be 16, the year after that

43:45.556 --> 43:49.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
64. If you had money in the bank
at that kind of rate, you would
be delighted. You would,

43:49.560 --> 43:54.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in fact, be owning the world
after a very few years. And so
would cats.

43:54.732 --> 43:58.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: According
to Foley's calculations,
Operation Catnip would need

43:58.636 --> 44:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to spay about 75 percent of the
female cats in the county in
order to make this work.

44:04.242 --> 44:08.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's roughly 10 times more
than they're able to do right
now.

44:08.546 --> 44:13.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I asked Bryan Kortis why
PetSmart Charities is involved
with a nationwide campaign, when

44:13.518 --> 44:17.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the research doesn't show that
it works on large cat
populations.

44:17.321 --> 44:21.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRYAN KORTIS: I'm totally
comfortable with trap, neuter,
return moving forward on a much

44:21.659 --> 44:28.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
larger scale than it has in the
past, even though we don't have
100 percent scientific

44:28.065 --> 44:34.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
proof that's been peer-reviewed
and published that it works on
that large of a scale.

44:34.605 --> 44:37.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: While
Kortis remains committed to the
trap, neuter and return of

44:37.808 --> 44:43.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feral cats, his employer is
reconsidering. Since we recorded
this interview with Kortis,

44:43.080 --> 44:47.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PetSmart Charities announced
late last year that it was
laying off its entire staff.

44:47.785 --> 44:52.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a statement sent to us, a
spokesperson said: "The
organization is reassessing its

44:52.390 --> 44:55.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
programs, including its support
of trap, neuter, return, but
they will honor all existing
grant

44:55.860 --> 44:58.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
commitments."

44:58.563 --> 45:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Although one of the biggest
funders of trap, neuter and
return is having second
thoughts,

45:03.100 --> 45:09.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the feral cat movement continues
to gain political clout. Last
month, after a long standoff,

45:09.607 --> 45:14.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Antioch's cat feeders prevailed.
The city council granted Susan
Smith and her allies

45:14.612 --> 45:21.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the right to feed as part of an
official trap, neuter and return
program.

45:21.886 --> 45:26.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When it comes to controlling
cats, it's not only about
science. It's about our
emotions.

45:26.824 --> 45:31.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in the court of public
opinion, it seems that America
will always back the cat.

45:31.762 --> 45:36.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For "PBS NewsHour," I'm Adithya
Sambamurthy in Antioch,
California.

45:36.267 --> 45:41.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, earlier
this week, I was in New York and
spoke with Adithya Sambamurthy.

45:41.038 --> 45:45.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As your piece points out, there
is still some question about the
effectiveness of this approach.

45:45.076 --> 45:48.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, why are companies and
charities putting money behind
it?

45:48.512 --> 45:52.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: Well, it's
a good question. And it's one
that I put to PetSmart
Charities.

45:52.516 --> 45:58.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the response that I got is
that the founders of the company
want to end homelessness -- cat

45:58.856 --> 46:02.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
homelessness. They want to end
the euthanasia of cats in
shelters. And they believe that

46:02.994 --> 46:06.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this is the best approach.

46:06.030 --> 46:10.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you look at it through
strictly a, you know, animal
rights, animal welfare
perspective,

46:10.901 --> 46:15.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there is something to be
said for it. The problem is
that, at the city level,

46:15.206 --> 46:19.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at county level, when you're
talking about many thousands of
cats, the research just

46:19.343 --> 46:22.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doesn't show that it's
working at that level.

46:22.179 --> 46:26.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK, so let's
talk about the societal impact.
How significant of a

46:26.183 --> 46:29.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
problem is this in
different communities?

46:29.253 --> 46:33.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: The study
that I reference is the
University of Georgia's cat
camera

46:33.290 --> 46:38.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
study. And what's really
interesting here is that, even
if you feed cats on a daily

46:38.295 --> 46:41.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basis and you spay and neuter
them, they are still going to go
out and hunt. They're
instinctual

46:41.432 --> 46:44.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
predators.

46:44.435 --> 46:49.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The University of Georgia shows
that cats are not just killing
mice and rats. They're

46:49.273 --> 46:56.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killing frogs, a surprising
number of them, reptiles,
amphibians, small mammals, and
birds.

46:56.047 --> 47:00.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so if you have vulnerable
species in your community, it's
a problem.

47:00.051 --> 47:07.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there any
way to domesticate a feral cat
if you catch them young enough?

47:07.024 --> 47:12.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY: Yes, I did
that. We -- I have adopted a
kitten that was born to a feral

47:12.630 --> 47:16.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mother. And he's doing really
well and he loves humans.

47:16.467 --> 47:22.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So he's definitely tame now.
But, for adult feral cats, it's
very rare. And it's not a

47:22.139 --> 47:25.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policy prescription. We're not
going to adopt our way out of
this problem.

47:25.209 --> 47:27.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You talk a
little bit about the law of
large numbers here. How do you

47:27.945 --> 47:33.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever get control of a population
that's multiplying as quickly as
these cats are?

47:33.117 --> 47:35.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY:
It's really difficult.

47:35.386 --> 47:41.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the one thing that I found
is that this is a largely
volunteer-driven effort. The

47:41.859 --> 47:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
movement to, you know, sterilize
these cats and put them back
outside is largely driven

47:46.697 --> 47:49.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by volunteers, who are
incredibly hardworking. They
have jobs. They have families.
And they

47:49.500 --> 47:52.903 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do this work.

47:52.903 --> 47:56.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Unfortunately, as I'm finding,
it's not proving to work at that
scale. It's just a really

47:56.173 --> 47:58.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
difficult endeavor.

47:58.309 --> 48:02.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Adithya
Sambamurthy joining us from San
Francisco from "Reveal" and the

48:02.179 --> 48:04.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Center for Investigative
Reporting, thanks so much.

48:04.048 --> 48:06.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ADITHYA SAMBAMURTHY:
Thank you, Hari.

48:06.217 --> 48:08.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For more on
this story, visit "Reveal," the
investigative public radio

show, at RevealNews.org.

48:28.939 --> 48:31.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Finally tonight, a
"NewsHour" essay.

48:31.642 --> 48:36.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What better way to battle
discrimination than with pop
culture? Or so thought Haroon
Moghul,

48:36.447 --> 48:41.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when he asked J.J. Abrams in an
open letter to add an Islamic
character to "Star Wars."

48:41.218 --> 48:43.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's more of his thoughts on
why a Jedi named Mohammad could
help fight fear with

48:43.988 --> 48:46.157 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hope.

48:46.157 --> 48:49.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAROON MOGHUL, Author: The day
before "The Force Awakens" was
released, I wrote an open

48:49.860 --> 48:54.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
letter to its director, J.J.
Abrams, who also rebooted "Star
Trek."

48:54.598 --> 48:58.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With tensions between Muslims
and our neighbors worse than I
had ever known, I asked Abrams

48:58.669 --> 49:01.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to add a positive Muslim
character to one of these
franchises, maybe, I mused, a
Jedi

49:01.972 --> 49:05.409 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
named Mohammed.

49:05.409 --> 49:08.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But many readers were
dismissive. One wrote simply
that Star Wars was set a long
time

49:08.979 --> 49:14.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ago in a galaxy far, far away,
where Islam doesn't exist.

49:14.285 --> 49:19.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By missing my point, he made my
point. We can accept a Ben
Kenobi, though Ben's a Hebrew

49:19.590 --> 49:23.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
name. We don't seem to have any
trouble with Luke Skywalker,
even though Luke was also

49:23.994 --> 49:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the 12 apostles. Captain
Jim Kirk, great, but a Captain
Hussein Kirk, that made

49:29.533 --> 49:33.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some readers think I wanted
Sharia law on the bridge, when I
had said no such thing.

49:33.938 --> 49:40.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I only wanted us to confront how
we treat Muslims. Islamophobia
is real, and it's ugly.

49:40.044 --> 49:42.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Robert Doggart allegedly planned
to attack Muslims in New York
with guns, bombs, even

49:42.813 --> 49:44.882 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a machete.

49:44.882 --> 49:51.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A former Klan member, Glendon
Crawford, tried to build a
radioactive weapon to attack
mosques.

49:51.622 --> 49:57.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
People have been kicked,
punched, stabbed, shot,
murdered, even pushed in front
of trains,

49:57.294 --> 50:01.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
targeted for their faith
and their faith alone.

50:01.098 --> 50:05.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Islamophobia is like racism, not
because Islam is a race, but
because, for anti-Muslim bigots,

50:05.936 --> 50:10.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Islam functions in the exact
same way that race does for
racists.

50:10.708 --> 50:15.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That doesn't mean I deny the
terrible violence committed by
some Muslims, sometimes in
Islam's

50:15.446 --> 50:19.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
name. That doesn't mean I don't
respect everyone's right to
contest ideas and beliefs they
don't

50:19.516 --> 50:25.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agree with, including my own. It
just means I think judging every
single Muslim by the

50:25.122 --> 50:28.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actions of a few, especially
when nearly every Muslim
institution and organization
condemns

50:28.792 --> 50:33.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
those actions, is a problem.

50:33.163 --> 50:37.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What someone thinks of Islam
depends a lot on whether she
knows any Muslims. The challenge

50:37.701 --> 50:43.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that, out of 322 million
Americans, only a few million
are Muslim. Even in a
transporter,

50:43.641 --> 50:46.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how could we meet and greet
everyone in time to change
minds?

50:46.277 --> 50:52.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is why I wrote that letter
to J.J. Abrams in The Washington
Post. Science fiction and

50:52.683 --> 50:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fantasy, whether books or
movies, are an astonishingly
effective ways to reach huge
numbers of people,

50:57.288 --> 51:01.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to reflect us back to ourselves,
and to provoke us to think
differently.

51:01.725 --> 51:05.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The original "Star Trek"
featured an African
communications officer, a
Russian navigator

51:05.996 --> 51:10.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a Japanese helmsman, not to
mention a half-Vulcan,
half-human first officer. That

51:10.768 --> 51:16.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was back in the 1960s, during
the civil rights era, at the
height of the Cold War, just a

51:16.307 --> 51:20.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
few decades from Japanese
internment camps. Yet the
television show was wildly
popular,

51:20.577 --> 51:25.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it still is, as are the many
spinoffs that grew out of it.

51:25.149 --> 51:29.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It didn't matter where all those
characters came from, but where
they were going, where

51:29.219 --> 51:33.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no one had gone before. It gave
us a vision for our divided
planet, of a united future

51:33.223 --> 51:36.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we could want, not dread.

51:36.660 --> 51:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can we see someone of a Muslim
background being part of that
future too? I hope so.

51:42.166 --> 51:46.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People often ask me, how can
ordinary folks fight extremism
and intolerance? I tell them,

51:46.337 --> 51:50.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by imagining a world that's not
just different, but better. You
don't fight fear with fear.

51:50.441 --> 52:07.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You fight fear with hope.
