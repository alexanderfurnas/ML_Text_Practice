THE WAY TO SIT DOWN WITH THE

>> I'M REALLY NOT SURPRISED.

02:18.233 --> 02:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN FRANKLY THIS IS A

02:19.833 --> 02:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY TESTING PROGRAM, SO WE

02:22.366 --> 02:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT THE

02:23.500 --> 02:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REST OF US THINK.

02:24.466 --> 02:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN EVEN THOUGH THE NEW SOUTH

NORTH KOREANS, FRANKLY SPEAKING,

02:33.633 --> 02:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T THINK THEY REALLY CARE

02:34.766 --> 02:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO THIS IS THE RESULT.

02:36.466 --> 02:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ARE THE

02:37.133 --> 02:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTS IN NORTH KOREA RIGHT

02:40.333 --> 02:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW?

02:43.200 --> 02:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, WE SEEM TO HEAR THAT AT

02:44.566 --> 02:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAST THERE IS SOME DIPLOMATIC

02:45.700 --> 02:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GESTURE TO THE UNITED STATES TO

02:47.366 --> 02:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRY TO GET TALKS GOING BUT

02:49.600 --> 02:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEITHER SIDE CAN AGREE ON WHAT

02:50.933 --> 02:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PRECONDITIONS CAN BE TO GET

02:52.133 --> 02:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE TALKS TO START.

02:53.666 --> 02:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> FRANKLY WHEN THE U.S. TALKS

02:54.866 --> 02:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT PRECONDITIONS WHAT THEY

02:55.766 --> 02:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE TRYING TO SAY IS WE WILL

02:57.500 --> 02:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALK TO THE NORTH KOREANS ON THE

02:59.466 --> 03:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASIS OF GETTING RID OF THE

03:01.933 --> 03:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUCLEAR WEAPONS, SOMETHING THEY

03:03.400 --> 03:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALREADY AGREED TO WAY BACK IN

03:05.200 --> 03:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2005.

03:06.633 --> 03:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THE NORTH KOREANS SAY THEY

03:08.066 --> 03:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL TALK TO THE U.S., IT HAS TO

03:10.266 --> 03:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO WITH ONE NUCLEAR POWER TO

03:11.633 --> 03:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANOTHER.

03:12.500 --> 03:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: DOES THE

03:13.266 --> 03:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIONSHIP THAT THE UNITED

03:14.266 --> 03:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES HAS WITH CHINA AND

03:15.966 --> 03:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIA, ARE THEY STRONG ENOUGH

03:17.500 --> 03:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HAVE LEVERAGE ON NORTH KOREA?

03:19.100 --> 03:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE

03:20.466 --> 03:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN WORKING SO FAR?

03:22.133 --> 03:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, CERTAINLY PRESIDENT

03:23.466 --> 03:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP HAS INVESTED A LOT AND A

03:25.966 --> 03:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY SERIOUS EFFORT TO BRING

03:27.300 --> 03:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CHINESE ON BOARD.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE'S MADE IT CLEAR TO THE

03:30.300 --> 03:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHINESE, LOOK, WE HAVE A LOT OF

03:31.800 --> 03:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUES BUT THIS IS NUMBER ONE.

03:32.933 --> 03:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK THAT'S KIND OF A GOOD

03:34.800 --> 03:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPROACH FOR THE CHINESE IN

03:36.500 --> 03:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIND OF KEEPING AT THEM ON THIS

03:38.033 --> 03:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MAKING SURE THAT AT A

03:39.900 --> 03:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINIMUM THE U.N. SANCTIONS ARE

03:41.733 --> 03:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FULLY LIVED UP TO.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE CHINA HAS WORK TO DO.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH RESPECT TO RUSSIA, I THINK

03:47.066 --> 03:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S KIND OF A SECONDARY ISSUE.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY SEEM TO BE MORE FOCUSED ON

03:50.900 --> 03:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER THERE IS ANYTHING THEY

03:51.833 --> 03:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN DO TOGETHER IN SYRIA.

03:53.533 --> 03:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> MEANWHILE OUR ALLIES, JAPAN

03:54.966 --> 03:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SOUTH KOREA ARE IN THE

INCREASING.

03:59.600 --> 04:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:00.900 --> 04:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREASING.

04:01.733 --> 04:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE DOWNSIDE, OF COURSE,

04:02.566 --> 04:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF TALKING TO THE CHINESE IS

04:03.866 --> 04:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOTH THE JAPANESE AND SOUTH

04:05.366 --> 04:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KOREANS GET A LITTLE NERVOUS

04:06.733 --> 04:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THAT.

04:07.733 --> 04:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESPECIALLY AS WE HAVE NO

04:08.666 --> 04:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMBASSADORS IN THE REGION,

04:09.933 --> 04:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY DON'T FEEL REASSURED

04:11.200 --> 04:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THE TIME.

04:12.366 --> 04:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN PARTICULAR, THE SOUTH

04:14.133 --> 04:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KOREANS ARE CONCERNED WHEN THEY

04:15.666 --> 04:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALK TO THE CHINESE, THAT IT

04:17.500 --> 04:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPEARS TO BE, YOU ARE TALKING

04:18.866 --> 04:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE KOREAN PENINSULA, YOU

04:20.500 --> 04:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THEM WITHOUT THEM.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE

04:24.466 --> 04:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIND OF ENGAGE WITH THEM ON A

04:26.833 --> 04:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:29.333 --> 04:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THAT THE COURSE THE

04:30.566 --> 04:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:31.533 --> 04:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSIDERING THAT NORTH KOREA HAS

04:32.966 --> 04:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN SO FLAGRANTLY VIOLATING SO

04:35.466 --> 04:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY OF THE AGREEMENTS THAT THEY

04:36.500 --> 04:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE?

04:37.266 --> 04:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:40.233 --> 04:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THE

04:41.700 --> 04:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORTH KOREANS HAVE THE SLIGHTEST

INTEREST IN DENUCLEARIZATION.

04:45.100 --> 04:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK KIM JUNG UN'S FATHER DID

04:46.933 --> 04:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND CERTAINLY CARED WHAT THE

04:48.466 --> 04:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHINESE THOUGHT.

04:49.900 --> 04:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT KIM JUNG UN DOESN'T SEEM TO

04:51.866 --> 04:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARE AT ALL WHAT CHINA THINGS,

04:57.200 --> 04:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES.

05:05.766 --> 05:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST THAT KIND OF A STATEMENT

05:07.433 --> 05:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALONE, COULD YOU HAVE IMAGINED

05:09.133 --> 05:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

A FORMULATION LIKE THAT BUT

05:18.733 --> 05:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LET'S UNDERSTAND, OUR PRESIDENT,

05:20.166 --> 05:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL OF THESE KINDS OF ISSUES ARE

05:21.466 --> 05:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEW TO HIM.

05:22.066 --> 05:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK HE WAS PROBABLY

TRYING TO SAY TO THE CHINESE

05:25.100 --> 05:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK, I'M WILLING TO BE POLITE

COME FORWARD.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY IN

05:30.300 --> 05:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CONTEXT OF TRYING TO SHOW

05:31.966 --> 05:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:13.600 --> 20:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYBODY SORT OF SAID OH, LOOK,

20:15.700 --> 20:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE SO MUCH BETTER THAN WE

20:17.333 --> 20:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USED TO BE.

20:18.033 --> 20:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
800 WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY USED

20:19.300 --> 20:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DIE EVERY DAY IN CHILD BIRTH.

20:23.833 --> 20:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'VE LIVED THAT PROBLEM.

20:25.466 --> 20:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEANWHILE BABIES ARE DYING,

20:27.066 --> 20:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LET'S FOCUS ON THE BABIES.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WE'VE SORT OF TAKEN THE OUR

20:30.900 --> 20:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EYE OFF MATERNAL HEALTH.

20:32.166 --> 20:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT

20:33.533 --> 20:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE KINDS OF SAFETY, REALLY

20:35.200 --> 20:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASIC SAFETY THINGS THAT NEED TO

20:36.833 --> 20:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE PUT AM PLACE JUST TO KEEP

20:38.666 --> 20:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOMS SAFE.

20:39.366 --> 20:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S A LITTLE BIG PART OF

20:40.800 --> 20:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IS HAPPENING.

20:41.933 --> 20:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S THAT 60% OF THE DEATHS IN

20:44.133 --> 20:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE U.S., AT LEAST, ARE

20:46.600 --> 20:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREVENTABLE.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU ALSO SEEM

20:49.033 --> 20:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE NOT A

20:51.033 --> 20:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STANDARD HOSPITAL PROTOCOL TO

20:52.033 --> 20:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEAL WITH COMPLICATIONS, SO

20:54.033 --> 20:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY THE ONES THAT COULD HAVE

20:56.433 --> 20:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN PREVENT DEATH END UP

20:58.266 --> 20:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASCADING OUT OF CONTROL INTO

20:59.300 --> 21:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER.

21:00.733 --> 21:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES.

21:01.100 --> 21:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO AGAIN, NONE OF THIS IS, YOU

21:04.133 --> 21:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW, THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE

21:05.833 --> 21:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONE TO PREVENT WOMEN FROM DYING

OR NEARLY DYING IN CHILD BIRTH

21:10.533 --> 21:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE U.S. ARE PRETTY

21:11.800 --> 21:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL-KNOWN.

21:12.466 --> 21:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:15.133 --> 21:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CALLED PREECLAMPSIA.

PREECLAMPSIA IN THE U.S.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S TEXT BOOK, EVERYBODY KNOWS

21:25.266 --> 21:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.

21:26.366 --> 21:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS NOT THAT HER CAREGIVERS

21:27.900 --> 21:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEREN'T GOOD DOCTORS BUT DIDN'T

21:29.400 --> 21:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RECOGNIZE WHAT WAS GOING ON

21:30.600 --> 21:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T ON THE SAME

PAGE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT THE

21:33.066 --> 21:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STANDARDS ARE.

21:34.033 --> 21:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT WE SHOULD DO WHEN

21:35.833 --> 21:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAIN STANDARDS HIT.

21:37.366 --> 21:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OVERALL IN THE U.S. I THINK

21:39.066 --> 21:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE

21:41.666 --> 21:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATERNAL COMPLICATIONS ARE

21:42.866 --> 21:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUGHT NOT TO BE VERY COMMON

21:45.100 --> 21:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY MUCH MORE

21:47.033 --> 21:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMON THAN DOCTORS AND NURSES

21:49.800 --> 21:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALIZE.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
