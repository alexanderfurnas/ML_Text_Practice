AN ANCIENT CREATURE.

04:17.033 --> 04:18.767
WHERE IT WILL BE STUDIED AND

04:18.767 --> 04:20.200
THEN PUT ON DISPLAY.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.967
>>> AND NASA'S LABORATORY SAID

04:22.967 --> 04:24.300
IT HAS SOLVED THE MYSTERY OF

04:24.300 --> 04:26.167
WHAT LOOKS LIKE A DOUGHNUT THA

04:26.167 --> 04:28.800
APPEARED ON THE SURFACE OF MARS.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.733
THESE WERE BEFORE AND AFTE

04:29.733 --> 04:31.600
PICTURES OF THE SAME SPOT TAKE

04:31.600 --> 04:32.700
13 DAYS APART.

04:32.700 --> 04:33.700
NOW SCIENTISTS SAY THEY KNOW

04:33.700 --> 04:35.067
WHAT THE OBJECT ON THE RIGHT IS,

04:35.067 --> 04:37.233
AND IT'S NOT A DOUGHNUT.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.700
INSTEAD, THEY SAY IT'S JUST

04:38.700 --> 04:42.067
SMALL PIECE OF ROCK THAT BROKE

04:42.067 --> 04:43.700
OFF AND PUSHED IT INTO VIEW.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.500
OTHERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT TH

04:46.500 --> 04:49.500
OBJECT MIGHT BE A FUNGUS-LIK

04:49.500 --> 04:50.133
ORGANISM

04:50.133 --> 04:50.167
WHICH MEANS THERE WAS LIFE O

04:50.167 --> 05:01.667
THE PLANET

05:01.667 --> 05:03.533
>>> WE WANT TO GO MORE DEEPL

05:03.533 --> 05:06.000
INTO THE IMPORTANT UNION VOTE IN

05:06.000 --> 05:06.167
TENNESSEE.

05:06.167 --> 05:08.900
FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY JIM

05:08.900 --> 05:11.300
WHO'S BEEN COVERING THE STOR

05:11.300 --> 05:13.100
FOR BLOOMBERG NEWS

05:13.100 --> 05:14.433
WHY WAS THIS SO SIGNIFICANT?

05:14.433 --> 05:16.233
>> IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FIRS

05:16.233 --> 05:18.800
FOR THE UNION, FOR THE UAW T

05:18.800 --> 05:22.400
ACTUALLY ORGANIZE A PLANT IN THE

05:22.400 --> 05:22.533
SOUTH.

05:22.533 --> 05:25.600
A FOREIGN-OWNED CAR MAKER.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.133
AND THAT WAS THE SIGNIFICANCE.

05:27.133 --> 05:28.633
IT WAS SEEN AS A CHANCE FOR THEM

05:28.633 --> 05:30.667
TO GET A FOOTHOLD IN A REGIO

05:30.667 --> 05:33.267
THAT'S TRADITIONALLY REALL

05:33.267 --> 05:36.067
DIFFICULT FOR UNION ORGANIZING

05:36.067 --> 05:38.000
AND THAT WAS PRIMARILY THE

05:38.000 --> 05:38.433
SIGNIFICANCE THERE

05:38.433 --> 05:39.967
>> MOST OF THESE ARE RIGHT T

05:39.967 --> 05:40.700
WORK STATES.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.967
WHAT WERE THE OUTSIDE FORCES

05:42.967 --> 05:45.400
THAT WERE USING THIS AS SORT O

05:45.400 --> 05:47.600
THEIR BIG BATTLE GROUND?

05:47.600 --> 05:53.533
>> WELL, YOU HAD REPUBLICA

05:53.533 --> 05:54.033
POLITICIANS.

05:54.033 --> 05:58.167
SENATOR CORKER AND STATE

05:58.167 --> 05:58.633
SENATORS AS WELL, STAT

05:58.633 --> 05:58.900
POLITICIANS.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.533
THEIR ARGUMENT WAS THAT THIS

06:00.533 --> 06:02.567
WOULD BASICALLY MAKE THE

06:02.567 --> 06:04.600
STATEMENTS COMPETITIVE

06:04.600 --> 06:05.433
COMPANIES WOULD LOOK A

06:05.433 --> 06:06.867
TENNESSEE AND THINK THAT'S A

06:06.867 --> 06:08.767
HIGHER CHALLENGE I COULD B

06:08.767 --> 06:09.533
FACING A UNION

06:09.533 --> 06:10.833
I'LL GO TO SOUTH CAROLINA OR

06:10.833 --> 06:13.067
ALABAMA INSTEAD.

06:13.067 --> 06:15.700
SO THEY PITCHED THAT LINE PRETTY

06:15.700 --> 06:16.033
HARD

06:16.033 --> 06:17.833
IT WAS ALSO SOME INTERES

06:17.833 --> 06:19.100
GROUPS, WASHINGTON-BASED

06:19.100 --> 06:20.133
INTEREST GROUPS THAT WERE USED

06:20.133 --> 06:26.900
THE VOTE AS A PROXY TO KIND OF

06:26.900 --> 06:27.933
ATTACK THE UNION FOR CONNECTIONS

06:27.933 --> 06:28.967
WITH THE PRESIDENT

06:28.967 --> 06:30.533
>> SO EXPLAIN ABOUT THE IDEA O

06:30.533 --> 06:33.533
THE WORKERS COUNCIL.

06:33.533 --> 06:35.500
VOLKSWAGEN SAW THIS VOTE AS

06:35.500 --> 06:36.933
WAY TO GET TO SOMETHING THEY D

06:36.933 --> 06:37.667
IN OTHER PLANTS.

06:37.667 --> 06:38.700
WHAT IS THAT

06:38.700 --> 06:42.267
>> THIS IS THE ONLY MAJO

06:42.267 --> 06:43.167
VOLKSWAGEN FACILITY THAT DOESN'T

06:43.167 --> 06:44.767
HAVE UNION AFFILIATION

06:44.767 --> 06:47.700
THE WORKS COUNCIL WAS A GERMAN

06:47.700 --> 06:49.800
SORT OF CREATION THAT GIVES TH

06:49.800 --> 06:53.000
EMPLOYEES A SEAT AT THE TABLE IN

06:53.000 --> 06:55.733
TERMS OF DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS

06:55.733 --> 06:55.767
AND STAFFING ISSUES, THINGS LIKE

06:55.767 --> 06:59.133
THAT

06:59.133 --> 07:00.900
NOT FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

07:00.900 --> 07:02.433
THAT'S THE UNION'S JOB

07:02.433 --> 07:04.267
IN GERMANY YOU HAVE WORK COUNCIL

07:04.267 --> 07:05.033
AND UNIONS

07:05.033 --> 07:07.167
THERE'S NO WORK COUNCILS IN TH

07:07.167 --> 07:07.567
U.S.

07:07.567 --> 07:09.467
THIS WAS AN EXPERIMENT IN A WAY.

07:09.467 --> 07:12.967
THE VOTE WAS TO JOIN THE UAW FOR

07:12.967 --> 07:14.100
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.133
THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UA

07:16.133 --> 07:17.833
AND VOLKSWAGEN IS THEY WOULD

07:17.833 --> 07:19.333
NEGOTIATE THE FORMATION OF A

07:19.333 --> 07:19.500
COUNCIL.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.700
>> VOLKSWAGEN WAS NOT PUSHIN

07:21.700 --> 07:22.533
THE UNION.

07:22.533 --> 07:25.300
IT JUST WANTS WHAT IT HA

07:25.300 --> 07:26.033
EVERYWHERE ELSE.

07:26.033 --> 07:27.467
>> YES

07:27.467 --> 07:29.900
>> DOES VOLKSWAGEN HAVE A CHANCE

07:29.900 --> 07:31.267
TO BUILD THAT ANY OTHER WAY?

07:31.267 --> 07:33.567
OR IS IT ILLEGAL TO DO THA

07:33.567 --> 07:34.900
WITHOUT HAVING A UNION

07:34.900 --> 07:36.733
>> WELL, TALK TO LAWYERS

07:36.733 --> 07:38.167
MOST SAY IT'S ILLEGAL TO DO IT

07:38.167 --> 07:39.067
WITHOUT A UNION.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.467
SO THAT WAS THE STEP YOU HAD T

07:41.467 --> 07:41.567
TAKE

07:41.567 --> 07:41.700
WHAT THEY CAN DO RIGHT NOW I

07:41.700 --> 07:46.100
UNCLEAR.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.000
THERE ARE OTHER TARGETS OF

07:47.000 --> 07:48.567
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE UAW IN THE

07:48.567 --> 07:49.000
SOUTH.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.300
AND LIKELY THAT THEY'RE PROBABLY

07:50.300 --> 07:52.967
GOING TO TRY AGAIN AT SOME OTHER

07:52.967 --> 07:54.967
PLANTS MAYBE IN ALABAMA OR OTHER

07:54.967 --> 07:55.400
STATES

07:55.400 --> 07:57.400
>> SO THAT'S WHERE THE UAW I

07:57.400 --> 07:59.400
GOING TO HAVE TO FOCUS NEXT?

07:59.400 --> 08:00.567
>> I THINK THAT'S THEIR BEST

08:00.567 --> 08:01.433
SHOT AT THIS POINT

08:01.433 --> 08:03.867
THIS WAS A TOUGH LOSS BECAUS

08:03.867 --> 08:06.933
THEY DID HAVE THE COMPAN

08:06.933 --> 08:10.033
NEUTRAL, YOU KNOW, GIVING NO

08:10.033 --> 08:11.233
RESISTANCE TO THE EFFORT

08:11.233 --> 08:12.967
AND THEY COULDN'T TURN IT.

08:12.967 --> 08:14.633
IT WAS A BIT OF A SURPRISE,

08:14.633 --> 08:16.700
THINK, FOR PEOPLE DOWN THERE

08:16.700 --> 08:20.700
WE TALKED TO WORKERS DOWN THER

08:20.700 --> 08:20.933
MONDAY

08:20.933 --> 08:21.633
THEY WERE CONFIDENCE THIS WA

08:21.633 --> 08:23.500
GOING TO GO THEIR WAY.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.300
I THINK IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMEN

08:24.300 --> 08:24.367
FOR SURE

08:24.367 --> 08:39.933
>> THANKS SO MUCH.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.567
THAT'S NUMBER ONE.

18:54.567 --> 18:55.100
NUMBER TWO, THERE'S TH

18:55.100 --> 18:56.733
INVESTMENT PART OF IT.

18:56.733 --> 19:00.400
AND IT'S REALLY TECHNICAL, BUT

THERE'S DOLLAR COST AVERAGIN

THAT INVESTMENT GURUS LIKE M

YOU PUT A LITTLE IN THE MARKET

19:06.167 --> 19:07.267
WITH EACH PAYCHECK

19:07.267 --> 19:08.500
IF YOU'RE NOT ONLY GETTING THA

19:08.500 --> 19:10.567
AT THE END OF THE YEAR, IT MEANS

19:10.567 --> 19:12.133
YOU'RE NOT RIDING THE UP AND

19:12.133 --> 19:13.333
DOWN MOVEMENTS OF THE MARKET

19:13.333 --> 19:14.800
YOU'RE REALLY TAKING A

19:14.800 --> 19:16.300
INVESTMENT RISK BY PUTTING A

19:16.300 --> 19:18.033
LARGE SUM OF MONEY IN THERE.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.667
>> WHAT ARE OTHER COMPANIE

DIFFERENT THINGS AT PLAY HER

19:25.600 --> 19:26.833
RIGHT NOW.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.000
CLEARLY THE UPROAR AGAINST AOL

19:29.000 --> 19:31.367
HAS A GREAT OUTCOME FOR WORKERS.

19:31.367 --> 19:33.667
BUT IBM WAS ACTUALLY THE FIRST

19:33.667 --> 19:34.833
COMPANY TO DO THIS OR THE FIRS

19:34.833 --> 19:35.867
BIG COMPANY THAT THEY WERE GOING

19:35.867 --> 19:37.400
TO PAY ONCE A YEAR

19:37.400 --> 19:42.733
THAT SAID, IBM HAS BIG BENEFITS.

19:42.733 --> 19:44.733
THEY RANK HIGHLY

19:44.733 --> 19:46.700
SO FOR THOSE WORKERS, IT DOESN'T

19:46.700 --> 19:48.600
HURT AS MUCH

19:48.600 --> 19:48.833
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

19:48.833 --> 19:49.800
THINGS HAPPENING HERE.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.167
TECH COMPANIES, FOR EXAMPLE.

19:51.167 --> 19:52.833
A COMPANY LIKE FACEBOOK DOESN'

19:52.833 --> 19:54.433
OFFER A 401(k) MATCH CURRENTLY

19:54.433 --> 19:55.433
ALTHOUGH THEY DO PLAN TO OFFER

19:55.433 --> 19:56.633
ONE LATER IN THE YEAR.

19:56.633 --> 19:58.367
>> AND WHAT ABOUT COMPANIE

19:58.367 --> 19:59.067
OFFERING MATCHES

19:59.067 --> 20:01.167
HAS THAT CHANGED OVER TIME

20:01.167 --> 20:02.800
>> DURING THE BUST WHEN TH

20:02.800 --> 20:04.967
MARKET WENT BELLY UP, A LOT OF

20:04.967 --> 20:06.200
COMPANIES HAD TO SCALE BACK ON

20:06.200 --> 20:07.033
THEIR BENEFITS TO KEEP THE

20:07.033 --> 20:07.567
LIGHTS ON.

20:07.567 --> 20:08.833
THERE WERE A LOT OF COMPANIE

20:08.833 --> 20:10.400
WHO STOPPED OFFERING THAT MATCH.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.667
IT HAS RATCHETED UP AS THE

20:12.667 --> 20:13.533
MARKET IMPROVED.

20:13.533 --> 20:15.133
BUT FOR EXAMPLE IN THE BANKING

20:15.133 --> 20:16.333
SECTOR, A LOT OF COMPANIES W

20:16.333 --> 20:18.133
WERE TALKING ABOUT NOT GETTING

20:18.133 --> 20:19.300
THAT MATCH, THEY'RE NOT GETTIN

20:19.300 --> 20:21.533
IT UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR TOO

20:21.533 --> 20:24.267
IN THAT INDUSTRY

20:24.267 --> 20:25.767
IT CAN BE VERY INDUSTR

20:25.767 --> 20:25.900
SPECIFIC

20:25.900 --> 20:27.600
>> WHAT ABOUT THIS SHIFT O

20:27.600 --> 20:28.833
SAVING MORE?

20:28.833 --> 20:30.400
ONE SAID 401(k) WOULD ENCOURAG

20:30.400 --> 20:31.600
PEOPLE TO SAVE MORE MONEY.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.000
NOW WE'VE HAD THAT RUNNING FOR

20:33.000 --> 20:34.033
20 30R YEARS

20:34.033 --> 20:35.500
HOW'S THE DATA PAN OUT

20:35.500 --> 20:37.300
>> IT'S NOT WORKING VERY WELL.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.033
THE AVERAGE WORKER HAS A PRETT

20:39.033 --> 20:40.067
LOW RETIREMENT BALANCE

20:40.067 --> 20:41.533
BUT PEOPLE WORKING AT BI

20:41.533 --> 20:43.600
COMPANIES THAT ARE SERVICED BY

20:43.600 --> 20:44.300
FIDELITY INVESTMENTS, FO

20:44.300 --> 20:45.367
EXAMPLE, AT THE END OF THE

20:45.367 --> 20:48.067
FOURTH QUARTER THEY HAD ABOU

20:48.067 --> 20:49.333
$86,000, THE AVERAGE WORKER IN

20:49.333 --> 20:49.967
THEIR PLAN

20:49.967 --> 20:51.900
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO D

20:51.900 --> 20:52.400
VERY MUCH.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.133
AND CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO PAY

20:55.133 --> 20:58.667
FOR A NURSING HOME FOR THE YEAR.

20:58.667 --> 21:00.733
>> IS THAN IT DOES THE

21:00.733 --> 21:02.000
EXECUTIVES WHO DON'T CARE MUCH

21:02.000 --> 21:03.333
ABOUT WHETHER THE COMPANY IS

21:03.333 --> 21:04.200
MATCHING THEIR 401(k).

21:04.200 --> 21:05.833
>> A COMPANY LIKE WALMART, FOR

21:05.833 --> 21:07.067
EXAMPLE, THE AVERAGE WORKE

21:07.067 --> 21:08.967
THERE HAS A BALANCE LESS THA

21:08.967 --> 21:09.200
$20,000.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.800
>> AND SO HOW DOES THAT ADD UP

21:11.800 --> 21:13.033
OVER TO BE A BIG DIFFERENCE BY

21:13.033 --> 21:14.100
THE TIME YOU RETIRE?

21:14.100 --> 21:15.300
>> IT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE BY THE

21:15.300 --> 21:17.933
TIME YOU RETIRE.

21:17.933 --> 21:19.167
AND THERE ARE SOME CHANGES

21:19.167 --> 21:19.300
HAPPENING.

21:19.300 --> 21:21.133
A LOT OF COMPANIES ARE

21:21.133 --> 21:22.600
AUTOMATICALLY INVESTING YOU IN A

21:22.600 --> 21:24.333
RETIREMENT ACCOUNT RIGHT NOW T

21:24.333 --> 21:25.567
REALLY NUDGE YOU TO PUT MONE

21:25.567 --> 21:25.700
IN

21:25.700 --> 21:26.733
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE

21:26.733 --> 21:28.067
ARE JUST PUTTING IN ENOUGH MONEY

21:28.067 --> 21:29.000
TO GET THE MATCH

21:29.000 --> 21:31.233
THEY'RE NOT PUTTING THAT MAXIMUM

21:31.233 --> 21:34.033
AMOUNT WHICH IS $17,500 THIS

21:34.033 --> 21:36.300
YEAR AND IT CHANGES EVERY YEAR

21:36.300 --> 21:37.800
IT'S MORE IF YOU'RE NEARIN

21:37.800 --> 21:38.033
RETIREMENT

21:38.033 --> 21:39.233
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO

21:39.233 --> 21:41.300
LIVE ON, FRANKLY

21:41.300 --> 21:42.867
>> SO IF YOU SHORTCHANGE

21:42.867 --> 21:45.567
YOURSELF OR SAVE $200 OR WHA

21:45.567 --> 21:47.767
NOW, HOW DOES THAT COMPOUNDING

21:47.767 --> 21:50.500
INTEREST ADD UP OVER TIME?

21:50.500 --> 21:53.233
>> SOME EXAMPLES PUT TOGETHER BY

21:53.233 --> 21:54.300
VANGUARD, THEY FOUND THE AVERAGE

21:54.300 --> 21:56.133
WORKER IS PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE

21:56.133 --> 21:58.933
ABOUT $50,000 LESS AT THE END OF

21:58.933 --> 22:01.300
EVERYTHING IF THE COMPANY DI

DIE AND THEIR CONDITION IS

22:43.900 --> 22:44.767
WITHOUT HOME

22:44.767 --> 22:48.367
AS A RESULT THE SICKEST CHILDREN

22:48.367 --> 22:52.933
CAN OPT FOR A LETHAL INJECTION

THEY'RE DOING AND ARE SUPPORTE

22:54.933 --> 22:56.967
BY THEIR PARENTS

22:56.967 --> 22:57.900
DOCTORS DON'T EXPECT MANY TO

22:57.900 --> 22:59.133
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW LAW.

22:59.133 --> 23:01.067

23:01.067 --> 23:03.667
FEEL THAT THEY CAN'T CONTINUE.

23:03.667 --> 23:05.433
THEY SAY THAT SUSTAINED A LIFE

23:05.433 --> 23:07.100
THAT IS WITHOUT HOPE AND FILLE
