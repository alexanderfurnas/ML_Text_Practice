COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, THE CAPTUR

GULF OF GUINEA

04:25.600 --> 04:26.700
GLOBAL BUSINESS IMPLICATIONS

04:26.700 --> 04:29.400
BECAUSE NIGERIA IS AFRICA'

LEADING OIL PRODUCER AND A MAJOR

SUPPLIER OF COCOA AND METALS

HEAD OF SEA LEVEL MARITIME RISK.

04:39.933 --> 04:43.600
BECAUSE OF THE MOVIE "CAPTAI

04:45.733 --> 04:47.233
WHAT ARE THE PARALLELS AND THE

04:47.233 --> 04:48.067
DISSIMILARITIES WHEN IT COMES TO

04:48.067 --> 04:49.533
WHAT'S HAPPENING OFF THE COAST

04:49.533 --> 04:50.767
OF NIGERIA

04:50.767 --> 04:52.867
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME

04:52.867 --> 04:54.167
FIRST OF ALL

04:54.167 --> 04:55.833
APPLES AND ORANGES

04:55.833 --> 04:57.100
I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING A

04:57.100 --> 04:59.667
THE SOMALI CASE, PIRACY, IT'

04:59.667 --> 05:03.033
MUCH MORE MARITIME BASED, IT

05:03.033 --> 05:04.167
ORIGINATED ON THE WATER, AND

05:04.167 --> 05:06.133
TAKES ADVANTAGE OF SHIPS, CARGOS

05:06.133 --> 05:07.567
GOING PAST SOMALIA

05:07.567 --> 05:10.333
WHEREAS IN TEARS OF NIGERIA,

05:10.333 --> 05:11.433
WE'RE LOOKING AT A FORM OF

05:11.433 --> 05:12.633
CRIMINALITY WHICH HAS EXTENDED

05:12.633 --> 05:15.100
TO THE WATER BUT WHICH I

05:15.100 --> 05:17.400
BASICALLY LAND BASED, BASED ON

05:17.400 --> 05:19.867
THE ILLEGAL BLACK MARKET FOR OIL

05:19.867 --> 05:21.600
AND ATTACKS SHIPS THAT ACTUALL

05:21.600 --> 05:24.967
OPERATE AROUND NIGERIA, GO INT

05:24.967 --> 05:26.800
AND OPERATE CLOSE TO SHORE

05:26.800 --> 05:28.500
SO IT'S VERY DIFFERENT MODELS.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.133
NIGERIA'S OIL PRODUCTION HAS

05:30.133 --> 05:32.167
MADE IT A HAVEN FOR A HUGE

05:32.167 --> 05:32.433
FIGHT.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.100
THERE'S A POLITICAL MOVEMENT

05:34.100 --> 05:35.833
THERE TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE OUT

05:35.833 --> 05:37.333
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THESE TWO

05:37.333 --> 05:39.067
ARE INTERCONNECTED, THE CRIM

05:39.067 --> 05:40.200
THAT'S HAPPENING OFFSHORE,

05:40.200 --> 05:40.533
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH OIL ON

05:40.533 --> 05:42.533
LAND

05:42.533 --> 05:44.700
>> YEAH, QUITE SO.

05:44.700 --> 05:46.600
THE GROUP THAT WE'RE LOOKING A

05:46.600 --> 05:48.000
RIGHT NOW IS POSSIBLY CONNECTE

05:48.000 --> 05:51.067
TO THE KIDNAPPING, CALLED TH

05:51.067 --> 05:53.000
M.E.N.D., MOVEMENT FOR THE

05:53.000 --> 05:56.933
EMANCIPATION OF THE NIGER DELTA.

05:56.933 --> 05:58.933
IT AGREED TO A TRUCE A FEW YEARS

05:58.933 --> 06:00.733
AGO, THE MILITANTS HAD PUT DOW

06:00.733 --> 06:02.000
THEIR GUNS AND GOTTEN BENEFITS

06:02.000 --> 06:02.600
AS WELL AS EDUCATION

06:02.600 --> 06:06.767
BUT IT SEEMS TO COME BACK UP

06:06.767 --> 06:07.000
AGAIN.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.533
IT'S BASICALLY ORGANIZING PEOPLE

06:08.533 --> 06:10.100
FROM THE NIGER DELTA WHO ARE

06:10.100 --> 06:12.633
UPSET AT THE AMOUNT OF OIL

06:12.633 --> 06:16.167
THAT'S PUMPED OUT OF THEIR PAR

06:16.167 --> 06:18.367
OF THE COUNTRY AND HOW LITTL

06:18.367 --> 06:20.367
MONEY THEY HAVE FROM THE

06:20.367 --> 06:21.567
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO SHOW FO

06:21.567 --> 06:21.833
IT

06:21.833 --> 06:23.900
>> SO IS THIS LUCRATIVE ENOUGH

06:23.900 --> 06:24.367
IS THAT WHY THIS KEEPS

06:24.367 --> 06:27.867
HAPPENING?

06:27.867 --> 06:31.067
>> IN TERMS OF THE KIDNAPPING,

06:31.067 --> 06:32.333
YES, DEFINITELY.

06:32.333 --> 06:33.967
AND ALSO WHAT'S CALLED BUNKERING

06:33.967 --> 06:35.767
WHICH IS THE STEALING OF OIL O

06:35.767 --> 06:37.067
GASOLINE PRODUCTS FROM

06:37.067 --> 06:39.567
PIPELINES.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.467
WE HAVE CRIMINAL GROUPS THAT ARE

06:41.467 --> 06:43.767
OPERATING LOOSELY WITH POLITICAL

06:43.767 --> 06:45.800
AS WELL AS OTHER AGENDAS

06:45.800 --> 06:48.033
AND THEY'VE BEEN SELF-FINANCING,

06:48.033 --> 06:49.200
DOING THIS SORT OF KIDNAPPIN

06:49.200 --> 06:50.933
MULLS STEALING OF PETROLEU

06:50.933 --> 06:52.500
PRODUCTS AND RESELLING THEM BACK

06:52.500 --> 06:53.733
INTO THE MARKET FOR YEARS NOW.

06:53.733 --> 06:54.833
>> AND WHAT ARE SOME OF TH

06:54.833 --> 06:58.233
SAFETY ISSUES OR TACTICAL ISSUES

06:58.233 --> 06:59.633
FROM THE U.S. PERSPECTIVE TO TRY

06:59.633 --> 07:02.067
TO GET THESE HOSTAGES OUT?

07:02.067 --> 07:03.933
>> THERE ARE MANY THINGS THA

07:03.933 --> 07:04.900
COULD GO WRONG

07:04.900 --> 07:07.333
WE WERE WORRIED ABOU

07:07.333 --> 07:08.500
IDENTIFYING THE GROUP TO FIN

07:08.500 --> 07:10.600
OUT IF THEY'RE DISCIPLINED

07:10.600 --> 07:11.933
THERE COULD BE RIVALRIES AND

07:11.933 --> 07:13.833
FIGHTS AMONG THE GANG MEMBERS.

07:13.833 --> 07:14.767
THERE COULD BE OTHER GANGS THA

07:14.767 --> 07:16.633
WOULD WANT TO KIDNAP THESE TWO

07:16.633 --> 07:17.900
AMERICANS BECAUSE THEY HAVE HIGH

07:17.900 --> 07:18.433
RESALE VALUE

07:18.433 --> 07:19.567
WE COULD LOOK AT A PROBLEM THI

07:19.567 --> 07:21.533
TERMS OF A BOTCHED MILITAR

07:21.533 --> 07:23.533
RESPONSE IF THE NIGERIAN OR AN

07:23.533 --> 07:24.833
OTHER GOVERNMENT WERE TO MOVE IN

07:24.833 --> 07:26.567
TOO QUICKLY.

07:26.567 --> 07:27.300
IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT PEOPLE

07:27.300 --> 07:29.433
COULD GET KILLED IN TH

07:29.433 --> 07:29.667
OPERATION.

07:29.667 --> 07:30.967
AND KIDNAPPERS IN THAT PART OF

07:30.967 --> 07:32.567
THE WORLD HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO

07:32.567 --> 07:34.567
KILL THEIR HOSTAGES WHEN THE

07:34.567 --> 07:35.867

14:45.533 --> 14:46.733
HERE ISN'T GOING TO DO IT FO

14:46.733 --> 14:47.500
THE RIGHT REASONS?

14:47.500 --> 14:49.433
>> THAT PERSON'S MOTIVATED, THEY

14:49.433 --> 14:50.767
CAN CERTAINLY FIND IT OUT ON

14:50.767 --> 14:51.533
THEIR OWN.

14:51.533 --> 14:52.833
THIS ISN'T HIDDEN INFORMATION.

14:52.833 --> 14:53.967
SOMEONE DETERMINED TO BREAK INTO

14:53.967 --> 14:56.633
A SYSTEM, THEY CAN TAKE NORMAL

14:56.633 --> 14:57.767
COURSES AND ADD THIS HOW AM

14:57.767 --> 15:00.400
GOING TO RUIN THE WORLD MINDSE

15:00.400 --> 15:00.933
TO IT.

15:00.933 --> 15:02.467
IT'S THE SAME WAY A LOCKSMIT

15:02.467 --> 15:05.133
WHO KNOWS HOW TO FIX LOCKS CAN

15:05.133 --> 15:05.967
ALSO BREAK INTO THEM

15:05.967 --> 15:07.100
>> Reporter: CYBER SECURIT

15:07.100 --> 15:08.333
CONSULTANT STEWART BAKER SAY

15:08.333 --> 15:10.033
SOMETIMES IT MAKES SENSE FOR A

15:10.033 --> 15:11.333
COMPANY THAT'S BEEN THE TARGET

15:11.333 --> 15:14.267
OF BAD GUY HACKERS TO ENGAGE I

15:14.267 --> 15:15.767
THE LITTLE DIGITAL BREAKING AN

15:15.767 --> 15:17.800
ENTERING OF ITS OWN, TO HACK

15:17.800 --> 15:18.267
BACK, IN OTHER WORDS

15:18.267 --> 15:20.100
HE THINKS IT COULD BE AN

15:20.100 --> 15:21.400
IMPORTANT WEAPON IN THE CYBE

15:21.400 --> 15:24.267
SECURITY ARSENAL

15:24.267 --> 15:25.533
BUT IT ISN'T SO CLEAR-CU

15:25.533 --> 15:27.467
ETHICALLY OR LEGALLY, BECAUSE IT

15:27.467 --> 15:29.600
CAN VIOLATE FEDERAL COMPUTER

15:29.600 --> 15:30.033
SECURITY LAWS.

15:30.033 --> 15:33.800
>> I HAVE BEEN MAKING A VERY

15:33.800 --> 15:36.133
PUBLIC ARGUMENT THAT WE SHOULD

15:36.133 --> 15:37.600
ALLOW THIS

15:37.600 --> 15:39.133
AND WE SHOULD READ THE COMPUTE

15:39.133 --> 15:40.267
FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT TO PERMI

15:40.267 --> 15:40.533
IT

15:40.533 --> 15:42.567
>> WHAT IF THE MACHINE QUESTIO

15:42.567 --> 15:44.033
IS OUTSIDE THE U.S.?

15:44.033 --> 15:45.267
IS IT STILL A VIOLATION OF THE

15:45.267 --> 15:45.400
ACT?

15:45.400 --> 15:46.667
>> UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS.

15:46.667 --> 15:48.700
>> Reporter: BAKER SAYS GOOD GUY

15:48.700 --> 15:49.867
HACKERS WHO HAVE HACKED BACK

15:49.867 --> 15:51.500
HAVE LEARNED THAT CYBE

15:51.500 --> 15:52.500
CRIMINALS AREN'T ALWAYS AS

15:52.500 --> 15:54.200
CLEVER AS THEY SEEM TO BE.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.833
TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF A HACKER WHO

15:56.833 --> 15:58.100
BROKE INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT

15:58.100 --> 15:59.600
COMPUTERS, COPIED PERSONAL

15:59.600 --> 16:01.100
INFORMATION ABOUT OFFICERS, AN

16:01.100 --> 16:02.867
POSTED IT ONLINE

16:02.867 --> 16:05.400
HE ALSO LEFT A PROVOCATIVE

16:05.400 --> 16:06.900
PICTURE OF HIS GIRLFRIEND AS A

16:06.900 --> 16:07.500
CALLING CARD

16:07.500 --> 16:09.733
WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A

16:09.733 --> 16:10.733
MISTAKE.

16:10.733 --> 16:14.533
>> THEY TOOK THE PICTURE WITH AN

16:14.533 --> 16:15.467
iPHONE

16:15.467 --> 16:20.000
AND THAT MEANT THAT SOMEBODY HAD

16:20.000 --> 16:21.200
HELPFULLY INCLUDED THE

16:21.200 --> 16:22.767
GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES WHERE THE

16:22.767 --> 16:24.033
PICTURE WAS TAKEN.

16:24.033 --> 16:26.900
SO THE FBI FINDS THE GIRLFRIEN

16:26.900 --> 16:30.533
OF THE HACKER AND WENT AND

16:30.533 --> 16:33.200
BUSTED THE GUY IN TEXAS.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.000
SO THESE DIGITAL CLUES ARE

16:34.000 --> 16:34.400
EVERYWHERE

16:34.400 --> 16:36.267
>> Reporter: THE HACKER PLEADE

16:36.267 --> 16:39.033
GUILTY TO ACCESSING A PROTECTE

16:39.033 --> 16:39.600
COMPUTER WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION

16:39.600 --> 16:42.033
AND RECEIVED A SENTENCE OF 2

16:42.033 --> 16:43.133
MONTHS IN PRISON

16:43.133 --> 16:44.667
STEWART BAKER SAYS THAT'S TH

16:44.667 --> 16:46.633
KIND OF OUTCOME HE'D LIKE TO SEE

16:46.633 --> 16:48.867
FROM GOOD GUY HACKERS LIKE THE

16:48.867 --> 16:53.700
STUDENTS AT CARNEGIE MELLON.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.300
HEAR MORE FROM THE STUDENT

17:06.633 --> 17:08.633
AGAINST AUTHORITIES IN SAUDI

17:08.633 --> 17:09.233
ARABIA TODAY

17:09.233 --> 17:11.400
WOMEN PUSHED BACK AGAINST

17:11.400 --> 17:12.567
LONG-STANDING BAN ON DRIVING

17:12.567 --> 17:14.533
AND THEN POSTED VIDEOS OF IT

17:14.533 --> 17:14.833
ONLINE

17:14.833 --> 17:16.333
IT'S THE LATEST CHALLENGE TO

17:16.333 --> 17:17.600
RELIGIOUS LEADERS BY WOMEN

17:17.600 --> 17:20.133
SEEKING GREATER FREEDOMS A

17:21.367 --> 17:22.333
SEEKING NEW WAYS TO EXPRES

17:22.333 --> 17:22.800
THEMSELVES

17:22.800 --> 17:24.767
THERE'S CURRENTLY A MOVIE IN

17:24.767 --> 17:26.767
U.S. THEET THERE'S SHOWS HOW

17:26.767 --> 17:28.700
TIMES ARE CHANGING IN SAUD

17:28.700 --> 17:31.567
ARABIA

17:31.567 --> 17:33.733
THIS IS THE FIRST FEATURE FILM

17:33.733 --> 17:35.233
MADE IN SAUDI ARABIA AND THE

17:35.233 --> 17:37.233
FIRST DIRECTED BY A WOMAN.

17:37.233 --> 17:38.800
THE MOVIE IS ABOUT A YOUNG TEE

17:38.800 --> 17:40.367
WHO WANTS NOTHING MORE THAN TO

17:40.367 --> 17:41.200
RIDE A BIKE.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.100
BUT ISN'T ALLOWED TO BECAUSE O

17:42.100 --> 17:47.767
RELIGIOUS NORMS.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.067
THOUGH IT'S FICTION, THE FIL

17:49.067 --> 17:50.933
ALSO SHOWS THE SECOND-CLAS

17:50.933 --> 17:52.700
STATUS OF SAUDI WOMEN IN REA

17:52.700 --> 17:52.967
LIFE

17:52.967 --> 17:54.800
THE NEED FOR APPROVAL FROM THEIR

HUSBANDS OR MALE GUARDIANS

17:56.267 --> 17:57.033
BEFORE WORKING

17:57.033 --> 17:59.867
AND A MAN'S RIGHT TO MORE THAN

17:59.867 --> 18:00.567
ONE WIFE

18:00.567 --> 18:01.867
AND THEN THERE'S THE BAN O

18:01.867 --> 18:04.233
WOMEN DRIVING.

18:04.233 --> 18:05.933
JUST AS THE MOVIE REBELS AGAINST

18:28.300 --> 18:31.567
FIRST TIME IS 1990

18:31.567 --> 18:33.833
AND THE SECOND TIME IS 2011.

18:33.833 --> 18:42.033
THE FIRST TWO TIMES I GOT --

18:42.033 --> 18:43.533
LOSING MY JOB.

18:43.533 --> 18:45.567
>> IN THE FIRST CAMPAIGN IN TH

18:45.567 --> 18:47.533
1990s, 47 WOMEN'S WERE ARRESTED,

18:47.533 --> 18:48.933

18:52.767 --> 18:56.000

18:56.000 --> 18:58.433
WE HAD TO DRIVE WITHIN A GROUP

WE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GOING TO

FELT MUCH MORE VULNERABLE, 1990.

19:07.100 --> 19:08.633
2013, YEAH, A LITTLE FEAR.

19:08.633 --> 19:10.867
BUT I KNOW THAT THE SUPPOR

19:10.867 --> 19:13.233
SYSTEM IS REALLY VERY LARGE.

19:13.233 --> 19:17.200
SAUDI ARABIA HAS TO CHANGE

19:17.200 --> 19:18.667
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S A MATTE

19:18.667 --> 19:19.133
OF CHOICE.

19:19.133 --> 19:20.300
IT ISN'T

WE ARE PART OF THIS GLOBAL

WE'RE PART OF THIS GLOBA

THE RIGHT TO DRIVE, SHE SAYS, IS
