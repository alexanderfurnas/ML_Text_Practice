JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.206 --> 00:11.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: two
reporters on
the ground in New York state on
the battle

00:11.078 --> 00:16.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for that next presidential
primary. We hear
the latest on the Republican and
the Democratic

00:16.550 --> 00:20.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
races. Are Trump's and Clinton's
lead as solid
as they look?

00:20.888 --> 00:28.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: new hope in paralysis
research. A quadriplegic
man is given some of his
mobility back with

00:28.528 --> 00:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the use of microelectrodes and
muscle stimulation.

00:33.200 --> 00:39.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And training for the unthinkable
-- the people
prepared to launch nuclear
weapons, if given

00:39.406 --> 00:41.241 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the order.

1ST LT. KATHLEEN FOSTERLING,
U.S. Air Force:
It's hard to think about it
because you don't

00:43.377 --> 00:48.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know what is going to happen in
that situation.
You just have to do your job,
and whatever

00:48.949 --> 00:51.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the outcome is, it is.

00:51.251 --> 00:55.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

JUDY WOODRUFF: Nearly 40,000
Verizon landline
and cable workers walked off the
job in nine

01:13.240 --> 01:18.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eastern states today. They went
on strike
eight months after their
contract expired,

01:18.478 --> 01:21.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and with little progress in
negotiations.

01:21.214 --> 01:25.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Workers in New York and
Philadelphia stood
in picket lines, protesting what
they said

01:25.953 --> 01:32.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were Verizon's attempts to
freeze pensions,
make layoffs easier, and rely
more on contract

01:32.793 --> 01:34.561 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
workers.

MAN: The five people in charge
of our company
make $235 million. They want to
take away

01:38.799 --> 01:43.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from me. I have got to work 70
hours a week
to make ends meet. How is that
right? I get

01:43.704 --> 01:47.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paid a good salary. Forget about
the rest
of the world that doesn't get
paid as good

01:47.240 --> 01:50.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as we do. I don't know. Where
does it end?
When does it end?

01:50.944 --> 01:55.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Verizon said the
real issues
are health care costs and
contract provisions

01:55.882 --> 02:01.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are out of date. The
company also said
it's trained thousands of
non-union workers

02:01.154 --> 02:04.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to fill in, so customers won't
be affected.

02:04.658 --> 02:11.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Confirmation came today that the
Zika virus,
spread by mosquitoes, does cause
microcephaly,

02:11.131 --> 02:16.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abnormally small heads in
babies. The U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention

02:16.903 --> 02:23.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reported that existing evidence
also links
Zika to other severe brain
defects. It repeated

02:23.276 --> 02:30.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the standing advice to pregnant
women to avoid
traveling to areas where Zika is
spreading.

02:30.317 --> 02:36.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In war-torn Syria, the
government held parliamentary
elections today in the areas it
controls.

02:36.523 --> 02:41.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The voting took place as peace
talks resumed
in Geneva. But the Syrian
Foreign Ministry

02:41.962 --> 02:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ruled any talk of a government
without President
Bashar al-Assad.

02:47.034 --> 02:52.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, lawmakers in Iraq got
into a brawl
with as the political crisis
deepened. The

02:52.973 --> 02:57.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fighting broke out in a dispute
over how to
clean up corruption. Some
demanded the prime

02:57.944 --> 03:02.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minister sack his current
cabinet and bring
in technocrats.

03:02.949 --> 03:08.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's been a new incident at
sea between
Russia and the U.S. Pentagon
officials say

03:08.088 --> 03:14.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian jets repeatedly buzzed a
U.S. Navy
destroyer in the Baltic Sea this
week, coming

03:14.728 --> 03:21.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as close as 30 feet. A Russian
helicopter
also made passes. Video from the
ship shows

03:21.301 --> 03:25.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a jet sweeping past in what
appeared to be
a simulated attack.

03:25.605 --> 03:27.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The White House today was
critical.

03:27.541 --> 03:33.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
This incident, as you won't be
surprised to

03:33.046 --> 03:38.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hear, is entirely inconsistent
with the professional
norms of militaries operating in
proximity

03:38.952 --> 03:43.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to each other in international
waters and
international airspace. And we
continue to

03:43.590 --> 03:45.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be concerned about this
behavior.

03:45.459 --> 03:51.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. Navy
says the destroyer
took no action in response. It
is latest in

03:51.164 --> 03:54.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a series of such incidents in
recent years.

03:54.367 --> 04:00.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New trouble erupted between
migrants and Macedonian
police along the Greek border.
At least 50

04:00.941 --> 04:06.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
migrants tried to pull down
parts of razor-wire
fences at a closed crossing
that's become

04:06.913 --> 04:14.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a flash point. Macedonian police
fired tear
gas again to drive the crowd
back. About 11,000

04:14.221 --> 04:19.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people are stranded in a
makeshift tent city
on the Greek side of the border.

04:19.860 --> 04:25.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Voters in South Korea have dealt
a surprise
blow to their conservative
leader. Early results

04:25.298 --> 04:31.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
indicate that President Park
Geun-hye's ruling
party lost their majority in
Parliament today.

04:31.805 --> 04:38.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The election took place as South
Korea faces
sagging growth, as well as North
Korean provocation.

04:38.078 --> 04:43.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The results threaten Park's
plans for her
final 20 months in office.

04:43.683 --> 04:50.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Chinese court today threw out
the country's
first legal challenge to laws
against same-sex

04:50.157 --> 04:55.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marriages. The case was brought
by a gay couple
who'd been denied a marriage
license. Hundreds

04:56.029 --> 05:01.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of supporters gathered outside
the court in
Changsha, and greeted the couple
after the

05:01.635 --> 05:05.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
court turned them down. Their
lawyer said
the fight will go on.

05:05.872 --> 05:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHI FULONG, Attorney (through
translator):
Today is not the beginning and
definitely

05:10.477 --> 05:15.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not the end. The achievement of
every right
relies on the efforts of
everyone and is not

05:15.215 --> 05:19.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
achieved overnight. I believe,
as long as
we try together, we will finally
realize the

05:19.452 --> 05:21.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rights of equality.

05:21.354 --> 05:24.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Supporters say
they're heartened
that a Chinese court even agreed
to hear the

05:24.991 --> 05:29.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
case and that state-controlled
news media
covered it.

05:29.095 --> 05:35.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, a task
force in Chicago
charged police in that city have
abused minorities

05:35.068 --> 05:40.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for decades with excessive force
and a code
of silence. The panel was
established last

05:40.574 --> 05:46.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year after an outcry over the
shootings of
black suspects. In a scathing
report, the

05:46.346 --> 05:51.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group concluded that Chicago
police have -- quote
-- "no regard for the sanctity
of life when

05:51.885 --> 05:55.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it comes to people of color."

05:55.121 --> 06:01.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Five of the largest U.S. banks
have flunked
attempts to create so-called
living wills.

06:01.328 --> 06:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Federal regulators said today
that their plans
for surviving bankruptcy without
a taxpayer

06:06.299 --> 06:12.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bailout are -- quote -- "not
credible." J.P.
Morgan Chase, Bank of America,
Wells Fargo

06:12.472 --> 06:16.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and others have until October to
try again.

06:16.810 --> 06:22.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The nation's largest U.S. coal
mining company
filed today for federal
bankruptcy protection.

06:22.115 --> 06:27.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Peabody Energy, based in Saint
Louis, has
seen its stock value cut in half
in the past

06:28.021 --> 06:33.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year. It's being pressed by
cheap natural
gas and tougher environmental
regulations.

06:33.827 --> 06:37.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Several other major coal
companies have already
made bankruptcy filings.

06:37.564 --> 06:44.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street surged again as
financial
stocks rebounded some. The Dow
Jones industrial

06:44.070 --> 06:53.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average gained 187 points to
close at 17908.
The Nasdaq rose 75 points, and
the S&amp;P 500

06:53.246 --> 06:54.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
added 20.

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a tale of
two New Yorks, courting the
state's urban

06:59.419 --> 07:07.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and rural voters; a major
windfall for cancer
research courtesy of Facebook's
first president;

07:07.460 --> 07:20.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
how science helped a
quadriplegic man move
his fingers; and much more.

07:20.273 --> 07:27.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, the latest from the
presidential campaign.

07:27.347 --> 07:32.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is less than a week to go
until voters
in New York state have their
say, and the

07:32.185 --> 07:38.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates hit the hustings
again today. A
major East Coast job action was
a main focus.

07:38.058 --> 07:41.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
It's a question of workers
standing up for

07:41.127 --> 07:42.896 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
justice.

07:42.929 --> 07:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For the Democratic
hopefuls, it
was a day to embrace labor,
ahead of next

07:46.099 --> 07:47.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
week's New York primary.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PROTESTERS: Bernie! Bernie!
Bernie!

07:49.769 --> 07:53.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Bernie Sanders joined
striking
Verizon workers in Brooklyn.

07:53.506 --> 07:56.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Today, you
are standing
up, not just for justice for
Verizon workers.

07:56.309 --> 08:05.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You are standing up for millions
of Americans
who don't have a union.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

08:07.354 --> 08:12.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: You're
telling corporate
America they cannot have it all.

08:12.726 --> 08:18.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Hillary Clinton also
slammed Verizon,
saying in a statement: "The
company wants

08:18.164 --> 08:25.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to outsource more and more jobs.
Verizon should
do the right thing and return to
negotiations."

08:25.672 --> 08:30.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton picked up the support of
an electrical
workers union in New York, while
Sanders snagged

08:30.443 --> 08:31.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the transit workers.

08:31.711 --> 08:33.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Thank you
so much for
your support.

08:33.580 --> 08:38.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Vermont senator
also landed
his first endorsement from a
Senate colleague.

08:38.451 --> 08:43.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oregon Democrat Jeff Merkley
announced his
backing in a New York Times
op-ed, and on

08:43.490 --> 08:49.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MSNBC, he explained why he broke
ranks with
40 Democratic senators backing
Clinton.

08:49.396 --> 08:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. JEFF MERKLEY (D), Oregon:
This really
is all about the person who has
the boldest,

08:53.366 --> 08:57.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most fierce vision on the
biggest issues facing
America and the world.

08:57.103 --> 09:01.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Republican
front-runner Donald
Trump is stumping tonight in
Pittsburgh. But,

09:01.408 --> 09:06.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
last night, the New York
billionaire appeared
in a CNN town hall, with wife
Melania joining

09:06.479 --> 09:08.248 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN: Melania,
do you ever
want to say to him, put the
mobile device

09:10.116 --> 09:12.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down, that, like, it's 2:00
a.m., and you're
still tweeting?

09:12.719 --> 09:15.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELANIA TRUMP, Wife of Donald
Trump: Anderson,
if he would only listen. I did
many times.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

09:17.791 --> 09:21.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELANIA TRUMP: And I just say,
OK, do whatever
you want. He's an adult. He
knows the consequences.

09:21.661 --> 09:22.529 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And...

09:22.562 --> 09:24.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

09:24.264 --> 09:29.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump also lashed out
again at
party rules that he says are
robbing him of

09:29.803 --> 09:35.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delegates. But Republican Party
chairman Reince
Priebus fired back on Twitter,
defending the

09:35.208 --> 09:41.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
process and saying: "It's the
responsibility
of they campaigns to understand
it. Complaints

09:41.281 --> 09:43.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now? Give us all a break."

09:43.683 --> 09:48.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's rivals, John Kasich and
Ted Cruz,
campaigned in Maryland and
Pennsylvania this

09:48.288 --> 09:50.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
afternoon.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
I am here today with a word of
hope and encouragement.

09:53.760 --> 10:00.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All across Pennsylvania, all
across the this
country, people are waking up,
and help is

10:00.600 --> 10:01.234 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the way!

10:01.267 --> 10:03.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

10:03.236 --> 10:08.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: We're going to
seed manufacturing
jobs coming back to
Pennsylvania, the backbone

10:08.208 --> 10:09.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the middle class.

10:09.309 --> 10:12.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Cruz has his own CNN
town hall
tonight.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

10:15.248 --> 10:19.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's turn now to
the next
primary on the calendar.

10:19.152 --> 10:23.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Tuesday, voters in the state
of New York
will head to the polls.

10:23.189 --> 10:27.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining us to talk about the
politics of the
Empire State, Beth Fouhy, a
senior editor

10:27.727 --> 10:35.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at MSNBC.com. She joins us from
New York City.
And from Albany, Karen DeWitt,
capital bureau

10:35.168 --> 10:37.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chief for New York state Public
Radio.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we welcome both of you.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, let's start with the
Republicans.

10:41.674 --> 10:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beth, Fouhy to you, first. Break
it down a
little bit for us. Which voters
are eligible

10:46.880 --> 10:51.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to vote in the Republican
primary? How are
delegates selected in New York?

10:51.718 --> 10:54.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH FOUHY, Senior Editor,
MSNBC.Com: Well,
the only people who can vote in
the Republican

10:54.754 --> 10:59.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primary, Judy, are Republicans.
This is a
closed primary state, and that
presents challenges

10:59.726 --> 11:01.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and opportunities to both side.

11:01.961 --> 11:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of just the overall
look at the Republican
field, Donald Trump is just
really dominating

11:07.033 --> 11:12.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here. He's, of course, from New
York. He's
the big alpha dog of New York,
and that that

11:12.171 --> 11:15.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
status basically is propelling
him throughout
the state.

11:15.208 --> 11:19.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of the polling that we have
seen here,
the public polling, shows him at
or above

11:19.212 --> 11:25.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
50 percent. He's beating Senator
Cruz and
John Kasich by as much as 30
points in all

11:25.518 --> 11:30.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this polling. So, right now, the
big mystery
is whether he can actually top
50 percent,

11:30.557 --> 11:36.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, get all the statewide
unpledged delegates,
and get 50 percent in those
congressional

11:36.996 --> 11:38.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
districts, where he could really
sweep up
a whole lot delegates.

11:38.831 --> 11:43.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a possibility, Judy,
that he could
actually get every single one of
the 95 delegates

11:43.303 --> 11:45.071 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the state.

11:45.104 --> 11:47.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as you said,
would have
to win over 50 percent of the
vote in order

11:47.874 --> 11:49.609 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do that.

11:49.642 --> 11:53.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Karen DeWitt, to you. What about
-- do you
agree with the way Beth has laid
it out? And

11:53.379 --> 11:56.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is Trump stronger in one part of
the state
or another?

11:56.215 --> 12:00.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN DEWITT, New York State
Public Radio:
Well, yes, Trump doesn't really
have a really

12:00.186 --> 12:06.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good get-out-the-vote effort or
ground game,
but sure here is drawing people
to the rallies.

12:06.826 --> 12:10.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have been huge, to use
his word.
A lot of people have been coming
to them.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's been all over the state.

12:12.532 --> 12:16.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been very exciting, I
think, for New
York Republicans, as well as
Democrats. I

12:16.536 --> 12:21.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was talking to the New York
state Republican
Party chair, Ed Cox, and he
today, this is

12:21.240 --> 12:26.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York's New Hampshire. We get
to meet these
people firsthand. It is really
energizing

12:26.713 --> 12:28.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everybody.

12:28.648 --> 12:32.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yes, I think Trump is
speaking to especially
Upstate New York. There is a lot
of discontent

12:32.218 --> 12:37.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the economy. The Upstate
economy has
been doing terribly for decades.
And a lot

12:37.290 --> 12:42.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of people are upset. The
manufacturing jobs
aren't here anymore. He's
attracting mainly

12:42.762 --> 12:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the white, working middle-class
voters who
used to have good jobs, may not
have them,

12:47.367 --> 12:50.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are worried about their children
having to
leave the state.

12:50.236 --> 12:55.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he does really seem to be
resonating a
lot more than Kasich and Cruz,
although the

12:55.808 --> 13:00.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way that the delegates are
selected, Kasich
and Cruz could win some
delegates, because

13:00.113 --> 13:04.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's congressional district by
congressional
district, the way the race goes.

13:04.350 --> 13:07.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they could pick up some
delegates, and
that's what they're hoping to
do. They know

13:07.820 --> 13:09.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- probably know at this point
they can't
win.

13:09.756 --> 13:15.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Beth, when
Karen says Trump
doesn't have much of a
ground-level organization,

13:16.029 --> 13:18.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does that mean organization
doesn't matter
in New York?

13:18.631 --> 13:21.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETH FOUHY: Well, he hasn't had
much of an
organization anywhere.

13:21.734 --> 13:26.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, this really is one of
these candidacies
that, in the places that he's
won, has been

13:26.039 --> 13:31.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primarily the force of his
personality, the
force of his celebrity, this
real power and

13:31.411 --> 13:34.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
connection that he has with
certain types
of voters in different states.

13:34.847 --> 13:39.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York is even -- is all of
that and more.
I mean, New York is his home
state, although

13:39.519 --> 13:44.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it has changed quite a lot since
he was growing
up here. For example, he grow up
in Queens,

13:44.257 --> 13:49.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy. Queens is now probably the
most ethnically
diverse place in the entire
United States.

13:49.429 --> 13:53.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Flushing, New York, more
languages spoken
there than any other place in
the United States

13:53.933 --> 13:57.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and has more people who are of
an immigrant
background than any other place.

13:57.804 --> 14:03.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the things that Trump talks
about, the
sort of pushing away illegal
immigrants, concern

14:03.609 --> 14:08.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the borders, when he comes
back to his
home borough of Queens, he's
seeing American

14:08.081 --> 14:12.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diversity in all of its glory.
And that may
be a little bit troubling to
him, because

14:12.885 --> 14:15.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's not quite the same place
that he grew
up in.

14:15.555 --> 14:20.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, he's very, very popular
almost everywhere
in New York, and can possibly
break through

14:20.560 --> 14:24.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and get that 50 percent in all
the congressional
districts and sweep the
delegates.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fascinating.

14:26.065 --> 14:30.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just quickly, Karen, so what
appeal is there
for, say, a Ted Cruz to make in
New York,

14:30.770 --> 14:35.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or a John Kasich, when Trump
seems to have
the advantage?

14:35.675 --> 14:41.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN DEWITT: Well, I think Cruz
did make
a real mistake back in Iowa when
he discredited

14:41.547 --> 14:45.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New York City values. People
haven't forgotten
that.

14:45.118 --> 14:49.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York Republicans are not
that conservative.
They're pretty moderate. So I
think Cruz has

14:49.722 --> 14:54.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a real challenge here. John
Kasich seems to
be going for more of the
electeds. He met

14:54.994 --> 15:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Senate Republicans,
trying to convince
them to maybe tell their friends
to vote for

15:00.299 --> 15:03.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him. He's trying to go the more
moderate route.
He's held a lot of town hall
meetings, which

15:03.803 --> 15:08.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he seems to excel in. So, they
are trying
chip away in particular
congressional districts.

15:08.875 --> 15:14.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karen, staying
with you quickly,
turning to the Democrats, who
can vote in

15:14.981 --> 15:19.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Democratic primary? And does
organization
matter for the Democrats?

15:19.452 --> 15:22.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAREN DEWITT: Yes, it absolutely
does.

15:22.722 --> 15:27.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, it is closed just to
Democrats.
But you have Hillary Clinton,
who has all

15:27.927 --> 15:33.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the established elected
officials, from Governor
Cuomo, all the way down to local
county legislators,

15:33.833 --> 15:40.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Bernie Sanders, who has the
younger folks
who are very motivated to vote,
but the question

15:40.406 --> 15:44.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, will they really come out on
Election
Day? Did they register early
enough?

15:44.043 --> 15:48.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of them may have to do
absentee ballot.
A lot of them are millennials,
and you would

15:48.247 --> 15:53.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to use snail mail to do an
absentee ballot,
which they are not used to
doing. So, can

15:53.686 --> 16:00.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders get as many voters out
as Hillary
Clinton likely can with her
support from the

16:00.159 --> 16:05.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
major elected officials,
particularly in New
York City, and particularly with
her support

16:05.064 --> 16:09.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the major party unions that
are supporting
her and will help with the
get-out-the-vote

16:09.202 --> 16:10.703 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
effort?

16:10.736 --> 16:12.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's right.
There is such
a thing as snail mail, still.

16:12.538 --> 16:15.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Beth, how do you look at the
Clinton-Sanders
competition?

16:15.741 --> 16:21.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH FOUHY: Well, it's a little
bit closer
than the field on the Republican
side, Judy,

16:21.314 --> 16:26.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but so far, Clinton is quite a
ways ahead
of Bernie Sanders, and for many,
many reasons.

16:26.319 --> 16:31.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's not forget, she was a
senator from New
York for eight years. She was
elected in 2000,

16:31.724 --> 16:36.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reelected in 2006. She knows how
to run in
New York. She knows where to go.
She knows

16:36.495 --> 16:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the communities she needs to be
speaking to.
Plus, she was a pretty
well-regarded senator.

16:40.566 --> 16:44.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She paid as much attention to
the Upstate
issues as she did to the folks
in the city.

16:44.904 --> 16:50.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She was really, really
responsive around 9/11
and the needs of the
first-responders there,

16:50.576 --> 16:56.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but also Upstate dairy farms and
apple farms
and those big cities up there
that, as Karen

16:56.282 --> 17:00.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put it, have been struggling,
like the areas
around Syracuse, Rochester, that
kind of thing.

17:00.987 --> 17:05.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Bernie Sanders, even though
he's got his
thick Brooklyn accent, hasn't
lived in the

17:05.157 --> 17:09.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state for a long time and is not
super well-known.
He will get those college
students out if

17:09.862 --> 17:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're registered and can vote,
eligible
to vote here as Democrats. He's
got a big

17:14.233 --> 17:18.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really tonight in Washington
Square Park in
Manhattan, where tons and tons
of young people

17:18.671 --> 17:20.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are expected to attend.

17:20.439 --> 17:23.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been going to a lot of
college towns
in New York, and there are
plenty of them

17:23.276 --> 17:27.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this state. So he will get a
lot of enthusiasm,
that kind of enthusiasm that we
have seen

17:27.246 --> 17:31.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in other states. But he starts
really well
behind her because of her
experience and her

17:31.517 --> 17:33.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
connections here in New York.

17:33.452 --> 17:36.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Karen,
there's no Brooklyn
advantage or no home state
advantage for Bernie

17:36.989 --> 17:38.758 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sanders?

17:38.791 --> 17:43.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN DEWITT: Well, I will say
one thing that
Sanders is trying to capitalize
on is the

17:43.195 --> 17:45.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so-called fractivists.

17:45.064 --> 17:49.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are the anti-fracking
activities who
were successful in convincing
Governor Cuomo

17:49.802 --> 17:54.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to ban fracking in New York.
It's the only
state where it's illegal. And
he's hoping

17:54.640 --> 17:59.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that those voters will come out.
They gave
Cuomo a primary challenge,
supported Cuomo's

17:59.745 --> 18:02.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
primary challenger back in 2014.

18:02.548 --> 18:06.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his challenger, who, by the
way, was a
Vermont transplant, Zephyr
Teachout, actually

18:06.686 --> 18:11.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
won a number of Upstate
counties. So, Bernie
Sanders this week said he's for
a nationwide

18:11.457 --> 18:16.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ban on fracking. He mentions it
in his speeches
here, and he's really trying to
play that

18:16.362 --> 18:21.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up, hoping he can get those
progressives out,
a small group, but very
motivated voters.

18:21.934 --> 18:25.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it is a lot
of delegates
at stake, and we know the
candidates are working

18:25.905 --> 18:30.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the state hard. And we thank
both of you for
giving us this insight.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Beth Fouhy and Karen DeWitt,
thank you both.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETH FOUHY: Thanks, Judy.

18:34.413 --> 18:37.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAREN DEWITT: Thank you.

18:37.550 --> 18:51.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: A young tech
magnate places
a big bet on a different
approach to fighting

18:51.764 --> 18:53.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cancer.

18:53.599 --> 18:57.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sean Parker made a name for
himself as the
co-founder of Napster and the
first president

18:57.336 --> 19:02.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Facebook. The billionaire is
still actively
involved in the start-up world,
but he's now

19:02.942 --> 19:08.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dedicated a significant part of
his fortune
to medicine and fighting
disease.

19:08.047 --> 19:14.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, he announced a major
initiative, a
$250 million grant to help fund
research and

19:14.754 --> 19:20.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
collaboration in immunotherapy
among six of
the country's leading medical
schools and

19:20.426 --> 19:24.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cancer centers. It's the largest
gift ever
of its kind.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he joins me now from Los
Angeles.

19:27.566 --> 19:29.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sean Parker, welcome.

19:29.301 --> 19:34.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So where does this passion, the
drive to do
something about cancer come
from?

19:34.206 --> 19:37.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN PARKER, Founder, Parker
Institute for
Cancer Immunotherapy: Well, we
have all had

19:37.043 --> 19:39.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our own personal experience with
cancer.

19:39.378 --> 19:44.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Virtually no one is untouched by
cancer, whether
they have had the disease
themselves, one

19:44.550 --> 19:50.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of their loved ones has had it,
one of their
friends. You know, half of all
men and a third

19:50.656 --> 19:53.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of all women will have cancer in
their lifetime.

19:53.859 --> 20:00.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's -- what is especially
frustrating
is, despite all of these
advances in genomics

20:00.232 --> 20:06.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and understanding of the drivers
behind cancer,
progress over the last 20 years
just hasn't

20:06.338 --> 20:12.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been fast enough. And, as
somebody who has
spent his life as an
entrepreneur trying to

20:12.611 --> 20:16.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pursue kind of rapid, disruptive
changes,
I'm impatient.

20:16.615 --> 20:21.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think -- I think that
patients and their
families and doctors are
impatient as well.

20:21.921 --> 20:27.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as I began to look at this
problem more
closely, it was clear that we
needed both

20:27.726 --> 20:32.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new technology platforms, like
immunotherapy,
but we also need to figure out
how to collaborate

20:32.965 --> 20:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and cooperate better within the
world of academic
science in order to really solve
the problem.

20:40.473 --> 20:44.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're zeroing
this money in
on immunotherapy. Why?

20:44.110 --> 20:48.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN PARKER: So, immunotherapy
is an incredibly
promising technology.

20:48.814 --> 20:55.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has a very long history going
back 100
years. In fact, it was believed
at one point

20:55.988 --> 21:04.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that cancer was caused by an
insufficiency
of the immune system. It turned
out that that

21:04.230 --> 21:11.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wasn't entirely false. Cancer is
kept in check
in the early stages by the
immune system.

21:11.537 --> 21:17.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The immune system is also an
incredibly powerful
weapon. It's really good at
recognizing cells

21:17.376 --> 21:22.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that have mutations, our cells
that are different,
look different.

21:22.047 --> 21:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it makes perfect sense
that we should
be able to harness the power of
the immune

21:26.452 --> 21:32.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system, which works with your
own body, in
order to target cancer and
destroy it.

21:32.158 --> 21:37.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You also in your
presentation
earlier today -- I was watching
-- you focus

21:37.363 --> 21:44.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the inefficiency of the
current system
of cancer research, competing
centers, overlapping

21:44.303 --> 21:52.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
laboratories, competition for
money, an unwillingness
to share information.

21:52.077 --> 21:55.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is something you're really
baking in
to giving this money, isn't it?

21:55.915 --> 22:04.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN PARKER: This is incredibly
important
to the Parker Institute, and I
think to the

22:04.423 --> 22:06.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
next generation of research.

22:06.492 --> 22:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A field like immunotherapy is a
great example.
It's incredibly
interdisciplinary. And that

22:14.200 --> 22:22.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interdisciplinary nature means
that folks
from genomics, informatics,
immunology, and

22:22.474 --> 22:27.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oncology all need to figure out
how to work
together and share data, and
they also need

22:27.413 --> 22:32.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to be able to share the
breakthroughs that
they make without being
encumbered by bureaucracy

22:32.451 --> 22:36.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or issues around intellectual
property, because
it's going to be combinations of
therapies

22:36.522 --> 22:41.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
coming together that are
successful in treating
the disease.

22:41.060 --> 22:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what we are able to do is
create a sort
of big sandbox that all these
scientists can

22:48.500 --> 22:52.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
play in together. They have
access to the
best technology and they have
access to all

22:52.104 --> 22:55.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of each other's breakthroughs,
so that a breakthrough
that gets made at one center is
immediately

22:55.908 --> 22:59.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
usable by scientists in another
center within
the network.

22:59.278 --> 23:05.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the hope is that this is not
just a model
for how we can research cancer
immunology,

23:05.818 --> 23:11.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it's also potentially a
model for how
we can do scientific research --
scientific

23:11.323 --> 23:13.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
medical research in other
fields.

23:13.125 --> 23:17.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You are 36 years
old. As we
said, you're part of this new
generation of

23:17.429 --> 23:22.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tech -- people who have been
very successful
in the tech industry.

23:22.234 --> 23:29.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have a much more hands-on
approach to
your philanthropy. How do you
ward against

23:29.241 --> 23:34.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being overconfident, of thinking
that more
is going to come out of this
than actually

23:34.146 --> 23:35.781 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
will?

23:35.814 --> 23:39.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEAN PARKER: I think, if
anything, we have
the opposite attitude. We accept
that, in

23:39.985 --> 23:45.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our philanthropic endeavors,
we're going to
fail, and we're going to have to
be honest

23:45.858 --> 23:47.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with ourselves that not
everything is going
to work.

23:47.926 --> 23:53.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's one of the problems of
philanthropy
in general. Large philanthropies
and philanthropists,

23:54.033 --> 23:58.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they don't want to be told that
the gifts
that they're making didn't
achieve the results

23:58.837 --> 24:02.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the world that they were
looking for, whereas,
in the business community, and
in particular

24:02.574 --> 24:07.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as an entrepreneur building
start-ups, you
have got to be willing to accept
failure.

24:07.780 --> 24:11.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a part of life. Not
everything is going
to succeed. And you have got to
be honest

24:11.750 --> 24:16.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with yourself about why
something didn't work.
If you can't diagnose the reason
why something

24:16.955 --> 24:21.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
failed, you're not going to be
able to do
a better job at it in the
future. So, this

24:21.093 --> 24:27.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a general principle that
we're trying to
apply, you know, from the world
of start-ups

24:27.533 --> 24:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in business to the world of
giving.

24:29.835 --> 24:34.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you have a
timeline in your
own mind, Sean Parker, in terms
of when you

24:34.106 --> 24:39.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expect to see results and, just
quickly, the
role of the federal government
in all this?

24:39.178 --> 24:43.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEAN PARKER: The federal
government can be
a catalyst.

24:43.115 --> 24:48.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Cancer Moonshot, the
president and
vice president's Cancer Moonshot
effort has

24:48.787 --> 24:57.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come at an incredibly opportune
time, at this
point of convergence between the
computer

24:57.262 --> 25:05.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
science world and the world of
life sciences,
and at an inflection point in
the development

25:05.270 --> 25:11.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of life sciences. So, that
catalytic role,
I think, is very helpful.

25:11.810 --> 25:16.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sean Parker,
announcing today
the Parker Institute, we
certainly do wish

25:16.081 --> 25:21.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you well. Thank you.

25:21.153 --> 25:27.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEAN PARKER: Thank you.

25:27.326 --> 25:31.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

25:31.330 --> 25:35.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
men and women
with their fingers on the
triggers of the

25:35.868 --> 25:43.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. nuclear arsenal; a kind of
ATM for clean
drinking water; and a French
chef explains

25:43.308 --> 25:46.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why you shouldn't always follow
the recipe.

25:46.512 --> 25:52.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, another science
story, this one
looking at promising new
research in the treatment

25:52.384 --> 25:56.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of spinal cord injuries and
other causes of
paralysis.

25:56.455 --> 25:58.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has that.

25:58.223 --> 26:03.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Five years ago,
as a college
freshman, Ian Burkhart dove into
a wave at

26:03.328 --> 26:08.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a North Carolina beach and broke
his neck
on the sandy ocean floor,
leaving him paralyzed

26:09.001 --> 26:10.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the chest down.

26:10.803 --> 26:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, in a medical first, he has
regained some
movement in his hands and
fingers through

26:15.441 --> 26:21.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
technology that communicates his
thoughts
directly to his hand muscles. It
uses a tiny

26:21.280 --> 26:26.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chip inserted in his brain and
an electronic
sleeve.

26:26.318 --> 26:30.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Burkhart has learned to perform
simple tasks,
even playing a guitar video
game.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN BURKHART, Spinal Injury
Victim: It is
just something that is so fluid.
It's just

26:33.692 --> 26:38.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of like it was before I had
my injury,
where I just think about what I
want to do,

26:38.797 --> 26:40.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and now I can do it.

26:40.599 --> 26:45.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The work by
researchers at
Ohio State University and
Battelle Memorial

26:45.204 --> 26:50.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Institute is not a cure for
paralysis, and
Burkhart must be connected to
computers in

26:50.776 --> 26:56.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lab in order to use his hands.
But it's
another big advance in the field
of neural

26:56.348 --> 26:58.116 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
engineering.

26:58.150 --> 27:01.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And science correspondent Miles
O'Brien has
been following these
developments, and joins

27:01.553 --> 27:03.255 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me now.

27:03.288 --> 27:08.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles, this is essentially a new
way of getting
directly from the brain to the
hand?

27:08.527 --> 27:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Exactly, Jeff.
Think of it
as a jumper cable. His brain is
fine. His

27:14.867 --> 27:19.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mysteries are still there. The
nerves are
intact, except for where the
injury is.

27:19.371 --> 27:25.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you can create a way to
bypass where
that injury is in the spinal
cord, you can

27:25.944 --> 27:32.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do wonderful things. At the core
of this is
significant development in
recent years in

27:32.251 --> 27:38.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understanding how our brains
work, and reading
the language of the brain,
interpreting it,

27:38.156 --> 27:43.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, in short order, turning
that into action
which can lead to movement of
muscles. It's

27:43.428 --> 27:45.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nothing short of remarkable.

27:45.164 --> 27:49.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So we're talking
about Ian
Burkhart is moving his hands by,
in a way,

27:49.668 --> 27:56.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thinking about it. But that
involves this
computer chip and training it to
interpret

27:56.341 --> 27:57.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his brain, in a sense.

27:57.676 --> 28:01.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes, it's not
unlike training
voice recognition.

28:01.713 --> 28:08.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of us are familiar with
that. What they
do is, they -- using advanced
MRI equipment,

28:08.387 --> 28:14.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have him think about moving
what is missing,
or, in his case, what he's
unable to move

28:14.092 --> 28:19.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because it's paralyzed. And it
lights up certain
parts of the brain. You teach
the computer

28:19.998 --> 28:24.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to understand those patterns,
artificial intelligence,
pattern recognition.

28:24.636 --> 28:31.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, eventually, it understands
what the brain
is telling it to do and can fire
electrodes

28:31.276 --> 28:33.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which will in turn move his
muscles.

28:33.512 --> 28:36.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And through this
electronic
sleeve, right?

28:36.782 --> 28:40.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Explain -- explain a little bit
more how it
moves, how it works.

28:40.085 --> 28:45.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, so, they
have got the
sensors embedded in his brain.
Wires come

28:45.257 --> 28:49.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of his head, through a
computer, out of
the computer, another set of
wires to the

28:49.628 --> 28:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sleeve which is attached to his
paralyzed
hand. The sleeve has electrodes
in it which

28:54.833 --> 28:58.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
engage the muscles themselves
and fire the
muscles.

28:58.236 --> 29:04.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They wanted to do it in a
noninvasive way.
Already, they were putting this
chip in his

29:04.042 --> 29:10.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brain, and so they wanted to
minimize the
invasiveness of this as they
performed this

29:10.482 --> 29:14.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experiment. Ultimately, as we
look toward
making this a practical solution
for those

29:14.419 --> 29:18.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are paralyzed and giving
them more movement,
you would want to get into a
situation where

29:18.991 --> 29:24.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everything is embedded and,
through wireless
control potentially, embedded
electrodes in

29:24.429 --> 29:26.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the muscles themselves would
control the movement.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, because,
right now, it
can only be done in a lab,
right, with him

29:29.835 --> 29:30.769 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wired up?

29:30.802 --> 29:32.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Exactly.

29:32.704 --> 29:37.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what he's doing is pushing
technology
forward. He's a remarkable young
man. And

29:37.342 --> 29:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is something that doesn't
really affect
his quality of life on a
day-to-day basis,

29:41.947 --> 29:43.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it will affect others down
the road.

29:43.749 --> 29:48.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, a big step.
How hard is
it to get to that further goal,
and how big

29:48.587 --> 29:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a step would this be, do you
think?

29:50.989 --> 29:52.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Not
insignificant.

29:52.758 --> 29:57.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A couple big things. First of
all, there's
a bandwidth issue. His brain is
generating

29:57.729 --> 30:04.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about a gigabyte of data every
three minutes,
so you have got a lot of data
that you have

30:04.302 --> 30:09.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to handle wirelessly, connecting
it from the
brain down to the limb that you
want to see

30:09.341 --> 30:11.076 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
move.

30:11.109 --> 30:15.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other thing is, the body
correctly
identifies these implants as
foreign objects

30:15.313 --> 30:19.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and attacks them. And so, over
time, what
we have discovered in previous
experiments

30:19.484 --> 30:24.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with people who have had similar
implants,
they lose their efficacy because
the body

30:24.256 --> 30:26.024 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
goes after them.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Miles,
I want to
switch gears. I want to ask you
about another

30:28.360 --> 30:31.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing that broke this afternoon
that you have
been covering for us.

30:31.797 --> 30:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's Zika. And, as you know,
late this afternoon,
the CDC concludes that Zika
causes microcephaly

30:38.704 --> 30:42.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and other birth defects. What's
the significance
there?

30:42.974 --> 30:47.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, this is
just kind of
dotting the I, crossing the T.

30:47.112 --> 30:54.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the CDC did was, they did a
study of
the studies that exist and
concluded with

30:54.186 --> 30:59.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some finality that there is this
connection,
causation, we like to call it in
science,

30:59.191 --> 31:04.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between Zika and microcephaly.
Couple that
with the fact that CDC officials
are now talking

31:04.863 --> 31:11.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about possibly other birth
defects linked
to Zika, vision-related, an
M.S.-like disease,

31:11.903 --> 31:13.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
premature births.

31:13.705 --> 31:20.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then add to that the fact
that the spread
seems to be looming into perhaps
as many as

31:20.078 --> 31:25.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
30 U.S. states, and, really, you
don't see
a lot of encouraging news
anywhere on the

31:25.717 --> 31:32.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Zika front. And the
administration, the CDC
is asking Congress for some
emergency funding

31:32.124 --> 31:35.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to try to nip this thing in the
bud, and now
would be the time to do that.

31:35.627 --> 31:40.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, clearly some
new urgency
here, and clearly some attempts
to get funding,

31:40.465 --> 31:42.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which would do what exactly? Do
you know?

31:42.601 --> 31:49.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, the more
that they can
get out there and get public
education in

31:49.274 --> 31:56.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the mix, more studies to draw
these links,
more efforts to combat it, and
make people

31:56.314 --> 32:02.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aware, as much as anything, that
when a woman
is pregnant, in particular, that
being near

32:02.654 --> 32:08.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these particular mosquitoes,
this Aedes aegypti
mosquito, which is now spreading
into our

32:08.627 --> 32:12.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of the world, can be a very
dangerous
thing.

32:12.230 --> 32:19.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
science correspondent
Miles O'Brien, thanks very much.

32:19.104 --> 32:25.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome,
Jeff.

32:25.443 --> 32:31.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Over the past
eight months,
we have aired three stories
about America's

32:31.383 --> 32:33.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
aging nuclear arsenal.

32:33.185 --> 32:36.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we thought we'd share
with you some
of the more interesting things
we learned

32:36.855 --> 32:38.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
along the way.

32:38.223 --> 32:40.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has that.

32:40.158 --> 32:44.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Our past stories
looked at the
debate over rebuilding America's
nuclear submarines,

32:44.729 --> 32:48.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
missiles and bombs, now that
much of the current
arsenal is reaching the end of
its service

32:48.967 --> 32:50.769 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

32:50.802 --> 32:54.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, tonight, to continue our
unprecedented
look behind the scenes, we meet
some of the

32:54.239 --> 32:57.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
men and women charged with this
great responsibility.

32:57.509 --> 33:02.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Veteran defense correspondent
Jamie McIntyre
reported these stories for us,
in partnership

33:02.347 --> 33:05.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the Pulitzer Center on
Crisis Reporting.

33:05.417 --> 33:12.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: All stations, all stations,
this is absentee,
absentee.

33:12.157 --> 33:17.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: If the president
ever gives
the order to unleash nuclear
weapons, the

33:17.662 --> 33:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
men and women whose fingers are
on the triggers
would hear something like this.

33:21.700 --> 33:25.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Yankee, mike. Stand by,
uniform.

33:25.070 --> 33:31.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: It's the sound
of an emergency
action message. It's only a
drill, but in

33:31.076 --> 33:36.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a real-life situation, the
highly encrypted
message sent to bombers,
submarines and missile

33:36.181 --> 33:42.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crews would tell them which war
plan to execute
and which targets to destroy.

33:42.988 --> 33:49.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The coded message echoes,
because it's sent
by many different radios around
the world,

33:49.261 --> 33:54.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to ensure that even if the
nation were under
nuclear attack, at least one of
the messages

33:54.532 --> 33:58.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would get through.

33:58.970 --> 34:03.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour" was granted rare
access to
America's nuclear war fighters
over the past

34:03.375 --> 34:08.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
six months. At Minot Air Force
base in North
Dakota, we spent the day with
the airmen who

34:08.747 --> 34:14.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
load the B-52 bombers and the
crews that fly
them.

34:14.719 --> 34:18.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chief Master Sergeant Lee Robins
is the wing
weapons manager.

34:18.456 --> 34:20.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How can you tell how old it is?

34:20.325 --> 34:24.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHIEF MASTER SGT. LEE ROBINS,
U.S. Air Force:
It's pretty easy. So, there is
-- on the tail

34:24.596 --> 34:29.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number, if we look underneath
the letters
A.F., this is a 61, so that is
when it rolled

34:29.067 --> 34:30.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
off the assembly line.

34:30.869 --> 34:35.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: That makes this
aircraft 19
years older than Major Luke
Dellenbach, a

34:35.540 --> 34:37.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
B-52 commander and instructor
pilot.

34:37.542 --> 34:42.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I asked him about the
differences between
flying a conventional vs.
nuclear mission.

34:42.914 --> 34:46.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAJ. LUKE DELLENBACH, U.S. Air
Force: For
a nuclear mission for us, it's
very controlled.

34:46.151 --> 34:50.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's very scripted. The
president doesn't
want us doing things that we
want to do. There

34:50.922 --> 34:54.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not inventiveness. It's very
much you follow
the rules and you follow the
procedures and

34:54.826 --> 34:56.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
guidelines that we have.

34:56.628 --> 35:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For conventional, it's almost
the opposite.
We have a lot more flexibility.
We can be

35:01.299 --> 35:04.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more innovative. We can hit
targets different
ways.

35:04.369 --> 35:09.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: It's a sobering
mission, and
the venerable B-52 has been
updated with modern

35:09.374 --> 35:15.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
avionics to carry it out, even
though, as
the crew is quick to show us,
some non-mission-critical

35:15.480 --> 35:19.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
systems are an antiquated
reminder of its
Cold War history.

35:19.184 --> 35:20.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do we have?

35:20.986 --> 35:21.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAJ. C. RYAN COX, U.S. Air
Force: So, over
here, we have the oven. It has
two different

35:21.686 --> 35:22.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
settings, off and 400 degrees.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: 1960s
technology?

35:24.289 --> 35:25.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAJ. C. RYAN COX: It still works
today. And
up here, we have a sextant port
(INAUDIBLE)

35:25.757 --> 35:28.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
navigation if everything else
fails.

35:28.460 --> 35:33.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: You know how to
use a sextant?

35:33.365 --> 35:43.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAJ. C. RYAN COX: No. We usually
put a GPS
antenna out of it if we need it.

35:43.174 --> 35:45.110 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:45.143 --> 35:51.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: While bombers
crews typically
fly at 50,000 feet above the
ground, the submariners

35:51.616 --> 35:56.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we visited last summer lurk
hundreds of feet
below the surface, in this case
plying the

35:56.688 --> 35:58.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
depths of the Pacific Ocean.

35:58.957 --> 36:01.793 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Dive, dive.

36:01.826 --> 36:07.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: By far, the
stealthiest leg
of the nuclear triad, the
submarine's unofficial

36:07.932 --> 36:10.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
motto is hide with pride.

36:10.535 --> 36:16.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The USS Pennsylvania's crew
spends three months
at a time in the cramped
confines of the windowless

36:16.374 --> 36:22.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ballistic missile submarine,
breathing recycled
air and never seeing the sun,
that is, unless

36:22.647 --> 36:28.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are among the chosen few
who get to go
topside while the sub takes on
provisions,

36:28.053 --> 36:33.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
an elaborate and highly
choreographed ritual
on the high seas in which canvas
bags of food

36:33.792 --> 36:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an supplies are transferred from
boat to boat.

36:37.162 --> 36:43.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While the subs patrol undersea,
missileers
serve underground. They have to
take an elevator

36:43.568 --> 36:49.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
50 to 60 feet down each time
they arrive at
their jobs. There are 45 launch
facilities

36:49.607 --> 36:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spread across the America's
heartland controlling
the intercontinental ballistic
missiles, ICBM,

36:56.114 --> 36:58.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
buried in silos in fixed, known
locations.

36:58.683 --> 37:00.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Incoming emergency action
message.

37:00.552 --> 37:06.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: We got to watch
two junior
officers practicing running
through the lengthy

37:06.057 --> 37:08.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
checklist to launch nuclear
missiles.

37:08.860 --> 37:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To get the launch keys, they
must each unlock
a padlock. In this training
scenario, using

37:15.467 --> 37:22.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unfamiliar locks, a forgotten
combination
delays a mock launch. In case
you're wondering,

37:22.440 --> 37:27.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
missileers can't just go rogue.
It takes four
officers, in two separate launch
facilities,

37:27.712 --> 37:33.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to launch a missile after an
authentication
code is received.

37:33.818 --> 37:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't help noticing how
young America's
nuclear warriors are. First
Lieutenant Kathleen

37:38.756 --> 37:45.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fosterling who commands a
two-person missile
combat crew, is 27. She works a
24-hour shift

37:45.530 --> 37:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eight times a month, waiting for
an order
she hopes to never receive.

37:49.234 --> 37:53.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1ST LT. KATHLEEN FOSTERLING,
U.S. Air Force:
I wouldn't say it's lonely. Yes,
we only work

37:53.338 --> 37:58.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with technically one other
person, but we
have all the other guys topside.
We have -- we

37:58.243 --> 38:02.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talk to the other crews at the
other capsules
constantly.

38:02.714 --> 38:06.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But our free time, if we have
any, not always
-- sometimes, there is a lot --
sometimes,

38:06.417 --> 38:13.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is not -- a lot of people
do homework.
There is a lot of people in
school. We read.

38:13.091 --> 38:19.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We watch TV. We watch movies,
hang out with
each other. It's not so bad.

38:19.564 --> 38:21.332 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:21.366 --> 38:26.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: Do you ever
wonder, we ask,
what it would be like if she had
to turn the

38:26.104 --> 38:27.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
launch key for real?

38:27.872 --> 38:29.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1ST LT. KATHLEEN FOSTERLING:
It's hard to
think about it, because you
don't know what

38:29.874 --> 38:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to happen in that
situation. You
just have to do your job. And
whatever the

38:35.246 --> 38:38.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
outcome is, it is.

38:38.082 --> 38:43.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: First Lieutenant
Fosterling
is not alone. A number of
nuclear warriors

38:43.588 --> 38:48.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told us it's very hard to think
about what
it would be like after the
unthinkable happens.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Now Jamie McIntyre
joins us.

38:52.530 --> 38:57.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Jamie, this was really a
remarkable series.
You showed us things that we
rarely see on

38:57.835 --> 38:59.671 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
television.

38:59.704 --> 39:03.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have to ask you, what do you
take away from
this personally? What was most
memorable for

39:03.775 --> 39:05.543 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you?

39:05.577 --> 39:07.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: Well, you know,
John, one
of the things we asked almost
all the people

39:07.345 --> 39:10.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we interviewed was, have you
ever thought
about what would happen if you
actually had

39:10.648 --> 39:14.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to employ these weapons? It is
the classic
unthinkable scenario.

39:14.986 --> 39:18.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we found was that, yes,
most of them
had thought about it, but they
don't dwell

39:18.756 --> 39:23.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on it. These are military people
trained to
a mission and they think about
their part

39:23.428 --> 39:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the mission, and there's not
a whole lot
of angst of what would happen if
they actually

39:28.833 --> 39:31.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were involved in an all-out
nuclear exchange.

39:31.369 --> 39:35.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was interesting. When we
talked to the
submarine commander, we said,
well, how would

39:35.206 --> 39:39.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you deal with the crew after you
have already
launched all these missiles and
you know that

39:39.177 --> 39:43.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe even the end of the world
is coming?
And he said, well, it would be
difficult.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hopefully, he said, there will
be some guidance.

39:45.984 --> 39:50.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: A little guidance
from the Pentagon
on it.

39:50.154 --> 39:55.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And talk about that, because
this really is
-- they are handling the awesome
power of

39:55.493 --> 40:00.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nuclear weapons. But it's a job
for them.
It's their assignment. It's
their day-to-day

40:00.832 --> 40:02.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
assignment.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: Well, I
mentioned this in
the piece, that one of the
things that really

40:04.269 --> 40:08.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
struck me was how young
everybody was, and
how they're focused on their
mission.

40:08.906 --> 40:16.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The young 1st lieutenant that we
met in the
missile silo, 1st Lieutenant
Kathleen Fosterling,

40:16.648 --> 40:20.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so she's very young and she's
commanding this
two-person crew, but yet -- and
she's in this

40:20.385 --> 40:25.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tiny room underground in a
windowless room
every day. And one of the things
that struck

40:25.757 --> 40:29.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you is that you had the -- you
see how they
personalize their life.

40:29.127 --> 40:34.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for instance, those locks --
and you saw
the sequence in the story where
the training

40:34.866 --> 40:38.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scenario, they can't get the
lock open because
they're using a training lock.
In real life,

40:38.469 --> 40:43.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they all use their own personal
padlocks.
And she had plastered hers with
Hello Kitty

40:43.141 --> 40:47.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stickers, which seemed to be
sort of this
juxtaposition of the fact that
they're -- they're

40:47.845 --> 40:52.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conducting this awesome mission,
but, at the
same time, it is a job, and they
just need

40:52.150 --> 40:56.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have some sort of human
interaction and
think of it as something that
they just do

40:56.421 --> 40:57.388 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every day.

40:57.422 --> 40:59.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Just personalizing
their workspace.

40:59.157 --> 41:03.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jamie McIntyre, remarkable
reporting. Thank
you very much.

41:03.061 --> 41:09.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: Thank you.

41:09.801 --> 41:18.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: India has the
world's largest
number of people, about 76
million, without

41:18.209 --> 41:23.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
access to clean drinking water.
And that's
according to a report the
international charity

41:23.314 --> 41:25.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WaterAid released last month.

41:25.450 --> 41:30.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro
reports, an innovative solution
to that problem

41:30.888 --> 41:33.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is popping up across the
country.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His report is part of our
Breakthrough series.

41:35.927 --> 41:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The United
Nations estimates
that women in India spend a
collective 150

41:42.900 --> 41:49.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
million workdays every year just
gathering
water, water that's increasingly
scarce and

41:49.340 --> 41:51.109 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
polluted.

41:51.142 --> 41:56.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, in parts of the country,
including this
Delhi suburb, an experiment is
under way.

41:56.214 --> 42:03.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's called a water ATM.
Customers purchase
credit on a prepaid card, scan
it at the tap,

42:03.821 --> 42:08.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and out comes water that's drawn
from the
ground and purified right at the
site, using

42:08.893 --> 42:11.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a technology called reverse
osmosis.

42:11.596 --> 42:17.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amit Mishra manages the Delhi
facilities for
a social business called
Sarvajal, which hopes

42:17.535 --> 42:22.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to use reinvest profits it makes
to sustain
these outlets over the long
term.

42:22.573 --> 42:26.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This where the water gets
purified. It goes
into the large tanks here
storage?

42:26.978 --> 42:28.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMIT MISHRA, Sarvajal: Yes.

42:28.713 --> 42:33.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: With
charitable grants
for the $30,000 of equipment and
land given

42:33.084 --> 42:38.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by the local government,
Sarvajal can charge
customers a fraction of the
price of commercially

42:38.456 --> 42:42.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bottled water, which most people
here cannot
afford.

42:42.860 --> 42:48.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fetching water remains a mostly
female chore.
It's still self-service with
heavy lifting.

42:48.433 --> 42:53.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's a massive improvement
over what most
of Delhi's poorer neighborhoods
have.

42:53.171 --> 42:54.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): By
12:00?

42:54.705 --> 42:58.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: We filmed
their ordeal
six years ago.

42:58.676 --> 43:00.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): By
4:00.

43:00.645 --> 43:06.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The long
wait for a municipal
tanker truck that has no fixed
schedule, the

43:06.851 --> 43:12.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mad dash when it finally
arrives.

43:12.990 --> 43:18.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city's middle class buys its
way out of
such chaos. Jyoti Sharme lives
in an apartment

43:18.629 --> 43:23.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's hooked up to the city
water supply,
better off, but hardly well off.

43:23.534 --> 43:25.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JYOTI SHARME, India: We get
water 45 minutes
a day in the morning, and that's
it.

43:25.970 --> 43:27.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: From the
city?

43:27.405 --> 43:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JYOTI SHARME: Yes, into these
storage tanks.

43:30.274 --> 43:34.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She
described an elaborate
jury-rigged system of pumps or
motors homeowners

43:34.979 --> 43:38.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
use to extract water from the
aging city pipes.

43:38.382 --> 43:42.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JYOTI SHARME: These are all
pipelines made
by the people themselves. And
these motors,

43:42.787 --> 43:50.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they actually create a suction
vacuum. So,
if there is no water in the
pipeline, any

43:50.495 --> 43:54.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crack in the pipe will allow
sewer or dirty
water to get into the pipelines.

43:54.866 --> 44:00.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And things
have hardly
improved for most people since
our 2010 visit.

44:00.471 --> 44:06.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
K.H. PATIL, State Legislator: In
India, every
21 seconds, we lose a child.

44:06.577 --> 44:11.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: K.H. Patil
is a state
legislator and self-described
water activist

44:11.883 --> 44:13.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the southern province of
Karnataka.

44:13.751 --> 44:21.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
K.H. PATIL: Because of
contaminated water,
the health of our children is
really very

44:21.759 --> 44:23.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
badly affected.

44:23.694 --> 44:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Across
India, it is contaminated
by industrial and agricultural
discharges

44:28.766 --> 44:31.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and poor to nonexistent sewage
treatment.

44:31.602 --> 44:37.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have got two glasses from
either end of
the purification process. This
one has clean

44:37.074 --> 44:42.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water. This one has the raw
water that comes
out of the ground. They're
indistinguishable

44:42.547 --> 44:49.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the naked eye, but Amit
Mishra here has
a meter to measure the total
dissolved solids,

44:49.554 --> 44:54.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it's here that you really
see the difference.
So, let's do the clean water
first.

44:54.659 --> 44:58.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMIT MISHRA: So, the clean water

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: One hundred
and 30, within
the World Health Organization
range for drinkable

45:04.068 --> 45:04.569 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
water.

45:04.602 --> 45:06.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMIT MISHRA: Yes.

45:06.137 --> 45:13.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: OK, and
let's go to the
contaminated water now, 1,912.

45:13.911 --> 45:16.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, this is really like poison?

45:16.213 --> 45:17.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMIT MISHRA: This is really like
poison.

45:18.015 --> 45:22.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And it's
what many people
consume: so-called raw water
drawn directly

45:22.987 --> 45:28.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the ground, sometimes
bottled and sold
by unscrupulous, unregulated
operators.

45:28.326 --> 45:32.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIT MISHRA: For our uneducated,
there is
no difference between the clean
and the clear.

45:32.997 --> 45:38.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But among
those who have
literally gotten a taste of
clean water, there's

45:38.169 --> 45:44.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growing awareness of the health
benefits.
In the tiny space that is living
room, bedroom

45:44.041 --> 45:49.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and kitchen, Poonam echoed what
we heard from
several Sarvajal customers, as
she prepared

45:49.847 --> 45:56.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the family dinner, carefully
pouring the water
that's just as precious as her
staple rice.

45:56.053 --> 46:01.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): In
the past, we
always suffered from upset
stomachs, frequently

46:02.026 --> 46:07.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
running to the latrine. We had
to go long
distances to pick it up, and so
we would buy

46:07.732 --> 46:11.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
water, and that was full of
chemicals. This
water is really good.

46:11.469 --> 46:18.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
K.H. PATIL: People see what is
happening,
and with all that, now they are
getting educated.

46:18.342 --> 46:23.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And Minister
Patil says
governments at all levels are
starting to

46:23.514 --> 46:25.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
respond to the drinking water
crisis.

46:25.950 --> 46:32.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Karnataka government, for
example, has
commissioned 7,000 kiosks or
ATMs like this

46:33.024 --> 46:38.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one in a semirural area, pinning
high hopes
on technology and on private
companies that

46:39.030 --> 46:45.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run these facilities that will
have an incentive
to improve the notoriously
unreliable service.

46:45.436 --> 46:51.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For your incentive to keep the
thing running
properly is very plain to see.
You will lose

46:51.809 --> 46:54.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
money if the system is down.

46:54.779 --> 46:56.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMIT MISHRA: Yes.

46:56.514 --> 46:59.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Still, he
says, despite
many satisfied customers, growth
has been

46:59.850 --> 47:02.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
slower than Sarvajal had
planned.

47:02.620 --> 47:07.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The politics are complicated, he
says, in
the world's most populous
democracy, even

47:07.324 --> 47:10.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for life's most basic necessity.

47:10.261 --> 47:14.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this
Fred de Sam Lazaro
in New Delhi.

47:14.365 --> 47:19.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Fred's
reporting is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories
Project at the

47:19.704 --> 47:33.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University of St. Thomas in
Minnesota.

47:33.284 --> 47:35.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now a "NewsHour" essay.

47:35.219 --> 47:41.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chef Jacques Pepin arrived in
the United States
from France in 1959. He is the
author of the

47:41.225 --> 47:47.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
widely cited French culinary
text book "La
Technique," the star of several
PBS cooking

47:47.732 --> 47:52.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shows, including one with his
friend and fellow
cook the late Julia Child.

47:52.603 --> 47:56.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, Pepin shares his idea
on the essence
of a recipe.

47:56.640 --> 48:02.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUES PEPIN, Chef: For someone
who writes
recipes, there is a paradox
between the written

48:02.313 --> 48:05.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recipe and the creation of a
taste.

48:05.983 --> 48:11.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When writing a recipe, one
records a moment
in time which can never be
duplicated exactly

48:11.622 --> 48:18.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again. The paradox is that the
recipe tells
the reader, this must be done
this way, when,

48:18.462 --> 48:25.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in fact, to get the result
you're looking
for, the recipe has to be
modified each time.

48:25.469 --> 48:31.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The exact reproduction of a
taste, which is
what the making of a dish is,
only works when

48:31.542 --> 48:36.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the processes, timing, and
ingredients are
adjusted and changed to fit each
particular

48:36.347 --> 48:38.182 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
situation.

48:38.215 --> 48:44.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a gap between the
step-by-step procedure
and the completed dish, just as
an artist

48:44.855 --> 48:49.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cannot equate the technical
process of painting
with the finished work of art.

48:49.460 --> 48:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Several years ago, I wrote a
recipe for pears
in caramel sauce. The idea was,
you peel the

48:56.033 --> 49:00.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pears, cut them in half, remove
the seeds,
sprinkle them with sugar, and
place them in

49:00.504 --> 49:06.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very hot oven. Exposed to the
heat, the
juice of the pear seeps out,
combines with

49:06.076 --> 49:09.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the sugar and creates a caramel.
By then,
the pears are cooked.

49:10.014 --> 49:15.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Add cream to the caramel, and
the resulting
sauce is poured around the pear
in a serving

49:15.186 --> 49:21.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dish. As the sauce cools and
thickens, it
is finished with a bit of pear
brandy or cognac.

49:21.659 --> 49:28.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I first created this
recipe, the pears
were done in 30 minutes. That
amount of time

49:28.165 --> 49:34.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only reflects the unique set of
circumstances
I faced, ripeness of the pear,
type of roasting

49:34.772 --> 49:39.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
pan I used. This is what
happened on that
particular day.

49:39.977 --> 49:45.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The next time, I used pears that
were more
ripe, and they were done in 10
minutes. But

49:45.683 --> 49:51.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the liquid around hadn't yet
turned into a
caramel. So I removed the pears,
reduced the

49:51.222 --> 49:54.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
liquid to a caramel, and
finished it with
cream.

49:54.258 --> 50:00.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The third time, I used Bosc
pears that were
very hard. No juice came out of
the pears.

50:00.664 --> 50:06.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sugar started burning. So I
had to add
water to the pan to create a
caramel. The

50:06.971 --> 50:13.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pears needed almost an hour of
cooking, even
though my recipe said 30
minutes. Yet, at

50:13.310 --> 50:16.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the end, the three dishes looked
and taste
the same.

50:16.213 --> 50:23.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the recipe had been followed
to the letter,
the finished dish would have
been a disaster,

50:23.087 --> 50:29.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but understanding the idea in
the platonic
sense behind the dish enables
the cook to

50:29.059 --> 50:31.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
adjust and compensate for
ingredients, temperature,
humidity, et cetera.

50:31.829 --> 50:42.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what is the point of at
recipe? A recipe
is a teaching tool, a guide, a
point of departure.

50:42.806 --> 50:47.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to follow it exactly
the first time
you make the dish. But as you
make it again

50:47.811 --> 50:53.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and again, you will change it,
you will massage
it to fit your own taste, your
own sense of

50:53.651 --> 50:55.419 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
aesthetic.

50:55.452 --> 50:59.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have had dinner many times at
the home of
friends who cooked from one of
my cookbooks

50:59.857 --> 51:05.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and have often been amazed at
how far away
the dish has moved from the
original recipe.

51:05.496 --> 51:13.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is not necessarily a
negative experience.
In fact, it is sometimes better
than the original.

51:13.337 --> 51:23.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I end up getting credit and
thanks for
a dish that has nothing to do
with me anymore.

51:23.380 --> 51:32.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now for our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

51:32.323 --> 51:34.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you too.

51:34.358 --> 51:38.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama hosted the sixth
annual White
House Science Fair today. There
were more

51:38.829 --> 51:44.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than 130 students from 30 states
in attendance.
Among the projects presented by
elementary,

51:44.969 --> 51:52.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
middle and high school students,
a water-powered
generator, a prototype robot
that could help

51:52.476 --> 51:55.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clean subway tracks, and even a
student-designed,
3-D-printed bubble wand.

51:55.746 --> 52:00.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Have you tested out the bubble
wands?

52:00.351 --> 52:01.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Yes, sir.

52:01.151 --> 52:02.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Do they work?

52:02.519 --> 52:03.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Yes, sir.

52:03.587 --> 52:05.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Do you want to try
one?

52:05.322 --> 52:07.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: Yes. Do you want to try
one?

52:07.057 --> 52:13.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: You want -- you
know what? What
do you think we get some bubbles
going on

52:13.998 --> 52:14.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right here?

52:14.965 --> 52:18.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know what? Clearly, I am out
of practice.

52:18.535 --> 52:19.470 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:19.503 --> 52:22.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK, we won't
comment on that.

personal evolution and the
effect of income
inequality in the United States.
