01:48.608 --> 01:50.444
THE NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS ARE ON

01:50.444 --> 01:51.645
THEIR OWN.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.113
THEY ARE STANDING SEPARATE FROM

01:53.113 --> 01:55.449
ANYTHING ELSE, AND NO DISCUSSION

01:55.449 --> 01:56.850
HAS EVER TAKEN PLACE ABOUT

02:52.272 --> 02:53.440
AUTHORITIES IN MEXICO NOW

02:53.440 --> 02:54.574
BELIEVE THEY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

02:54.574 --> 02:55.842

03:03.550 --> 03:05.185
REMAINS HAVE BEEN FOUND AND ARE

03:05.185 --> 03:06.219

THEY WEAR CONSERVATIVE OUTFITS

03:31.478 --> 03:32.646
AND NO MAKEUP.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.381
THEY WOULD ALSO NEED PERMISSION

03:34.381 --> 03:35.649
FROM A MALE RELATIVE.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.384
SOME SAUDI MEDIA DISPUTED THE

03:37.384 --> 03:38.418
ACCOUNT.

03:38.418 --> 03:39.553
THE PRESIDENT MADE IT OFFICIAL

>> Sreenivasan: IF CONFIRMED BY

AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN TO HOLD

04:01.208 --> 04:01.975
THE POST.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.376
STILL ANOTHER STUDENT HAS DIED

04:03.376 --> 04:04.911
IN THE AFTERMATH OF THAT SCHOOL

04:04.911 --> 04:06.513
CAFETERIA SHOOTING NORTH OF

04:06.513 --> 04:08.115
SEATTLE TWO WEEKS AGO.

THE LATEST VICTIM IS 15-YEAR-OLD

04:09.416 --> 04:10.617
ANDREW FRYBERG.

04:10.617 --> 04:12.085
HIS COUSIN, JAYLEN FRYBERG, WAS

04:12.085 --> 04:12.886
THE SHOOTER.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.521
THREE 14-YEAR-OLDS WERE ALSO

04:14.521 --> 04:15.922
KILLED IN THE ATTACK.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.390
WORD OF A NEW TOOL TO FIGHT THE

04:17.390 --> 04:19.526
HARASSMENT OF WOMEN ONLINE.

04:19.526 --> 04:20.727
TWITTER IS TEAMING UP WITH A

04:20.727 --> 04:21.995
WOMEN’S ADVOCACY GROUP TO HELP

04:21.995 --> 04:23.230
USERS REPORT AND IDENTIFY

04:23.230 --> 04:25.198
ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR ON THE ONLINE

04:25.198 --> 04:27.000
PLATFORM IN THE HOPES OF

04:27.000 --> 04:29.102
RESOLVING IT WITHIN 24 HOURS.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.270
THE COMPANY HAD BEEN CRITICIZED

04:30.270 --> 04:31.972
FOR NOT RESPONDING AGGRESSIVELY

04:31.972 --> 04:34.508
ENOUGH TO ONLINE ABUSE CLAIMS.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.476
AND SOME NEW, MORE DIVERSE FACES

04:36.476 --> 04:37.878
MIGHT SOON BE USED FOR THOSE

04:37.878 --> 04:39.513
EMOJI SYMBOLS THAT YOU PROBABLY

04:39.513 --> 04:40.914
HAVE SEEN OR USED ON YOUR

04:40.914 --> 04:41.448
SMARTPHONES.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.183
THIS IS WHAT A FACE LOOKS LIKE

04:43.183 --> 04:44.885
TODAY, BUT THIS IS WHAT

04:44.885 --> 04:46.386
ENGINEERS SAY THEY COULD LOOK

04:46.386 --> 04:47.654
LIKE IN THE FUTURE.

04:47.654 --> 04:48.755
THE NEW SKIN TONES COULD BE

04:48.755 --> 04:50.257
ROLLED OUT BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT

04:50.257 --> 04:51.024
YEAR.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.626
AND A NEW MEASURE OF WEALTH

04:52.626 --> 04:54.194
INEQUALITY HAS BEEN RELEASED.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.730
THE CHARITY, OXFAM, SAYS THE 85

04:56.730 --> 04:58.932
RICHEST PEOPLE ON EARTH TOGETHER

04:58.932 --> 05:00.867
HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY AS

05:00.867 --> 05:04.104
THE POOREST 3.5 BILLION PEOPLE.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.205
THE GROUP SAYS THE NUMBER OF

05:05.205 --> 05:06.173
BILLIONAIRES HAS DOUBLED IN THE

05:06.173 --> 05:07.407
PAST FIVE YEARS, A PERIOD IT

05:07.407 --> 05:09.276
SAYS THAT HAS BEEN MARKED BY AN

05:09.276 --> 05:11.545
EXPLOSION IN INEQUALITY.

05:21.788 --> 05:22.756
>> Sreenivasan: IN IRAQ, A

05:22.756 --> 05:24.324
SUICIDE BOMBER ATTACKED A POLICE

05:24.324 --> 05:25.759
CONVOY, KILLING EIGHT PEOPLE,

05:25.759 --> 05:27.460
INCLUDING A SENIOR OFFICER.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.562
THE INCIDENT OCCURRED IN THE

05:28.562 --> 05:30.163
CITY OF BEIJI, THE SITE OF THE

05:30.163 --> 05:31.965
NATION’S LARGEST OIL REFINERY,

05:31.965 --> 05:34.467
APPROXIMATELY 150 MILES NORTH OF

05:34.467 --> 05:35.569
BAGHDAD.

05:35.569 --> 05:36.636
GOVERNMENT FORCES HAVE BEEN

05:36.636 --> 05:37.904
BATTLING ISLAMIC STATE

05:37.904 --> 05:39.439
EXTREMISTS THERE FOR SOME TIME

05:39.439 --> 05:40.307
NOW.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.841
AT LEAST 32 OTHERS WERE KILLED

05:41.841 --> 05:43.677
TODAY IN A SERIES OF BOMBINGS IN

05:43.677 --> 05:45.345
AND AROUND BAGHDAD.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.380
ALL THIS, A DAY AFTER PRESIDENT

05:47.380 --> 05:49.282
OBAMA ANNOUNCED PLANS TO DOUBLE

05:49.282 --> 05:50.850
THE NUMBER OF AMERICAN MILITARY

05:50.850 --> 05:53.887
ADVISORS IN IRAQ TO ABOUT 3,000.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.188
FOR MORE, AS PART OF OUR

05:55.188 --> 05:56.356
CONTINUING INTERVIEW SERIES,

05:56.356 --> 05:58.191
"THE WAR ON ISIS," WE ARE JOINED

05:58.191 --> 05:59.826
NOW FROM WASHINGTON BY ANTHONY

05:59.826 --> 06:00.327
CORDESMAN.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.595
HE IS WITH THE CENTER FOR

06:01.595 --> 06:02.662
STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL

06:02.662 --> 06:04.297
STUDIES AND WAS THE DIRECTOR OF

06:04.297 --> 06:05.632
INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT IN THE

06:05.632 --> 06:07.033
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF

06:07.033 --> 06:07.834
DEFENSE.

06:07.834 --> 06:08.902
I THINK THE FIRST QUESTION

06:08.902 --> 06:09.936
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ON

06:09.936 --> 06:11.671
THEIR MINDS IS, IS THIS MISSION

06:11.671 --> 06:12.272
CREEP?

06:12.272 --> 06:14.007
WHY ARE WE SENDING THESE

06:14.007 --> 06:15.308
ADDITIONAL TROOPS IN?

06:15.308 --> 06:16.843
>> I THINK WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND

06:16.843 --> 06:19.713
WHAT THE MISSION REALLY IS.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.548
WE HAVE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND TO

06:21.548 --> 06:23.717
ESSENTIALLY REBUILD THE IRAQI

06:23.717 --> 06:28.021
ARMY, CREATE A SUNNI FORCE IN

06:28.021 --> 06:30.023
THE AREAS NOW OCCUPIED BY THE

06:30.023 --> 06:32.892
ISLAMIC STATE, AND HELP THE

06:32.892 --> 06:34.828
PESHMERGA BECOME AN EFFECTIVE

06:34.828 --> 06:37.030
MILITARY FORCE.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.599
NOW, WE HAD ABOUT 1,400 PEOPLE

06:39.599 --> 06:42.002
OFFICIALLY ON THE GROUND WHEN

06:42.002 --> 06:43.436
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE.

06:43.436 --> 06:44.938
THE ACTUAL NUMBERS WERE HIGHER,

06:44.938 --> 06:46.373
BUT NOT EVERYBODY WAS BEING

06:46.373 --> 06:47.941
COUNTED.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.843
BUT THAT WAS SCARCELY ENOUGH TO

06:49.843 --> 06:52.345
TRAIN NINE BRIGADES OF IRAQI

06:52.345 --> 06:54.814
FORCES, AND THE IRAQI ARMY HAS

06:54.814 --> 06:56.883
TO BE REBUILT ALMOST FROM THE

06:56.883 --> 06:58.551
GROUND UP.

06:58.551 --> 06:59.819
IT WASN’T ENOUGH TO TRAIN AN

06:59.819 --> 07:01.621
ADDITIONAL THREE PESHMERGA

07:01.621 --> 07:03.256
BRIGADES.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.026
AND ADDING ANOTHER 1,500 PEOPLE

07:06.026 --> 07:07.560
CERTAINLY ISN’T GOING TO BE THE

07:07.560 --> 07:09.396
END OF THIS MISSION.

07:09.396 --> 07:11.464
IF WE’RE SUCCESSFUL AND WE CAN

07:11.464 --> 07:14.634
CREATE SUNNI UNITS AS WELL,

07:14.634 --> 07:15.935
WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO DRIVING

07:15.935 --> 07:18.705
OUT THE ISLAMIC STATE.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.073
SO IT ISN’T A MATTER OF MISSION

07:20.073 --> 07:20.674
CREEP.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.375
FROM THE START IT’S BEEN CLEAR,

07:22.375 --> 07:25.912
THE AIR CAMPAIGN COULD ONLY WORK

07:25.912 --> 07:27.781
IF YOU COULD GET POLITICAL UNITY

07:27.781 --> 07:29.883
WITHIN IRAQ, AND YOU COULD

07:29.883 --> 07:32.085
CREATE A MIX OF IRAQI GROUND

07:32.085 --> 07:34.120
FORCES THAT COULD DRIVE THE

07:34.120 --> 07:35.955
ISLAMIC STATE OUT.

07:35.955 --> 07:36.890
>> Sreenivasan: SO IS THERE

07:36.890 --> 07:39.726
SOME CONFIDENCE THAT EITHER THE

07:39.726 --> 07:41.461
U.S. OR ANYONE ELSE HAS THAT

07:41.461 --> 07:43.863
ADDING THESE 1,500 MILITARY

07:43.863 --> 07:45.498
TRAINERS, RAMPING UP, LET’S SAY,

07:45.498 --> 07:47.567
ANOTHER 20,000 IRAQI TROOPS IN A

07:47.567 --> 07:49.836
FEW MONTHS, WILL BE ENOUGH?

07:49.836 --> 07:50.704
>> WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL

07:50.704 --> 07:51.204
HERE.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.839
NO, THERE IS NO CONFIDENCE THAT

07:52.839 --> 07:54.474
THIS WILL BE ENOUGH.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.575
FIRST, IT ISN’T A MATTER OF

07:55.575 --> 07:56.643
MONTHS, ALTHOUGH YOU CAN MAKE

07:56.643 --> 07:58.912
PROGRESS WITH THE BETTER UNITS

07:58.912 --> 08:00.413
IN THAT TIME.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.716
IT’S BEEN STATED VERY CLEARLY

08:02.716 --> 08:05.285
THIS COULD TAKE SEVERAL YEARS.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.854
AND FOR IT TO WORK, YOU HAVE TO

08:07.854 --> 08:10.323
CONVINCE THE SUNNIS IN THE

08:10.323 --> 08:12.859
WESTERN PART OF IRAQ AND IN KEY

08:12.859 --> 08:15.428
AREAS IN THE NORTH LIKE MOSUL,

08:15.428 --> 08:17.430
THAT THEY WILL SPLIT WITH THE

08:17.430 --> 08:19.566
ISLAMIC STATE, THAT THEY WILL

08:19.566 --> 08:21.601
HAVE THEIR OWN MILITARY IDENTITY

08:21.601 --> 08:23.903
IN THESE NATIONAL GUARD UNITS,

08:23.903 --> 08:25.071
AND THOSE NATIONAL GUARD UNITS

08:25.071 --> 08:26.806
ARE GOING TO REQUIRE A MAJOR

08:26.806 --> 08:29.275
U.S. EFFORT TO TRAIN AND EQUIP.

08:29.275 --> 08:30.410
>> Sreenivasan: WAS THERE A

08:30.410 --> 08:31.711
TIPPING POINT THAT FORCED THIS?

08:31.711 --> 08:33.179
IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS WE’VE

08:33.179 --> 08:34.781
TALKED ABOUT SEVERAL ATTACKS

08:34.781 --> 08:36.216
GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE

08:36.216 --> 08:37.217
CITY OF BAGHDAD.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.351
>> NO, NOT REALLY.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.652
I MEAN, THE FACT THAT IT CAN

08:39.652 --> 08:41.688
OPERATE NEAR BAGHDAD OR BAGHDAD

08:41.688 --> 08:43.890
AIRPORT HAS BEEN A REALITY FOR

08:43.890 --> 08:45.091
MONTHS NOW.

08:45.091 --> 08:47.927
THE TIPPING POINT IS POLITICAL.

08:47.927 --> 08:49.863
WHAT’S HAPPENED IS THAT MALIKI,

08:49.863 --> 08:51.798
WHO PROVOKED A CIVIL WAR, IS

08:51.798 --> 08:53.099
GONE.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.801
YOU HAVE A PRIME MINISTER WHO

08:54.801 --> 08:56.770
NOW HAS A MINISTER OF DEFENSE

08:56.770 --> 08:59.205
AND A MINISTER OF INTERIOR.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.807
YOU HAVE SOMETHING APPROACHING A

09:00.807 --> 09:02.542
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.577
YOU NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUT

09:04.577 --> 09:06.713
U.S. ADVISERS IN THAT CAN

09:06.713 --> 09:10.083
ACTUALLY TRAIN IRAQI FORCES AND

09:10.083 --> 09:12.285
HELP REBUILD THE ARMY THAT

09:12.285 --> 09:14.788
MALIKI HELPED DESTROY.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.756
AND YOU HAVE ENOUGH CONSENSUS TO

09:16.756 --> 09:19.092
BOOST AND SUPPORT THE PESHMERGA

09:19.092 --> 09:20.660
FORCES.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.595
THIS IS AN ONGOING POLITICAL

09:22.595 --> 09:23.329
STRUGGLE.

09:23.329 --> 09:24.697
WE DON’T KNOW HOW IT WILL COME

09:24.697 --> 09:25.932
OUT.

09:25.932 --> 09:27.467
AND AS YET, THE SUNNIS, WHICH

09:27.467 --> 09:29.903
ARE KEY TO OUR SUCCESS, HAVE NOT

09:29.903 --> 09:32.906
IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY, TURNED

09:32.906 --> 09:34.674
AGAINST THE ISLAMIC STATE.

09:34.674 --> 09:35.608
>> Sreenivasan: WHILE WE’VE

09:35.608 --> 09:37.010
BEEN FOCUSED ON THE TROOP

09:37.010 --> 09:38.077
MOVEMENTS AND THE INCREASED

09:38.077 --> 09:39.312
PRESENCE OF AMERICAN TROOPS IN

09:39.312 --> 09:40.513
IRAQ, WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING IN

09:40.513 --> 09:42.582
SYRIA?

09:42.582 --> 09:43.850
>> WELL, WE SUFFERED VERY

09:43.850 --> 09:45.885
SERIOUS REVERSES.

09:45.885 --> 09:47.320
TWO OF THE KEY ELEMENTS THAT WE

09:47.320 --> 09:50.523
PUT TRAINING AND ARMS INTO, THE

09:50.523 --> 09:53.226
ONLY REALLY MODERATE ELEMENTS IN

09:53.226 --> 09:55.929
THE NORTHERN PART OF SYRIA

09:55.929 --> 09:58.298
HAVE SUFFERED SERIOUS DEFEATS

09:58.298 --> 10:01.301
NEAR THE TURKISH BORDER BY A

10:01.301 --> 10:03.236
DIFFERENT ISLAMIST EXTREMIST

10:03.236 --> 10:05.572
GROUP, THE AL-NUSRA FRONT.

10:05.572 --> 10:06.739
WE DON’T KNOW HOW MUCH EQUIPMENT

10:06.739 --> 10:09.275
THEY’VE LOST, HOW MUCH MILITARY

10:09.275 --> 10:11.311
CAPABILITY THEY’VE LOST, BUT THE

10:11.311 --> 10:13.680
UNITS WE DID MOST TO TRAIN AND

10:13.680 --> 10:14.781
THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THE

10:14.781 --> 10:17.283
CORE OF THIS FORCE OF FREE

10:17.283 --> 10:18.852
SYRIAN UNITS THAT WE WERE GOING

10:18.852 --> 10:21.855
TO BUILD UP WITH 5,000 BEING

10:21.855 --> 10:23.623
TRAINED IN SAUDI ARABIA, AND

10:23.623 --> 10:26.493
ANOTHER 5,000 TRAINED ELSEWHERE,

10:26.493 --> 10:28.695
HAVE TAKEN A VERY SERIOUS SET OF

10:28.695 --> 10:29.996
REVERSES.

10:29.996 --> 10:32.499
HOW BAD THAT REVERSE IS, IS

10:32.499 --> 10:33.666
SOMETHING WHICH THE DEPARTMENT

10:33.666 --> 10:36.002
OF DEFENSE COULDN’T ESTIMATE, AT

10:36.002 --> 10:37.804
LEAST AS OF YESTERDAY.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.559
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, PONCE

15:59.559 --> 16:01.260
SAYS, WHEN THESE DEPORTATIONS

16:01.260 --> 16:02.995
STARTED, U.S. AUTHORITIES WERE

16:02.995 --> 16:05.298
PROVIDING NO INFORMATION ABOUT

16:05.298 --> 16:09.268
WHO WAS HEADING THEIR WAY.

16:09.268 --> 16:09.902
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.370
SO, THE U.S. WAS DEPORTING

16:35.461 --> 16:37.797

THE CONSTELLATION TAURUS IN

22:27.413 --> 22:29.815
DISTANT SPACE, PLANETS ARE BEING

22:29.815 --> 22:30.416
BORN.

22:30.416 --> 22:31.350
HOW DO WE KNOW?

22:31.350 --> 22:32.618
BECAUSE SCIENTISTS ARE OBSERVING

22:32.618 --> 22:34.820
IT HAPPEN MORE CLEARLY THAN EVER

22:34.820 --> 22:35.854
BEFORE.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.523
USING THE ALMA RADIO TELESCOPE

22:37.523 --> 22:39.525
IN CHILE, ASTRONOMERS WERE ABLE

22:39.525 --> 22:41.293
TO CAPTURE THIS IMAGE SHOWING A

22:41.293 --> 22:43.629
STAR SURROUNDED BY A LARGE DISC

22:43.629 --> 22:45.497
MADE OF GAS AND DUST.

22:45.497 --> 22:46.398
IT MAY LOOK LIKE AN ARTIST’S

22:46.398 --> 22:47.666
ILLUSTRATION, BUT, IN FACT, AT

22:47.666 --> 22:49.868
THE CENTER OF THIS IMAGE IS THE

22:49.868 --> 22:52.504
REAL H.L. TAURI STAR.

22:52.504 --> 22:53.772
AND THE DARK RINGS-- THAT’S

22:53.772 --> 22:54.974
BELIEVED TO BE THE DUST AND GAS

22:54.974 --> 22:56.909
COMING TOGETHER TO FORM PLANETS,

22:56.909 --> 22:58.410
METEORS AND ASTEROIDS.

22:58.410 --> 23:01.547
H.L. TAURI IS 450 LIGHT YEARS

23:01.547 --> 23:03.048
FROM EARTH, AND EVEN THOUGH IT’S

23:03.048 --> 23:04.850
ALMOST ONE MILLION YEARS OLD,

23:04.850 --> 23:06.485
ASTRONOMERS CONSIDER IT QUITE

23:06.485 --> 23:07.186
YOUNG.

23:07.186 --> 23:08.320
FOR DECADES, ASTRONOMERS HAVE

23:08.320 --> 23:09.488
KNOWN OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE

23:09.488 --> 23:11.357
STAR BUT HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO

23:11.357 --> 23:12.958
SEE IT CLEARLY.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.360
BUT NOW, HIGH UP IN CHILE’S

23:14.360 --> 23:16.028
ATACAMA DESERT, SCIENTISTS

23:16.028 --> 23:17.763
ARE USING RADIO FREQUENCIES TO

23:17.763 --> 23:19.865
GATHER EMISSIONS FROM GAS, DUST

23:19.865 --> 23:21.533
AND STARS TO MAKE HIGH-

23:21.533 --> 23:22.868
RESOLUTION IMAGES OF THE

23:22.868 --> 23:24.703
UNIVERSE, IMAGES EVEN SHARPER

23:24.703 --> 23:26.171
THAN SOME OF THOSE TAKEN FROM

23:26.171 --> 23:27.606
SPACE BY NASA’S HUBBLE

23:27.606 --> 23:28.874
TELESCOPE.

23:28.874 --> 23:29.742
THE FINDINGS HAVE SHAKEN

23:29.742 --> 23:31.343
ASTRONOMERS’ THEORIES.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.579
>> EVEN AT THIS YOUNG AGE, ALMA

23:33.579 --> 23:34.947
HAS DISCOVERED THAT WE ALREADY

23:34.947 --> 23:36.548
HAVE LARGE PLANETARY CORES

23:36.548 --> 23:37.383
FORMING.

23:37.383 --> 23:39.118
SO, THE PROCESS OF PLANET

23:39.118 --> 23:41.086
FORMATION HAS TO OCCUR MUCH

23:41.086 --> 23:42.821
FASTER AND MUCH EARLIER THAN WE

23:42.821 --> 23:44.189
HAD EVER EXPECTED.

23:44.189 --> 23:45.190
>> Sreenivasan: THE NEW PICTURE

23:45.190 --> 23:46.959
HAS GOTTEN SCIENTISTS EXCITED

23:46.959 --> 23:48.627
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE

23:48.627 --> 23:49.628
TELESCOPE.

23:49.628 --> 23:51.797
>> IMAGE AND DISCOVERY REPRESENT

23:51.797 --> 23:54.633
A MILESTONE IN THE HISTORY OF

23:54.633 --> 23:56.902
ALMA, AND IT’S A DREAM THAT’S

23:56.902 --> 23:57.503
COME TRUE.

23:57.503 --> 23:58.604
I MEAN, PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT

23:58.604 --> 24:00.372
ABOUT IT FOR 20 YEARS, AND NOW

24:00.372 --> 24:01.173
WE SEE IT.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.308
>> Sreenivasan: WITH THE NEW

24:02.308 --> 24:03.809
IMAGE DISPLAYING DETAIL NEVER

24:03.809 --> 24:05.878
BEFORE SEEN, ASTRONOMERS ARE NOW

24:05.878 --> 24:07.346
HOPING TO EXPAND OUR

24:07.346 --> 24:09.214
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PLANETS

24:09.214 --> 24:11.583
FORM BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OUR

24:11.583 --> 24:13.652
OWN SOLAR SYSTEM.

24:25.431 --> 24:26.265
>> Sreenivasan: SOME MORE NEWS

24:26.265 --> 24:27.266
BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU TONIGHT.

24:27.266 --> 24:28.934
THE PENTAGON CONFIRMS THAT U.S.

24:28.934 --> 24:30.969
WARPLANES HIT A GATHERING OF TOP

24:30.969 --> 24:33.205
ISIS LEADERS, POSSIBLY INCLUDING

24:33.205 --> 24:35.441
ITS TOP COMMANDER, ABU BAKR AL-

24:35.441 --> 24:36.408
BAGHDADI.

24:36.408 --> 24:37.643
ONE ARAB TELEVISION NETWORK

24:37.643 --> 24:38.711
QUOTED SOURCES AS SAYING

24:38.711 --> 24:40.846
BAGHDADI WAS CRITICALLY WOUNDED.

24:40.846 --> 24:41.847
THAT’S IT FOR THIS EDITION OF

24:41.847 --> 24:42.948
THE NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

24:42.948 --> 24:43.882
I’M HARI SREENIVASAN.

24:43.882 --> 24:44.950
SEE YOU BACK HERE TOMORROW

24:44.950 --> 24:45.217
