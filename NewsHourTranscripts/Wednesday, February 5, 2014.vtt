03:19:08.391 --> 03:19:43.926
17 SENTSZ PER SHARE.            
SO IT WILL DEAL A BLOW TO THEIR

SO IT WILL DEAL A BLOW TO THEIR

ARGUMENT ONE HEARS, EMPLOYERS   
WHEN THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PAY

11:14:29.024 --> 11:15:02.637
MANY PEOPLE.                    
AND THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN THE    
ECONOMY IS IN A FRAGILE STATE,  

11:15:02.675 --> 11:15:26.124
AND THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN THE    
ECONOMY IS IN A FRAGILE STATE,  
AS MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE IT IS    

11:15:26.181 --> 11:15:45.195
ECONOMY IS IN A FRAGILE STATE,

>> THE EVIDENCE REALLY DOESN'T  
HOLD UP ANYMORE.                

11:16:30.323 --> 11:16:59.501
>> THE EVIDENCE REALLY DOESN'T  
HOLD UP ANYMORE.                
THAT WAS TRUE-- WHICH I FIRST   

11:16:59.539 --> 11:17:23.007
HOLD UP ANYMORE.                
THAT WAS TRUE-- WHICH I FIRST   
CAME TO CONGRESS THERE WAS A LOT

11:17:23.045 --> 11:17:41.393
THAT WAS TRUE-- WHICH I FIRST   
CAME TO CONGRESS THERE WAS A LOT
OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT'S   

11:17:41.450 --> 11:17:47.122
CAME TO CONGRESS THERE WAS A LOT
OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT'S   
TRUE.                           

11:17:47.141 --> 11:18:30.308
OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT'S   
TRUE.                           
YOU LOOK AT AN EMPLOYER LIKE    

11:18:30.346 --> 11:18:58.896
TRUE.                           
YOU LOOK AT AN EMPLOYER LIKE    
COSTCO, THEY SEE GREATER SAVINGS

11:18:58.934 --> 11:19:33.175
YOU LOOK AT AN EMPLOYER LIKE    
COSTCO, THEY SEE GREATER SAVINGS
IN A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE

11:19:33.213 --> 11:20:06.826
COSTCO, THEY SEE GREATER SAVINGS
IN A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE
OF THE RETENTION OF THEIR       

11:20:06.864 --> 11:21:15.441
IN A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE
OF THE RETENTION OF THEIR       
QUALITY WORKERS AND NOT GETTINGS

11:21:15.479 --> 11:21:59.883
OF THE RETENTION OF THEIR       
QUALITY WORKERS AND NOT GETTINGS
THAT HAPPENS AT THE LOW-WAGE    

11:21:59.921 --> 11:22:05.612
QUALITY WORKERS AND NOT GETTINGS
THAT HAPPENS AT THE LOW-WAGE    
AREA.                           

11:22:05.650 --> 11:22:22.095
THAT HAPPENS AT THE LOW-WAGE    
AREA.                           
AND THAT'S WHY THEY SUPPORT THE 

11:22:22.133 --> 11:23:24.981
AREA.                           
AND THAT'S WHY THEY SUPPORT THE 
INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE.   

11:23:25.019 --> 11:24:03.733
AND THAT'S WHY THEY SUPPORT THE 
INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE.   
SO I THINK THE EVIDENCE IT      

11:24:03.771 --> 11:24:22.785
INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE.   
SO I THINK THE EVIDENCE IT

OVERWHELMING.
