GWEN IFILL: Good evening.

00:05.505 --> 00:06.473 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:08.342 --> 00:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: Donald
Trump attempts a campaign reset
with a focus

00:11.812 --> 00:15.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the economy, while Hillary
Clinton holds
tight to a lead.

00:15.415 --> 00:18.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead: The
Rio Olympic
Games are on.

00:19.019 --> 00:24.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We round up the best moments of
weekend wins,
and some of the lingering
controversy over

00:24.625 --> 00:26.326 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doping.

00:26.360 --> 00:30.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And refugees moving
to Upstate
New York discover their health
care needs

00:30.797 --> 00:32.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
move beyond what's visible.

00:32.733 --> 00:37.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KOWSAR ALI, Jericho Road: It's
actually hard
for them, because there's
nothing as depression.

00:37.237 --> 00:39.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say, OK, because that never
existed in
my country.

00:39.806 --> 00:41.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's nothing as depression.

00:41.174 --> 00:45.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:45.045 --> 00:49.816 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:49.850 --> 01:04.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Delta Air Lines
canceled more
than 400 flights today, after a
global crash

01:04.765 --> 01:06.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of its computer systems.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hours later, the carrier resumed
limited service.

01:09.536 --> 01:15.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the glitch also delayed more
than 1,000
flights, and left passengers
stranded.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some complained they'd been
given little information.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: When I got here, I waited.

01:19.379 --> 01:23.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I got here like 8:37 flight, and
then it kept
going, you know, delayed,
delaying it.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they never announced
that it was
canceled.

01:25.986 --> 01:29.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I had to call the service and
they told
me it was canceled.

01:29.222 --> 01:31.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they gave me another flight,
but now I
got a flight tomorrow.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it was the fact that they
didn't let me
know what was going on.

01:34.561 --> 01:37.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The trouble was
caused by a
power outage in Atlanta.

01:37.864 --> 01:44.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The utility Georgia Power said a
kind of industrial
circuit-breaker called a switch
gear failed.

01:44.671 --> 01:49.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just last month, Southwest
Airlines was hit
by an equipment failure that
canceled 2000

01:49.509 --> 01:51.411 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
flights.

01:51.445 --> 01:56.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Southwestern
Pakistan, a suicide
bombing killed at least 67
people today, and

01:56.450 --> 01:58.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wounded scores more.

01:58.218 --> 02:01.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It happened in a hospital in the
city of Quetta.

02:01.521 --> 02:04.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jonathan Rugman of Independent
Television
News reports.

02:04.891 --> 02:08.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: Ambulances
usually arrive
at hospitals in a hurry.

02:08.729 --> 02:14.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Quetta this morning, they
were leaving,
ferrying the injured away from
an attack on

02:14.234 --> 02:15.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a hospital itself.

02:15.969 --> 02:20.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As smoke filled the corridors,
it quickly
became clear the timing was
deliberate.

02:20.841 --> 02:28.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, men on a motorbike had
shot dead Bilal
Kasi, a senior lawyer on his way
to court.

02:28.215 --> 02:33.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then the group waited for his
fellow lawyers
to gather here before blowing
them up, the

02:33.720 --> 02:38.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so-called double tap, as cynical
as it was
cruel.

02:39.026 --> 02:43.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MERAJ TAREEN, Attorney: After
our bar association
president was targeted, we all
came to the

02:43.663 --> 02:45.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hospital.

02:45.532 --> 02:48.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were leaving the hospital
after Kasich's
autopsy and the media were
interviewing lawyers

02:48.969 --> 02:50.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
when the blast took place.

02:50.604 --> 02:54.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For many minutes, there was
darkness all around
us, and then we heard gunshots.

02:54.941 --> 02:59.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: Lawyers
complained to visiting
army chiefs that, while they
haven't been

02:59.379 --> 03:05.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allowed to drive their cars into
the hospital,
a suicide bomber had managed to
get through,

03:05.419 --> 03:11.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while the hospital's director
told the press
that just one guard armed with a
baton was

03:11.124 --> 03:17.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in charge of security, which
might seem all
the more scandalous, given that
these pictures

03:17.230 --> 03:22.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from January show the same
hospital, this
time receiving survivors from
another deadly

03:23.003 --> 03:26.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suicide bombing on another
medical facility
in the town.

03:27.007 --> 03:33.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, once again, Pakistanis are
crying out
for security, putting pressure
on their Prime

03:33.613 --> 03:38.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Minister, Nawaz Sharif, and his
army chief,
who visited the hospital this
evening.

03:38.351 --> 03:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"For God sake, don't back off,"
this survivor
told the prime minister.

03:43.023 --> 03:47.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"It's a handful of people we
must fight with
all our might.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Don't lose courage."

03:49.062 --> 03:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Both the Islamic
State group and
a breakaway Taliban faction
claimed responsibility

03:53.934 --> 03:55.469 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the attack.

03:55.502 --> 04:00.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Japan's Emperor
Akihito signaled
today he'd like to step down.

04:00.207 --> 04:05.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His position is symbolic, and he
has no political
power, but his abdication would
require a

04:05.645 --> 04:07.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
constitutional change.

04:07.514 --> 04:12.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spoke in a rare 10-minute
address pre-recorded
and broadcast nationally.

04:12.719 --> 04:19.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMPEROR AKIHITO, Japan (through
translator):
I am already more than 80 years
old, and fortunately

04:19.292 --> 04:21.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am now in good health.

04:21.094 --> 04:25.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, when I consider that my
fitness level
is gradually declining, I am
worried that

04:25.565 --> 04:30.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it may become difficult for me
to carry out
my duties with my whole being as
the symbol

04:30.237 --> 04:32.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the state, as I have done
until now.

04:32.672 --> 04:37.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Over the years,
Akihito has
had heart surgery and been
treated for prostate

04:37.777 --> 04:39.446 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cancer.

04:39.479 --> 04:44.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is the 125th emperor in a
dynastic line
that goes back more than 2,700
years.

04:44.951 --> 04:50.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Parts of Eastern
Mexico are reeling
after the remnants of Hurricane
Earl touched

04:50.557 --> 04:54.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
off deadly mudslides over the
weekend, killing
40 people.

04:54.661 --> 04:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Surging rainwater uprooted
buildings and tore
through concrete walls on
Saturday.

04:59.399 --> 05:04.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Soldiers and first-responders
worked Sunday
to clear debris caked in mud.

05:04.037 --> 05:09.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wal-Mart is
moving to muscle
up in online sales, buying
online retailer

05:09.576 --> 05:11.211 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Jet.com.

05:11.244 --> 05:17.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The deal announced today
includes $3 billion
in cash and $300 million in
stock.

05:17.417 --> 05:21.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Wal-Mart is looking to
strengthen its Web
presence and capitalize on a
growing group

05:21.621 --> 05:24.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of customers who want to buy in
bulk online.

05:24.891 --> 05:29.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On Wall Street
today, the Dow
Jones industrial average lost 14
points to

05:29.396 --> 05:32.332 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
close at 18,529.

05:32.365 --> 05:36.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell about eight
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 slipped two.

05:36.703 --> 05:43.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Russia fired
back today,
after its entire Paralympic team
was banned

05:43.109 --> 05:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from next month's games for
athletes with
physical disabilities.

05:46.880 --> 05:51.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Russian Organizing Committee
said the
ban for alleged doping amounts
to a human

05:51.451 --> 05:53.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rights abuse.

05:53.253 --> 05:57.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The same doping scandal barred
more than 100
Russian athletes from the
current Olympics

05:57.557 --> 05:59.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Rio de Janeiro.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Paralympics will also be in
Rio.

06:01.795 --> 06:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Donald Trump's
plan that he says will
revitalize the economy;

06:07.901 --> 06:15.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Olympians shattering
records and taking
home gold; a city caring for
refugees' unseen

06:15.475 --> 06:20.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
needs; and much more.

06:20.313 --> 06:32.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The two major
candidates for president
jostled for position in the last
week, stepping

06:32.959 --> 06:38.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into and out of political
corners, and attempting
to paint the other as unfit and
unstable.

06:38.932 --> 06:43.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Donald Trump stuck to
policy, while
Hillary Clinton stuck it to
Donald Trump.

06:43.436 --> 06:48.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
These reforms will offer biggest
tax revolution

06:48.541 --> 06:51.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since the Reagan tax reform.

06:51.244 --> 06:56.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump chose the
traditional campaign
setting of the Detroit Economic
Club to deliver

06:56.683 --> 07:00.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the sober outline of his
economic ideas, starting
with taxes.

07:00.754 --> 07:06.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I am proposing an
across-the-board
income tax reduction, especially
for middle-income

07:06.960 --> 07:08.295 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Americans.

07:08.328 --> 07:12.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This will lead to millions of
new and really
good-paying jobs.

07:12.932 --> 07:19.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rich will pay their fair
share, but no
one will pay so much that it
destroys jobs,

07:19.839 --> 07:23.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or undermines our ability as a
nation to compete.

07:24.010 --> 07:29.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But throughout his
scripted remarks,
Trump was regularly interrupted
at least a

07:29.549 --> 07:31.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dozen times by hecklers.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

07:34.487 --> 07:38.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will say, the Bernie Sanders
people had
far more energy and spirit.

07:38.925 --> 07:44.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump's tax plan
envisions three
income tax brackets of 33
percent, 25 percent

07:44.531 --> 07:46.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and 12 percent.

07:46.266 --> 07:51.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His original plan, last fall,
topped out at
25 percent for the wealthiest
earners.

07:51.705 --> 07:57.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump also argued for cutting
the top corporate
tax rate to 15 percent, less
than half what

07:57.477 --> 07:59.079 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it is now.

07:59.112 --> 08:02.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Republican nominee also
called for a freeze
on new government regulation.

08:02.949 --> 08:08.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: It is time to
remove the anchor
dragging us down.

08:08.455 --> 08:09.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's what it's doing.

08:09.622 --> 08:11.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's dragging us down.

08:11.991 --> 08:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Upon taking office, I will issue
a temporary
moratorium on new agency
regulations.

08:19.799 --> 08:25.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump said the
specifics of his
plan will be spelled out on his
Web site at

08:25.071 --> 08:26.906 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some point.

08:26.940 --> 08:31.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he used today's remarks to
attack Hillary
Clinton's approach to economic
policy, saying,

08:31.511 --> 08:34.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it punishes you for working and
doing business
in the United States.

08:34.647 --> 08:37.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
It's clear -- and a lot of the
journalists

08:37.717 --> 08:41.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have written this -- that Trump
is scrambling
to do damage control.

08:41.554 --> 08:46.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Clinton, who
campaigned in Florida
today, including a brewery tour
in St. Petersburg,

08:46.893 --> 08:49.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was quick to dismiss Trump's
economic plan.

08:49.329 --> 08:58.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: He wants
to basically
just repackage trickle-down
economics.

08:58.571 --> 09:00.306 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

09:00.340 --> 09:06.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Now, you
know, that
old saying, fool me once, shame
on you, fool

09:06.079 --> 09:07.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
me twice, shame on me?

09:07.947 --> 09:12.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The candidates
sparred as Trump
tumbled in the polls after a
series of political

09:12.886 --> 09:14.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
missteps last week.

09:14.854 --> 09:19.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Friday, he finally endorsed
House Speaker
Paul Ryan and others he had
initially declined

09:19.893 --> 09:21.828 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to support.

09:21.861 --> 09:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, a new face, little
known GOP operative
Evan McMullin, said he is hoping
to capitalize

09:27.100 --> 09:33.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on Republican unease by
launching his own
independent bid for president.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are the polls real?

09:34.674 --> 09:36.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Will the reset take?

09:36.443 --> 09:41.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the state of this
topsy turvy
political year, we turn to
Politics Monday.

09:41.347 --> 09:45.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's Amy Walter of The Cook
Political Report
and Tamara Keith of NPR.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome back, ladies.

09:47.220 --> 09:50.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tamara, tell me about this Trump
speech today.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Was this the reset, the pivot we
keep talking
about?

09:51.958 --> 09:53.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Or was
the last one the pivot?

09:53.359 --> 09:55.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Or was the last one?

09:55.094 --> 09:57.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Or was the last
one before that
the pivot?

09:57.897 --> 09:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton just said this.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is only one Trump.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are different flavors of
Donald Trump.

10:03.603 --> 10:07.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's teleprompter speech,
policy speech
Donald Trump, which is what we
got today.

10:07.707 --> 10:13.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is rally Donald Trump,
where he says
stuff and gets the crowd going,
and then there

10:13.580 --> 10:17.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is Twitter Donald Trump at
various hours of
the day.

10:17.750 --> 10:22.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is part -- about once every
month, we
get one of these teleprompter
speeches.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In some way, this was a reset.

10:24.390 --> 10:29.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His tax plan that you mentioned
in the piece,
it was on his Web site until
about 24 hours

10:29.996 --> 10:30.964 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

10:30.997 --> 10:32.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Then it came down.

10:32.832 --> 10:37.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now there's a new tax plan which
aligns with
a tax plan from House
Republicans, moves him

10:37.136 --> 10:41.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more into the orbit of the
Republican mainstream.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there were several things in
this speech
that moved him a little bit
closer to the

10:44.210 --> 10:45.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republican mainstream.

10:45.211 --> 10:46.179 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

10:46.212 --> 10:47.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Go ahead, Amy.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes.

10:49.048 --> 10:50.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's the key,
because if you
look at the biggest challenge
for Donald Trump

10:50.550 --> 10:53.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right now, he's doing very well
among these
white working-class voters.

10:53.119 --> 10:54.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We keep talking about that.

10:54.354 --> 10:57.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where he's not doing well are
white white-collar
voters.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this was a message directly
related to
them.

10:59.559 --> 11:02.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was interesting to see
Hillary Clinton
talk about repackaging
Reaganomics.

11:02.762 --> 11:06.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For a lot of those voters who
right now are
saying either I'm voting for
Hillary Clinton

11:06.366 --> 11:09.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or I'm undecided on Donald
Trump, they kind
of like the Reaganomics message.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They like the tax cut message.

11:11.538 --> 11:15.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They like the lack of regulation
-- or scaling
back on regulation message.

11:15.675 --> 11:20.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the economy is one -- of the
14 different
areas that The Wall Street
Journal poll asked

11:21.014 --> 11:26.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who do you think does a better
job of question,
Donald Trump only was ahead on
four of those.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One of those was the economy.

11:28.187 --> 11:32.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a place where, if I were
that campaign,
I would be spending much more
time talking

11:32.425 --> 11:36.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the economy, a lot less
time beating
up on your fellow Republicans.

11:36.596 --> 11:39.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And of course we are
going to
hear more from Hillary Clinton
on the subject

11:39.198 --> 11:41.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
later -- or as the week goes on
apparently
every day.

11:41.968 --> 11:47.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tam, let's talk about last
week's unforced,
or were they unforced errors,
the errors,

11:48.007 --> 11:49.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the series of errors.

11:49.175 --> 11:52.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that what led us to today, to
the teleprompter
speech?

11:52.278 --> 11:56.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It certainly would
seem like
he needed a reset.

11:56.849 --> 12:01.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He need to have a clean break
from last week's
sort of rolling errors.

12:01.888 --> 12:09.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, even as late as yesterday,
he was tweeting
fact-checks about the baby, the
baby being

12:09.429 --> 12:10.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a baby that...

12:10.597 --> 12:11.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Crying baby that he
made the joke
about.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: There was a crying
baby.

12:13.299 --> 12:16.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he made a joke and it
was interpreted
as him kicking a baby out of a
rally, when

12:16.502 --> 12:18.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
maybe the baby had already left.

12:18.972 --> 12:23.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as late as yesterday, he was
tweeting
about this.

12:23.042 --> 12:28.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So today's speech, the challenge
is, we are
getting closer and closer to the
general election.

12:28.548 --> 12:33.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in today's speech, he said I
will have
more specifics, I will have
details on my

12:33.853 --> 12:36.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Web site, tune in, in a couple
of weeks.

12:36.723 --> 12:39.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have heard that before.

12:39.292 --> 12:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I wait for digging into
policy, but
maybe this race isn't really
about policy.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.234 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:48.267 --> 12:50.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That's part of the
question.

12:50.036 --> 12:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But on the other hand, let's
just measure
this by -- just for giggles, by
conventional

12:54.540 --> 12:56.242 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
measures.

12:56.275 --> 13:01.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, including
during the Olympics,
is hammering him with anti-Trump
ads.

13:01.180 --> 13:04.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Not a peep in conventional sense
coming from
Donald Trump.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

13:05.918 --> 13:08.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He still has yet to show us that
he's going
to run a traditional campaign.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, look, he's gotten this far.

13:10.256 --> 13:11.290 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

13:11.324 --> 13:12.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Not one ad, not one
television
ad.

13:12.258 --> 13:13.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Not one television
ad.

13:13.259 --> 13:14.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He doesn't have a traditional
anything.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.762 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

13:15.795 --> 13:17.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he's gotten this far.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this is what we have been
going back
and forth about for this entire
campaign,

13:20.800 --> 13:24.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is he's either going to
show us at the
end of the day that he's upended
all the rules

13:24.303 --> 13:27.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of politics, that you don't need
these fancy
consultants, you don't need ads,
you don't

13:27.974 --> 13:32.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need polls, you don't need any
of it, just
your personality and your
message and the

13:32.478 --> 13:35.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
environment alone can drive
voters to the
polls.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But let me try
something with
you.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Yes, please.

13:38.284 --> 13:41.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: When we were sitting
at the conventions
and we heard him say, "I am your
voice," I

13:41.821 --> 13:45.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think we all agreed that that
was his message,
that he had settled on a
message.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have not heard that since.

13:47.593 --> 13:52.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, I think still
to the voters
that support him, that still is
the message,

13:52.265 --> 13:54.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he is going to be the
person that stands
up for us.

13:54.767 --> 13:58.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His challenge is that he hasn't
broadened
it beyond that same group of
voters he was

13:58.471 --> 14:00.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
speaking to at the convention.

14:00.273 --> 14:04.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this speech for the first
time what he
did was he married the
traditional sort of

14:04.410 --> 14:10.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chamber of Commerce, Republican
message on
taxes and entitlements with the
populist,

14:10.783 --> 14:16.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anti-NAFTA, anti-trade message
that he's been
saying on the trial, trying to
bring the party

14:16.489 --> 14:18.191 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
together.

14:18.224 --> 14:21.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, unifying the party has
been a challenge
that he continues to struggle
with.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And until he figures that out,
Hillary Clinton
is going to continue to have a
lead.

14:25.031 --> 14:28.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, and also for
the first time,
we have seen kind of both
candidates talking

14:28.868 --> 14:33.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about mental stability as an
issue, speaking
about their opponent.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

14:35.441 --> 14:39.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary's campaign begun this
several months
-- or at least a month ago, I
would say, talking

14:39.378 --> 14:43.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
about whether he's
temperamentally fit to
be president.

14:43.449 --> 14:48.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the convention, Michael
Bloomberg said,
let's choose a sane candidate.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that was a big moment.

14:50.056 --> 14:54.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's a major figure at a
convention talking
about sanity.

14:54.627 --> 14:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump this week seems to
have gone
to the "I know you are, but what
am I?"

14:59.999 --> 15:03.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school, and now he's saying that
Hillary Clinton
is temperamentally unfit.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Based on her comment
saying that
she short-circuited an answer on
e-mails.

15:06.539 --> 15:07.607 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:07.640 --> 15:09.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, she
short-circuited an
answer.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This has also spawned some
conspiracy theories
about her health.

15:12.411 --> 15:17.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, let's talk about
someone else
getting into the race, someone
probably I

15:17.383 --> 15:20.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think it's fair the three of us
had never
heard of, a gentleman by the
name of Evan

15:20.853 --> 15:25.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McMullin, who says he's going to
represent
all the Republicans who are not
for Trump.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

15:26.292 --> 15:27.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Who is he?

15:27.293 --> 15:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: He's a former CIA
operative.

15:29.862 --> 15:31.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's a former House staffer.

15:31.597 --> 15:36.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He now is retired from his
position at the
House.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is what we have been
talking about, I
feel like, at this table for so
long.

15:39.906 --> 15:42.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You have this group of
Republicans who say
they can't support Trump, but
they can't find

15:42.875 --> 15:44.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
somebody else to rally around.

15:44.243 --> 15:47.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here is his challenge, getting
on ballots
in many states.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The deadlines have closed.

15:49.315 --> 15:51.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The same time -- the
last time
we talked about David French
right now, yes.

15:51.317 --> 15:52.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Remember that, David
French?

15:52.685 --> 15:54.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His challenge, getting on
ballots.

15:54.453 --> 15:58.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a candidate who also
went to BYU,
the thought being he could play
well in a

15:58.491 --> 16:02.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
place like Utah or Arizona that
have a big
Mormon population.

16:02.228 --> 16:05.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Arizona, you have to get a lot
of signatures
to get on the ballot.

16:05.431 --> 16:09.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the deadline there is the
first week in
September.

16:09.569 --> 16:15.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Utah, not as arduous, but that
means just
like one or two states that he
may have an

16:15.875 --> 16:17.543 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
impact on.

16:17.577 --> 16:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, quite frankly, if we're
talking about
Arizona in Utah in September and
October,

16:21.514 --> 16:23.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this race is a blowout.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like, it's not even going to be
lose.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We might as well just sleep in
on Election
Day.

16:27.753 --> 16:30.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But except it
doesn't seem at
all to be the case.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: At least, no one is
willing to
quite go that far.

16:33.392 --> 16:37.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the Friday light, late
night, programmed
against the Olympics endorsement
of Paul Ryan,

16:38.030 --> 16:43.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kelly Ayotte, and John McCain,
does that help
them at all, or does it hurt
them?

16:43.135 --> 16:44.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: No.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it really looked like those
endorsements
came under duress.

16:46.305 --> 16:47.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He was reading.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He looked uncomfortable saying
it.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No, it doesn't help them.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

16:54.180 --> 16:58.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I were Senator Kelly Ayotte,
who right
now is looking at a very, very
tough race

16:58.184 --> 17:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a state that's now turning
away from Donald
Trump, I would be like, you know
what, thanks,

17:02.588 --> 17:04.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but that's OK, you can keep your
endorsement.

17:04.457 --> 17:07.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I think that's
kind of what
Paul Ryan said, which was,
that's nice.

17:07.994 --> 17:09.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's nice, but I
don't...

17:09.395 --> 17:10.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You don't think it
necessarily
helps?

17:10.863 --> 17:12.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You don't think it necessarily
helps?

17:12.098 --> 17:15.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: No, they're in a
tough spot.

17:15.201 --> 17:19.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of these people who are
down-ballot are
in a tough spot, because they
don't -- they

17:19.272 --> 17:25.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have already on some level
associated themselves
with the person at the top of
the ticket.

17:25.378 --> 17:29.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at the same time, they are
trying to distance
themselves.

17:29.315 --> 17:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Democrats aren't going to
let them get
away with distancing themselves
one bit.

17:32.351 --> 17:36.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And brace for
whatever may happen
this week, as opposed to last
week.

17:36.255 --> 17:37.223 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.025 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tamara Keith of NPR,
Amy Walter
of The Cook Political Report,
thank you both

17:40.393 --> 17:41.994 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very much.

17:42.028 --> 17:48.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

17:48.067 --> 17:54.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

17:54.106 --> 18:01.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For all of the
concerns and
problems leading into Rio, the
first days

18:01.414 --> 18:06.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Olympics generally went
off well, with
memorable moments, and the hope
of a promising

18:06.886 --> 18:09.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
week to come for the USA.

18:09.922 --> 18:16.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After one weekend in Rio,
American swimmers
are living up to golden
expectations so far.

18:16.629 --> 18:22.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Powerhouse swimmer Katie Ledecky
grabbed her
first gold medal of these games
Sunday night,

18:22.635 --> 18:28.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
breaking her own world record in
the 400-meter
freestyle, with competitors
almost five seconds

18:28.774 --> 18:30.543 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in her wake.

18:30.576 --> 18:31.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE LEDECKY, Olympic Gold
Medal Winner:
It's an amazing feeling, to sing
the national

18:31.277 --> 18:32.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
anthem and see the flags raised.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I got to go out there with a
teammate and
we sang our hearts out.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Veteran Michael
Phelps, who's
now 31 years old, collected his
19th gold,

18:35.514 --> 18:39.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as part of the men's 4-by-100
relay team.

18:39.885 --> 18:45.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also Sunday, the U.S. women
gymnastics team
proved their dominance in
qualifying for the

18:45.491 --> 18:49.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all-around category, which
permits only two
per country.

18:49.695 --> 18:53.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Favorite Simone Biles soared to
the number
one spot.

18:53.933 --> 18:59.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Teammate Aly Raisman will join
her in the
finals, edging out 2012 gold
medalist Gabby

18:59.638 --> 19:02.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Douglas for the second U.S.
slot.

19:02.508 --> 19:09.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, fencer Ibtihaj
Muhammad became
the first American Olympian to
compete wearing

19:09.181 --> 19:11.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a Muslim hijab, or head scarf.

19:11.951 --> 19:15.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She won her first round, before
being defeated.

19:15.388 --> 19:20.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, uproars over doping
are still swirling
over Rio.

19:20.326 --> 19:26.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova
faced boos before
a preliminary race on Sunday.

19:26.565 --> 19:30.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She had been banned after
failing drug tests,
and then reinstated.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American Lily King made clear
her displeasure
about Efimova's presence in the
pool.

19:33.005 --> 19:37.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Saturday, Australian
swimmer Mack Horton
accused his Chinese rival Sun
Yang of being

19:38.010 --> 19:42.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a -- quote -- "drug cheat" and
then beat him
in the 400-meter freestyle.

19:42.782 --> 19:46.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chinese officials have demanded
an apology.

19:46.852 --> 19:51.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now for an on-the-ground
perspective from
Rio, I spoke a short time ago to
Christine

19:51.424 --> 19:56.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brennan, a sportswriter and
columnist who's
covering the Games for USA
Today.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's also a contributor for ABC
News.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Christine Brennan, hello.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been quite a weekend for
the United States
in swimming.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tell us what it's been like at
the swimming
venue.

20:07.006 --> 20:10.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, USA Today: I
will tell
you, Judy, it was really an
electric evening

20:10.643 --> 20:15.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and certainly for the United
States last night,
with both Katie Ledecky in the
400 freestyle,

20:15.948 --> 20:20.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world record performance,
breaking her on
world record by almost two
seconds.

20:20.653 --> 20:25.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then within, what, maybe 20,
30 minutes,
you had that relay, of course,
Michael Phelps

20:25.357 --> 20:30.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming back to the pool for the
first time,
31 years old now, his fifth
Olympic Games.

20:30.429 --> 20:32.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what does he do?

20:32.198 --> 20:37.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's in the second leg of that
four-person
relay and he stakes the U.S. out
to a lead,

20:37.069 --> 20:42.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and the U.S. -- his two
teammates just came
in and won, beating the French.

20:42.374 --> 20:46.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The crowd, you would have
thought it was a
U.S. crowd, in the sense that
here we are

20:46.712 --> 20:48.514 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Rio.

20:48.547 --> 20:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it was a really majestic
moment, I think,
but with the knowledge that the
fans had that

20:53.419 --> 20:56.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were watching something
special, watching
Michael Phelps return, the
greatest Olympian

20:56.789 --> 20:59.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of all time, winning his 19th
gold medal.

20:59.291 --> 21:03.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, those two things back to
back -- and Katie
Ledecky even said it after she
won.

21:03.629 --> 21:05.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She goes, "I think there's going
to be another
gold medal."

21:05.431 --> 21:06.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was the first for the U.S.
in the pool.

21:07.032 --> 21:09.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Usually, the U.S. dominates in
the swimming
pool.

21:09.335 --> 21:11.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we will see that
over the next
few days as well.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is it about
Katie Ledecky?

21:15.007 --> 21:17.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What puts her far ahead of the
competition?

21:17.076 --> 21:20.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Well, I think
all of her
opponents would love to know
that.

21:20.312 --> 21:22.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's competing really only
against herself.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The 800 freestyle is hers.

21:24.383 --> 21:27.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She will be even farther ahead
in that.

21:27.319 --> 21:29.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People should get used to seeing
that.

21:29.221 --> 21:34.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's just one of these people
who has a wonderful
attitude about life, super
smart, going to

21:34.927 --> 21:40.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stanford, and gets it, has a
great perspective,
wonderful family that loves
sports, and also,

21:40.733 --> 21:45.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for herself, just a sense that
she just wants
to better herself.

21:45.237 --> 21:49.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It sounds like a cliche, but she
just goes
out there, follows her coach's
orders, kind

21:49.108 --> 21:53.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the model student, the model
athlete, and
just puts it together, and is
absolutely on

21:53.312 --> 21:56.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
top of her game at the most
important moment
of her life.

21:56.715 --> 22:01.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Michael
Phelps, as you
said, he's now 31 years old.

22:01.086 --> 22:04.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He came into these Games with 18
gold medals.

22:04.523 --> 22:06.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He just picked up another one
last night.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is he looking to do in Rio?

22:08.661 --> 22:10.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Well, he's
got a lot more.

22:10.896 --> 22:12.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's just beginning.

22:12.097 --> 22:14.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And people are going to say,
what, more Michael
Phelps?

22:14.133 --> 22:15.901 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

22:15.935 --> 22:19.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's got the 100 butterfly, 200
butterfly,
200 individual medley and
probably one more

22:19.505 --> 22:20.472 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
relay.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we're just beginning to see
Phelps.

22:22.641 --> 22:24.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And this is shocking.

22:24.109 --> 22:26.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you think about this in
sports, swimming
is a young person's came.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As I said, Katie Ledecky is 19
years old.

22:28.614 --> 22:31.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Somebody of these people are --
a lot of teenagers
in the pool.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And here's Michael Phelps, 31.

22:32.918 --> 22:36.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, he has certainly had some
difficulties
in his life.

22:36.255 --> 22:38.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He went to rehab after a second
DUI.

22:38.557 --> 22:41.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He has acknowledged his
problems.

22:41.193 --> 22:45.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact that he could be so
strong at
31 -- in most sports, he would
long since

22:45.965 --> 22:50.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be retired, in terms of his age
-- and yet
he's just still as dominant as
ever.

22:50.502 --> 22:55.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then you have
the doping
allegations around the Russians
and others.

22:55.374 --> 22:59.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's already causing a backlash
among a number
of the athletes.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How is that affecting things
there?

23:01.614 --> 23:04.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: I will tell
you, it's been
really interesting.

23:04.550 --> 23:10.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the metaphor for the
entire conversation,
Judy, about Russian doping, the
diabolical

23:10.256 --> 23:14.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian doping machine and the
fact that they
were allowed to compete in the
Olympics, as

23:14.827 --> 23:19.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opposed to being kicked out, as
I thought
they should be, the metaphor
really is -- the

23:19.298 --> 23:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pool is a metaphor for that.

23:21.100 --> 23:26.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The booing for these athletes,
Yulia Efimova
especially, the breast stroker,
loud boos

23:26.805 --> 23:32.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for her, loud boos for the
Russian men's 4x100
freestyle relay team, you never
hear that,

23:32.444 --> 23:33.412 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ever.

23:33.445 --> 23:34.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what is that?

23:34.446 --> 23:35.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the swimmers.

23:35.681 --> 23:37.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's coming especially coming
from the swimming
section.

23:37.516 --> 23:39.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The swimmers know.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.052 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They know.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're disgusted by this.

23:41.587 --> 23:45.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know people will say, hey,
Lance Armstrong
cheated and Marion Jones.

23:45.057 --> 23:49.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. has probably given the
world the
two worst cheaters ever in Lance
Armstrong

23:49.128 --> 23:50.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Marion Jones.

23:50.996 --> 23:55.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The big difference is that for
Russia it was
government-sponsored,
state-sponsored doping.

23:55.267 --> 24:00.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The equivalent would be if a
member of President
Obama's Cabinet ran a five-year
doping plan

24:00.673 --> 24:06.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the United States involving
the FBI, the
CIA, U.S. Olympic Committee, and
U.S. Anti-Doping

24:06.578 --> 24:07.546 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Agency.

24:07.579 --> 24:09.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's how diabolical the
Russian plan was.

24:09.448 --> 24:14.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One other sport
Gymnastics,
this was the first Olympics
appearance for

24:14.787 --> 24:20.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Simone Biles of the United
States, who she
absolutely lived up to her
billing in that

24:20.292 --> 24:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
qualifying event yesterday.

24:21.627 --> 24:24.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Oh, she sure
did.

24:24.563 --> 24:31.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Think Mary Lou Retton and Gabby
Douglas and
Olga Korbut and Nadia Comaneci
into one.

24:31.837 --> 24:35.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In many ways, we are seeing the
culmination
of an entire sport in one
person.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Simone Biles is that good.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the U.S. team is that good.

24:39.845 --> 24:44.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a sport the you can have
a point,
a tenth of a point deciding
first, second,

24:44.683 --> 24:46.085 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
third.

24:46.118 --> 24:50.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. was 10 points ahead as
a team in
the qualifying yesterday.

24:50.055 --> 24:54.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the team, the U.S. team,
will certainly
win the gold medal, barring some
incredible

24:54.760 --> 24:57.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unforeseen occurrence tomorrow.

24:57.663 --> 24:58.630 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So there's that.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the team competition.

25:00.232 --> 25:03.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then Simone Biles in the
individual all-around,
she is expected to win the gold.

25:03.202 --> 25:07.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then she is expected to go
on to the individual
apparatuses and actually keep
winning gold.

25:07.906 --> 25:12.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Simone Biles, I believe by
the time these
Olympic Games are over, will be
seen as the

25:12.344 --> 25:14.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
greatest U.S. gymnast ever.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'll tell you, that's saying
something,
because there is certainly a lot
of competition

25:16.882 --> 25:18.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for that title.

25:18.784 --> 25:23.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally,
Christine, after all
the hype and the negative
stories about Brazil,

25:23.122 --> 25:28.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about Rio running up to these
Olympics, how
do these first few days feel to
you?

25:28.260 --> 25:32.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Judy, I have
to say that
these Games have been a pleasant
surprise.

25:32.631 --> 25:36.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are issues with
transportation and buses
not coming and things like that,
but it really

25:36.802 --> 25:38.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
feels like an Olympics to me.

25:38.337 --> 25:40.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when I say that, I mean
everything about
it.

25:41.006 --> 25:45.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The opening ceremony, I thought,
was actually
terrific on a budget.

25:45.043 --> 25:50.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They did more with less, far
less budget than,
say -- far fewer dollars to
spend than Beijing

25:50.482 --> 25:54.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in '08 with their grandiose
ceremony or London
in 2012.

25:54.420 --> 25:57.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I thought they did a great
job with a
message, with a conscience.

25:57.189 --> 25:58.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that has carried
over the last
few days.

25:58.957 --> 26:00.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have seen good will in many
places.

26:00.926 --> 26:03.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, I mentioned the
booing, but good
will in many places.

26:03.962 --> 26:05.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have seen great upsets.

26:05.497 --> 26:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have seen athletes care so
much about
this.

26:08.033 --> 26:09.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the Games are moving on.

26:09.768 --> 26:10.769 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Knock on wood.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will see how it goes over the
next two
weeks.

26:12.638 --> 26:14.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they really seem to be going
on just fine.

26:14.873 --> 26:18.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you consider the National
Football League
had to cancel its Hall of Fame
game because

26:18.710 --> 26:23.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a problem on the field, they
couldn't put
on one football game, and here
Rio is seemingly

26:23.649 --> 26:26.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them moving ahead with all of
these venues,
and so far, so good.

26:26.985 --> 26:31.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's in many ways a
big sports upset,
but it's also a nice thing to
see as the Games

26:31.490 --> 26:32.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have started.

26:32.658 --> 26:34.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Christine
Brennan, thank you
very much.

26:34.693 --> 26:36.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we look forward to talking
to you in the
days to come.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: You bet,
Judy.

26:38.297 --> 26:42.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

26:42.534 --> 26:51.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

26:51.310 --> 26:56.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
efforts to make
peace between high schoolers and
police; and

26:56.548 --> 27:00.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the harmonies of Neko Case, K.D.
Lang and
Laura Veirs.

27:00.586 --> 27:08.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: President Obama has
pledged to
accept 10,000 Syrian refugees by
October,

27:08.093 --> 27:10.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
despite resistance playing out
in many communities.

27:10.762 --> 27:16.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Refugees, many of them rootless
for years,
often arrive with significant
medical problems

27:16.101 --> 27:18.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and psychological trauma.

27:18.303 --> 27:23.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Sarah
Varney brings
us this report about how one
city, Buffalo,

27:23.342 --> 27:25.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
New York, is adapting.

27:25.344 --> 27:30.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her story was produced in
collaboration with
our partner Kaiser Health News.

27:30.115 --> 27:36.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Since Murhaf,
Ghenwa, and their
children moved here from Syria,
even mundane

27:36.922 --> 27:40.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tasks like cooking and homework
have become
more complicated.

27:40.425 --> 27:44.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: They have 10 airplanes.

27:44.096 --> 27:50.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Unaccustomed tote
this new life,
the family relies on help from
Hassan Alishaqi

27:50.569 --> 27:58.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from a local resettlement agency
called Journey's
End.

27:58.610 --> 28:03.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Refugee agencies help families
like this one
find housing and jobs, get
medical care and

28:03.849 --> 28:07.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health insurance and enroll in
English classes
and schools.

28:07.786 --> 28:15.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They fled Syria after civil war
erupted there
in 2011, unleashing an exodus of
more than

28:15.894 --> 28:18.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
four million refugees.

28:18.163 --> 28:23.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The destruction and violence
came close to
Murhaf's family during one their
last nights

28:23.068 --> 28:24.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the city of Homs.

28:24.703 --> 28:29.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Some
bullets came
to my house through the window.

28:29.708 --> 28:33.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I was afraid for the safety
of my kids.

28:34.012 --> 28:38.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They never sleep because of --
it's just very
hard for them to sleep.

28:38.884 --> 28:44.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: After a year in
Cairo and exhaustive
security checks, the family
arrived in Buffalo,

28:44.089 --> 28:46.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a quiet city on the edge of Lake
Erie.

28:46.758 --> 28:51.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And like many new arrivals here,
they're struggling
with the aftermath of their
horrific journey

28:51.063 --> 28:54.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as they attempt to build
healthier lives in
their new home.

28:54.666 --> 28:59.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 90 percent of the
refugees who resettle
to New York live in Upstate New
York.

28:59.171 --> 29:02.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The city of Buffalo has become a
welcoming
haven for many of them.

29:02.674 --> 29:07.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But over the last 15 years, the
countries
and conflicts they come from
have changed.

29:07.245 --> 29:10.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the health care needs of
refugees are
changing, too.

29:10.349 --> 29:14.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jericho Road is a community
health center
in Buffalo that has long treated
refugees

29:14.353 --> 29:20.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from some of the world's poorest
countries,
including Myanmar, Bhutan, Sudan
and Somalia.

29:20.659 --> 29:24.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The clinic is a crossroads of
languages and
customs.

29:24.262 --> 29:28.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New refugees receive free
medical assistance
from the federal government for
eight months.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then they can buy private
insurance or enroll
in Medicaid.

29:31.236 --> 29:32.938 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

29:32.971 --> 29:35.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MYRON GLICK, Jericho Road: When
you came,
we found that your T.B. test was
positive.

29:35.807 --> 29:39.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think you are now taking
medicine for
that, right?

29:39.878 --> 29:47.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The clinic's
founder, Dr. Myron
Glick, often treats refugees for
tuberculosis,

29:47.653 --> 29:51.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
malaria and childhood
malnutrition.

29:51.723 --> 29:56.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he says the more recent
arrivals from
Iraq and Syria, which are
middle-income countries,

29:56.862 --> 30:05.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
typically don't suffer from
diseases of poverty,
but instead have been
traumatized by war.

30:05.570 --> 30:10.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A critical report by local
leaders that examined
the area's safety net found that
health care

30:10.208 --> 30:15.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
providers urgently need to
improve culturally
appropriate mental health
services.

30:15.647 --> 30:20.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And more clinics needed to
follow Jericho
Road's model, hiring refugees
who can help

30:20.085 --> 30:21.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
new arrivals adjust.

30:22.020 --> 30:29.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kowsar Ali, a Somali and Arabic
interpreter,
says just figuring out how to
explain a patient's

30:29.194 --> 30:34.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
symptoms and a doctor's
diagnosis is a puzzle,
words and phrases with no
English equivalent,

30:34.966 --> 30:37.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
medical terms like PTSD and
depression that
are unfamiliar.

30:37.803 --> 30:41.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KOWSAR ALI, Jericho Road: It's
actually hard
for them because there's nothing
as depression.

30:41.873 --> 30:45.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say, OK, because that never
existed in
my country.

30:45.043 --> 30:46.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's nothing as depression.

30:46.878 --> 30:50.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Dr. Glick says the
initial relief
refugees feel when they reach
safety often

30:50.916 --> 30:52.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gives way to a new reality.

30:52.484 --> 30:54.352 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

30:54.386 --> 30:58.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MYRON GLICK: All the horrible
things that
happen to people along their
journey to America,

30:58.924 --> 31:01.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and yet really they come with
hope.

31:01.460 --> 31:05.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a year, two years in, you
see that hope
dissipate.

31:05.497 --> 31:12.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really challenging here in
America to
deal with the stresses that are
thrust upon

31:12.637 --> 31:15.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them without the support of
their home community.

31:15.941 --> 31:19.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: That sense of
isolation is easing
for some.

31:19.578 --> 31:25.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ali Kadhum arrived in Buffalo in
2008, just
as the fledgling Iraqi community
was taking

31:25.350 --> 31:26.485 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
root.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back then, Kadhum says there
were just 25
families.

31:28.186 --> 31:32.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALI KADHUM, Lake Shore
Behavioral Health:
Now it's almost 750 Iraqi
families.

31:32.557 --> 31:37.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Today, he says
Iraqis bump into
each other around town.

31:37.462 --> 31:39.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALI KADHUM: They feel they are
not alone.

31:39.498 --> 31:45.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They feel they are still living
in Iraq, because
people, there's restaurants,
cook their food

31:45.437 --> 31:47.038 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is some people speak their
language,
at least, and they can
communicate.

31:49.941 --> 31:54.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: So many refugees
have moved
here that the population of Erie
County, home

31:54.479 --> 31:58.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Buffalo, is growing for the
first time
since the 1960s.

31:58.517 --> 32:03.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are reshaping a city
that has struggled
to find its way in the modern
economy.

32:03.989 --> 32:07.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Old factories now house
English-language classes.

32:07.325 --> 32:13.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a small business incubator,
women sell
Iraqi macrame and Rwandan
scarves, and vendors

32:13.331 --> 32:18.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
claim to sell the best dim sum
in Buffalo.

32:18.336 --> 32:22.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Refugee children pursue music in
a program
called Buffalo String Works, and
are mentored

32:22.874 --> 32:25.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by professional musicians.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Health systems here are
adapting, too.

32:27.879 --> 32:32.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Catholic Church once, filled
with Italian
and Irish congregates, recently
reopened as

32:32.751 --> 32:37.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a health clinic for new
immigrants.

32:37.222 --> 32:42.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with so many arrivals from
active war
zones, the University at Buffalo
tapped Dr.

32:42.294 --> 32:46.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kim Griswold to help lead the
Western New
York Center for Survivors of
Torture.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.899 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:47.933 --> 32:49.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIM GRISWOLD, Western New York
Center for
Survivors of Torture: Some of
the folks that

32:49.835 --> 32:55.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have seen have been horribly
tortured physically,
with scars to prove it,
amputations, other

32:55.040 --> 32:59.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things that we have seen that
are horrific,
cigarette burns, whipping.

32:59.644 --> 33:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Kareem Khaleefah,
who worked
for the U.S. Army in Baghdad,
was kidnapped

33:04.182 --> 33:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by a Shia militia, lined up with
20 other
men and shot.

33:07.619 --> 33:15.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREEM KHALEEFAH, Worked for
U.S. Army (through
translator): I was like super
lucky that the

33:15.260 --> 33:17.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bullets come on the side of my
body.

33:17.596 --> 33:22.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: He fell to the
ground and pretended
to be dead until nightfall.

33:22.100 --> 33:26.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Even in Buffalo's quiet
neighborhoods, those
memories never fade, says
Kadhum, a mental

33:26.671 --> 33:29.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health counselor at Lake Shore
Behavioral
Health.

33:29.574 --> 33:35.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says many older Iraqis, like
Saja Alnaqeeb
and her husband, Mahmoud, once
lived prosperous,

33:35.213 --> 33:36.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vibrant lives.

33:36.381 --> 33:41.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, in 2005, Saja was tortured
and the family
fled.

33:41.052 --> 33:43.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now she stays inside, tormented
by her memories.

33:43.922 --> 33:54.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): My
family, sometimes,
they wake up, they find me
screaming at night

33:54.566 --> 33:56.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with these nightmares.

33:56.334 --> 33:59.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The images she
sees on the news
are a constant reminder of the
continuing

33:59.804 --> 34:01.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
violence in Iraq.

34:01.506 --> 34:05.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She worries about her children
and grandchildren
still in Baghdad.

34:05.277 --> 34:11.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): My
mind is about
them.

34:11.483 --> 34:16.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every time they mention to me
they are unsafe,
they are getting threatened,
they move their

34:16.621 --> 34:23.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place from place to place just
to make sure
that they are -- protect their
kids and family.

34:23.395 --> 34:29.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The recent spate
of violent
attacks worldwide have fueled
anti-immigrant

34:29.267 --> 34:31.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and anti-refugee sentiment.

34:31.436 --> 34:36.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But experts on human migration
say these events
are rare, and, in fact, it's
refugees who

34:36.942 --> 34:39.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
often face discrimination and
violence.

34:39.678 --> 34:41.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Neil Boothby is a professor at
Columbia University.

34:42.013 --> 34:44.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NEIL BOOTHBY, Columbia
University: There's
going to be language issues.

34:44.282 --> 34:45.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's going to be cultural
issues.

34:45.951 --> 34:49.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What happens if a girl wants to
wear a scarf
over her head?

34:49.521 --> 34:51.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How is the community going to
respond to that?

34:51.222 --> 34:54.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What if people need to spend a
lot of time
in the mosques?

34:54.125 --> 34:55.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How are we going to respond to
that?

34:55.694 --> 34:57.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So it's going to be an
adjustment, I think,
for each side.

34:58.029 --> 35:03.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: In Buffalo, the
focus now is
to enroll more people in mental
health counseling.

35:03.935 --> 35:09.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At a Lake Shore clinic,
patients, like Kurd
Bllnd struggle to reconcile
religion, sectarian

35:09.240 --> 35:11.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and ethnic violence that has
persisted for
decades.

35:12.010 --> 35:14.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KURD BLLND, Patient (through
translator):
What happened to the Kurdish in
Iraq, of course

35:14.813 --> 35:17.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're going to be upset and
angry and anxious.

35:17.515 --> 35:22.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Bllnd, who grew up
in a Kurdish
village in Iraq, was jailed and
interrogated

35:22.220 --> 35:23.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for three years in the 1980s.

35:23.888 --> 35:28.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KURD BLLND (through translator):
Since the
age of 12 years until now -- I'm
67 years

35:28.360 --> 35:31.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of age -- I didn't see anything
good in life.

35:31.262 --> 35:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Two years after he
arrived in
Buffalo, Bllnd reluctantly
agreed to seek

35:35.333 --> 35:36.668 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
help.

35:36.701 --> 35:42.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KURD BLLND: They told me, if you
go there,
somebody talk to you.

35:42.440 --> 35:46.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe you forget past, what
happened to you.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSICA MARMION, Lake Shore
Behavioral Health:
The key stressor, I think, is
isolation.

35:49.247 --> 35:54.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they come here, they don't
speak the language,
they really only know their
immediate family.

35:54.252 --> 35:58.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Jessica Marmion is
a clinical
social worker who teams up with

Afaf Pickering.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AFAF PICKERING, Lake Shore
Behavioral Health:
We have like all kinds of people
coming.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.028 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We have lawyers.

36:03.061 --> 36:04.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have businesspeople.

36:04.863 --> 36:09.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have -- you need sometimes to
talk about
your problems, especially coming
from a country

36:09.834 --> 36:11.403 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of war.

36:11.436 --> 36:12.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You went through trauma.

36:12.437 --> 36:13.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You went through death.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You went through some violence.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we're not superhuman.

36:17.409 --> 36:21.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: As new refugees
arrive each
day in Buffalo, known as the
City of Good

36:21.980 --> 36:26.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neighbors, health care leaders
say they will
continue to listen, to reach
out, and help

36:26.217 --> 36:30.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
refugee families find new
opportunities in
a changing American city.

36:30.422 --> 36:39.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" and

I'm Sarah Varney in Buffalo.

36:39.597 --> 36:53.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last September, a
federal court
in Alabama ruled that the
Birmingham Police

36:53.244 --> 36:59.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department's disciplinary
practices, including
the use of pepper spray for
minor discipline

36:59.150 --> 37:03.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
problems, is in violation of
student rights
and unconstitutional.

37:03.721 --> 37:09.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Attorney Ebony Howard of the
Southern Poverty
Law Center filed the
class-action suit, and

37:09.294 --> 37:13.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
returns to court next month when
the police
department's appeal is heard.

37:13.198 --> 37:19.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As part of our year-long Race
Matters conversations
focusing on solutions, special
correspondent

37:19.237 --> 37:25.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Charlayne Hunter-Gault reports
from Birmingham
about reducing tensions between
African-American

37:25.043 --> 37:28.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high school students and the
police.

37:28.046 --> 37:34.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: This
video of a white
South Carolina policeman roughly
ejecting

37:34.285 --> 37:39.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a black student from her
classroom went viral
and ignited a conversation about
the proper

37:39.757 --> 37:42.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
role for police in schools.

37:42.393 --> 37:47.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ebony Howard, a lawyer with the
Southern Poverty
Law Center, has been involved in
that conversation

37:47.765 --> 37:54.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a result of her successful
suit against
police macing students in
Montgomery, Alabama.

37:54.139 --> 37:55.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ebony Howard, thank you for
joining us.

37:55.540 --> 37:57.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EBONY HOWARD, Southern Poverty
Law Center:
Thank you for having me.

37:57.342 --> 38:01.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Can you
tell us briefly
about the case you won in
Birmingham last

38:01.379 --> 38:02.413 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year?

38:02.447 --> 38:04.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EBONY HOWARD: Sure.

38:04.182 --> 38:08.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The case was about police
officers who are
stationed in Birmingham City
high schools

38:08.253 --> 38:13.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who are there to protect
students, and they
were using mace, or pepper spray
is what it's

38:13.825 --> 38:18.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sometimes called, against
students for engaging
in what amounts to normal
adolescent behavior.

38:18.730 --> 38:20.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Like
what?

38:20.498 --> 38:26.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EBONY HOWARD: Like, for example,
one of our
plaintiffs, plaintiff K.B., she
was leaving

38:26.137 --> 38:31.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
class and going to another class
with a fellow
classmate.

38:31.643 --> 38:36.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as she walked, a boy came up
to her and
started to call her really foul
names that

38:36.881 --> 38:38.750 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I won't repeat.

38:38.783 --> 38:44.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as he called her those
names, his friends
who had come with him, they
started to laugh.

38:44.656 --> 38:48.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the more they laughed, the
more names
he called her.

38:48.059 --> 38:49.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so she tried to walk away
from him.

38:49.928 --> 38:54.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as she walked away, he
followed her and
his friends followed her, and he
continued

38:54.332 --> 38:56.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to call her lots and lots of
names.

38:56.601 --> 39:01.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so eventually, as she walked
the entire
length of the school building,
she started

39:01.539 --> 39:02.674 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to cry.

39:02.707 --> 39:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she became hysterical.

39:04.976 --> 39:10.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when she reached the end of
the school
building, a police officer
walked up.

39:10.582 --> 39:14.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you would think that he
would have taken
care of her, but what he did
was, he told

39:14.586 --> 39:17.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her to calm down or he was going
to arrest
her.

39:17.522 --> 39:21.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when she didn't stop crying,
he put her
in handcuffs.

39:21.092 --> 39:25.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she continued to cry after
he handcuffed
her, and he told her, calm down.

39:25.863 --> 39:29.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when she didn't calm down
fast enough,
he sprayed her with mace.

39:29.867 --> 39:33.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other point that I forgot to
mention,
though, was that she was four
months' pregnant

39:33.705 --> 39:36.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the time when he sprayed her
with mace.

39:36.674 --> 39:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was arrested and taken to
the local juvenile
facility, where she had to take
off her pants

39:42.247 --> 39:46.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and her underwear and squat and
cough as a
part of a strip search.

39:46.985 --> 39:50.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so those are the kinds of
things that
were happening in Birmingham
City schools.

39:50.655 --> 39:55.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Now, you
argued the
things that are happening to
black students,

39:55.927 --> 40:01.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with examples like the ones you
just gave,
are very different from what
happens in white

40:01.733 --> 40:02.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
schools.

40:02.734 --> 40:03.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tell me just how different.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EBONY HOWARD: Right.

40:05.503 --> 40:09.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for example, the Birmingham
City School
System is 99 percent
African-American; 85

40:09.240 --> 40:13.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
percent of the students are on
free and reduced
lunch.

40:13.544 --> 40:19.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In contrast, a neighboring
school district,
the Jefferson County School
District, is much

40:19.250 --> 40:22.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more integrated, has far more
white students.

40:22.687 --> 40:29.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past 10 years, police
officers who
are in the Jefferson County
School District

40:29.661 --> 40:32.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have used mace 10 times.

40:32.163 --> 40:33.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's over 10 years.

40:33.931 --> 40:40.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In contrast, during a five-year
period in
Birmingham City, almost 300
students were

40:40.271 --> 40:42.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sprayed with mace.

40:42.106 --> 40:46.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
what do you
say to the critics who say that
a lot of these

40:46.044 --> 40:51.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kids are violent, that some are
gang members,
and that they get into
horrendous fights and

40:51.616 --> 40:55.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things like that in these
schools and need
to be controlled by the police?

40:55.520 --> 41:01.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EBONY HOWARD: There is no
question that many
of the students that are in
school districts

41:01.793 --> 41:06.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like the Birmingham City School
District have
very big challenges to overcome
with regard

41:06.597 --> 41:11.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to socioeconomic status and
poverty.

41:11.235 --> 41:15.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would also say that a lot
of this talk,
a lot of this rhetoric is just
propaganda.

41:15.773 --> 41:20.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You're
saying that
most of what these young people
who have been

41:20.311 --> 41:26.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maced have been doing, in other
schools, are
regarded as normal adolescent
behavior that

41:26.584 --> 41:28.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gets punished, but not in the
same way.

41:28.553 --> 41:34.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EBONY HOWARD: That is precisely
right, that
when a black boy engages in a
certain type

41:34.926 --> 41:39.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of misbehavior, there is a
perception that
that is criminal.

41:39.564 --> 41:45.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In contrast, when a white boy in
a different
school district does the same
thing, that

41:45.570 --> 41:47.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is perceived as adolescent
misconduct.

41:47.939 --> 41:54.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's an inequity that black
children and
Latino children have to live
with in this

41:54.579 --> 41:56.381 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

41:56.414 --> 41:59.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
the police,
of course, defended the actions
of the police,

41:59.183 --> 42:02.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying that these children
deserved what they
got.

42:02.186 --> 42:07.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet the judge, in his
ruling, affirmed
your protest.

42:07.058 --> 42:08.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EBONY HOWARD: Right.

42:08.893 --> 42:14.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, what I thought was the
most striking
about the findings of fact and
conclusions

42:14.465 --> 42:22.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of law that the judge issue was
that he recognized
that these are children, that
these are adolescents,

42:22.707 --> 42:28.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that the police officers, at
least the
ones who were the defendants in
this case,

42:28.379 --> 42:34.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't quite understand that,
whether intentionally
or unintentionally.

42:34.085 --> 42:41.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The judge said that, regardless,
it is clear
that Chief A.C. Roper, the chief
of police

42:41.626 --> 42:47.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the Birmingham Police
Department, at a
minimum needs to provide
officers who are

42:47.198 --> 42:51.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stationed in the Birmingham City
schools with
training on school-based
policing.

42:51.936 --> 42:58.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You
worked with the
chiefs are other police leaders
to work on

42:58.876 --> 43:00.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this problem, and what's going
on?

43:00.645 --> 43:09.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EBONY HOWARD: The judge ordered
that we get
with the defendants to meet and
confer on

43:09.287 --> 43:16.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
developing a plan that would
guide law enforcement
training for school-based
policing, as well

43:16.461 --> 43:21.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as policies and procedures on
school-based
policing for Birmingham City
schools.

43:21.299 --> 43:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, how
is that going?

43:22.300 --> 43:25.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EBONY HOWARD: So, we have met.

43:25.336 --> 43:32.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we agree on some things, but
were unable
to reach a consensus on other
things.

43:32.877 --> 43:40.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the chief of police has told
us that he
intends to appeal and has gone
through the

43:40.451 --> 43:42.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
process of appealing.

43:42.787 --> 43:49.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we believe that the point of
public education
in America is not just to teach
kids academics,

43:49.994 --> 43:54.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but to teach them how to be
citizens, how
to be adults.

43:54.298 --> 43:59.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that involves learning how
to manage conflict,
learning how to work with each
other, learning

43:59.370 --> 44:03.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how to respect people and that,
during that
process, they will make
mistakes.

44:03.107 --> 44:08.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They may fight, they may talk
back, they may
do things that we don't want
them to do.

44:08.579 --> 44:14.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the role of teachers and
principals and
police officers are to teach
them how to interact

44:14.085 --> 44:15.052 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with each other.

44:15.086 --> 44:16.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, what
is the solution?

44:16.787 --> 44:20.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EBONY HOWARD: The first thing is
that, if
we're going to have officers in
our schools,

44:20.424 --> 44:22.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
then they need to be trained.

44:22.260 --> 44:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They need not be biased with
regard to race
or socioeconomic status for the
students that

44:28.666 --> 44:30.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they are working with.

44:30.501 --> 44:35.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the more fundamental
thing and the
harder thing is that, when each
of us looks

44:35.072 --> 44:37.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at these kids, we need to see
our own.

44:37.808 --> 44:43.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We see someone who could be our
daughter,
our son, niece, our nephew, our
cousin, our

44:43.681 --> 44:46.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
own babies, rather than seeing
an other.

44:47.018 --> 44:48.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's not happening.

44:48.953 --> 44:50.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
Ebony Howard,
thank you.

44:50.187 --> 44:58.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EBONY HOWARD: Thank you so much.

44:58.262 --> 45:09.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight: how

45:41.405 --> 45:50.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The collaboration was the
brainchild of Lang,
who wanted to form what she

KOWSAR ALI, Jericho Road: It's
actually hard
for them, because there's
nothing as depression.

46:09.400 --> 46:10.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say, OK, because that never
existed in
my country. There's nothing as
depression.

(BREAK)

46:12.803 --> 46:14.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Delta Air Lines
canceled more
than 400 flights today, after a
global crash

46:14.605 --> 46:16.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of its computer systems. Hours
later, the
carrier resumed limited service.
But the glitch

46:16.340 --> 46:17.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also delayed more than 1,000
flights, and
left passengers stranded. Some
complained

46:17.174 --> 46:18.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they'd been given little
information.

46:18.943 --> 46:20.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: When I got here, I waited.
I got here
like 8:37 flight, and then it
kept going,

46:20.778 --> 46:22.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, delayed, delaying it.
And then they
never announced that it was
canceled. So I

46:22.580 --> 46:24.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had to call the service and they
told me it
was canceled. So they gave me
another flight,

46:24.315 --> 46:24.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but now I got a flight tomorrow.
So, it was
the fact that they didn't let me
know what

46:24.749 --> 46:26.517 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was going on.

46:26.550 --> 46:28.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The trouble was
caused by a
power outage in Atlanta. The
utility Georgia

46:28.386 --> 46:29.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Power said a kind of industrial
circuit-breaker
called a switch gear failed.
Just last month,

46:29.987 --> 46:31.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Southwest Airlines was hit by an
equipment
failure that canceled 2000
flights.

46:31.922 --> 46:33.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Southwestern
Pakistan, a suicide
bombing killed at least 67
people today, and

46:33.357 --> 46:34.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wounded scores more. It happened
in a hospital
in the city of Quetta.

JONATHAN RUGMAN: Ambulances
usually arrive
at hospitals in a hurry. In
Quetta this morning,

46:38.295 --> 46:39.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were leaving, ferrying the
injured away
from an attack on a hospital
itself. As smoke

46:39.764 --> 46:41.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
filled the corridors, it quickly
became clear
the timing was deliberate.

46:41.565 --> 46:43.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, men on a motorbike had
shot dead Bilal
Kasi, a senior lawyer on his way
to court.

46:43.401 --> 46:44.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then the group waited for his
fellow lawyers
to gather here before blowing
them up, the

46:44.502 --> 46:46.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so-called double tap, as cynical
as it was
cruel.

46:46.437 --> 46:48.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MERAJ TAREEN, Attorney: After
our bar association
president was targeted, we all
came to the

46:48.372 --> 46:50.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hospital. We were leaving the
hospital after
Kasich's autopsy and the media
were interviewing

46:50.141 --> 46:50.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lawyers when the blast took
place. For many
minutes, there was darkness all
around us,

46:50.808 --> 46:52.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and then we heard gunshots.

46:52.610 --> 46:54.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: Lawyers
complained to visiting
army chiefs that, while they
haven't been

46:54.445 --> 46:56.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allowed to drive their cars into
the hospital,
a suicide bomber had managed to
get through,

46:56.247 --> 46:58.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while the hospital's director
told the press
that just one guard armed with a
baton was

46:58.082 --> 46:59.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in charge of security, which
might seem all
the more scandalous, given that
these pictures

46:59.884 --> 47:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from January show the same
hospital, this
time receiving survivors from
another deadly

47:01.085 --> 47:02.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suicide bombing on another
medical facility
in the town.

47:02.887 --> 47:04.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, once again, Pakistanis are
crying out
for security, putting pressure
on their Prime

47:04.588 --> 47:06.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Minister, Nawaz Sharif, and his
army chief,
who visited the hospital this
evening.

47:06.457 --> 47:07.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"For God sake, don't back off,"
this survivor
told the prime minister. "It's a
handful of

47:07.758 --> 47:09.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people we must fight with all
our might. Don't
lose courage."

GWEN IFILL: Both the Islamic
State group and
a breakaway Taliban faction
claimed responsibility

47:10.127 --> 47:11.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the attack.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Japan's Emperor
Akihito signaled
today he'd like to step down.
His position

47:13.764 --> 47:15.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is symbolic, and he has no
political power,
but his abdication would require
a constitutional

47:15.533 --> 47:17.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change. He spoke in a rare
10-minute address
pre-recorded and broadcast
nationally.

47:17.468 --> 47:19.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMPEROR AKIHITO, Japan (through

I am already more than 80 years
old, and fortunately

47:19.303 --> 47:21.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I am now in good health.
However, when I consider
that my fitness level is
gradually declining,

47:21.105 --> 47:22.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am worried that it may become
difficult
for me to carry out my duties
with my whole

47:22.339 --> 47:24.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being as the symbol of the
state, as I have
done until now.

47:24.208 --> 47:26.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Over the years,
Akihito has
had heart surgery and been
treated for prostate

47:26.043 --> 47:27.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cancer. He is the 125th emperor
in a dynastic
line that goes back more than
2,700 years.

47:29.814 --> 47:31.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off deadly mudslides over the

40 people. Surging rainwater
uprooted buildings

47:31.649 --> 47:32.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Soldiers and first-responders

up in online sales, buying
online retailer

47:35.953 --> 47:37.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

million in stock.

47:37.722 --> 47:38.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Wal-Mart is looking to
strengthen its Web

two.

47:43.861 --> 47:45.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Russia fired
back today,
after its entire Paralympic team
was banned

47:45.696 --> 47:47.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from next month's games for
athletes with
physical disabilities. The
Russian Organizing

47:47.364 --> 47:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee said the ban for
alleged doping
amounts to a human rights abuse.
The same

47:49.133 --> 47:50.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doping scandal barred more than
100 Russian
athletes from the current
Olympics in Rio

47:50.201 --> 47:52.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
de Janeiro. The Paralympics will
also be in
Rio.

47:52.069 --> 47:53.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Donald Trump's
plan that he says will
revitalize the economy;

47:53.904 --> 47:54.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Olympians shattering
records and taking
home gold; a city caring for
refugees' unseen

47:54.472 --> 47:56.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
needs; and much more.

GWEN IFILL: The two major
candidates for president
jostled for position in the last
week, stepping

47:58.275 --> 48:00.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into and out of political
corners, and attempting
to paint the other as unfit and
unstable.

48:00.077 --> 48:01.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Donald Trump stuck to
policy, while
Hillary Clinton stuck it to
Donald Trump.

48:01.879 --> 48:02.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
These reforms will offer biggest
tax revolution

48:02.546 --> 48:04.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since the Reagan tax reform.

48:04.482 --> 48:05.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump chose the
traditional campaign
setting of the Detroit Economic
Club to deliver

48:05.816 --> 48:07.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the sober outline of his
economic ideas, starting
with taxes.

48:07.752 --> 48:09.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I am proposing an
across-the-board
income tax reduction, especially
for middle-income

48:09.520 --> 48:11.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans. This will lead to
millions of new
and really good-paying jobs. The
rich will

48:11.255 --> 48:12.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pay their fair share, but no one
will pay
so much that it destroys jobs,
or undermines

48:12.056 --> 48:13.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our ability as a nation to
compete.

48:13.924 --> 48:14.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But throughout his
scripted remarks,
Trump was regularly interrupted
at least a

48:14.492 --> 48:15.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dozen times by hecklers.

48:15.059 --> 48:16.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

48:16.527 --> 48:18.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will say, the Bernie Sanders
people had
far more energy and spirit.

48:18.395 --> 48:20.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump's tax plan
envisions three
income tax brackets of 33
percent, 25 percent

48:20.164 --> 48:20.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and 12 percent. His original
plan, last fall,
topped out at 25 percent for the
wealthiest

48:20.464 --> 48:22.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
earners.

48:22.366 --> 48:24.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump also argued for cutting
the top corporate
tax rate to 15 percent, less
than half what

48:24.235 --> 48:26.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is now. The Republican
nominee also called
for a freeze on new government
regulation.

48:26.103 --> 48:27.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: It is time to
remove the anchor
dragging us down. And that's
what it's doing.

48:27.872 --> 48:28.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's dragging us down. Upon
taking office,
I will issue a temporary
moratorium on new

48:28.405 --> 48:30.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
agency regulations.

48:30.174 --> 48:31.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump said the
specifics of his
plan will be spelled out on his
Web site at

48:31.942 --> 48:33.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some point. But he used today's
remarks to
attack Hillary Clinton's
approach to economic

48:33.644 --> 48:35.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy, saying, it punishes you
for working
and doing business in the United
States.

HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
It's clear -- and a lot of the
journalists

48:37.014 --> 48:38.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have written this -- that Trump
is scrambling
to do damage control.

GWEN IFILL: Clinton, who
campaigned in Florida
today, including a brewery tour
in St. Petersburg,

48:39.917 --> 48:41.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was quick to dismiss Trump's
economic plan.

48:41.652 --> 48:41.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: He wants
to basically
just repackage trickle-down
economics.

(BOOING)

48:43.721 --> 48:44.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Now, you
know, that
old saying, fool me once, shame
on you, fool

48:44.288 --> 48:46.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
me twice, shame on me?

48:46.157 --> 48:47.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The candidates
sparred as Trump
tumbled in the polls after a
series of political

48:47.892 --> 48:48.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
missteps last week. On Friday,
he finally
endorsed House Speaker Paul Ryan
and others

48:48.726 --> 48:50.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he had initially declined to
support.

48:50.694 --> 48:52.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, a new face, little
known GOP operative
Evan McMullin, said he is hoping
to capitalize

48:52.196 --> 48:53.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on Republican unease by
launching his own
independent bid for president.

48:53.130 --> 48:54.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are the polls real? Will the
reset take?

For more on the state of this
topsy turvy
political year, we turn to

Welcome back, ladies.

48:58.736 --> 48:59.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tamara, tell me about this Trump
speech today.
Was this the reset, the pivot we
keep talking

48:59.036 --> 49:00.437 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about?

49:00.471 --> 49:01.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public

the last one the pivot?

49:01.172 --> 49:02.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Or was the last one?

49:02.406 --> 49:04.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Or was the last
one before that
the pivot?

49:04.208 --> 49:06.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton just said this.
There is only
one Trump. There are different
flavors of

49:06.076 --> 49:07.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump. There's
teleprompter speech,
policy speech Donald Trump,
which is what

49:07.878 --> 49:09.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we got today. There is rally
Donald Trump,
where he says stuff and gets the
crowd going,

49:09.246 --> 49:10.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then there is Twitter Donald
Trump at
various hours of the day.

49:11.015 --> 49:12.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is part -- about once every
month, we
get one of these teleprompter
speeches. In

49:12.817 --> 49:14.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some way, this was a reset. His
tax plan that
you mentioned in the piece, it
was on his

49:14.585 --> 49:16.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Web site until about 24 hours
ago. Then it
came down. Now there's a new tax
plan which

49:16.487 --> 49:16.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aligns with a tax plan from
House Republicans,
moves him more into the orbit of
the Republican

49:16.887 --> 49:18.656 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mainstream.

49:18.689 --> 49:19.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there were several things in
this speech
that moved him a little bit
closer to the

49:19.256 --> 49:19.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republican mainstream.

49:19.657 --> 49:20.257 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

49:22.092 --> 49:23.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes.
And I think that's the key,
because if you

49:23.928 --> 49:24.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look at the biggest challenge
for Donald Trump
right now, he's doing very well
among these

49:24.595 --> 49:26.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
white working-class voters.

49:26.363 --> 49:28.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We keep talking about that.
Where he's not
doing well are white
white-collar voters.

49:28.165 --> 49:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this was a message directly
related to
them. It was interesting to see
Hillary Clinton

49:28.999 --> 49:30.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
talk about repackaging
Reaganomics.

49:30.835 --> 49:32.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For a lot of those voters who
right now are
saying either I'm voting for
Hillary Clinton

49:32.570 --> 49:34.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or I'm undecided on Donald
Trump, they kind
of like the Reaganomics message.
They like

49:34.338 --> 49:34.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the tax cut message. They like
the lack of
regulation -- or scaling back on
regulation

49:34.638 --> 49:36.440 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
message.

49:36.473 --> 49:38.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the economy is one -- of the
14 different
areas that The Wall Street
Journal poll asked

49:38.342 --> 49:39.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who do you think does a better
job of question,
Donald Trump only was ahead on
four of those.

49:39.043 --> 49:40.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One of those was the economy.

49:40.878 --> 49:42.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a place where, if I were
that campaign,
I would be spending much more
time talking

49:42.413 --> 49:44.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the economy, a lot less
time beating
up on your fellow Republicans.

49:44.148 --> 49:45.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And of course we are
going to
hear more from Hillary Clinton
on the subject

49:45.316 --> 49:47.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
later -- or as the week goes on
apparently
every day.

49:47.084 --> 49:48.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tam, let's talk about last
week's unforced,
or were they unforced errors,
the errors,

49:48.786 --> 49:50.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the series of errors. Is that
what led us
to today, to the teleprompter
speech?

49:50.087 --> 49:51.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It certainly would
seem like
he needed a reset.

49:51.889 --> 49:53.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He need to have a clean break
from last week's
sort of rolling errors. But,
even as late

49:53.691 --> 49:54.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as yesterday, he was tweeting
fact-checks
about the baby, the baby being a
baby that...

49:54.859 --> 49:56.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Crying baby that he
made the joke
about.

49:56.627 --> 49:58.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: There was a crying
baby. And
then he made a joke and it was
interpreted

49:58.162 --> 49:59.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as him kicking a baby out of a
rally, when
maybe the baby had already left.

49:59.897 --> 50:01.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as late as yesterday, he was
tweeting
about this. So today's speech,
the challenge

50:01.699 --> 50:03.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, we are getting closer and
closer to the
general election. And in today's
speech, he

50:03.500 --> 50:05.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said I will have more specifics,
I will have
details on my Web site, tune in,
in a couple

50:05.269 --> 50:06.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of weeks. We have heard that
before. And so
I wait for digging into policy,
but maybe

50:06.103 --> 50:06.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this race isn't really about
policy.

50:06.503 --> 50:07.404 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

50:07.438 --> 50:09.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That's part of the
question.

50:09.206 --> 50:10.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But on the other hand, let's
just measure
this by -- just for giggles, by
conventional

50:11.008 --> 50:12.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
measures. Hillary Clinton,
including during
the Olympics, is hammering him
with anti-Trump

50:12.343 --> 50:12.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ads. Not a peep in conventional
sense coming
from Donald Trump.

50:12.843 --> 50:14.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

50:14.578 --> 50:15.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He still has yet to show us that
he's going
to run a traditional campaign.
Now, look,

50:15.145 --> 50:15.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he's gotten this far.

50:15.546 --> 50:16.580 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

50:16.614 --> 50:18.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Not one ad, not one
television
ad.

50:18.315 --> 50:20.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Not one television
ad. He doesn't
have a traditional anything.
Right?

50:20.117 --> 50:21.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's gotten this far. And so
this is what
we have been going back and
forth about for

50:21.919 --> 50:23.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this entire campaign, which is
he's either
going to show us at the end of
the day that

50:23.721 --> 50:25.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's upended all the rules of
politics, that
you don't need these fancy
consultants, you

50:25.489 --> 50:26.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't need ads, you don't need
polls, you
don't need any of it, just your
personality

50:26.991 --> 50:28.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and your message and the
environment alone
can drive voters to the polls.

50:28.058 --> 50:28.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But let me try
something with
you.

50:28.626 --> 50:30.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Yes, please.

50:30.494 --> 50:32.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: When we were sitting
at the conventions
and we heard him say, "I am your
voice," I

50:32.229 --> 50:32.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think we all agreed that that
was his message,
that he had settled on a
message. We have

50:32.796 --> 50:34.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not heard that since.

50:34.632 --> 50:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, I think still
to the voters
that support him, that still is
the message,

50:35.866 --> 50:37.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he is going to be the
person that stands
up for us.

50:37.635 --> 50:39.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His challenge is that he hasn't
broadened
it beyond that same group of
voters he was

50:39.503 --> 50:41.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speaking to at the convention.
And this speech
for the first time what he did
was he married

50:41.305 --> 50:43.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the traditional sort of Chamber
of Commerce,
Republican message on taxes and
entitlements

50:43.040 --> 50:43.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the populist, anti-NAFTA,
anti-trade
message that he's been saying on
the trial,

50:43.908 --> 50:45.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to bring the party
together.

50:45.776 --> 50:47.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, unifying the party has
been a challenge
that he continues to struggle
with. And until

50:47.278 --> 50:49.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he figures that out, Hillary
Clinton is going
to continue to have a lead.

50:49.146 --> 50:50.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, and also for
the first time,
we have seen kind of both
candidates talking

50:50.547 --> 50:51.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about mental stability as an
issue, speaking
about their opponent.

50:51.048 --> 50:52.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

50:52.983 --> 50:54.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary's campaign begun this
several months
-- or at least a month ago, I
would say, talking

50:54.852 --> 50:55.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about whether he's
temperamentally fit to
be president. At the convention,
Michael Bloomberg

50:55.719 --> 50:57.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said, let's choose a sane
candidate.

50:57.521 --> 50:59.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was a big moment.
Here's a major
figure at a convention talking
about sanity.

50:59.323 --> 51:00.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump this week seems to
have gone
to the "I know you are, but what
am I?" school,

51:00.691 --> 51:02.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and now he's saying that Hillary
Clinton is
temperamentally unfit.

51:02.393 --> 51:02.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Based on her comment
saying that
she short-circuited an answer on
e-mails.

51:02.793 --> 51:03.861 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

51:03.894 --> 51:05.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, she
short-circuited an
answer.

51:05.362 --> 51:07.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This has also spawned some
conspiracy theories
about her health.

51:07.131 --> 51:08.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, let's talk about
someone else
getting into the race, someone
probably I

51:08.866 --> 51:10.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think it's fair the three of us
had never
heard of, a gentleman by the
name of Evan

51:10.601 --> 51:11.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McMullin, who says he's going to
represent
all the Republicans who are not
for Trump.

51:11.101 --> 51:11.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

51:11.669 --> 51:13.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Who is he?

51:13.470 --> 51:14.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: He's a former CIA
operative. He's
a former House staffer. He now
is retired

51:14.171 --> 51:15.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from his position at the House.

51:15.906 --> 51:17.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is what we have been
talking about, I
feel like, at this table for so
long. You

51:17.841 --> 51:18.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have this group of Republicans
who say they
can't support Trump, but they
can't find somebody

51:18.409 --> 51:20.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
else to rally around.

51:20.177 --> 51:21.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here is his challenge, getting
on ballots
in many states. The deadlines
have closed.

51:21.946 --> 51:23.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The same time -- the
last time
we talked about David French
right now, yes.

51:23.480 --> 51:25.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Remember that, David
French? His
challenge, getting on ballots.

51:25.215 --> 51:26.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a candidate who also
went to BYU,
the thought being he could play
well in a

51:26.984 --> 51:28.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place like Utah or Arizona that
have a big
Mormon population. Arizona, you
have to get

51:28.819 --> 51:29.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of signatures to get on
the ballot.
And the deadline there is the
first week in

51:29.186 --> 51:30.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
September.

51:30.955 --> 51:32.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Utah, not as arduous, but that
means just
like one or two states that he
may have an

51:32.823 --> 51:34.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impact on. And, quite frankly,
if we're talking
about Arizona in Utah in
September and October,

51:34.692 --> 51:35.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this race is a blowout. Like,
it's not even
going to be lose. We might as
well just sleep

51:35.225 --> 51:36.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in on Election Day.

51:36.560 --> 51:37.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But except it
doesn't seem at
all to be the case.

51:37.194 --> 51:38.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

51:38.495 --> 51:40.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: At least, no one is
willing to
quite go that far.

51:40.364 --> 51:42.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the Friday light, late
night, programmed
against the Olympics endorsement
of Paul Ryan,

51:42.066 --> 51:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kelly Ayotte, and John McCain,
does that help
them at all, or does it hurt
them?

51:42.566 --> 51:44.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: No.

51:44.401 --> 51:45.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it really looked like those
endorsements
came under duress. He was
reading. He looked

51:45.536 --> 51:47.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
uncomfortable saying it. No, it
doesn't help
them.

51:47.471 --> 51:49.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes. If I were
Senator Kelly Ayotte,
who right now is looking at a
very, very tough

51:49.340 --> 51:50.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race in a state that's now
turning away from
Donald Trump, I would be like,
you know what,

51:50.474 --> 51:52.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thanks, but that's OK, you can
keep your endorsement.

51:52.209 --> 51:53.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I think that's
kind of what
Paul Ryan said, which was,
that's nice.

51:53.077 --> 51:54.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's nice, but I
don't...

51:54.912 --> 51:55.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You don't think it
necessarily
helps? You don't think it
necessarily helps?

51:55.879 --> 51:57.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: No, they're in a
tough spot.

51:57.715 --> 51:59.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of these people who are
down-ballot are
in a tough spot, because they
don't -- they

51:59.616 --> 52:01.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have already on some level
associated themselves
with the person at the top of
the ticket.

52:01.418 --> 52:02.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at the same time, they are
trying to distance
themselves. And Democrats aren't
going to

52:02.586 --> 52:04.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
let them get away with
distancing themselves
one bit.

52:04.355 --> 52:04.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And brace for
whatever may happen
this week, as opposed to last
week.

52:04.989 --> 52:06.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Yes. Yes.

52:06.790 --> 52:07.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tamara Keith of NPR,
Amy Walter
of The Cook Political Report,
thank you both

52:07.157 --> 52:07.791 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very much.

52:07.825 --> 52:08.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

52:08.525 --> 52:10.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

52:10.294 --> 52:12.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For all of the
concerns and
problems leading into Rio, the
first days

52:12.162 --> 52:12.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Olympics generally went
off well, with
memorable moments, and the hope
of a promising

52:12.796 --> 52:14.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
week to come for the USA.

52:14.631 --> 52:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After one weekend in Rio,
American swimmers
are living up to golden
expectations so far.

52:16.467 --> 52:18.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Powerhouse swimmer Katie Ledecky
grabbed her
first gold medal of these games
Sunday night,

52:18.402 --> 52:18.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
breaking her own world record in
the 400-meter
freestyle, with competitors
almost five seconds

52:18.802 --> 52:20.571 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in her wake.

52:20.604 --> 52:22.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE LEDECKY, Olympic Gold
Medal Winner:
It's an amazing feeling, to sing
the national

52:22.306 --> 52:22.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anthem and see the flags raised.
I got to
go out there with a teammate and
we sang our

52:22.706 --> 52:24.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hearts out.

52:24.508 --> 52:26.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Veteran Michael
Phelps, who's
now 31 years old, collected his
19th gold,

52:26.310 --> 52:28.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as part of the men's 4-by-100
relay team.
Also Sunday, the U.S. women
gymnastics team

52:28.112 --> 52:29.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proved their dominance in
qualifying for the
all-around category, which
permits only two

52:29.480 --> 52:31.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
per country. Favorite Simone
Biles soared
to the number one spot.

52:31.248 --> 52:33.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Teammate Aly Raisman will join
her in the
finals, edging out 2012 gold
medalist Gabby

52:33.217 --> 52:35.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Douglas for the second U.S.
slot. And, today,
fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad became
the first American

52:35.085 --> 52:35.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Olympian to compete wearing a
Muslim hijab,
or head scarf. She won her first
round, before

52:35.519 --> 52:37.421 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being defeated.

52:37.454 --> 52:39.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, uproars over doping
are still swirling
over Rio. Russian swimmer Yulia
Efimova faced

52:39.289 --> 52:41.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
boos before a preliminary race
on Sunday.
She had been banned after
failing drug tests,

52:41.191 --> 52:41.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then reinstated. American
Lily King made
clear her displeasure about
Efimova's presence

52:41.592 --> 52:43.494 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the pool.

52:43.527 --> 52:45.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Saturday, Australian
swimmer Mack Horton
accused his Chinese rival Sun
Yang of being

52:45.429 --> 52:46.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a -- quote -- "drug cheat" and
then beat him
in the 400-meter freestyle.
Chinese officials

52:46.063 --> 52:47.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have demanded an apology.

52:47.731 --> 52:49.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now for an on-the-ground
perspective from
Rio, I spoke a short time ago to
Christine

52:49.566 --> 52:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brennan, a sportswriter and
columnist who's
covering the Games for USA
Today. She's also

52:50.234 --> 52:50.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a contributor for ABC News.

52:50.868 --> 52:52.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Christine Brennan, hello.

52:52.770 --> 52:53.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been quite a weekend for
the United States
in swimming. Tell us what it's
been like at

52:53.303 --> 52:55.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the swimming venue.

52:55.072 --> 52:56.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, USA Today: I
will tell
you, Judy, it was really an
electric evening

52:56.974 --> 52:58.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and certainly for the United
States last night,
with both Katie Ledecky in the
400 freestyle,

52:58.575 --> 53:00.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world record performance,
breaking her on
world record by almost two
seconds.

53:00.411 --> 53:02.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then within, what, maybe 20,
30 minutes,
you had that relay, of course,
Michael Phelps

53:02.212 --> 53:03.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming back to the pool for the
first time,
31 years old now, his fifth
Olympic Games.

53:03.947 --> 53:05.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what does he do? He's in the
second leg
of that four-person relay and he
stakes the

53:05.783 --> 53:06.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. out to a lead, and the U.S.
-- his two
teammates just came in and won,
beating the

53:06.083 --> 53:07.818 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
French.

53:07.851 --> 53:09.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The crowd, you would have
thought it was a
U.S. crowd, in the sense that
here we are

53:09.686 --> 53:11.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Rio. But it was a really
majestic moment,
I think, but with the knowledge
that the fans

53:11.555 --> 53:12.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had that they were watching
something special,
watching Michael Phelps return,
the greatest

53:12.723 --> 53:14.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Olympian of all time, winning
his 19th gold
medal.

53:14.625 --> 53:16.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, those two things back to
back -- and Katie
Ledecky even said it after she
won. She goes,

53:16.393 --> 53:18.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"I think there's going to be
another gold
medal." She was the first for
the U.S. in

53:18.228 --> 53:18.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the pool. Usually, the U.S.
dominates in the
swimming pool. And I think we
will see that

53:18.929 --> 53:20.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over the next few days as well.

53:20.764 --> 53:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is it about
Katie Ledecky?
What puts her far ahead of the
competition?

53:22.399 --> 53:24.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Well, I think
all of her
opponents would love to know
that.

53:24.201 --> 53:26.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's competing really only
against herself.
The 800 freestyle is hers. She
will be even

53:26.070 --> 53:27.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
farther ahead in that. People
should get used
to seeing that. She's just one
of these people

53:27.938 --> 53:29.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has a wonderful attitude
about life, super
smart, going to Stanford, and
gets it, has

53:29.740 --> 53:30.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a great perspective, wonderful
family that
loves sports, and also, for
herself, just

53:30.741 --> 53:32.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a sense that she just wants to
better herself.

53:32.509 --> 53:34.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It sounds like a cliche, but she
just goes
out there, follows her coach's
orders, kind

53:34.344 --> 53:35.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the model student, the model
athlete, and
just puts it together, and is
absolutely on

53:35.579 --> 53:37.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
top of her game at the most
important moment
of her life.

53:37.314 --> 53:39.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Michael
Phelps, as you
said, he's now 31 years old. He
came into

53:39.183 --> 53:39.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these Games with 18 gold medals.
He just picked
up another one last night. What
is he looking

53:39.616 --> 53:40.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do in Rio?

53:41.018 --> 53:42.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Well, he's
got a lot more.
He's just beginning.

53:42.920 --> 53:44.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people are going to say,
what, more Michael
Phelps? Yes. He's got the 100
butterfly, 200

53:44.721 --> 53:45.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
butterfly, 200 individual medley
and probably
one more relay. So we're just
beginning to

53:45.122 --> 53:46.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
see Phelps.

53:46.957 --> 53:48.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is shocking. When you
think about
this in sports, swimming is a
young person's

53:48.759 --> 53:49.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came. As I said, Katie Ledecky
is 19 years
old. Somebody of these people
are -- a lot

53:49.393 --> 53:51.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of teenagers in the pool.

53:51.195 --> 53:52.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here's Michael Phelps, 31.
Now, he has
certainly had some difficulties
in his life.

53:53.030 --> 53:54.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went to rehab after a second
DUI. He has
acknowledged his problems. But
the fact that

53:54.865 --> 53:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he could be so strong at 31 --
in most sports,
he would long since be retired,
in terms of

53:56.066 --> 53:57.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his age -- and yet he's just
still as dominant
as ever.

53:57.835 --> 53:59.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then you have
the doping
allegations around the Russians
and others.

53:59.670 --> 53:59.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's already causing a backlash
among a number
of the athletes. How is that
affecting things

53:59.970 --> 54:01.338 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there?

54:01.371 --> 54:03.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: I will tell
you, it's been
really interesting.

54:03.273 --> 54:05.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the metaphor for the
entire conversation,
Judy, about Russian doping, the
diabolical

54:05.175 --> 54:06.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian doping machine and the
fact that they
were allowed to compete in the
Olympics, as

54:06.944 --> 54:07.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opposed to being kicked out, as
I thought
they should be, the metaphor
really is -- the

54:07.611 --> 54:09.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pool is a metaphor for that.

54:09.413 --> 54:11.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The booing for these athletes,
Yulia Efimova
especially, the breast stroker,
loud boos

54:11.248 --> 54:11.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for her, loud boos for the
Russian men's 4x100
freestyle relay team, you never
hear that,

54:11.548 --> 54:13.317 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ever.

54:13.350 --> 54:15.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what is that? That's the
swimmers. That's
coming especially coming from
the swimming

54:15.185 --> 54:16.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
section. The swimmers know. They
know. They're
disgusted by this. And I know
people will

54:17.020 --> 54:18.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, hey, Lance Armstrong
cheated and Marion
Jones. The U.S. has probably
given the world

54:18.388 --> 54:20.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the two worst cheaters ever in
Lance Armstrong
and Marion Jones.

54:20.257 --> 54:22.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The big difference is that for
Russia it was
government-sponsored,
state-sponsored doping.

54:22.159 --> 54:23.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The equivalent would be if a
member of President
Obama's Cabinet ran a five-year
doping plan

54:23.994 --> 54:25.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the United States involving
the FBI, the
CIA, U.S. Olympic Committee, and
U.S. Anti-Doping

54:25.195 --> 54:26.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Agency. That's how diabolical
the Russian
plan was.

54:26.997 --> 54:28.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One other sport
Gymnastics,
this was the first Olympics
appearance for

54:28.732 --> 54:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Simone Biles of the United
States, who she
absolutely lived up to her
billing in that

54:29.399 --> 54:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
qualifying event yesterday.

54:30.234 --> 54:32.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Oh, she sure
did.

54:32.035 --> 54:33.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Think Mary Lou Retton and Gabby
Douglas and
Olga Korbut and Nadia Comaneci
into one. In

54:33.837 --> 54:34.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many ways, we are seeing the
culmination of
an entire sport in one person.
Simone Biles

54:34.838 --> 54:36.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is that good. And the U.S. team
is that good.

54:36.540 --> 54:38.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a sport the you can have
a point,
a tenth of a point deciding
first, second,

54:38.342 --> 54:40.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
third. The U.S. was 10 points
ahead as a team
in the qualifying yesterday. And
the team,

54:40.110 --> 54:40.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. team, will certainly
win the gold
medal, barring some incredible
unforeseen

54:40.644 --> 54:42.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
occurrence tomorrow.

54:42.479 --> 54:44.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's that. That's the team
competition.
Then Simone Biles in the
individual all-around,

54:44.148 --> 54:45.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she is expected to win the gold.
And then
she is expected to go on to the
individual

54:45.149 --> 54:46.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
apparatuses and actually keep
winning gold.

54:46.984 --> 54:48.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Simone Biles, I believe by
the time these
Olympic Games are over, will be
seen as the

54:48.785 --> 54:49.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
greatest U.S. gymnast ever. And
I'll tell
you, that's saying something,
because there

54:49.920 --> 54:51.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is certainly a lot of
competition for that
title.

54:51.822 --> 54:53.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally,
Christine, after all
the hype and the negative
stories about Brazil,

54:53.524 --> 54:55.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about Rio running up to these
Olympics, how
do these first few days feel to
you?

54:55.292 --> 54:57.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Judy, I have
to say that
these Games have been a pleasant
surprise.

54:57.161 --> 54:58.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are issues with
transportation and buses
not coming and things like that,
but it really

54:59.029 --> 55:00.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feels like an Olympics to me.
And when I say
that, I mean everything about
it. The opening

55:00.764 --> 55:02.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ceremony, I thought, was
actually terrific
on a budget. They did more with
less, far

55:02.666 --> 55:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
less budget than, say -- far
fewer dollars
to spend than Beijing in '08
with their grandiose

55:03.333 --> 55:05.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ceremony or London in 2012.

55:05.169 --> 55:06.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought they did a great
job with a
message, with a conscience. And
I think that

55:06.970 --> 55:08.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has carried over the last few
days. You have
seen good will in many places.
Of course,

55:08.105 --> 55:09.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mentioned the booing, but good
will in many
places.

55:09.873 --> 55:11.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have seen great upsets. You
have seen
athletes care so much about
this. And the

55:11.742 --> 55:12.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Games are moving on. Knock on
wood. We will
see how it goes over the next
two weeks. But

55:12.676 --> 55:14.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they really seem to be going on
just fine.

55:14.511 --> 55:16.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you consider the National
Football League
had to cancel its Hall of Fame
game because

55:16.346 --> 55:18.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a problem on the field, they
couldn't put
on one football game, and here
Rio is seemingly

55:18.182 --> 55:19.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them moving ahead with all of
these venues,
and so far, so good. I think
that's in many

55:19.883 --> 55:21.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ways a big sports upset, but
it's also a nice
thing to see as the Games have
started.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Christine
Brennan, thank you
very much. And we look forward
to talking

55:22.286 --> 55:23.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to you in the days to come.

55:23.487 --> 55:24.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: You bet,
Judy. Thank you
very much.

55:24.121 --> 55:25.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

55:25.923 --> 55:27.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
efforts to make
peace between high schoolers and
police; and

55:27.057 --> 55:28.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the harmonies of Neko Case, K.D.
Lang and
Laura Veirs.

55:28.725 --> 55:29.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: President Obama has
pledged to
accept 10,000 Syrian refugees by
October,

55:29.826 --> 55:31.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
despite resistance playing out
in many communities.

55:31.628 --> 55:32.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Refugees, many of them rootless
for years,
often arrive with significant
medical problems

55:32.262 --> 55:34.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and psychological trauma.

55:34.064 --> 55:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Sarah
Varney brings
us this report about how one
city, Buffalo,

55:35.966 --> 55:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York, is adapting. Her story
was produced
in collaboration with our
partner Kaiser Health

55:36.266 --> 55:38.101 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
News.

55:38.135 --> 55:39.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Since Murhaf,
Ghenwa, and their
children moved here from Syria,
even mundane

55:39.469 --> 55:40.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tasks like cooking and homework
have become
more complicated.

55:40.137 --> 55:41.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: They have 10 airplanes.

55:42.005 --> 55:43.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Unaccustomed tote
this new life,
the family relies on help from
Hassan Alishaqi

55:43.140 --> 55:44.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from a local resettlement agency
called Journey's
End.

55:44.942 --> 55:46.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Refugee agencies help families
like this one
find housing and jobs, get
medical care and

55:46.777 --> 55:48.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health insurance and enroll in
English classes
and schools. They fled Syria
after civil war

55:48.745 --> 55:50.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
erupted there in 2011,
unleashing an exodus
of more than four million
refugees. The destruction

55:50.514 --> 55:50.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and violence came close to
Murhaf's family
during one their last nights in
the city of

55:50.814 --> 55:52.549 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Homs.

55:52.583 --> 55:54.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Some
bullets came
to my house through the window.
And I was

55:54.418 --> 55:54.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
afraid for the safety of my
kids. They never
sleep because of -- it's just
very hard for

55:54.851 --> 55:56.853 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them to sleep.

55:56.887 --> 55:58.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: After a year in
Cairo and exhaustive
security checks, the family
arrived in Buffalo,

55:58.722 --> 56:00.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a quiet city on the edge of Lake
Erie. And
like many new arrivals here,
they're struggling

56:00.490 --> 56:00.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the aftermath of their
horrific journey
as they attempt to build
healthier lives in

56:00.924 --> 56:02.793 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their new home.

56:02.826 --> 56:04.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 90 percent of the
refugees who resettle
to New York live in Upstate New
York. The

56:04.728 --> 56:06.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city of Buffalo has become a
welcoming haven
for many of them. But over the
last 15 years,

56:06.496 --> 56:07.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the countries and conflicts they
come from
have changed. And the health
care needs of

56:07.164 --> 56:08.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
refugees are changing, too.

56:08.865 --> 56:10.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jericho Road is a community
health center
in Buffalo that has long treated
refugees

56:10.634 --> 56:12.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from some of the world's poorest
countries,
including Myanmar, Bhutan, Sudan
and Somalia.

56:12.469 --> 56:14.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The clinic is a crossroads of
languages and
customs. New refugees receive
free medical

56:14.371 --> 56:14.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assistance from the federal
government for
eight months. Then they can buy
private insurance

56:14.938 --> 56:16.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or enroll in Medicaid.

56:16.740 --> 56:17.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MYRON GLICK, Jericho Road:
When you came,
we found that your T.B. test was
positive.

56:17.975 --> 56:19.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think you are now taking
medicine for
that, right?

56:19.843 --> 56:21.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The clinic's
founder, Dr. Myron
Glick, often treats refugees for
tuberculosis,

56:21.678 --> 56:23.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
malaria and childhood
malnutrition. But he
says the more recent arrivals
from Iraq and

56:23.547 --> 56:24.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria, which are middle-income
countries,
typically don't suffer from
diseases of poverty,

56:24.514 --> 56:26.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but instead have been
traumatized by war.

56:26.416 --> 56:28.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A critical report by local
leaders that examined
the area's safety net found that
health care

56:28.285 --> 56:29.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
providers urgently need to
improve culturally
appropriate mental health
services. And more

56:30.020 --> 56:30.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clinics needed to follow Jericho
Road's model,
hiring refugees who can help new
arrivals

56:30.320 --> 56:32.222 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
adjust.

56:32.256 --> 56:34.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kowsar Ali, a Somali and Arabic
interpreter,
says just figuring out how to
explain a patient's

56:34.157 --> 56:35.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
symptoms and a doctor's
diagnosis is a puzzle,
words and phrases with no
English equivalent,

56:35.425 --> 56:37.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
medical terms like PTSD and
depression that
are unfamiliar.

56:37.294 --> 56:39.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KOWSAR ALI, Jericho Road: It's
actually hard
for them because there's nothing
as depression.

56:39.062 --> 56:40.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say, OK, because that never
existed in
my country. There's nothing as
depression.

56:40.897 --> 56:41.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Dr. Glick says the
initial relief
refugees feel when they reach
safety often

56:41.565 --> 56:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gives way to a new reality.

56:43.467 --> 56:45.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. MYRON GLICK: All the
horrible things that
happen to people along their
journey to America,

56:45.302 --> 56:47.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and yet really they come with
hope. And a
year, two years in, you see that
hope dissipate.

56:47.070 --> 56:48.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really challenging here in
America to
deal with the stresses that are
thrust upon

56:48.171 --> 56:50.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them without the support of
their home community.

56:50.040 --> 56:51.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: That sense of
isolation is easing
for some. Ali Kadhum arrived in
Buffalo in

56:51.908 --> 56:52.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2008, just as the fledgling
Iraqi community
was taking root. Back then,
Kadhum says there

56:52.476 --> 56:54.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were just 25 families.

56:54.144 --> 56:55.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALI KADHUM, Lake Shore
Behavioral Health:
Now it's almost 750 Iraqi
families.

56:55.545 --> 56:57.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Today, he says
Iraqis bump into
each other around town.

56:57.347 --> 56:59.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI KADHUM: They feel they are
not alone.
They feel they are still living
in Iraq, because

56:59.182 --> 56:59.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, there's restaurants,
cook their food
here. There is some people speak
their language,

57:00.017 --> 57:01.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at least, and they can
communicate.

57:01.785 --> 57:03.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: So many refugees
have moved
here that the population of Erie
County, home

57:03.553 --> 57:05.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Buffalo, is growing for the
first time
since the 1960s. And they are
reshaping a

57:05.389 --> 57:05.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city that has struggled to find
its way in
the modern economy. Old
factories now house

57:06.023 --> 57:07.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
English-language classes.

57:07.858 --> 57:09.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a small business incubator,
women sell
Iraqi macrame and Rwandan
scarves, and vendors

57:09.626 --> 57:11.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
claim to sell the best dim sum
in Buffalo.
Refugee children pursue music in
a program

57:11.094 --> 57:12.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called Buffalo String Works, and
are mentored
by professional musicians.

57:12.963 --> 57:14.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Health systems here are
adapting, too. A Catholic
Church once, filled with Italian
and Irish

57:14.765 --> 57:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
congregates, recently reopened
as a health
clinic for new immigrants. And
with so many

57:16.566 --> 57:17.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arrivals from active war zones,
the University
at Buffalo tapped Dr. Kim
Griswold to help

57:17.834 --> 57:19.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lead the Western New York Center
for Survivors
of Torture.

57:19.636 --> 57:21.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. KIM GRISWOLD, Western New
York Center
for Survivors of Torture: Some
of the folks

57:21.538 --> 57:23.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we have seen have been
horribly tortured
physically, with scars to prove
it, amputations,

57:23.106 --> 57:24.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other things that we have seen
that are horrific,
cigarette burns, whipping.

57:24.908 --> 57:26.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Kareem Khaleefah,
who worked
for the U.S. Army in Baghdad,
was kidnapped

57:26.076 --> 57:27.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by a Shia militia, lined up with
20 other
men and shot.

57:27.978 --> 57:28.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREEM KHALEEFAH, Worked for
U.S. Army (through
translator): I was like super
lucky that the

57:28.845 --> 57:30.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bullets come on the side of my
body.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: He fell to the
ground and pretended
to be dead until nightfall.

57:32.215 --> 57:33.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Even in Buffalo's quiet
neighborhoods, those
memories never fade, says
Kadhum, a mental

57:34.017 --> 57:35.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health counselor at Lake Shore
Behavioral
Health. He says many older
Iraqis, like Saja

57:35.786 --> 57:37.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alnaqeeb and her husband,
Mahmoud, once lived
prosperous, vibrant lives. Then,
in 2005,

57:37.587 --> 57:39.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saja was tortured and the family
fled. Now
she stays inside, tormented by
her memories.

57:39.523 --> 57:40.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): My
family, sometimes,
they wake up, they find me
screaming at night

57:40.090 --> 57:41.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with these nightmares.

57:41.858 --> 57:43.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The images she
sees on the news
are a constant reminder of the
continuing

57:43.593 --> 57:45.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
violence in Iraq. She worries
about her children
and grandchildren still in
Baghdad.

57:45.429 --> 57:47.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): My
mind is about
them. Every time they mention to
me they are

57:47.097 --> 57:48.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
unsafe, they are getting
threatened, they
move their place from place to
place just

57:48.398 --> 57:50.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make sure that they are --
protect their
kids and family.

57:50.200 --> 57:51.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The recent spate
of violent
attacks worldwide have fueled
anti-immigrant

57:51.935 --> 57:53.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and anti-refugee sentiment. But
experts on
human migration say these events
are rare,

57:53.403 --> 57:54.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, in fact, it's refugees who
often face
discrimination and violence.

57:54.504 --> 57:56.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Neil Boothby is a professor at
Columbia University.

57:56.306 --> 57:58.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NEIL BOOTHBY, Columbia
University: There's
going to be language issues.
There's going

57:58.175 --> 57:59.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be cultural issues. What
happens if a girl
wants to wear a scarf over her
head? How is

58:00.010 --> 58:01.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the community going to respond
to that? What
if people need to spend a lot of
time in the

58:01.812 --> 58:02.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mosques? How are we going to
respond to that?
So it's going to be an
adjustment, I think,

58:02.245 --> 58:04.181 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for each side.

58:04.214 --> 58:06.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: In Buffalo, the
focus now is
to enroll more people in mental
health counseling.

58:06.116 --> 58:07.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At a Lake Shore clinic,
patients, like Kurd
Bllnd struggle to reconcile
religion, sectarian

58:07.250 --> 58:09.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and ethnic violence that has
persisted for
decades.

58:09.052 --> 58:10.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KURD BLLND, Patient (through
translator):
What happened to the Kurdish in
Iraq, of course

58:10.087 --> 58:11.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're going to be upset and
angry and anxious.

58:11.888 --> 58:12.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Bllnd, who grew up
in a Kurdish
village in Iraq, was jailed and
interrogated

58:12.589 --> 58:14.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for three years in the 1980s.

58:14.257 --> 58:15.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KURD BLLND (through translator):
Since the
age of 12 years until now -- I'm
67 years

58:15.258 --> 58:16.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of age -- I didn't see anything
good in life.

58:16.993 --> 58:17.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Two years after he
arrived in

KURD BLLND: They told me, if you

somebody talk to you. Maybe you
forget past,

JESSICA MARMION, Lake Shore

The key stressor, I think, is
isolation. So,

58:23.433 --> 58:25.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they come here, they don't speak
the language,
they really only know their

We have like all kinds of people
coming. We

58:29.406 --> 58:31.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have lawyers. We have
businesspeople. We have
-- you need sometimes to talk
about your problems,

58:31.241 --> 58:32.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially coming from a country
of war. You
went through trauma. You went
through death.

58:32.476 --> 58:34.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You went through some violence.
So, we're

JUDY WOODRUFF: Last September, a
federal court
in Alabama ruled that the
Birmingham Police

58:42.819 --> 58:44.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department's disciplinary
practices, including
the use of pepper spray for
minor discipline

58:44.221 --> 58:45.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
problems, is in violation of
student rights
and unconstitutional.

58:46.022 --> 58:47.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Attorney Ebony Howard of the
Southern Poverty
Law Center filed the
class-action suit, and

58:47.524 --> 58:49.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
returns to court next month when
the police
department's appeal is heard.

high school students and the

CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: This
video of a white
South Carolina policeman roughly
ejecting

58:55.699 --> 58:56.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a black student from her
classroom went viral
and ignited a conversation about
the proper

58:56.366 --> 58:58.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
role for police in schools.

58:58.301 --> 59:00.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ebony Howard, a lawyer with the
Southern Poverty
Law Center, has been involved in
that conversation

59:00.170 --> 59:01.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a result of her successful
suit against
police macing students in
Montgomery, Alabama.

59:01.104 --> 59:02.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ebony Howard, thank you for
joining us.

59:02.506 --> 59:04.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EBONY HOWARD, Southern Poverty
Law Center:
Thank you for having me.

59:04.307 --> 59:04.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Can you
tell us briefly
about the case you won in
Birmingham last

59:04.608 --> 59:05.108 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year?

59:05.142 --> 59:06.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EBONY HOWARD: Sure.

59:06.877 --> 59:08.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The case was about police
officers who are
stationed in Birmingham City
high schools

59:08.712 --> 59:10.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who are there to protect
students, and they
were using mace, or pepper spray
is what it's

59:10.680 --> 59:11.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sometimes called, against
students for engaging
in what amounts to normal
adolescent behavior.

59:11.515 --> 59:13.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Like
what?

59:13.283 --> 59:15.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EBONY HOWARD: Like, for example,
one of our
plaintiffs, plaintiff K.B., she
was leaving

59:15.118 --> 59:16.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
class and going to another class
with a fellow
classmate. And as she walked, a
boy came up

59:16.586 --> 59:18.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to her and started to call her
really foul
names that I won't repeat.

59:18.488 --> 59:20.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as he called her those
names, his friends
who had come with him, they
started to laugh.

59:20.257 --> 59:22.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the more they laughed, the
more names
he called her. And so she tried
to walk away

59:22.259 --> 59:23.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from him. And as she walked
away, he followed
her and his friends followed
her, and he continued

59:23.093 --> 59:24.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to call her lots and lots of
names.

59:24.861 --> 59:26.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so eventually, as she walked
the entire
length of the school building,
she started

59:26.630 --> 59:28.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to cry. And she became
hysterical. And when
she reached the end of the
school building,

59:28.398 --> 59:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a police officer walked up. And
you would
think that he would have taken
care of her,

59:29.933 --> 59:31.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but what he did was, he told her
to calm down
or he was going to arrest her.

59:31.701 --> 59:33.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when she didn't stop crying,
he put her
in handcuffs. And she continued
to cry after

59:33.537 --> 59:34.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he handcuffed her, and he told
her, calm down.
And when she didn't calm down
fast enough,

59:34.171 --> 59:35.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he sprayed her with mace.

59:35.906 --> 59:37.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other point that I forgot to
mention,
though, was that she was four
months' pregnant

59:37.774 --> 59:39.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the time when he sprayed her
with mace.
She was arrested and taken to
the local juvenile

59:39.576 --> 59:40.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
facility, where she had to take
off her pants
and her underwear and squat and
cough as a

59:40.143 --> 59:41.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
part of a strip search.

59:41.945 --> 59:43.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so those are the kinds of
things that
were happening in Birmingham
City schools.

59:43.713 --> 59:45.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Now, you
argued the
things that are happening to
black students,

59:45.482 --> 59:45.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with examples like the ones you
just gave,
are very different from what
happens in white

59:45.782 --> 59:46.416 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
schools.

59:46.450 --> 59:46.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tell me just how different.

59:46.983 --> 59:48.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EBONY HOWARD: Right.

59:48.752 --> 59:50.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for example, the Birmingham
City School
System is 99 percent
African-American; 85

59:50.720 --> 59:52.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent of the students are on
free and reduced
lunch. In contrast, a
neighboring school district,

59:52.622 --> 59:54.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Jefferson County School
District, is much
more integrated, has far more
white students.

59:54.391 --> 59:56.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past 10 years, police
officers who
are in the Jefferson County
School District

59:56.193 --> 59:57.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have used mace 10 times. That's
over 10 years.
In contrast, during a five-year
period in

59:57.527 --> 59:59.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Birmingham City, almost 300
students were
sprayed with mace.

59:59.362 --> 01:00:01.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
what do you
say to the critics who say that
a lot of these

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:02.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kids are violent, that some are
gang members,
and that they get into
horrendous fights and

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:04.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things like that in these
schools and need
to be controlled by the police?

01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:06.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EBONY HOWARD: There is no
question that many
of the students that are in
school districts

01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:07.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like the Birmingham City School
District have
very big challenges to overcome
with regard

01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:09.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to socioeconomic status and
poverty.

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:10.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would also say that a lot
of this talk,
a lot of this rhetoric is just
propaganda.

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:12.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You're
saying that
most of what these young people
who have been

01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:13.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maced have been doing, in other
schools, are
regarded as normal adolescent
behavior that

01:00:13.677 --> 01:00:15.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gets punished, but not in the
same way.

01:00:15.479 --> 01:00:16.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EBONY HOWARD: That is precisely
right, that
when a black boy engages in a
certain type

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of misbehavior, there is a
perception that
that is criminal.

01:00:18.582 --> 01:00:20.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In contrast, when a white boy in
a different
school district does the same
thing, that

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:21.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is perceived as adolescent
misconduct. That's
an inequity that black children
and Latino

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:23.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children have to live with in
this country.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
the police,
of course, defended the actions
of the police,

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:25.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying that these children
deserved what they
got.

01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:26.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet the judge, in his
ruling, affirmed
your protest.

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:27.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EBONY HOWARD: Right.

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, what I thought was the
most striking
about the findings of fact and
conclusions

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of law that the judge issue was
that he recognized
that these are children, that
these are adolescents,

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:33.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that the police officers, at
least the
ones who were the defendants in
this case,

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:35.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't quite understand that,
whether intentionally
or unintentionally.

01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The judge said that, regardless,
it is clear
that Chief A.C. Roper, the chief
of police

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:38.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the Birmingham Police
Department, at a
minimum needs to provide
officers who are

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:40.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stationed in the Birmingham City
schools with
training on school-based
policing.

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:40.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You
worked with the
chiefs are other police leaders
to work on

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:42.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this problem, and what's going
on?

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:44.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EBONY HOWARD: The judge ordered
that we get
with the defendants to meet and
confer on

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:46.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
developing a plan that would
guide law enforcement
training for school-based
policing, as well

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:47.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as policies and procedures on
school-based
policing for Birmingham City
schools.

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:49.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, how
is that going?

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:49.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EBONY HOWARD: So, we have met.
And we agree
on some things, but were unable
to reach a

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:51.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
consensus on other things.

01:00:51.548 --> 01:00:53.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the chief of police has told
us that he
intends to appeal and has gone
through the

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:55.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
process of appealing. And we
believe that
the point of public education in
America is

01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:57.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not just to teach kids
academics, but to teach
them how to be citizens, how to
be adults.

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:58.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that involves learning how
to manage conflict,
learning how to work with each
other, learning

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:00.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how to respect people and that,
during that
process, they will make
mistakes.

01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:02.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They may fight, they may talk
back, they may
do things that we don't want
them to do. And

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:02.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the role of teachers and
principals and police
officers are to teach them how
to interact

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:03.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with each other.

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:05.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, what
is the solution?

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EBONY HOWARD: The first thing is
that, if
we're going to have officers in
our schools,

01:01:07.364 --> 01:01:08.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then they need to be trained.
They need not
be biased with regard to race or
socioeconomic

01:01:08.565 --> 01:01:10.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
status for the students that
they are working
with.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the more fundamental
thing and the
harder thing is that, when each
of us looks

01:01:12.202 --> 01:01:14.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at these kids, we need to see
our own. We
see someone who could be our
daughter, our

01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:14.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
son, niece, our nephew, our
cousin, our own
babies, rather than seeing an
other. And that's

01:01:14.538 --> 01:01:15.739 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not happening.

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:16.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
Ebony Howard,
thank you.

01:01:16.473 --> 01:01:17.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EBONY HOWARD: Thank you so much.

01:01:17.574 --> 01:01:19.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight: how
three became
one.

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:21.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown talks to a new
musical group
getting much attention this
summer.

01:01:21.144 --> 01:01:21.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The
pre-performance huddle
in which three
singer-songwriters with
successful

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:23.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
solo careers morph into one
group.

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:24.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Neko Case, K.D. Lang, and Laura
Veirs become
Case/Lang/Veirs.

01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:25.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The collaboration was the
brainchild of Lang,
who wanted to form what she
calls a:

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:27.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
K.D. LANG, Musician: Folk punk
girl group.

01:01:27.751 --> 01:01:29.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The three women
released an
album earlier this summer. We
spoke before

01:01:29.119 --> 01:01:30.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a recent performance at the
Lincoln Theatre
in Washington, D.C.

01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:32.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
K.D. LANG: I didn't know if it
was going to
work, but I thought it would be
interesting.

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:34.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I love these two artists as
individual
sources of great inspiration.

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:34.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So one day, I just had the
instinct to call
them, to e-mail them, and they
wrote back

01:01:34.591 --> 01:01:36.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in half-an-hour.

01:01:36.326 --> 01:01:38.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Canadian-born
Lang, now
54, is the senior member of the
band, and

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:40.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
probably best known to the wider
public, selling
two million copies of her 1992
album, "Ingenue."

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:41.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neko Case, 45, has been a
mainstay of indie
rock and country music since the
late '90s,

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both as a solo artist and with
the band the
New Pornographers; 42-year-old
Laura Veirs,

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:45.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
known for mixing classic country
and folk,
has turned out a range of work,
from a children's

01:01:45.602 --> 01:01:46.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
record, to a film soundtrack, to
her 2013
album, "Warp and Weft," which
included contributions

01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:47.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from Case and Lang.

01:01:47.971 --> 01:01:49.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The three made an important
decision from
the start, that they would write
only original

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
songs for this effort, and write
them together
as much as possible.

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:51.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEKO CASE, Musician: I often
start with lyrics,
and I try to make sure that
they're accessible,

01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:53.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but slightly off.

01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:55.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Laura uses a lot of
alternate tunings
as a guitar player. And she
comes up with

01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:57.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incredible melodies. You know,
when you first
hear them, they seem familiar to
you. And

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:59.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then you sing them or play them,
and you realize
they're on a completely
different level, like

01:01:59.049 --> 01:01:59.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
something familiar is so
completely brand-new.
And the different languages take
you outside

01:01:59.616 --> 01:02:01.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of your comfort zone.

01:02:01.351 --> 01:02:03.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA VEIRS, Musician: How do
you meld minds
to come up with something that's
cohesive

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:03.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and make a record that sounds
like it's not
like a variety show or
piecemeal? So, it was

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:04.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a really hard project for us.

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:06.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So how'd you do
it?

01:02:06.523 --> 01:02:08.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA VEIRS: Well, some of it is
just like
gritting our teeth, like, what
are we going

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:09.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to write about today? I don't
know. Let's
go take a walk. Oh, there's a
fireworks stand.

01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:11.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Oh, there's a fireworks named
Delirium.

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:13.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a good song title. Let's
go write a
song. Oh, we can't finish it.
Well, here's

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:14.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neko. She'd kind of come in and
write a bridge
and finish it. And she took that
song, "Delirium,"

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and made it her own, and added
her own lyrics
and vocals.

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:17.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEKO CASE: Being the boss of
your own career,
you get used to having veto
power and getting

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:19.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what you want, or as close to
what you want
as you have mapped out, you
know?

01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:20.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You didn't get
that in this
case?

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:22.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEKO CASE: Not always. And it
was a really
excellent exercise..

01:02:22.339 --> 01:02:24.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
K.D. LANG: It was a difficult
process at times.
Like Neko said, we're used to
having our own

01:02:24.174 --> 01:02:24.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
veto power as individual
artists. And to hear
somebody say, no, I just don't
like that bridge

01:02:24.808 --> 01:02:25.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is excruciating at times.

01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:26.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:27.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA VEIRS: And we all sulked.
We sulked.
We pouted.

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:27.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEKO CASE: Yes, there was some
sulking. But
we...

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.079 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:30.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're laughing
as you say
it now, right?

01:02:30.947 --> 01:02:32.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
K.D. LANG: Yes, but what that
ended up doing,
because we didn't have a
language, we weren't

01:02:32.782 --> 01:02:33.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
friends, we didn't have a
vernacular, a common
vernacular between us, so we had
to swiftly

01:02:33.183 --> 01:02:34.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
develop one.

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:35.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: They took turns
as lead singers.

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On "Honey and Smoke," it was
Lang, with the
other two on backup. The
collaboration has

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:39.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brought great reviews from
critics and a summer-long
tour around the U.S.

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:39.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You all three had success. I
assume tough
times as well. Being a working
musician, has

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:41.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it been a good life?

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:43.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA VEIRS: I say yes. I feel
every night
like, I can't believe this is my
job. Like,

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:44.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I get to do this. I love the
solitary aspect
of writing, because usually I
write solitary,

01:02:45.028 --> 01:02:46.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by myself. But I love the
teamwork aspect
of the touring and the
recording.

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:48.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
K.D. LANG: I like the music. I
don't like
the business. I get very tired
of the travel

01:02:48.832 --> 01:02:49.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and moving, constantly moving.
But the hour-and-a-half
that I'm making music, I'm one
of the happiest

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:51.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people on earth.

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:52.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEKO CASE: Around 2010, I kind
of looked up
and said, I'm 40 years old. You
know, I chose

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:54.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
music. I don't have a husband. I
don't have
any kids. Like, I chose music.
So, I had to

01:02:54.738 --> 01:02:55.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make a decision. Like, do I want
to do something
else, or do I want to go from
journeyman to

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:56.873 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
master?

01:02:56.906 --> 01:02:57.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I realized, you know, I want
to be a really
good musician. So, this
particular opportunity

01:02:58.008 --> 01:02:59.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happening at that time was this
beautiful
kismet.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:01.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For now, at
least, Neko Case,
K.D. Lang, and Laura Veirs say
this is a one-off

01:03:01.845 --> 01:03:02.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
project, one album and one tour.
And they
will savor the collaborative
moment of Case/Lang/Veirs

01:03:02.712 --> 01:03:03.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before returning to their solo
careers.

01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:05.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS

overseas
and his endorsement of Hillary
Clinton.

01:03:14.224 --> 01:03:15.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

tonight.
