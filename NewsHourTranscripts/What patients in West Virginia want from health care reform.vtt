JUDY WOODRUFF: And speaking
of the efforts to replace the
Affordable Care Act, let's

00:03.700 --> 00:08.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
continue hearing how
some citizens and health
care providers see it.

00:08.533 --> 00:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Producer Jason Kane visited
a pair of clinics in the
heart of coal country.

00:13.166 --> 00:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last night, we took you to the
town of Wise, Virginia, in a
state that opted not to expand

00:19.400 --> 00:22.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Medicaid for
low-income residents.

00:22.100 --> 00:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just across the border, in West
Virginia, the Affordable Care
Act and its Medicaid expansion

00:29.066 --> 00:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meant the rate of uninsured
residents dropped from at least
21 percent before the law took

00:35.166 --> 00:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
effect to 9 percent in 2015,
and nearly a third of families
in the state do get Medicaid.

00:41.300 --> 00:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 83 percent of
Mingo County voted for the
president in the election.

00:47.700 --> 00:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the state has been ravaged
by the opioids epidemic.

00:51.533 --> 00:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But at the Williamson Health
and Wellness Center, nerves
are now on edge as patients

00:57.433 --> 00:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
recount their personal stories.

00:59.533 --> 01:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REBECCA HICKS, West Virginia:
My name's Rebecca Hicks, and I'm
from Chattaroy, West Virginia.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm 37 years old.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
When I was younger, I was raped.

01:07.533 --> 01:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I guess I got on drugs to cope
with it, regular pain pills.

01:12.133 --> 01:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, it started with, you
know, snorting the pills.

01:16.233 --> 01:19.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then it led to
shooting the pills.

01:19.733 --> 01:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I have always
struggled to have a doctor.

01:24.566 --> 01:27.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this place kind of
takes care of all of it.

01:27.633 --> 01:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My access to Medicaid has helped
me pay for medicines that I
would never have been able

01:35.000 --> 01:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pay for and to see
specialists that I wouldn't
be able to see if I
didn't have that medical

01:45.533 --> 01:47.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

01:47.233 --> 01:48.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEROME CLINE, Family
Nurse Practitioner: My
name's Jerome Cline.

01:48.200 --> 01:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm a family nurse practitioner.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With the passage of the
Affordable Care Act, the state
had expanded Medicaid programs.

01:56.266 --> 01:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, it's just under
50 percent of our patients,
I think, are Medicaid.

01:59.633 --> 02:01.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
VICKI HATFIELD, Family
Nurse Practitioner: My
name is Vicki Hatfield.

02:01.833 --> 02:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a certified family
nurse practitioner and a
certified diabetes educator.

02:06.366 --> 02:11.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once we started seeing more
patients qualify for Medicaid,
they were able to come in, and

02:13.266 --> 02:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we were able to start getting
them caught up on their
preventive screenings and health

02:16.666 --> 02:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
promotion activities, and
just be able to treat their
chronic illnesses that had been

02:22.900 --> 02:24.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
neglected.

02:24.866 --> 02:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The increased funds for Medicaid
services brought more revenue
into the clinic, so that

02:30.100 --> 02:33.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
allowed us to hire
more people here.

02:33.666 --> 02:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also allowed us to do some
other things in the community
to promote healthy living.

02:40.033 --> 02:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEROME CLINE: We have a
farmers market every Saturday.

02:42.100 --> 02:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VICKI HATFIELD: We also had
community gardens start.

02:45.600 --> 02:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we see more people
growing their own vegetables.

02:49.033 --> 02:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEROME CLINE: We have a
community 5K almost every month.

02:55.733 --> 02:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then we have a community
health worker program.

02:58.466 --> 03:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's certainly a lot of cheaper
to keep people healthy at home
than it is once they get into

03:01.966 --> 03:04.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the system.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VICKI HATFIELD: Now, as we watch
what's happening with possible
repeal or replacement of the

03:09.133 --> 03:11.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Affordable Care Act,
it's very concerning.

03:11.433 --> 03:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know patients are concerned,
particularly patients who
had chronic diseases that now

03:18.333 --> 03:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're able to get
medications for, or patients
who need annual screening.

03:23.633 --> 03:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONNIE SUE MAHON, West Virginia:
I have got a head injury.

03:25.133 --> 03:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have got a sleeping disorder.

03:26.766 --> 03:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have got back problems.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have got knee problems.

03:30.133 --> 03:35.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have panic attacks.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Connie Sue Mahon.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We need the medical.

03:40.266 --> 03:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they take it, it's
going to hurt a lot of
families in West Virginia.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President Trump promised
us a better plan.

03:48.133 --> 03:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we all voted to get him
in there because we thought
he'd do this country better.

03:51.200 --> 03:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But if we ain't got that
medical, we won't have nothing.

03:55.166 --> 03:56.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's how people
in Mingo County live.

03:56.666 --> 03:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JERINEL TAYLOR, West Virginia:
My name is Jerinel Taylor.

03:58.633 --> 04:00.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm 58 years old.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I have diabetes.

04:01.933 --> 04:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to have the medication
to keep the diabetes down.

04:05.766 --> 04:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you don't, you lose your
eyes, your kidneys, and all this
stuff, so I try to keep up with

04:11.233 --> 04:13.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

04:13.233 --> 04:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I started receiving the Medicaid
after the Obamacare, the
Affordable Care Act, or whatever

04:15.800 --> 04:17.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it was called.

04:17.933 --> 04:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With the care I receive here,
my numbers have come down, my
blood pressure, and they keep

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everything pretty much took
care of for me, the mammograms
and all the cancer screenings

04:26.600 --> 04:28.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that I need.

04:28.666 --> 04:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Affordable Care Act has helped
me, but it has hurt other
people, especially people like

04:31.533 --> 04:32.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my brother.

04:32.533 --> 04:33.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's hurt him.

04:33.533 --> 04:35.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he works hard.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they take it out
of his taxes because he
doesn't have insurance.

04:37.300 --> 04:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He can't afford the insurance
under the Affordable Care Act.

04:40.133 --> 04:41.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, it has hurt him.

04:41.933 --> 04:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, if they drop
me, they drop me.

04:44.233 --> 04:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEROME CLINE: Thinking about
the possible changes to the
health care system and the

04:51.600 --> 04:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drive to save money
with Medicaid, I'm
not sure if there's an
accounting of these people

04:57.000 --> 05:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now seeking their primary care
through the E.R.s, when they
can come here and the visit,

05:01.066 --> 05:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and pay a small co-pay, vs.
going to the E.R., and all of
a sudden, it's a $2,000 bill.

05:05.500 --> 05:10.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REBECCA HICKS: About
two years ago, I had
been in the hospital,
like in the mental ward

05:11.666 --> 05:14.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for my mental health
at least 25 times.

05:14.966 --> 05:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now I have hadn't
had to be hospitalized
for over two years,
because of all the doctors

05:22.966 --> 05:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here that has helped me so much.

05:26.133 --> 05:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEROME CLINE: Especially now,
with the drug epidemic around
here, what are we going to

05:30.433 --> 05:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
do with the people who
have found an improved
quality of life, and
they have moved beyond,

05:37.000 --> 05:41.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you know, a life of
addiction, and we have
got them into recovery?

05:41.233 --> 05:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we curtail that
treatment, what potentially
happens to those patients?

05:45.533 --> 05:49.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
VICKI HATFIELD: I would
like to see the Medicaid
expansion continue.

05:49.933 --> 05:54.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I would like to see
also a revision for
some of the premiums.

05:56.866 --> 06:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have some patients who did not
qualify for Medicaid expansion,
but they also could not

06:01.400 --> 06:03.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
afford the premium
and the deductible.

06:03.666 --> 06:05.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think that needs
to be revisited.

06:05.766 --> 06:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there are good parts
to the program, but there are
also some things that do need

06:10.600 --> 06:12.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
improvement.

06:12.633 --> 06:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REBECCA HICKS: I would tell
the politicians that they might
want to think real hard about

06:18.600 --> 06:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it and take a break from it a
little bit until they know more
about it, because what they're

06:23.833 --> 06:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dealing is, if they take
health care away from somebody
that's an addict, they're going

06:30.266 --> 06:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to resort to worser things.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I chose those people.

06:36.800 --> 06:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I put my faith in those people
that they would make this
place better, not take away the

06:45.233 --> 06:47.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
only things that were
helping this area.
