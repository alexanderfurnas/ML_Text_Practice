00:43.610 --> 00:44.478
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.479
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:45.479 --> 00:46.513
ISIS IS BEING BLAMED FOR A

00:46.513 --> 00:47.881
TERROR ATTACK IN ANOTHER PART OF

00:47.881 --> 00:49.283
THE WORLD TODAY, AFGHANISTAN.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.684
THE PRESIDENT OF THAT COUNTRY

00:50.684 --> 00:52.085
SAYS THE EXTREMIST GROUP WAS

00:52.085 --> 00:53.553
RESPONSIBLE FOR A SUICIDE

00:53.553 --> 00:55.155
BOMBING THAT LEFT AT LEAST 33

00:55.155 --> 00:56.023
PEOPLE DEAD AND AN ESTIMATED 100

00:56.023 --> 00:57.691
WOUNDED.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.159
THE ATTACK OCCURRED OUTSIDE A

00:59.159 --> 01:00.327
BANK IN THE EASTERN CITY OF

01:00.327 --> 01:01.662
JALALABAD.

01:01.662 --> 01:02.763
THE VICTIMS HAD GATHERED THERE

01:02.763 --> 01:04.564
TO COLLECT THEIR PAYCHECKS.

01:04.564 --> 01:06.033
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE TALIBAN,

01:06.033 --> 01:07.534
WHICH HAS BEEN AT WAR WITH THE

01:07.534 --> 01:08.902
WESTERN-BACKED GOVERNMENT IN

01:08.902 --> 01:09.770
AFGHANISTAN, ALSO CONDEMNED

01:09.770 --> 01:10.704
TODAY'S ATTACK.

01:10.704 --> 01:13.640
WE'LL HAVE MORE AFTER THE NEWS

01:13.640 --> 01:14.107
SUMMARY.

01:14.107 --> 01:15.208
A SUSPECTED TERROR PLOT IN

01:15.208 --> 01:16.576
AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN FOILED.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.178
AUTHORITIES IN MELBOURNE

01:18.178 --> 01:20.113
ARRESTED FIVE TEENS SAID TO HAVE

01:20.113 --> 01:22.049
BEEN PLANNING AN ATTACK ON

01:22.049 --> 01:24.051
POLICE DURING A WORLD WAR I

01:24.051 --> 01:25.552
COMMEMORATION NEXT WEEK.

01:25.552 --> 01:27.187
THE FIVE TEENS, ALL 18 OR 19

01:27.187 --> 01:28.789
YEARS OLD, ARE ALL DESCRIBED AS

01:28.789 --> 01:31.091
ISIS SYMPATHIZERS.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.826
THERE HAS BEEN A SHARP SPIKE IN

01:32.826 --> 01:34.027
TERROR-RELATED ARRESTS IN

01:34.027 --> 01:34.728
AUSTRALIA IN THE PAST SIX

01:34.728 --> 01:36.763
MONTHS.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.699
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN

01:38.699 --> 01:40.734
STRUCK A MORE CONCILIATORY TONE

01:40.734 --> 01:41.868
TOWARD THE UNITED STATES TODAY.

01:41.868 --> 01:43.637
DURING A TELEVISION INTERVIEW,

01:43.637 --> 01:45.539
HE SAID THE TWO COUNTRIES SHARE

01:45.539 --> 01:47.541
WHAT HE CALLED A COMMON AGENDA.

01:47.541 --> 01:48.642
AND PUTIN SAID RUSSIA IS

01:48.642 --> 01:49.743
PREPARED TO WORK WITH WHOEVER IS

01:49.743 --> 01:50.944
ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

01:50.944 --> 01:52.279
STATES NEXT YEAR.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.547
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO

01:53.547 --> 01:54.915
COUNTRIES HAVE DETERIORATED

01:54.915 --> 01:56.550
SINCE RUSSIA'S ANNEXATION OF

01:56.550 --> 01:57.451
CRIMEA AND THE SUBSEQUENT

01:57.451 --> 01:59.987
SANCTIONS IMPOSED AGAINST IT.

01:59.987 --> 02:01.455
CALIFORNIA TODAY MODIFIED ITS

02:01.455 --> 02:03.357
PROPOSED DROUGHT RESTRICTIONS.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.258
THE STATE'S WATER RESOURCES

02:05.258 --> 02:07.260
CONTROL BOARD SAID THE NEW RULES

02:07.260 --> 02:08.895
WOULD REDUCE CUTS TO COMMUNITIES

02:08.895 --> 02:10.597
THAT HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO SAVE

02:10.597 --> 02:12.132
WATER BUT WOULD INCREASE CUTS ON

02:12.132 --> 02:13.934
MORE WASTEFUL COMMUNITIES.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.602
THE GOAL IS TO HAVE THE NEW

02:15.602 --> 02:17.170
RULES IN PLACE BEFORE SUMMERTIME

02:17.170 --> 02:19.639
WHEN WATER USAGE SPIKES.

02:19.639 --> 02:20.974
A NEW REPORT SAYS THE CATHOLIC

02:20.974 --> 02:22.576
CHURCH IN THE UNITED STATES

02:22.576 --> 02:24.711
SPENT MORE THAN $150 MILLION

02:24.711 --> 02:26.747
DURING A 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDING

02:26.747 --> 02:28.582
LAST SUMMER ON CHILD ABUSE

02:28.582 --> 02:30.250
CASES, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

02:30.250 --> 02:31.218
SUM ON LEGAL SETTLEMENTS WITH

02:31.218 --> 02:33.353
VICTIMS.

02:33.353 --> 02:35.122
IT SAID MOST OF THE ABUSE CASES

02:35.122 --> 02:36.256
OCCURRED FROM THE 1960s TO THE

02:36.256 --> 02:38.592
1980s.

02:38.592 --> 02:42.863
THE CHURCH SPENT THE REST OF THE

02:42.863 --> 02:46.700
MONEY, ALMOST $32 MILLION, WAS

02:46.700 --> 02:47.467
ON WHAT THE CHURCH CALLS "SAFE

02:47.467 --> 02:48.635
ENVIRONMENT" TRAINING PROGRAMS.

02:48.635 --> 02:49.836
TWO WEEKS AFTER A POLICEMAN SHOT

02:49.836 --> 02:51.104
AND KILLED WALTER SCOTT IN NORTH

02:51.104 --> 02:52.372
CHARLESTON, THE LOCAL CHAPTER OF

02:52.372 --> 02:53.907
THE N.A.A.C.P. IS CALLING ON THE

02:53.907 --> 02:54.908
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

02:54.908 --> 02:56.143
INVESTIGATE ALL FATAL SHOOTINGS

02:56.143 --> 02:57.611
BY POLICE IN THAT SOUTH CAROLINA

02:57.611 --> 02:58.412
COMMUNITY DURING THE PAST TWO

02:58.412 --> 02:59.946
DECADES.

02:59.946 --> 03:01.515
THE GROUP CLAIMS AUTHORITIES

03:01.515 --> 03:03.050
THERE DELIBERATELY FILED FALSE

03:03.050 --> 03:04.685
REPORTS AND TAMPERED WITH

03:04.685 --> 03:06.353
EVIDENCE TO PROTECT OFFICERS

03:06.353 --> 03:07.988
INVOLVED IN THE FATAL SHOOTINGS

03:07.988 --> 03:09.456
OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS, WHAT THEY

03:09.456 --> 03:13.093
CALL A "BLUE WALL OF SILENCE."

03:13.093 --> 03:14.628
AND NEARLY 20 REPUBLICAN

03:14.628 --> 03:16.129
PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS ARE IN

03:16.129 --> 03:17.631
NASHUA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, THIS

03:17.631 --> 03:19.032
WEEKEND FOR WHAT THE STATE

03:19.032 --> 03:20.233
REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE CALLS THE

03:20.233 --> 03:21.635
"FIRST IN THE NATION" FORUM.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.170
THE STATE'S ALWAYS INFLUENTIAL

03:23.170 --> 03:24.271
PRIMARY IS NOW A LITTLE LESS

03:24.271 --> 03:27.274
THAN TEN MONTHS AWAY.

03:27.274 --> 03:28.975
AND THERE MAY BE A SCIENTIFIC

03:28.975 --> 03:30.911
EXPLANATION FOR THOSE LOVING

03:30.911 --> 03:32.345
FEELINGS YOU HAVE WHEN YOU LOOK

03:32.345 --> 03:33.947
INTO YOUR DOG'S EYES.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.515
RESEARCHERS IN JAPAN SAY A

03:35.515 --> 03:37.217
CHEMICAL CALLED OXYTOCIN,

03:37.217 --> 03:38.718
SOMETIMES CALLED THE LOVE

03:38.718 --> 03:40.253
HORMONE, IS RELEASED IN YOUR

03:40.253 --> 03:41.888
BRAIN, PROMPTING THOSE GOOD

03:41.888 --> 03:43.457
FEELINGS TO WASH OVER YOU.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.092
IT'S NOT UNREQUITED LOVE.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.860
THE SCIENTISTS SAYS THE DOGS ARE

03:46.860 --> 03:49.563
EXPERIENCING THE SAME CHEMICAL

03:49.563 --> 03:50.864
RELEASE AND PRESUMABLY THE SAME

03:50.864 --> 04:02.742
LOVING FEELINGS.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.144
>> Sreenivasan: TODAY'S BOMBING

04:04.144 --> 04:05.278
IN AFGHANISTAN CAPS A CHAOTIC

04:05.278 --> 04:06.646
WEEK THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE

04:06.646 --> 04:08.448
MUSLIM WORLD.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.117
VIOLENT CONFLICTS ARE NOW RAGING

04:10.117 --> 04:11.818
IN IRAQ, SYRIA AND YEMEN, AND

04:11.818 --> 04:13.687
THE THREAT POSED BY TERROR

04:13.687 --> 04:15.288
GROUPS LIKE ISIS AND AL QAEDA ON

04:15.288 --> 04:16.723
THE ARABIAN PENINSULA SEEMINGLY

04:16.723 --> 04:18.792
ARE INTENSIFYING.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.393
TO HELP US ANALYZE THESE

04:20.393 --> 04:22.028
DEVELOPMENTS, WE ARE JOINED FROM

04:22.028 --> 04:23.463
WASHINGTON BY ANTHONY CORDESMAN

04:23.463 --> 04:24.397
OF THE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND

04:24.397 --> 04:25.699
INTERNATIONAL STUDIES.

04:25.699 --> 04:26.933
MR. CORDESMAN PREVIOUSLY SERVED

04:26.933 --> 04:27.934
IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND WAS

04:27.934 --> 04:29.202
THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE

04:29.202 --> 04:30.403
ASSESSMENT IN THE OFFICE OF THE

04:30.403 --> 04:32.339
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.

04:32.339 --> 04:34.040
IT'S NEARLY 2,000 MILES FROM

04:34.040 --> 04:35.175
DAMASCUS SYRIA TO KABUL,

04:35.175 --> 04:36.510
AFGHANISTAN.

04:36.510 --> 04:37.711
AND VIOLENCE SEEMS TO BE

04:37.711 --> 04:38.712
SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE

04:38.712 --> 04:40.680
REGION.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.082
WHAT'S THE BIGGER PICTURE THAT

04:42.082 --> 04:44.151
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND?

04:44.151 --> 04:45.952
>> I'M AFRAID THAT IS THE BIGGER

04:45.952 --> 04:47.320
PICTURE BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE

04:47.320 --> 04:49.356
WATCHING AND WE HAVE BEEN

04:49.356 --> 04:51.725
WATCHING ALMOST SINCE 2010 IS A

04:51.725 --> 04:55.028
VERY SHARP RISE IN THE NUMBER OF

04:55.028 --> 04:55.896
TERRORIST INCIDENTS.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.731
AND NOW WHAT WE'RE WATCHING IS

04:57.731 --> 05:00.500
CIVIL WAR AND BASICALLY SOME

05:00.500 --> 05:02.335
FORMS OF INSURGENCY.

05:02.335 --> 05:03.069
>> Sreenivasan: WE MENTIONED

05:03.069 --> 05:04.404
THAT SUICIDE BOMBING IN EASTERN

05:04.404 --> 05:05.872
AFGHANISTAN TODAY, THAT THE

05:05.872 --> 05:07.541
PRESIDENT OF THAT COUNTRY BLAMES

05:07.541 --> 05:09.309
ON ISIS.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.544
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS IT THAT ISIS

05:10.544 --> 05:12.946
IS NOW INVOLVED IN AFGHANISTAN?

05:12.946 --> 05:14.781
>> WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL.

05:14.781 --> 05:17.584
I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM IS

05:17.584 --> 05:19.486
IT'S CONVENIENT TO BLAME ISIS IF

05:19.486 --> 05:22.122
YOU'RE TRYING TO NEGOTIATE WITH

05:22.122 --> 05:22.756
THE TALIBAN.

05:22.756 --> 05:25.325
BUT A LOT OF GROUPS HAVE SORT OF

05:25.325 --> 05:28.962
HAD THIS COSMETIC SET OF

05:28.962 --> 05:30.597
ALIGNMENTS WITH THE ISLAMIC

05:30.597 --> 05:32.232
STATE WITHOUT THERE BEING REAL

05:32.232 --> 05:33.366
TIES.

05:33.366 --> 05:34.601
THESE MOVEMENTS ARE GENERALLY

05:34.601 --> 05:36.169
INDEPENDENT.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.804
AND LONG BEFORE ANY OF THESE

05:37.804 --> 05:39.940
ALIGNMENTS OCCURRED,

05:39.940 --> 05:42.209
AFGHANISTAN, FOR EXAMPLE, SAW A

05:42.209 --> 05:44.511
VERY SHARP RISE IN CASUALTIES

05:44.511 --> 05:45.545
LAST YEAR.

05:45.545 --> 05:47.314
THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER RISE THIS

05:47.314 --> 05:48.315
YEAR.

05:48.315 --> 05:50.350
WHAT I THINK WE HAD HOPED FOR IN

05:50.350 --> 05:51.985
TERMS OF A MUCH STRONGER

05:51.985 --> 05:54.354
AFGHAN FORCES, A MUCH

05:54.354 --> 05:55.956
STRONGER AFGHANISTAN GOVERNMENT,

05:55.956 --> 05:57.457
HAS YET TO APPEAR.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.926
THERE CERTAINLY IS NO MORE

05:59.926 --> 06:01.027
STABILITY IN AFGHANISTAN THAN

06:01.027 --> 06:04.364
THERE IS IN YEMEN OR SYRIA OR

06:04.364 --> 06:05.732
IRAQ OR ON THE OTHER AREAS IN

06:05.732 --> 06:06.199
THIS REGION.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.734
>> Sreenivasan: YOU MENTIONED

06:07.734 --> 06:09.636
IRAQ, AND ISIS FORCES ARE NOW

06:09.636 --> 06:11.071
BATTLING GOVERNMENT TROOPS FOR

06:11.071 --> 06:13.340
CONTROL OF RAMADI AND THE

06:13.340 --> 06:15.909
NATION'S LARGEST OIL REFINERY.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.510
WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT THE

06:17.510 --> 06:18.645
EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR BOMBING

06:18.645 --> 06:19.246
CAMPAIGN AGAINST THEM?

06:19.246 --> 06:20.814
>> WE'RE DEALING WITH A

06:20.814 --> 06:22.549
SCATTERED FORCE.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.050
IT ISN'T REALLY DEPENDENT ON A

06:24.050 --> 06:25.952
LOT OF HEAVY EQUIPMENT.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.954
IT CAN EMBED ITSELF IN BUILDINGS

06:27.954 --> 06:29.556
AND CITIES, WHICH MAKES BOMBING

06:29.556 --> 06:31.524
VERY DIFFICULT UNLESS IT'S

06:31.524 --> 06:35.662
SUPPORTED BY GROUND TROOPS.

06:35.662 --> 06:38.565
IN BOTH THE CASE OF RAMADI AND

06:38.565 --> 06:39.866
THE REFINERY THAT IS NOT

06:39.866 --> 06:41.034
SOMETHING WHERE AIR POWER ALONE

06:41.034 --> 06:42.636
CAN BE FULLY EFFECTIVE.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.604
WHERE IT HAS DONE WELL IS

06:44.604 --> 06:45.872
REDUCING THE REVENUES THEY'VE

06:45.872 --> 06:46.840
HAD THROUGH OIL EXPORTS.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.075
IT HAS HAD SOME IMPACT ON

06:49.075 --> 06:51.945
HITTING KEY LEADERSHIP CADRES,

06:51.945 --> 06:54.147
BUT THIS BOMBING CAMPAIGN SO FAR

06:54.147 --> 06:56.783
HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LIMITED AND

06:56.783 --> 06:58.985
IT HAS NOT HAD ANY MAJOR

06:58.985 --> 07:00.954
STRATEGIC IMPACT.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.957
>> Sreenivasan: IF WE TURN OUR

07:03.957 --> 07:07.427
SPOTLIGHT TO YEMEN FOR A SECOND,

07:07.427 --> 07:09.462
YESTERDAY AL QAEDA FORCES SEIZED

07:09.462 --> 07:11.164
DOZENS OF TANKS, ROCKET

07:11.164 --> 07:12.165
LAUNCHERS, SMALL ARMS.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.400
HOW CONCERNING IS THAT GROUP'S

07:13.400 --> 07:14.401
GAINS GIVEN THAT IT WAS

07:14.401 --> 07:15.735
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PARIS

07:15.735 --> 07:17.170
TERRORIST ATTACKS IN JANUARY?

07:17.170 --> 07:18.571
>> WELL, IT IS CONCERNING

07:18.571 --> 07:20.173
BECAUSE IT ALSO IS THE MOVEMENT

07:20.173 --> 07:21.374
WHICH HAS BEEN BEST ORGANIZED IN

07:21.374 --> 07:23.743
TRYING TO LAUNCH ATTACKS AGAINST

07:23.743 --> 07:26.613
THE UNITED STATES.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.115
A REBIRTH OF THAT GROUP,

07:29.115 --> 07:30.450
AL QAEDA IN THE ARABIAN

07:30.450 --> 07:32.886
PENINSULA, IS SERIOUSLY

07:32.886 --> 07:34.054
DANGEROUS.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.055
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT THE

07:35.055 --> 07:37.324
HUMANITARIAN ASPECT OF ALL THIS?

07:37.324 --> 07:38.658
THE MOST RECENT ESTIMATES FROM

07:38.658 --> 07:40.627
THE U.S. AID FOR SYRIA ARE A

07:40.627 --> 07:41.227
GOOD EXAMPLE.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.896
HAS A POPULATION OF A LITTLE

07:42.896 --> 07:44.331
OVER 18 MILLION.

07:44.331 --> 07:45.899
THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE 3.7

07:45.899 --> 07:47.000
MILLION THAT HAVE BEEN DRIVEN

07:47.000 --> 07:50.437
OUT OF THE COUNTRY AS REFUGEES.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.505
MORE THAN FOUR MILLION PEOPLE

07:52.505 --> 07:54.607
ARE SO CAUGHT UP IN THE FIGHTING

07:54.607 --> 07:56.476
THAT THERE'S NO FORM OF AID THAT

07:56.476 --> 07:57.677
CAN REACH THEM.

07:57.677 --> 08:00.313
JUST OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS,

08:00.313 --> 08:02.349
WE'VE SEEN SOMETHING CLOSE TO

08:02.349 --> 08:06.753
THAT BUILDING UP IN YEMEN-- A

08:06.753 --> 08:08.288
BREAKDOWN IN FOOD SUPPLY, IN

08:08.288 --> 08:10.590
BASIC OPERATIONS OF THE ECONOMY,

08:10.590 --> 08:12.425
THE SPREAD OF VIOLENCE

08:12.425 --> 08:15.061
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IN

08:15.061 --> 08:16.730
THE POPULATED AREAS.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.798
SO THE HUMAN COST JUST KEEPS

08:18.798 --> 08:19.499
RISING.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.367
>> Sreenivasan: IF SOMEONE'S

08:20.367 --> 08:21.701
JUST KIND OF OPENING UP THE

08:21.701 --> 08:23.470
PAPER, SO TO SPEAK, OR WATCHING

08:23.470 --> 08:24.738
THIS PROGRAM, CONSIDERING THE

08:24.738 --> 08:26.039
STRING OF HEADLINES THAT THEY'VE

08:26.039 --> 08:27.540
BEEN SEEING ALL WEEK, WHAT

08:27.540 --> 08:28.508
SHOULD THE TAKEAWAY BE?

08:28.508 --> 08:31.044
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY

08:31.044 --> 08:34.180
LONG SET OF STRUGGLES.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.116
IT ISN'T CENTERED IN ONE PLACE.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.951
WE'RE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH

08:37.951 --> 08:41.054
THIS PROBLEM FOR YEARS.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.256
WE'VE ALREADY SAID WE'VE HAD OUR

08:43.256 --> 08:46.493
CHIEF MILITARY WARN US THAT IN

08:46.493 --> 08:49.295
IRAQ IT COULD EASILY BE YEARS

08:49.295 --> 08:51.731
BEFORE MOSUL IS LIBERATED, AND

08:51.731 --> 08:53.299
NO ONE HAS SAID ANYTHING ABOUT

08:53.299 --> 08:56.503
WHEN THIS CONFLICT WILL END IN

08:56.503 --> 08:58.905
SYRIA, END IN YEMEN, END IN

08:58.905 --> 08:59.472
AFGHANISTAN.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.241
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

09:01.241 --> 09:03.510
ANTHONY CORDESMAN JOINING US

09:03.510 --> 09:04.811
FROM WASHINGTON, THANKS SO MUCH.

09:04.811 --> 09:05.712
>> MY PLEASURE.

09:15.522 --> 09:16.856
>> Sreenivasan: WEDNESDAY IS

09:16.856 --> 09:18.324
EARTH DAY, AND PRESIDENT OBAMA

09:18.324 --> 09:19.692
IS EXPECTED TO TRAVEL TO FLORIDA

09:19.692 --> 09:20.894
TO HIGHLIGHT THE ISSUE OF

09:20.894 --> 09:22.996
CLIMATE CHANGE.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.664
TODAY, THOUSANDS GATHERED IN THE

09:24.664 --> 09:26.533
NATION'S CAPITAL FOR A RALLY AND

09:26.533 --> 09:28.601
A FREE CONCERT TO CALL FOR

09:28.601 --> 09:29.669
SWIFTER ACTION TO REDUCE

09:29.669 --> 09:30.770
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.539
THAT'S THE GOAL OF SOME

09:32.539 --> 09:33.873
TEENAGERS IN OREGON, TOO.

09:33.873 --> 09:35.442
THEY'VE TEAMED UP WITH

09:35.442 --> 09:36.643
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWYERS THERE AND

09:36.643 --> 09:37.677
HAVE GONE TO COURT TO TRY TO

09:37.677 --> 09:38.711
COMPEL THE STATE TO DO MORE,

09:38.711 --> 09:40.747
SOONER.

09:40.747 --> 09:41.648
THE NEWSHOUR'S MEGAN THOMPSON

09:41.648 --> 09:42.582
EXPLAINS THEIR NOVEL LEGAL

09:42.582 --> 09:43.383
APPROACH IN TONIGHT'S SIGNATURE

09:43.383 --> 09:49.189
PIECE FROM EUGENE, OREGON.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.156
>> Reporter: A CROWD PARADED

09:50.156 --> 09:51.691
RECENTLY OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE

09:51.691 --> 09:53.193
IN EUGENE, OREGON.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.794
KIDS, TEACHERS, PARENTS-- THERE

09:54.794 --> 09:56.563
WERE EVEN SINGING GRANDMAS-- ALL

09:56.563 --> 09:58.565
HOPING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO WHAT

09:58.565 --> 10:00.400
THIS YOUNG WOMAN WAS DOING

10:00.400 --> 10:03.069
INSIDE.

10:03.069 --> 10:04.604
>> YOUR HONOR, I HAVE COUNSEL

10:04.604 --> 10:06.005
TABLE WITH ME THIS MORNING, THIS

10:06.005 --> 10:06.940
AFTERNOON, KELSEY JULIANA, ONE

10:06.940 --> 10:08.741
OF THE PLAINTIFFS.

10:08.741 --> 10:10.577
>> Reporter: KELSEY JULIANA IS

10:10.577 --> 10:12.312
ONLY 19 YEARS OLD, BUT SHE'S

10:12.312 --> 10:14.247
SUING THE STATE OF OREGON,

10:14.247 --> 10:15.949
CLAIMING IT'S NOT DOING NEARLY

10:15.949 --> 10:17.917
ENOUGH TO STOP CLIMATE CHANGE

10:17.917 --> 10:19.586
AND PREVENT THE EFFECTS IT WILL

10:19.586 --> 10:20.587
HAVE ON HER GENERATION AND THOSE

10:20.587 --> 10:22.322
TO COME.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.257
>> IF THE STATE DOES NOT ACT

10:24.257 --> 10:25.625
NOW, WE ARE FACING IRREVERSIBLE,

10:25.625 --> 10:28.828
CATASTROPHIC CRISES.

10:28.828 --> 10:30.296
>> Reporter: JULIANA, WHO

10:30.296 --> 10:31.831
DELAYED HER FIRST SEMESTER OF

10:31.831 --> 10:33.600
COLLEGE LAST FALL TO PARTICIPATE

10:33.600 --> 10:35.235
IN A CLIMATE WALK ACROSS THE

10:35.235 --> 10:36.669
COUNTRY, HAS BEEN ACTIVE ON THE

10:36.669 --> 10:38.037
ISSUE FOR YEARS.

10:38.037 --> 10:39.739
>> I'VE BEEN DOING CLIMATE

10:39.739 --> 10:41.174
ACTIVISM WORK SINCE FIFTH GRADE,

10:41.174 --> 10:42.775
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT STARTED WITH

10:42.775 --> 10:44.811
ME, YOU KNOW, GETTING MY

10:44.811 --> 10:46.746
FRIENDS, MY SOCCER TEAM TOGETHER

10:46.746 --> 10:48.648
AND SPENDING A DAY MARCHING AND

10:48.648 --> 10:51.184
HOLDING UP SIGNS.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.119
>> Reporter: IN 2011, JULIANA

10:53.119 --> 10:54.988
AND ANOTHER PLAINTIFF TEAMED UP

10:54.988 --> 10:56.756
WITH A LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL

10:56.756 --> 10:58.324
ACTIVIST GROUP, OUR CHILDREN'S

10:58.324 --> 10:59.626
TRUST, TO FILE THE LAWSUIT

10:59.626 --> 11:00.860
AGAINST THE STATE.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.729
JULIANA WAS JUST 15.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.497
BUT IT'S NOT ONLY HER AGE THAT'S

11:04.497 --> 11:06.366
DRAWN ATTENTION TO THIS CASE,

11:06.366 --> 11:08.334
IT'S ALSO THE LEGAL APPROACH

11:08.334 --> 11:13.273
THAT'S BEING USED, ALL STARTED

11:13.273 --> 11:14.641
BY UNIVERSITY OF OREGON LAW

11:14.641 --> 11:18.511
PROFESSOR MARY CHRISTINA WOOD

11:18.511 --> 11:20.046
>> IT WAS REALLY THE MOMENT WHEN

11:20.046 --> 11:21.548
HURRICANE KATRINA HIT AND I

11:21.548 --> 11:22.916
RECOGNIZED THAT CLIMATE CRISIS

11:22.916 --> 11:24.117
HAD NOT BEEN ADDRESSED PROPERLY

11:24.117 --> 11:25.218
BY GOVERNMENT, AND THE CRISIS

11:25.218 --> 11:26.052
WAS WORSENING WITH GREAT

11:26.052 --> 11:27.520
URGENCY.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.289
AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW HAD

11:29.289 --> 11:31.090
LARGELY FAILED TO ADDRESS MANY

11:31.090 --> 11:32.191
OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS

11:32.191 --> 11:33.693
WE FACE.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.961
SO, TO ME, THE PUBLIC TRUST

11:34.961 --> 11:35.662
DOCTRINE WAS THE LOGICAL

11:35.662 --> 11:37.163
RESPONSE.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.665
>> Reporter: THE PUBLIC TRUST

11:38.665 --> 11:40.400
DOCTRINE IS A LEGAL THEORY THAT

11:40.400 --> 11:41.935
ESSENTIALLY SAYS GOVERNMENT

11:41.935 --> 11:43.403
SHOULD HOLD CERTAIN NATURAL

11:43.403 --> 11:44.237
RESOURCES IN TRUST FOR THE

11:44.237 --> 11:45.738
PUBLIC.

11:45.738 --> 11:47.307
IT CAN BE TRACED BACK TO ANCIENT

11:47.307 --> 11:48.107
ROMAN LAW AND ENGLISH COMMON

11:48.107 --> 11:49.509
LAW.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.177
IN THE U.S., IT'S MOSTLY BEEN

11:51.177 --> 11:53.379
USED TO GUARANTEE PUBLIC ACCESS

11:53.379 --> 11:55.582
TO WATERWAYS AND BECAME PART OF

11:55.582 --> 11:57.383
AMERICAN CASE LAW BACK IN THE

11:57.383 --> 11:59.485
1890s IN A SUPREME COURT RULING

11:59.485 --> 12:01.087
THAT PRIVATE DEVELOPERS IN

12:01.087 --> 12:02.622
CHICAGO COULDN'T PREVENT PUBLIC

12:02.622 --> 12:05.191
ACCESS TO LAKE MICHIGAN.

12:05.191 --> 12:07.560
BUT IN THE 1970s, ENVIRONMENTAL

12:07.560 --> 12:09.329
LAWYERS BEGAN ARGUING THAT THE

12:09.329 --> 12:10.964
PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE SHOULD BE

12:10.964 --> 12:12.765
EXTENDED TO OTHER RESOURCES LIKE

12:12.765 --> 12:14.801
WILDLIFE OR EVEN THE AIR, AND

12:14.801 --> 12:16.135
THAT IT SHOULD COMPEL

12:16.135 --> 12:17.236
GOVERNMENTS TO PROTECT THESE

12:17.236 --> 12:19.105
RESOURCES, TOO.

12:19.105 --> 12:20.873
AND NOW, PROFESSOR WOOD SAYS, IT

12:20.873 --> 12:22.342
SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO PROTECT

12:22.342 --> 12:24.277
THE ATMOSPHERE, AS WELL.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.745
>> IT OBVIOUSLY APPLIES TO THE

12:25.745 --> 12:27.013
ATMOSPHERE BECAUSE THE

12:27.013 --> 12:28.247
ATMOSPHERE CONTROLS THE CLIMATE

12:28.247 --> 12:29.482
SYSTEM WE ALL DEPEND ON FOR

12:29.482 --> 12:31.250
SURVIVAL.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.619
>> Reporter: WOOD THOUGHT, IF

12:32.619 --> 12:34.120
THE ATMOSPHERE COULD BE

12:34.120 --> 12:35.722
CONSIDERED A RESOURCE COVERED BY

12:35.722 --> 12:37.423
THE PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE, THEN

12:37.423 --> 12:38.858
MAYBE COURTS COULD FORCE

12:38.858 --> 12:40.226
GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ADDITIONAL

12:40.226 --> 12:41.327
STEPS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS

12:41.327 --> 12:42.762
EMISSIONS.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.464
SHE CALLED HER IDEA "ATMOSPHERIC

12:44.464 --> 12:46.332
TRUST LITIGATION" AND WORKED

12:46.332 --> 12:47.900
WITH WELL-KNOWN CLIMATE

12:47.900 --> 12:49.769
SCIENTIST JAMES HANSEN.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.804
HE SAYS WE NEED TO REDUCE

12:51.804 --> 12:55.208
EMISSIONS BY AT LEAST 6% A YEAR

12:55.208 --> 12:56.743
AND PROPOSED SPECIFIC REMEDIES

12:56.743 --> 12:57.644
LIKE A CARBON TAX TO HELP GET

12:57.644 --> 12:58.911
THERE.

12:58.911 --> 13:00.279
WOOD STARTED GIVING TALKS ABOUT

13:00.279 --> 13:01.247
THE PLAN AND EVENTUALLY WROTE A

13:01.247 --> 13:02.482
BOOK.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.083
>> THE PROBLEM WITH CLIMATE IS

13:04.083 --> 13:06.052
THAT THERE IS MIND-BLOWING

13:06.052 --> 13:07.954
URGENCY, AND WE HAVE NOW

13:07.954 --> 13:09.856
NATURE'S LAWS TO CONTEND WITH.

13:09.856 --> 13:11.891
AND SO, WHAT ATMOSPHERIC TRUST

13:11.891 --> 13:13.192
LITIGATION ASKS IS THAT

13:13.192 --> 13:16.162
GOVERNMENT HAVE A PLAN.

13:16.162 --> 13:17.664
>> AND SO, I HEARD A TALK THAT

13:17.664 --> 13:19.599
MARY WOOD GAVE AT THE UNIVERSITY

13:19.599 --> 13:21.167
OF OREGON ABOUT USING THE PUBLIC

13:21.167 --> 13:23.002
TRUST DOCTRINE TO COMPEL

13:23.002 --> 13:24.470
GOVERNMENTS TO PROTECT OUR

13:24.470 --> 13:25.505
CLIMATE SYSTEM FOR FUTURE

13:25.505 --> 13:27.073
GENERATIONS.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.808
>> Reporter: ENVIRONMENTAL

13:28.808 --> 13:30.643
ATTORNEY JULIA OLSON WAS SO

13:30.643 --> 13:32.211
INSPIRED THAT SHE DECIDED TO PUT

13:32.211 --> 13:34.147
WOOD'S IDEAS INTO PRACTICE.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.915
IN 2010, SHE CO-FOUNDED OUR

13:35.915 --> 13:37.450
CHILDREN'S TRUST, THE GROUP THAT

13:37.450 --> 13:39.419
BACKED JULIANA'S CASE IN OREGON.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.421
BUT IT'S NOT JUST HAPPENING

13:41.421 --> 13:43.289
HERE; KIDS BACKED BY THE GROUP

13:43.289 --> 13:44.924
HAVE BROUGHT LAWSUITS AGAINST

13:44.924 --> 13:46.793
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND IN 14

13:46.793 --> 13:48.127
OTHER STATES, ALTHOUGH THE CASE

13:48.127 --> 13:49.328
IN OREGON HAS GOTTEN THE

13:49.328 --> 13:50.530
FURTHEST ALONG.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.131
AND THE IDEA'S CATCHING ON

13:52.131 --> 14:01.007
GLOBALLY, TOO; SIMILAR LAWSUITS

14:01.007 --> 14:01.874
HAVE BEEN FILED IN UKRAINE,

14:01.874 --> 14:02.875
UGANDA, THE PHILIPPINES AND THE

14:02.875 --> 14:03.976
NETHERLANDS.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.178
IT'S ALL BEEN DONE WITH THE HELP

14:05.178 --> 14:06.279
OF AN ARMY OF ATTORNEYS AND

14:06.279 --> 14:07.313
SCIENTISTS WORKING PRO BONO.

14:07.313 --> 14:08.481
>> WE'RE TRYING TO SPREAD THE

14:08.481 --> 14:09.816
MESSAGE THAT PEOPLE EVERYWHERE,

14:09.816 --> 14:10.983
ALL OVER THE WORLD, HOLD THESE

14:10.983 --> 14:12.185
FUNDAMENTAL, INALIENABLE RIGHTS

14:12.185 --> 14:13.286
TO HAVE THEIR ESSENTIAL NATURAL

14:13.286 --> 14:14.520
RESOURCES PROTECTED FOR

14:14.520 --> 14:15.655
THEMSELVES AND FOR FUTURE

14:15.655 --> 14:16.656
GENERATIONS, FOR THEIR CHILDREN

14:16.656 --> 14:27.467
AND GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.267
>> Reporter: MANY OF THE

14:28.267 --> 14:29.235
LAWSUITS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL

14:29.235 --> 14:30.403
SUIT, HAVE BEEN DISMISSED.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.671
AND WHILE A COUPLE OF STATE

14:31.671 --> 14:32.705
JUDGES HAVE BEEN RECEPTIVE TO

14:32.705 --> 14:33.973
THE IDEA THAT THE PUBLIC TRUST

14:33.973 --> 14:35.174
COULD INCLUDE THE ATMOSPHERE,

14:35.174 --> 14:36.175
NONE HAS FORCED STATE

14:36.175 --> 14:37.043
GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.077
RICHARD STEWART IS A PROFESSOR

14:38.077 --> 14:39.145
OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AT NEW YORK

14:39.145 --> 14:40.113
UNIVERSITY AND EXPLAINED THE

14:40.113 --> 14:41.114
PLAINTIFFS IN OREGON WILL HAVE

14:41.114 --> 14:42.381
AN UPHILL BATTLE, TOO.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.549
>> IT'S AN INTERESTING AND

14:43.549 --> 14:44.917
INTRIGUING IDEA, BUT THERE ARE A

14:44.917 --> 14:46.219
NUMBER OF PROBLEMS.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.553
ONE, IT GOES WAY BEYOND WHAT ANY

14:47.553 --> 14:49.689
STATE COURT HAS DONE THUS FAR.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.225
SECONDLY, THE ATMOSPHERE IS

14:52.225 --> 14:55.094
GLOBAL AND GREENHOUSE GASES MIX

14:55.094 --> 14:58.431
GLOBALLY, SO OREGON CAN BY NO

14:58.431 --> 15:00.399
MEANS SOLVE THE PROBLEM, EVEN

15:00.399 --> 15:03.136
THE PROBLEM IN OREGON.

15:03.136 --> 15:06.372
THE THIRD PROBLEM IS PROVIDING A

15:06.372 --> 15:07.774
REMEDY, AND MANY COURTS IN...

15:07.774 --> 15:09.609
THERE HAVE BEEN CASES BROUGHT IN

15:09.609 --> 15:10.910
OTHER STATES THAT HAVE SAID

15:10.910 --> 15:12.278
"THIS IS REALLY FOR THE

15:12.278 --> 15:13.513
POLITICAL BRANCHES, THIS IS

15:13.513 --> 15:14.614
BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF THE

15:14.614 --> 15:16.516
JUDICIARY TO MANAGE."

15:16.516 --> 15:18.284
>> Reporter: IN FACT, THE

15:18.284 --> 15:19.485
CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE IN OREGON

15:19.485 --> 15:21.354
ORIGINALLY TOSSED OUT JULIANA'S

15:21.354 --> 15:22.688
CASE ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS BASED

15:22.688 --> 15:24.323
ON THAT VERY ARGUMENT.

15:24.323 --> 15:25.992
BUT LAST YEAR, AN OREGON APPEALS

15:25.992 --> 15:27.894
COURT GAVE OUR CHILDREN'S TRUST

15:27.894 --> 15:29.629
ONE OF ITS BIGGEST WINS SO FAR,

15:29.629 --> 15:31.430
ORDERING THE CASE BACK TO THE

15:31.430 --> 15:32.899
LOWER COURT FOR A DECISION ON

15:32.899 --> 15:34.901
THE MERITS.

15:34.901 --> 15:37.537
FOUR YEARS AFTER THE PLAINTIFFS

15:37.537 --> 15:38.905
FILED THEIR LAWSUIT, THEY

15:38.905 --> 15:40.673
FINALLY GOT THEIR DAY IN COURT

15:40.673 --> 15:42.308
ON APRIL 7, HERE AT THE LANE

15:42.308 --> 15:45.211
COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT IN EUGENE.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.813
PEOPLE LINED UP TWO HOURS BEFORE

15:46.813 --> 15:48.447
THE HEARING TO WATCH KELSEY

15:48.447 --> 15:49.615
JULIANA'S CASE AGAINST THE STATE

15:49.615 --> 15:51.450
OF OREGON.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.352
BUT INTERESTINGLY, THE STATE

15:53.352 --> 15:54.921
ITSELF DOESN'T DISPUTE MANY OF

15:54.921 --> 15:55.822
THE BASIC UNDERLYING FACTS OF

15:55.822 --> 15:57.089
THE CASE.

15:57.089 --> 16:00.793
>> THE STATE OF OREGON AGREES

16:00.793 --> 16:01.994
THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A SERIOUS

16:01.994 --> 16:03.362
PROBLEM.

16:03.362 --> 16:04.764
>> Reporter: PAUL GARRAHAN IS AN

16:04.764 --> 16:06.232
ATTORNEY WITH THE OREGON

16:06.232 --> 16:07.433
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND WAS

16:07.433 --> 16:08.601
PART OF THE STATE'S LEGAL TEAM

16:08.601 --> 16:09.936
AT THE HEARING.

16:09.936 --> 16:11.270
THE STATE OF OREGON FOR DECADES

16:11.270 --> 16:12.271
HAS BEEN AN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

16:12.271 --> 16:13.940
LEADER.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.508
OREGON IS ALREADY ONE OF THE

16:15.508 --> 16:17.543
LOWEST GREENHOUSE GAS EMITTERS

16:17.543 --> 16:19.645
IN THE COUNTRY AND IS ABOUT TO

16:19.645 --> 16:20.847
SHUT DOWN ITS ONLY COAL-FIRED

16:20.847 --> 16:22.215
POWER PLANT.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.716
THE STATE EVEN HAS A GLOBAL

16:23.716 --> 16:25.251
WARMING COMMISSION AND IS

16:25.251 --> 16:27.353
ADOPTING A CLEAN FUELS PROGRAM.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.155
GARRAHAN SAYS THE STATE SHARES

16:29.155 --> 16:31.023
MANY OF THE PLAINTIFFS' GOALS,

16:31.023 --> 16:32.825
BUT USING THE PUBLIC TRUST

16:32.825 --> 16:34.660
DOCTRINE TO SUE IN COURT ISN'T

16:34.660 --> 16:35.595
THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT

16:35.595 --> 16:37.063
ACHIEVING THEM.

16:37.063 --> 16:38.998
>> WE THINK THAT AS A

16:38.998 --> 16:40.700
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF DEMOCRATIC

16:40.700 --> 16:42.068
GOVERNMENT, THOSE DECISIONS

16:42.068 --> 16:43.236
SHOULD BE MADE BY THE

16:43.236 --> 16:44.036
LEGISLATURE AND BY THE EXECUTIVE

16:44.036 --> 16:44.937
BRANCH.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.105
>> IT IS THE DUTY OF THE

16:46.105 --> 16:46.873
LEGISLATURE...

16:46.873 --> 16:47.773
>> Reporter: BUT THE PLAINTIFFS

16:47.773 --> 16:49.208
ARGUE THERE'S NO TIME FOR A

16:49.208 --> 16:50.977
DEBATE ABOUT THE ROLE OF VARIOUS

16:50.977 --> 16:52.712
BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT, AND

16:52.712 --> 16:54.780
POINT TO A REPORT ISSUED BY THE

16:54.780 --> 16:56.782
STATE ITSELF SHOWING ITS

16:56.782 --> 16:58.417
PROPOSED PLANS DON'T PUT IT ON

16:58.417 --> 17:00.119
TRACK TO ACHIEVE ITS OWN

17:00.119 --> 17:01.621
EMISSIONS GOALS.

17:01.621 --> 17:02.989
THE PLAINTIFFS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

17:02.989 --> 17:04.590
THE STATE IS TAKING LOTS OF

17:04.590 --> 17:06.025
STEPS TO ADDRESS THIS, BUT THEY

17:06.025 --> 17:07.693
SAY IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.029
>> WELL, WE AGREE THAT THE STATE

17:10.029 --> 17:11.330
CAN DO MORE, AND WE'RE

17:11.330 --> 17:13.165
AGGRESSIVELY PUSHING POLICIES TO

17:13.165 --> 17:14.233
DO MORE.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.468
>> Reporter: JUDGES HAVE SAID,

17:15.468 --> 17:16.769
"I'M A JUDGE, AND IT'S NOT MY

17:16.769 --> 17:19.272
JOB TO TELL DEMOCRATICALLY

17:19.272 --> 17:21.874
ELECTED LEGISLATURES AND STATE

17:21.874 --> 17:24.110
OFFICIALS WHAT TO DO."

17:24.110 --> 17:26.345
HOW DO YOU OVERCOME THAT?

17:26.345 --> 17:27.747
>> IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY SIMPLE.

17:27.747 --> 17:28.681
SO, WE HAVE THREE BRANCHES OF

17:28.681 --> 17:29.515
GOVERNMENT.

17:29.515 --> 17:30.616
IT GOES BACK TO FIFTH GRADE

17:30.616 --> 17:32.051
CIVICS.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.319
AND ONE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT,

17:33.319 --> 17:35.121
THE LEGISLATURE, DOESN'T GET TO

17:35.121 --> 17:37.123
BOTH INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION,

17:37.123 --> 17:38.157
WRITE THE LAWS AND THEN POLICE

17:38.157 --> 17:40.359
THEMSELVES.

17:40.359 --> 17:42.461
THAT WOULD BE A REAL

17:42.461 --> 17:43.529
CONCENTRATION OF POWER IN ONE

17:43.529 --> 17:45.364
BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.566
AND SO, WHAT WE'RE ASKING THE

17:47.566 --> 17:49.035
COURT TO DO IS DO ITS JOB AND

17:49.035 --> 17:50.469
INTERPRETING OUR PUBLIC TRUST

17:50.469 --> 17:52.271
RIGHTS AND THEN ALSO BE THE

17:52.271 --> 17:54.040
POLICE ON THE LEGISLATURE TO

17:54.040 --> 17:55.741
DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS

17:55.741 --> 17:57.176
UPHOLDING ITS DUTY TO MAKE LAWS

17:57.176 --> 17:59.278
THAT PROTECT OUR RIGHTS.

17:59.278 --> 18:00.479
>> Reporter: YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN

18:00.479 --> 18:02.648

18:04.183 --> 18:05.217
KNOW, CALLED THIS A BIT OF A

18:05.217 --> 18:06.419
STRETCH.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.521
WHY KEEP GOING WITH THIS?

18:08.521 --> 18:10.056
>> WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHOICE BUT

18:10.056 --> 18:11.924
TO KEEP GOING, AND I THINK ONE

18:11.924 --> 18:13.392
OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS FOR

18:13.392 --> 18:14.593
PEOPLE TO RECOGNIZE IS THE

18:14.593 --> 18:16.629
URGENCY OF THE CRISIS.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.397
AND IT'S ONLY OUR GENERATION

18:18.397 --> 18:19.932
THAT CAN DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM

18:19.932 --> 18:21.300
AND STOP THE IRREVERSIBLE

18:21.300 --> 18:23.069
IMPACTS THAT WE'RE CAUSING.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.403
>> Reporter: OLSON AND HER TEAM

18:24.403 --> 18:25.438

SLOWING DOWN.

18:26.539 --> 18:27.840

18:27.840 --> 18:29.575
STATE LAWSUITS AND ANOTHER

18:29.575 --> 18:31.210
FEDERAL LAWSUIT, AND NEW

18:31.210 --> 18:32.411
LAWSUITS ARE ALSO EXPECTED IN

18:32.411 --> 18:33.946
INDIA AND PAKISTAN.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.715
THE JUDGE IN OREGON SAYS HE WILL

18:35.715 --> 18:37.083
MAKE HIS RULING IN THE NEXT

18:37.083 --> 18:40.953
COUPLE OF MONTHS.

18:40.953 --> 18:41.887

18:41.887 --> 18:45.091
RULE IN OUR FAVOR.

18:45.091 --> 18:46.492
I HOPE THAT HE WILL LOOK ME IN

18:46.492 --> 18:48.260
THE EYE AND UNDERSTAND THAT, YOU

18:48.260 --> 18:52.198
KNOW, I AM RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

ACCEPTING PRIVATE INSURANCE OR

ACCEPT PATIENTS WHO PAY CASH.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.487
THAT MEANS MANY, INCLUDING THOSE

19:27.299 --> 19:28.534
SCENARIO OF SOMEONE WHO HAD AN

19:28.534 --> 19:30.302
APPOINTMENT TO SEE A DOCTOR, RAN

19:30.302 --> 19:31.037
OUT OF MEDS BEFORE THEN, WHAT

19:31.037 --> 19:31.570
HAPPENED?

19:31.570 --> 19:32.638
>> WELL, BASICALLY HIS MOTHER

19:32.638 --> 19:34.140
HAD BEEN TRYING FOR MONTHS TO

19:34.140 --> 19:36.275
GET THIS MAN, WHO IS IN HIS

19:36.275 --> 19:37.276
30s, WHO HAD BEEN HEARING

19:37.276 --> 19:39.345
VOICES, HAVING PARANOIA,

19:39.345 --> 19:40.513
THINKING THERE WERE DRONES

19:40.513 --> 19:41.947
FLYING OVERHEAD, THE C.I.A. WAS

19:41.947 --> 19:43.015
IN HIS APARTMENT.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.483
EVERYONE KNEW SOMETHING WAS

19:44.483 --> 19:44.917
WRONG.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.619
HE HAD BEEN HOSPITALIZED AND IN

19:46.619 --> 19:48.020
THE THE EMERGENCY ROOM BUT THE

19:48.020 --> 19:49.455
FAMILY SAYS THEY JUST COULDN'T

19:49.455 --> 19:50.923
GET HIM AN APPOINTMENT WITH A

19:50.923 --> 19:53.392
PSYCHIATRIST IN TIME TO KEEP HIM

19:53.392 --> 19:55.261
ON THE MEDICATION HE NEEDED.

19:55.261 --> 19:56.629
EITHER DOCTORS DIDN'T TAKE THEIR

19:56.629 --> 19:57.930
INSURANCE.

19:57.930 --> 19:58.931
THEY WOULDN'T RETURN THEIR

19:58.931 --> 20:00.800
CALLS, THEY HAD MONTHS-LONG WAIT

20:00.800 --> 20:02.635
OR THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SEE HIM.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.503
HE WAS A TOUGH PATIENT WITH A

20:04.503 --> 20:05.604
HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE,

20:05.604 --> 20:06.772
PARANOIA.

20:06.772 --> 20:08.107
HE WAS A DIFFICULT CASE.

20:08.107 --> 20:11.510
DOCTORS PREFER AN EASIER CASE.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.412
AFTER ALL OF THIS, HIS MOTHER,

20:13.412 --> 20:15.014
HIS FRIENDS, HIS FAMILY TRYING

20:15.014 --> 20:16.282
THEY FINALLY DID GET HIM AN

20:16.282 --> 20:17.349
APPOINTMENT AND THE MEDICATION

20:17.349 --> 20:18.084
RAN OUT.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.186
AND IT ENDED VERY TRAGICALLY, HE

20:20.186 --> 20:22.321
MURDERED HIS MOTHER WITH A

20:22.321 --> 20:24.356
KITCHEN KNIFE, AND EVERYBODY IN

20:24.356 --> 20:26.659
THE AFTERMATH WAS SAYING HOW

20:26.659 --> 20:27.960
COULD SOMETHING LIKE THIS

20:27.960 --> 20:28.627
HAPPEN?

20:28.627 --> 20:30.830

20:30.830 --> 20:32.731
SUPPORT, IN A SUBURB OF NEW YORK

20:32.731 --> 20:34.667
CITY, NOT BE ABLE TO GET HELP?

20:34.667 --> 20:36.168
AND ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS IS

20:36.168 --> 20:37.803
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH A LIMITED

20:37.803 --> 20:38.871
NUMBER OF DOCTORS WILLING TO

20:38.871 --> 20:40.372
TAKE THE HARD CASES AND TAKE

20:40.372 --> 20:42.408
PEOPLE WITH INSURANCE.

20:45.211 --> 20:46.445
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

20:46.445 --> 20:47.947
CYCLES THAT ARE AT WORK HERE.

20:47.947 --> 20:47.847
IT'S NOT JUST THE DOCTOR'S

20:47.847 --> 20:48.714
FAULT.

20:48.714 --> 20:51.117
IT'S REALLY THE SUPPLY, THE

20:51.117 --> 20:53.319
DEMAND, THE WHOLE SYSTEM SEEMS

20:53.319 --> 20:54.220
STACKED AGAINST SOMEONE LIKE

20:54.220 --> 20:54.920
THIS GETTING THE CARE.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.522
>> AND DOCTORS SAY WE'RE JUST

20:56.522 --> 20:58.657
NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH IT.

20:58.657 --> 20:59.525
THERE'S ENOUGH DEMAND FROM

20:59.525 --> 21:01.127
PEOPLE WHO WILL PAY CASH SO

21:01.127 --> 21:02.628
WE'LL JUST FOCUS ON THOSE

21:02.628 --> 21:04.230
PATIENTS.

21:04.230 --> 21:05.097
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY SAYS

21:05.097 --> 21:07.099
THEIR JOB IS TO GET THE BEST

21:07.099 --> 21:08.367
VALUE FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS, WHICH

21:08.367 --> 21:09.235
IS THE PATIENT.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.903
YOU KNOW, THEY-- IF THEY HAVE TO

21:10.903 --> 21:11.971
PAY DOCTORS MORE, THEY'RE GOING

21:11.971 --> 21:12.805
TO HAVE TO INCREASE CO-PAYS AND

21:12.805 --> 21:14.507
PREMIUMS.

21:14.507 --> 21:15.808
NO ONE WANTS TO PAY FOR HEALTH

21:15.808 --> 21:16.709
CARE THESE DAYS.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.777
EVERYONE WANTS TO CONTROL COSTS.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.980
SO THE INSURERS SAY THEY'RE

21:20.980 --> 21:22.081
TRYING TO DO WHAT IS IN THE BEST

21:22.081 --> 21:20.679
INTEREST OF THEIR CLIENTS.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.749
LARGER PICTURE INFLUENCE?

21:23.749 --> 21:25.384
HOW DID THE RECESSION PLAY INTO

21:25.384 --> 21:26.185
THIS?

21:26.185 --> 21:28.120
OR HOW DID OBAMACARE OR THE

21:28.120 --> 21:29.455
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PLAY INTO

21:29.455 --> 21:30.823
THIS?

21:30.823 --> 21:32.992
>> $4 BILLION GOT CUT FROM STATE

21:32.992 --> 21:34.460
MENTAL HEALTH BUDGETS DURING THE

21:34.460 --> 21:35.361
RECESSION.

21:35.361 --> 21:36.529
THAT'S MONEY THAT GOES TO

21:36.529 --> 21:37.930
SUPPORT COMMUNITY CLINICS THAT

21:37.930 --> 21:39.131
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE SAFETY

21:39.832 --> 21:41.000
ON THE OBAMACARE FRONT,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.968
OBAMACARE DID TRY TO ADDRESS

21:42.968 --> 21:44.937
THIS ISSUE, REQUIRING INSURERS

21:44.937 --> 21:46.172
TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH

21:46.172 --> 21:49.341
SERVICES, NOT JUST MEDICAL

21:49.341 --> 21:50.309
SERVICES.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.744
BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU MIGHT

21:51.744 --> 21:53.212
HAVE INSURANCE BUT CAN'T FIND A

21:53.212 --> 21:54.246
DOCTOR WHO WILL TAKE YOUR

21:54.246 --> 21:55.014
INSURANCE.

21:55.014 --> 21:55.848
OR --

21:55.848 --> 21:56.982
>> BECAUSE IT DIDN'T ADD 1,000

21:56.982 --> 21:58.184
NEW PSYCHIATRISTS INTO THE

21:58.184 --> 21:58.851
SYSTEM.

21:58.851 --> 21:59.685
>> AND THERE ARE SOME

21:59.685 --> 22:01.921
INDICATIONS THAT THE OBAMACARE

22:01.921 --> 22:03.389
INSURANCE PLANS PAY DOCTORS EVEN

22:03.389 --> 22:04.957
LESS THAN OTHER PRIVATE

22:04.957 --> 22:06.292
INSURANCE PLANS SO DOCTORS ARE

22:06.292 --> 22:08.260
EVEN LESS LIKELY TO TAKE THE

22:08.260 --> 22:09.428
PLANS SOLD ON THE OBAMACARE

22:09.428 --> 22:10.529
EXCHANGE.

22:10.529 --> 22:11.263
>> Sreenivasan: SHANNON

22:11.263 --> 22:12.097
PETTYPIECE, FROM BLOOMBERG NEWS,

22:12.097 --> 22:12.765
THANKS SO MUCH.

22:12.765 --> 22:13.799
>> THANK YOU.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.603
>>THIS IS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND,

22:17.603 --> 22:18.938
SATURDAY.

22:22.575 --> 22:23.209

22:23.209 --> 22:24.543
"VIEWERS LIKE YOU," YOUR CHANCE

22:24.543 --> 22:26.045
TO COMMENT ON SOME OF OUR RECENT

22:26.045 --> 22:26.979
WORK.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.514
MANY OF YOU WROTE US ABOUT LAST

22:28.514 --> 22:30.416
WEEKEND'S SIGNATURE PIECE FROM

22:30.416 --> 22:32.184
HAWAII EXPLORING THAT STATE'S

22:32.184 --> 22:33.686
DIFFICULTIES IMPLEMENTING SOLAR

22:33.686 --> 22:34.553
POWER.

22:34.553 --> 22:35.487
SOME RESIDENTS THERE SPENT

22:35.487 --> 22:36.855
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON SOLAR

22:36.855 --> 22:38.824
PANELS, ONLY TO BE TOLD BY THE

22:38.824 --> 22:41.126
LOCAL UTILITY COMPANY NOT TO

22:41.126 --> 22:42.895
TURN ON THE SWITCH BECAUSE THE

22:42.895 --> 22:44.430
POWER THEY WOULD GENERATE MIGHT

22:44.430 --> 22:46.131
OVERWHELM THE SYSTEM.

22:46.131 --> 22:48.601
MIKEATHINKER HAD THIS TO SAY:

22:48.601 --> 22:50.002
"THE ROOFTOP SOLAR INDUSTRY MADE

22:50.002 --> 22:51.870
A BAD ASSUMPTION THAT THEY COULD

22:51.870 --> 22:53.739
JUST SHOVE ALL THE ROOFTOP-

22:53.739 --> 22:55.307
GENERATED POWER BACK UP THE GRID

22:55.307 --> 22:56.408
AT ANY TIME AND EVERYTHING WOULD

22:56.408 --> 22:58.143
BE SWEETNESS AND BUTTERFLIES.

22:58.143 --> 22:59.612
AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED EARLY IN

22:59.612 --> 23:01.380
MY CAREER IN THE POWER INDUSTRY,

23:01.380 --> 23:03.048
THAT IS DECIDEDLY NOT HOW IT

23:03.048 --> 23:04.917
WORKS, AND THE SYSTEM IS LARGELY

23:04.917 --> 23:06.552
NOT READY FOR THAT KIND OF

23:06.552 --> 23:08.754
'BACKFLOW,' PARTICULARLY BECAUSE

23:08.754 --> 23:10.356
IT IS SO ERRATIC AND

23:10.356 --> 23:11.657
UNRELIABLE."

23:11.657 --> 23:13.492
MIKE LEE TOOK ISSUE WITH THOSE

23:13.492 --> 23:14.960
WHO HAD MADE THE SWITCH TO

23:14.960 --> 23:16.895
SOLAR: "THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS

23:16.895 --> 23:18.297
WHEN YOU HAVE TOO MANY LIBERALS

23:18.297 --> 23:20.165
LIVING IN THE SAME PLACE."

23:20.165 --> 23:22.167
CANDID ONE WARNED: "THE U.S.

23:22.167 --> 23:24.203
DOESN'T HAVE MUCH LEEWAY TOWARD

23:24.203 --> 23:26.205
AN ENHANCED GRID OPTION.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.040
HAWAII'S EXAMPLE IS SCHOOL

23:28.040 --> 23:28.874
TIME."

23:28.874 --> 23:30.943
PROUDLIBERALAMERICAN HAD SOME

23:30.943 --> 23:32.578
ADVICE: "BETTER THAT THESE

23:32.578 --> 23:34.580
PRODUCERS STAY ON THE GRID AND

23:34.580 --> 23:36.515
CONTINUE TO PAY A SMALL CHARGE

23:36.515 --> 23:38.851
TO HELP MAINTAIN IT AND HAVE THE

23:38.851 --> 23:41.086
EXCESS THEY PRODUCE OFFSET THIS

23:41.086 --> 23:42.955
COST AND PROVIDE POWER TO HELP

23:42.955 --> 23:44.923
REPLACE OUTDATED, INEFFICIENT

23:44.923 --> 23:46.892
AND POLLUTING CENTRALIZED POWER

23:46.892 --> 23:47.793
PLANTS."

23:47.793 --> 23:49.695
SHANE ALGARIN ADDED: "ANYBODY

23:49.695 --> 23:51.630
WHO REMEMBERS ENRON, THE RIGGING

23:51.630 --> 23:53.132
OF ELECTRICITY MARKETS,

23:53.132 --> 23:54.833
ARTIFICIAL BLACKOUTS, PEOPLE

23:54.833 --> 23:55.801
DYING BECAUSE THEIR MEDICAL

23:55.801 --> 23:56.969
EQUIPMENT DEPENDED ON

23:56.969 --> 23:59.204
ELECTRICITY, KNOWS WHY IT'S GOOD

23:59.204 --> 24:01.307
TO ESCAPE THE TENTACLES OF THE

24:01.307 --> 24:02.408
UTILITIES."

24:26.198 --> 24:27.800
AND PALESTINIAN OFFICIALS HAS

24:27.800 --> 24:29.001
BEEN RESOLVED.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.381
MINI COOPERS BECAUSE OF A DEFECT

24:42.381 --> 24:43.182
