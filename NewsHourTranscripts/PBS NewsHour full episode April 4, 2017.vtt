some advertisers pull away from
the scandal-plagued
network.

00:28.896 --> 00:34.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

the country
to allow classroom cameras to
protect students

00:34.635 --> 00:38.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with disabilities, but legal and

SAMANTHA CRANE, Autistic Self

Parents can't get access to that
footage unless

00:42.276 --> 00:44.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they know something's happened.

00:44.077 --> 00:48.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have to be able to say, I
would like
footage from this day, and
ideally from this

00:48.548 --> 00:50.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
particular time of the day.

00:50.250 --> 00:57.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Senate formally
opened debate today on Supreme

01:10.604 --> 01:14.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Neil Gorsuch, and headed toward
a bruising
battle.

01:14.608 --> 01:19.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans said they will
change the rules
to permit a simple majority to
confirm Gorsuch

01:19.813 --> 01:24.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if they can't come up with what
is called
cloture, the 60 votes necessary
to close off

01:24.985 --> 01:26.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a Democratic filibuster.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.821 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:27.854 --> 01:30.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority

appears as if cloture will not
be invoked,

01:30.424 --> 01:33.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but we will find out on
Thursday.

01:33.927 --> 01:38.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: Senator
McConnell would have the world
believe that

01:43.070 --> 01:48.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his hands are tied, that the
only option after
Judge Gorsuch doesn't earn 60
votes is to

01:48.909 --> 01:52.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
break the rules to change the
rules.

01:52.179 --> 01:54.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That could not be further from
the truth.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Only three Senate

Obamacare.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The original effort collapsed

we're throwing around concepts

the bill.

02:26.213 --> 02:29.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's occurring right now, but
that is not
to say that we're ready to go,
because we

02:29.116 --> 02:33.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to make that, when we go,
we have the
votes to pass this bill, we have
got the consensus

02:33.053 --> 02:34.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we have long been looking
for.

02:34.921 --> 02:39.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House
proposal would
let states seek exemptions from

federal officials over police
reforms.

03:09.489 --> 03:14.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, federal officials
sought to delay
final approval of an agreement
known as a

03:14.327 --> 03:15.729 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
consent decree.

03:15.762 --> 03:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

the city's police force, with or
without the
U.S. Department of Justice.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Police Commissioner Kevin Davis:

03:35.615 --> 03:39.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN DAVIS: I am disappointed
that the Department
of Justice thought it was
necessary to seek

03:39.686 --> 03:40.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a 90-day extension.

03:40.687 --> 03:43.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The reforms are going to come no

hearing set for this Thursday on
the proposed
Baltimore decree.

03:53.100 --> 03:58.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice officials said they want
to review
and assess how it fits with an
aggressive

03:58.505 --> 04:02.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new emphasis by the Trump
administration on
fighting crime.

LORETTA LYNCH, Former U.S.

The Department of Justice and
the city of

04:04.544 --> 04:08.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Baltimore have agreed to enter
into a court-enforceable
consent decree.

04:08.982 --> 04:14.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The decree was
announced just
before President Obama left
office, and almost

04:14.688 --> 04:22.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two years after the death of a
black man,
Freddie Gray, in police custody,
and the resulting

04:22.362 --> 04:24.731 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
unrest.

04:24.764 --> 04:30.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama Justice Department
found longstanding
patterns of racial profiling and
excessive

04:30.670 --> 04:32.472 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
force by police.

04:32.506 --> 04:37.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the new attorney general,
Jeff Sessions,
has ordered a sweeping review,
not just of

04:37.944 --> 04:45.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Baltimore agreement, but of
Justice Department
interactions with local law
enforcement nationwide.

04:45.252 --> 04:50.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Russia, investigators now say
a suicide

subway attack

04:50.557 --> 04:53.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that killed 14 people in St.
Petersburg.

04:53.393 --> 04:56.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

man.

04:56.429 --> 05:01.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's identified as a native of

a majority-Muslim state in
Central Asia.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's been no claim of
responsibility.

05:33.400 --> 05:37.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
names of people involved in the
Trump transition,
the Trump campaign, people
surrounding the

05:37.537 --> 05:41.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president-elect in order to spy
on them, in
order to expose them?

05:41.575 --> 05:42.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN RICE, Former U.S. National
Security
Adviser: Absolutely not.

05:42.976 --> 05:46.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%

ANDREA MITCHELL: Did you leak
the name of
Mike Flynn?

05:48.915 --> 05:52.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN RICE: I leaked nothing to
nobody, and
never have and never would.

07:21.975 --> 07:27.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

08:38.618 --> 08:41.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suburb, killing hundreds of
civilians.

08:41.488 --> 08:45.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The U.N. said the nerve agent
sarin was used.

08:45.091 --> 08:51.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2012, President Obama had
declared the
use of chemical weapons in Syria
a red line

08:51.598 --> 08:57.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that could trigger U.S.
airstrikes, but after
the 2013 attack, then-Secretary
of State John

08:57.904 --> 09:05.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kerry instead struck a deal with
Russia for
Syria to surrender its chemical
arsenal.

09:05.145 --> 09:08.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
International inspectors said
Damascus complied.

09:08.648 --> 09:13.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's strike comes on the eve
of a conference
in Brussels about Syria's future
and it drew

09:13.386 --> 09:15.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sharp condemnation.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FEDERICA MOGHERINI, Foreign
Policy Chief,
European Union: Chemical weapons
is the worst

09:17.690 --> 09:22.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the war crimes, and whoever
is responsible
for that must be held
accountable.

09:22.796 --> 09:27.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: For his part,
President Trump
said in a statement: "These
heinous actions

09:27.834 --> 09:34.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the Bashar al-Assad regime
are a consequence
of the past administration's
weakness and

09:34.140 --> 09:35.909 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
irresolution."

09:35.942 --> 09:41.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House spokesman
wouldn't discuss
a possible U.S. response, but he
did say ousting

09:41.281 --> 09:45.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Assad regime is no longer --
quote -- "a
fundamental option."

09:45.418 --> 09:50.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the U.N. Security
Council has scheduled
an emergency meeting for
tomorrow.

09:50.557 --> 09:53.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

09:53.993 --> 09:59.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Late today,
Secretary of State
Rex Tillerson said in a
statement that Syria's

09:59.766 --> 10:05.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allies, Russia and Iran, bear --
quote -- "great
moral responsibility" for those
killed in

10:05.104 --> 10:10.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today's attack, and he called on
those nations
to restrain the Assad regime.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For more on this, I'm joined by
Andrew Tabler.

10:12.846 --> 10:16.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a fellow at the Washington
Institute
for Near East Policy.

10:16.382 --> 10:18.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a think tank.

10:18.084 --> 10:22.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Susannah Sirkin, she's the
director of
international policy and
partnerships and

10:22.388 --> 10:25.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
senior adviser at Physicians for
Human Rights.

10:25.859 --> 10:31.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a group that specializes in
documenting
human rights abuses and
atrocities.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Susannah Sirkin, I'm going to
start with you.

10:34.801 --> 10:38.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there more you can tell us at
this point
about what happened in this
attack?

10:38.438 --> 10:42.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSANNAH SIRKIN, Physicians for
Human Rights:
Well, today, at Physicians for
Human Rights,

10:42.675 --> 10:48.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have had physicians view
dozens of photographs
and video clips to try to
understand what

10:48.648 --> 10:50.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
exactly has happened.

10:50.617 --> 10:56.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have had contact with a
number of doctors
on the front lines trying
desperately to treat

10:56.422 --> 11:00.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those who are injured, as well
as to deal
with those who apparently have
been killed

11:00.727 --> 11:02.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as a result of this attack.

11:02.996 --> 11:09.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that the medical system,
such as it
is, which has already been
devastated by more

11:09.235 --> 11:16.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than almost seven years of war,
has been responding
as best it can, but it is
really, as far as

11:16.376 --> 11:21.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we can tell, a situation of
chaos and desperation.

11:21.180 --> 11:29.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These kinds of weapons are
terrifying inherently
because they have no smell, they
have no -- they

11:29.422 --> 11:30.390 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
aren't seen.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have no taste.

11:32.559 --> 11:38.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they are detonated
essentially in a way
that is invisible, and then, all
of a sudden,

11:38.431 --> 11:40.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people succumb.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's severely painful.

11:42.702 --> 11:52.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many people who are attacked in
this way result
-- end up having nerve damage,
as well as

11:52.946 --> 11:57.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
muscular constriction, and in
the end, they
can't breathe at all.

11:57.083 --> 12:00.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they are rushed to the
hospital, and it's
really quite desperate.

12:00.386 --> 12:03.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I know that
work is still
being done to try to determine
what kind of

12:03.656 --> 12:05.458 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
chemical.

12:05.491 --> 12:10.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Andrew Tabler, is it clear or
even close to
being known at this point who
exactly was

12:10.263 --> 12:11.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behind this?

12:12.031 --> 12:13.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW TABLER, Fellow,
Washington Institute
for Near East Policy: Well, it
was behind

12:13.433 --> 12:17.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the opposition's lines, so it
seemed to be
delivered from the air.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So then that begs the question,
well, who
has air capabilities?

12:19.806 --> 12:20.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The opposition doesn't.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it would be the Assad regime
or the Russians.

12:24.744 --> 12:29.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in that case, I think that
most of the
initial indicators are pointing
at the Assad

12:29.449 --> 12:31.250 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
regime.

12:31.284 --> 12:35.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that then will, of course,
focus attention
on the Assad regime's activities
in the last

12:35.922 --> 12:37.790 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
few days.

12:37.824 --> 12:40.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And as we just
heard in Margaret
Warner's report, though, the
international

12:40.426 --> 12:44.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inspectors said just a few years
ago that
they had determined that the
Assad regime

12:44.764 --> 12:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had given up at least some of
their chemical
weapons.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDREW TABLER: That's right.

12:49.502 --> 12:53.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But -- but, at the end of the
process, there
was a concern about Syria's
declaration.

12:53.873 --> 12:56.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, a couple things to look for
in the coming
days.

12:57.010 --> 13:00.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they find that it was sarin
that was used,
which it initially seems from
the symptoms

13:00.713 --> 13:04.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it was, that that begs the
question,
well, where did it come from?

13:04.584 --> 13:09.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If all of the stockpiles were
destroyed, how
did this sarin enter -- if it's
found to be

13:09.155 --> 13:12.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chlorine, which is an industrial
chemical,
would they have been using for
years, then

13:12.659 --> 13:14.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's another matter.

13:14.494 --> 13:18.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Syrian regime has been
using -- has
been found to have carried out
chemical attacks

13:18.865 --> 13:22.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Syria multiple times since
the chemical
weapons deal.

13:22.268 --> 13:24.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is just one of the most
egregious.

13:24.203 --> 13:29.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Susannah
Sirkin, is it
-- from the symptoms, is it
possible to determine

13:29.642 --> 13:31.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what the chemical agent was?

13:31.577 --> 13:36.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSANNAH SIRKIN: Well, so far,
from everything
that Physicians for Human Rights
has seen

13:36.549 --> 13:43.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and observed through these
videos and photographs,
all of the symptoms that are
known to be associated

13:43.656 --> 13:52.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the use of sarin, which is
a banned nerve
agent, have been seen, foaming
at the mouth,

13:52.832 --> 14:00.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fluid coming from the nostrils,
severe respiratory
distress, muscular constriction,
seizures

14:00.139 --> 14:01.874 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and so forth.

14:01.908 --> 14:08.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, while we cannot say
definitively that
sarin was used, everything is
pointing to

14:08.614 --> 14:16.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a nerve agent and very likely
sarin, because
we know that sarin has been used
before by

14:16.422 --> 14:18.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Assad regime.

14:18.458 --> 14:23.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What would need to happen next
and what we're
calling for is an immediate
independent international

14:24.030 --> 14:30.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigation on the ground to
collect samples,
which would involve collecting
blood, urine,

14:30.269 --> 14:34.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and clothing and soil samples,
to have a definitive
conclusion.

14:34.240 --> 14:40.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And beyond that,
Andrew Tabler,
as you said, the signs point to
the Assad

14:40.379 --> 14:42.115 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
regime.

14:42.148 --> 14:47.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does anyone involved in this
get to the
bottom of determining
definitively whether

14:47.787 --> 14:49.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it was the Assad regime?

14:49.756 --> 14:53.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW TABLER: Well, there is a
joint investigative
mechanism that was put in place
by the United

14:53.426 --> 14:56.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nations years ago to investigate
these attacks.

14:56.162 --> 15:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have found that the
Assad regime
has used chemical agents on
multiple occasions.

15:00.366 --> 15:03.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I anticipate that that would be
used.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The question is, is it enough?

15:05.037 --> 15:06.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And in the past...

15:06.239 --> 15:07.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean is this
investigation
enough?

15:07.940 --> 15:09.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW TABLER: Yes, is this
investigation
enough?

15:09.242 --> 15:11.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is this method enough?

15:11.077 --> 15:15.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that -- in the past,
activists
and others have brought out
samples that have

15:15.615 --> 15:19.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
helped investigators looking
into these matters,
determine what was used, and
then determine

15:19.252 --> 15:21.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on a course of action.

15:21.053 --> 15:23.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, just staying
with you,
Andrew Tabler, today, we heard
an opposition

15:23.456 --> 15:28.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leader say that what happened,
in his words,
essentially a direct consequence
of what the

15:28.828 --> 15:34.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump administration has been
saying in the
past few days, that it was going
to be that

15:34.600 --> 15:37.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were prepared to live with
the Assad
regime.

15:38.004 --> 15:42.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, you have
President Trump
in his statement blaming it on
the failed

15:42.108 --> 15:43.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
policies of President Obama.

15:44.010 --> 15:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW TABLER: Well, in the
balance, first
of all, the Assad regime has
been using chemical

15:47.747 --> 15:49.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
agents since 2013.

15:49.582 --> 15:55.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, overall, I think, to be
fair, the Trump
administration was dealt a
pretty terrible

15:55.855 --> 15:58.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syria hand by the previous
administration.

15:58.424 --> 16:01.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I think the real question
here is, what
do you do going forward?

16:01.561 --> 16:05.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And tomorrow we're going to know
from action
at the U.N.

16:05.264 --> 16:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we're going to have to look
at the fact
that, while we hope the Syrian
war is winding

16:10.136 --> 16:14.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down, it doesn't seem to be when
we have attacks
like this, and that the
political settlement

16:14.040 --> 16:18.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we all want in Syria, the
whole country
political settlement, seems far
off.

16:18.177 --> 16:21.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We are going to
leave it there.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What a horrific event that's
taken place.

16:24.116 --> 16:29.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Andrew Tabler, Susannah Sirkin,
we thank you
both.

16:29.488 --> 16:39.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We turn now to the rules
regarding your online
privacy.

16:39.532 --> 16:47.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We turn now to the rules
regarding your online
privacy.

16:47.673 --> 16:52.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump has signed into
law legislation
that blocks the implementation
of some Internet

16:52.311 --> 16:56.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
privacy rules that were put in
place by the
Obama administration.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that story.

16:58.317 --> 17:02.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: These rules,
if they'd gone
into effect, would have
prohibited Internet

17:02.154 --> 17:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
service providers like Verizon
or AT&amp;T or
Comcast from collecting and
selling information

17:07.293 --> 17:11.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about your Internet browsing to
advertisers
without your permission.

17:11.530 --> 17:15.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on this, I'm joined now
by Scott
Cleland who's a researcher and
advocate for

17:15.334 --> 17:19.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
greater Internet competition,
and by Gigi
Sohn, who used to be with the
FCC, where she

17:19.906 --> 17:22.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helped craft the now repealed
rules.

17:22.608 --> 17:23.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Scott, help me understand this.

17:25.444 --> 17:28.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I know you work a lot with the
industry here.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why did these rules need to come
down, in
your view?

17:30.983 --> 17:35.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT CLELAND, Chairman,
NetCompetition.org:
What this thing has done, by
repealing this,

17:35.655 --> 17:41.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's gone back to the status
quo, and hopefully
it will return to a normal
Federal Trade Commission

17:41.460 --> 17:43.362 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
privacy regime.

17:43.396 --> 17:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But, as I
mentioned in the
intro, this would have stopped
ISPs from collecting

17:47.366 --> 17:49.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and selling to advertisers.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that seems to be what the
industry didn't
like about that.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that right?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT CLELAND: That's right,
because they
were pointed out as somehow
unique in a sense.

17:55.808 --> 17:59.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And ISPs, I know Gigi will say
that they're
the only ones where all the
information comes

17:59.879 --> 18:01.714 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
through.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the thing is, is people
don't understand
that 50 percent to almost 70
percent of traffic

18:04.283 --> 18:06.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is encrypted they can't see.

18:06.285 --> 18:11.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But more than that, I mean,
Google and Facebook
and others, when you talk about
all the services,

18:11.457 --> 18:15.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the authentication, when you
talk about all
the things you have there,
whether Gmail or

18:15.928 --> 18:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whatever, it's harder to leave
Google and
to leave Facebook, the sacrifice
of doing

18:20.833 --> 18:24.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that, and not using one, than it
is an ISP.

18:24.337 --> 18:30.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, there is this false
dichotomy where ISPs
are somehow special.

18:30.242 --> 18:36.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the main thing is, they
don't have a desire
to harm their consumers or to be
selling their

18:36.282 --> 18:37.450 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
privacy.

18:37.483 --> 18:40.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, they have been covered
by privacy
in the past.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't want to sell this
data.

18:42.321 --> 18:46.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Gigi, Scott
says these Internet
service providers don't want to
sell my data.

18:47.026 --> 18:49.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, why the need for a rule
blocking them
from doing so?

18:49.862 --> 18:53.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIGI SOHN, Co-Founder, Public
Knowledge: If
all these companies are doing
things to protect

18:53.933 --> 18:58.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your privacy, are they doing all
the same
things that the FCC rules
protected, then

18:58.804 --> 19:00.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
why did they seek repeal?

19:01.007 --> 19:06.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, Verizon, when we
adopted these rules
in October of 2016, they praised
what we did,

19:06.879 --> 19:09.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because they said, look, this is
standard
practice.

19:09.548 --> 19:16.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are commonsense rules that
protect individuals'
privacy and give them the power
to control

19:16.989 --> 19:19.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the fate of their personal
information.

19:19.191 --> 19:25.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I can talk about why I ISPs
are different,
that they see everything you do,
as opposed

19:25.564 --> 19:26.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Google and Facebook.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Because
they're the sole
gateway to the Internet.

19:28.134 --> 19:30.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GIGI SOHN: They're the sole
gateway to the
Internet.

19:30.302 --> 19:33.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You pay them handsomely, whereas
Google and
Facebook are free.

19:33.572 --> 19:36.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is just a different
expectation
from consumers.

19:36.409 --> 19:42.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, if you're lucky
enough to have
a choice in ISPs, it's still
very difficult.

19:42.281 --> 19:44.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are switching costs.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't have to use Google
if I don't
want to.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My spouse uses DuckDuckGo.

19:48.254 --> 19:49.855 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

19:49.889 --> 19:54.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't have to use Facebook,
but you must
use an ISP to get to the
Internet.

19:54.493 --> 20:00.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even so, even if we want to
level the
playing field, why did Congress
level the

20:00.066 --> 20:01.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
playing field down?

20:02.001 --> 20:09.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why didn't it make Google and
Facebook abide
by the high standards that the
FCC set?

20:09.341 --> 20:12.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is no playing field if
you're an ISP.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're completely and totally
unprotected.

20:13.879 --> 20:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean, Scott,
what about
that argument that, if Google
and Facebook

20:17.049 --> 20:22.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are free to do what the ISPs say
they would
like to do, that seems -- could
also be an

20:22.388 --> 20:25.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
argument for making stricter
security on those
guys?

20:25.858 --> 20:27.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT CLELAND: And let me be
very clear.

20:27.760 --> 20:33.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think ISPs would be more than
happy if there
was congressional legislation
that applied

20:33.432 --> 20:38.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same rules to everybody,
technology-neutral,
and put the consumer truly in
control.

20:39.004 --> 20:41.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We agree the consumer should be
put in control.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they'd have some great
support of
that.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, I don't think you would
have Google,
Facebook and Amazon and those,
they would

20:47.713 --> 20:48.914 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
say no way.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GIGI SOHN: William, the answer
is much simpler
than that.

20:51.817 --> 20:55.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Federal Communications
Commission regulates
networks.

20:55.154 --> 20:58.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It doesn't regulate Amazon,
Google and Facebook.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't have the legal power.

21:00.893 --> 21:05.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we had gone ahead and done
that -- and
it was interesting to see our
Republican colleagues

21:05.865 --> 21:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
urging us to do that, when they
know full
well we don't have the power.

21:09.435 --> 21:13.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we had done that, it would
have been thrown
out in court.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So we couldn't do that.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But here's what's interesting.

21:16.342 --> 21:19.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Google opposed these rules.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

21:20.846 --> 21:23.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not because it would have
applied to them,
but because they knew that this
served as

21:23.516 --> 21:25.017 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a template.

21:25.050 --> 21:29.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These rules serve as a template
that Congress
could use to raise the bar.

21:29.188 --> 21:31.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, instead, the bar has been
eliminated.

21:31.590 --> 21:37.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, right now,
though, if
I'm a consumer and these rules
are now moot,

21:37.296 --> 21:41.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and I want to protect my
privacy, like, what
can I ask of my ISP?

21:41.066 --> 21:45.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What are they allowed to do as
far as collecting
information about me, selling
information

21:45.771 --> 21:47.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about me right now?

21:47.573 --> 21:53.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GIGI SOHN: After all the
blowback, when the
Senate and the House passed this
law repealing

21:53.112 --> 21:55.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the FCC's rules, there was huge
amounts of
blowback.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think anybody expected
it.

21:57.850 --> 22:05.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Comcast, AT&amp;T and I believe
Verizon all
posted blog posts saying that,
you know, we

22:05.324 --> 22:07.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
don't use this information.

22:07.359 --> 22:09.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't share this information.

22:09.361 --> 22:11.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have no plans to do so.

22:11.463 --> 22:13.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't currently do so.

22:13.232 --> 22:15.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You don't buy
it?

22:15.067 --> 22:18.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIGI SOHN: Well, no, I buy it
that today,
they do not, but they want the
leave the door

22:18.837 --> 22:24.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
open to selling and sharing the
most sensitive
personal information, your
health care information,

22:24.810 --> 22:29.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your financial information, your
location,
your Social Security number.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They want to leave that door
open.

22:32.117 --> 22:36.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT CLELAND: It's very
important, if I can
correct, they're saying health
care information,

22:36.922 --> 22:38.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
financial information.

22:38.624 --> 22:42.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's part of the patchwork of
privacy regulations.

22:42.294 --> 22:45.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those -- all right, that's
sensitive data.

22:45.598 --> 22:48.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Companies like an ISP or even
Google shouldn't
be sharing that stuff.

22:48.968 --> 22:50.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a big no-no.

22:50.803 --> 22:55.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when we talk about trying to
scare people
about this, financial
information and health

22:55.474 --> 22:57.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care information is covered
under other laws.

22:57.643 --> 23:01.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Scott Cleland,
Gigi Sohn, thank you both very
much.

23:02.014 --> 23:06.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GIGI SOHN: Thank you.

23:06.085 --> 23:10.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT CLELAND: Thank you.

23:10.155 --> 23:15.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

23:15.227 --> 23:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
advertisers distance
themselves from FOX News amid
sexual harassment

23:21.567 --> 23:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allegations; why Texas puts
cameras in many
of its classrooms; and an
acclaimed author

23:27.873 --> 23:31.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gives the advice he wishes he
had known as
a young writer.

23:31.710 --> 23:38.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But first: Jordan's King
Abdullah will meet
with President Trump tomorrow
here in Washington.

23:38.083 --> 23:42.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One item on the agenda: the
growth of Jewish
settlements on the West Bank.

23:42.121 --> 23:48.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
More than half-a-million
Israelis live there
on land captured from Jordan 50
years ago,

23:48.761 --> 23:53.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
land that many Israelis claim as
a biblical
birthright, but that
Palestinians hope will

23:53.365 --> 23:55.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
comprise a future state.

23:55.668 --> 23:59.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From the West Bank, special
correspondent
Martin Seemungal reports.

23:59.705 --> 24:05.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Israeli
soldiers and police
mobilizing in the West Bank to
arrest and

24:05.411 --> 24:13.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remove Israelis, by force if
necessary, a
settler outpost at Amona judged
by Israeli

24:13.385 --> 24:18.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
courts to be illegal because it
is built on
land owned by Palestinians.

24:18.724 --> 24:23.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The West Bank was captured by
Israel during
the 1967 war.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
International law considers it
occupied territory.

24:26.832 --> 24:31.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Israel disputes this and has
been building
Jewish settlements for decades.

24:31.537 --> 24:33.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Amona is different.

24:33.305 --> 24:37.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's one of the settlements
built without
Israeli government authorization
on private

24:37.476 --> 24:39.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Palestinian land.

24:39.244 --> 24:44.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No government wants to use
troops against
its own citizens, especially
Prime Minister

24:44.883 --> 24:47.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing
coalition.

24:47.753 --> 24:53.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as the protesting settlers
were taken
away, he announced plans for a
major settlement

24:53.425 --> 24:57.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
expansion in another area of the
West Bank.

24:57.096 --> 25:02.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Netanyahu also promised to build
a new settlement
for the Jews evicted from Amona.

25:02.101 --> 25:07.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He delivered on that promise,
announcing plans
for the first completely new
settlement in

25:07.906 --> 25:09.808 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over 20 years.

25:09.842 --> 25:16.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will be built in the Shilo
area, near Nablus,
a powerful message in support of
these settlers

25:16.715 --> 25:20.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and one of their beliefs that
God gave these
lands to the Jews.

25:20.119 --> 25:25.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HAGAI BEN ARTZI, Beit El
Resident: We're standing
on this site of the dream of
Jacob.

25:25.491 --> 25:30.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Not far from
Amona, Hagai
Ben Artzi points to ruins that
he says mark

25:30.429 --> 25:36.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the biblical site of Jacob's
Ladder, the dream
where God promised the land of
Israel to the

25:36.101 --> 25:38.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jewish people in the Book of
Genesis.

25:38.036 --> 25:45.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAGAI BEN ARTZI: The roots of
the people of
Israel are in this place, and
the whole Zionist

25:45.444 --> 25:52.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
idea is the return of the Jewish
people to
the biblical land, to its
biblical homeland.

25:52.785 --> 25:57.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Ben Artzi is
the brother-in-law
of Prime Minister Netanyahu, and
a prominent

25:57.222 --> 26:02.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
citizen of Beit El, one of
nearly 200 settlements
across the West Bank.

26:02.795 --> 26:05.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has lived here for 40 years.

26:05.731 --> 26:10.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like many settlements, Beit El
started out
as a few caravans on a hilltop.

26:10.402 --> 26:13.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Osnat Sharon is one of the
original settlers.

26:13.639 --> 26:16.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She calls this area by its
biblical names,
Judea and Samaria.

26:17.009 --> 26:22.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OSNAT SHARON, Beit El Resident:
I felt like
a pioneer, to build a new place
in an empty

26:22.748 --> 26:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
place, and there was nothing
here, nothing.

26:25.484 --> 26:30.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Palestinians
argue that
the whole settlement is illegal
because of

26:30.055 --> 26:35.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
international law, and that at
least part
of Beit El was built on private
land, farmland

26:35.461 --> 26:38.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they say they haven't been
able to use
for years.

26:38.664 --> 26:44.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The issue is still in court and
that section
of Beit El remains off-limits to
building.

26:45.003 --> 26:50.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rest of Beit El has boomed
since those
early days, nearly 7,000 people
today, permanent

26:50.676 --> 26:55.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
buildings, a supermarket,
playgrounds, like
any small town.

26:55.380 --> 26:59.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They come from Israel, from
different countries,
many from the U.S.

26:59.852 --> 27:05.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One study estimates 15 percent
of the settlers
in the West Bank are American,
and they all

27:05.057 --> 27:09.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
believe that it is their right
to be here.

27:09.995 --> 27:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Less than a mile from the
playgrounds of Beit
El, Palestinian children are at
recess at

27:15.033 --> 27:16.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a Ramallah school.

27:16.802 --> 27:22.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Ramallah is the seat of
government for the
Palestinian Authority, and under
its control.

27:22.341 --> 27:27.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israeli soldiers control access
points to
the city, and Palestinians say
soldiers routinely

27:27.479 --> 27:30.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conduct raids, often in the
middle of the
night.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Access to farmland is severely
restricted.

27:34.019 --> 27:37.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The job market here is limited.

27:37.789 --> 27:41.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Settlements like Beit El are
built on land
the Palestinians hope will be
part of their

27:41.727 --> 27:43.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
future state.

27:43.529 --> 27:47.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The settlements are often a
focal point of
Palestinian anger, leading to
clashes with

27:47.366 --> 27:52.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
settlers and Israeli soldiers
who control
the lands where the settlements
are built.

27:52.471 --> 27:57.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hard-line Palestinians still
believe all of
the West Bank and Israel is
occupied land

27:57.543 --> 27:59.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that belongs to them.

27:59.411 --> 28:04.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There has been relative calm in
the West Bank
in recent months, the result of
ongoing security

28:04.116 --> 28:08.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
cooperation between the
Palestinian Authority
and Israel.

28:08.820 --> 28:14.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Husam Zomlot is a senior adviser
to Palestinian
Leader Mahmoud Abbas.

28:14.226 --> 28:17.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says using violence against
Jewish settlers
is counterproductive.

28:17.462 --> 28:20.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HUSAM ZOMLOT, Palestinian
Presidential Adviser:
We don't hate them.

28:20.232 --> 28:26.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, our histories with Jews
have been
an integral part of our national
fabric.

28:26.672 --> 28:34.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we dislike, however, is
occupiers, colonizers,
the seizures, deniers of our
very basic rights.

28:34.446 --> 28:40.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: The tense,
sometimes violent
status quo that has gone on for
decades defined

28:40.752 --> 28:43.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the enormous security wall
built by Israel.

28:43.722 --> 28:47.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It stretches for miles across
the West Bank.

28:47.092 --> 28:51.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Settlers here in Beit El, like
settlers across
the West Bank, have often had a
very complicated

28:51.897 --> 28:57.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relationship with the United
States, often
perceived as both protector and
enemy at the

28:57.603 --> 28:59.271 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
same time.

28:59.304 --> 29:03.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration in
particular wasn't
seen as a friend of the
settlers.

29:03.175 --> 29:08.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The arrival of Donald Trump, on
the other
hand, is being welcomed here in
Beit El.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are hopeful it is the
beginning of a
new era.

29:10.882 --> 29:14.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Bibi and I have known each other
for a long

29:14.152 --> 29:18.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
time, smart man, great
negotiator, and I think
we're going to make a deal.

29:18.624 --> 29:21.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: But Netanyahu
made his position
clear.

29:21.126 --> 29:24.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli
Prime Minister:
I believe that the issue of the
settlements

29:24.196 --> 29:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not the core of the conflict,
nor does
it really drive the conflict.

29:28.333 --> 29:33.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Beit El's new
yeshiva for
Jewish studies is reported to
have White House

29:33.472 --> 29:35.240 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
connections.

29:35.273 --> 29:41.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Friedman, Trump's new
ambassador to
Israel, and his son-in-law,
Jared Kushner,

29:41.246 --> 29:43.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have donated money to this
yeshiva.

29:44.016 --> 29:49.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has tapped Kushner to lead
negotiations
between Israel and the
Palestinians.

29:49.554 --> 29:53.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The broad parameters of the
so-called two-state
solution would give most of the
West Bank

29:53.592 --> 29:55.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the Palestinians for their
state.

29:56.028 --> 30:00.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israel would keep the major
settlement blocks,
which are close to the 1967
border.

30:00.198 --> 30:04.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In exchange, it would give an
equal amount
of land to the Palestinians.

30:04.803 --> 30:09.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it would mean dozens of
settlements like
Beit El would need to be
evacuated.

30:09.541 --> 30:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As many as 70,000 Jews live in
these areas.

30:13.612 --> 30:18.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The right-wing Jewish Home
Party, led by Naftali
Bennett, is part of Netanyahu's
coalition.

30:18.850 --> 30:24.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is pushing for unilateral
annexation to
bring all the settlements under
Israeli control.

30:24.923 --> 30:29.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is against the two-state
idea, and it has
pushed through a controversial
law giving

30:29.895 --> 30:36.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israel the right to build on
private Palestinian
land seen by many as a de facto
form of annexation.

30:36.601 --> 30:41.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tzachi Hanegbi is a senior
cabinet minister
with close ties to Netanyahu.

30:41.573 --> 30:45.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Hanegbi insists that the
government remains
committed to the two-state idea.

30:45.777 --> 30:48.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says the Jewish Home Party is
in the minority.

30:48.780 --> 30:52.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TZACHI HANEGBI, Israeli Cabinet
Minister:
The majority of Israelis, I
would say an overwhelming

30:52.117 --> 31:00.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
majority, believe that there has
to be a solution,
a peaceful solution, which will
not include

31:00.625 --> 31:02.394 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the annexation.

31:02.427 --> 31:06.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: On the Israeli
left, there
are deep worries that continued
construction

31:06.364 --> 31:11.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will kill any chance for two
states, a fear
shared by the Palestinian
leadership.

31:11.036 --> 31:15.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANAN ASHRAWI, Palestinian
Negotiator: We
made a historical and painful
compromise when

31:15.107 --> 31:20.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we accepted the two-state
solution, when we
said OK, we will recognize, and
we did recognize

31:20.545 --> 31:21.713 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Israel.

31:21.747 --> 31:25.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On 78 percent of our historical
homeland,
we did that.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How much more do they want?

31:27.619 --> 31:30.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: And ambiguous
statements
out of the White House about the
two-state

31:30.856 --> 31:32.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
solution alarm Palestinians.

31:32.758 --> 31:38.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HUSAM ZOMLOT: If you are not
going to support
the two-state solution, the
long-held U.S.

31:38.096 --> 31:44.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy, if you fail to clearly
condemn the
settlement expansion and the
colonial grab

31:44.402 --> 31:50.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our land, then you better
come up with
an alternative for the equal
number of population

31:50.442 --> 31:52.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inhabiting this land and the six
million Palestinians.

31:52.878 --> 31:58.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: And for the
moment, the
two sides have not agreed to
even begin negotiations.

31:58.283 --> 32:02.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you want to understand the
division these
issues are having on Israeli
society, consider

32:02.821 --> 32:09.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the words of Hagai Ben Artzi in
Beit El, Netanyahu's
own brother-in-law, against the
two-state

32:09.094 --> 32:13.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
solution, in favor of the right
wing's annexation
plan.

32:13.098 --> 32:21.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAGAI BEN ARTZI: If Netanyahu is
not courageous
enough to make that move, I will
support other

32:21.673 --> 32:23.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
candidates for prime minister.

32:23.575 --> 32:27.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: A scenario
that would lead
to confrontation with the
Palestinians, certainly

32:27.512 --> 32:33.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
politically, on the
international stage, possibly
a new eruption of violence in
the West Bank.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump is promising new
negotiations.

32:36.021 --> 32:42.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And reports in Israeli media
talk of a U.S.-
sponsored summit involving the
Palestinians,

32:42.327 --> 32:44.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Israel and Arab leaders.

32:44.296 --> 32:50.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arab states remain committed to
the two-state
solution in return for
recognition of Israel.

32:50.969 --> 32:55.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they would also demand a
freeze on all
settlement construction.

32:55.106 --> 33:00.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neither Israel, the U.S. or any
of the other
potential players have confirmed
that a summit

33:00.645 --> 33:02.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is being planned.

33:02.447 --> 33:06.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But Trump's special
representative attended
Arab League meetings.

33:06.484 --> 33:10.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jason Greenblatt has had
extensive discussions
with all sides.

33:10.455 --> 33:14.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has stated that the time has

33:42.254 --> 33:47.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Factor" after an investigation
by The New
York Times revealed five settled
lawsuits

33:47.559 --> 33:51.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against its host, Bill O'Reilly,
for alleged
inappropriate behavior.

33:52.030 --> 33:58.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, a related scandal led
to the ouster
of then-FOX News chairman Roger
Ailes.

33:58.169 --> 34:02.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To help us catch up on all this,
I am joined
by Michael Schmidt, who reported
on this for

34:02.807 --> 34:04.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The New York Times.

34:04.709 --> 34:09.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Noreen Farrell, she's the
executive director
of the civil rights organization
Equal Rights

34:09.981 --> 34:11.316 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Advocates.

34:11.349 --> 34:13.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the "NewsHour."

34:13.351 --> 34:15.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, Michael Schmidt, to you
first.

34:15.053 --> 34:18.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is the latest on the number
of advertisers
who are saying they're pulling
out?

34:18.390 --> 34:21.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT, The New York
Times: Well,
what happened yesterday is that
Mercedes was

34:21.226 --> 34:22.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the first to go.

34:22.227 --> 34:23.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They said that they're pulling.

34:23.428 --> 34:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then since, we're up to the
number about
14.

34:25.297 --> 34:28.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seems like we're adding them
at about one
an hour.

34:28.800 --> 34:32.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FOX itself just put out a
statement saying
it's trying to assuage the
concerns of its

34:32.771 --> 34:36.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advertisers and that the ads
have been moved
to other shows on the network.

34:36.574 --> 34:39.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They haven't said anything else
since our
story came out on Saturday.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are the
advertisers saying?

34:41.613 --> 34:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are they explaining why they're
doing this?

34:43.481 --> 34:45.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: They're not
really explaining.

34:45.250 --> 34:48.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some are saying, look, women's
issues are
obviously very important to us,
and we need

34:49.020 --> 34:53.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to send this message to our
clients, to our
customers, and to our employees.

34:53.525 --> 34:56.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, besides that, they don't
really want
to wade into it.

34:56.194 --> 35:00.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For Mercedes, it was sort of a
way of getting
attention on this issue.

35:00.498 --> 35:05.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They certainly have been praised
a lot by
groups that are calling for Mr.
O'Reilly's

35:05.570 --> 35:07.372 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ouster.

35:07.405 --> 35:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And FOX News
Channel, you're
saying, in large part has just
not addressed

35:11.943 --> 35:12.911 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this?

35:12.944 --> 35:14.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: Correct.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For our story, we sent them
dozens and dozens
of questions.

35:16.715 --> 35:20.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they gave us a statement,
which we included
in it, in which they said they
had addressed

35:20.452 --> 35:21.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
these issues with Mr. O'Reilly.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They didn't go any further than
that.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They didn't answer whether he's
been disciplined.

35:25.423 --> 35:29.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And since then, the only thing
they have said
was this statement today.

35:29.194 --> 35:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have also sent out an
e-mail to their
staff about how to report in
different types

35:34.599 --> 35:39.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of workplace issues that they
may have, sort
of a reminder to the folks about
what to do.

35:39.437 --> 35:43.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, based on --
Michael Schmidt,
based on your reporting, any
reporting you

35:43.174 --> 35:48.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been able to do inside FOX,
the FOX News
organization, can you tell what
the reaction

35:48.179 --> 35:49.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is inside?

35:50.015 --> 35:52.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: Well, we have
talked to some
folks in the newsroom who say
that people

35:52.484 --> 35:53.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are pretty worked up about this.

35:53.985 --> 35:57.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There's cuts at FOX News
currently going on,
and they want to know why...

35:57.589 --> 35:58.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean job
cuts?

35:58.590 --> 35:59.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: Job cuts going
on right now.

35:59.991 --> 36:03.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they want to know why the
money is going
to pay these women.

36:03.128 --> 36:07.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's millions and millions of
dollars that
have gone out the door, and
people there are

36:07.132 --> 36:08.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
losing their jobs.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're also disheartened by the
fact that
this is another issue for the
network.

36:12.737 --> 36:18.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you remember, last summer,
Roger Ailes
was sued by one of the hosts,
and it was a

36:18.176 --> 36:19.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
real scandal at the network.

36:19.244 --> 36:21.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they had to get rid of Mr.
Ailes.

36:21.379 --> 36:24.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while they thought they had
put that behind
them, there was an internal
investigation,

36:24.816 --> 36:28.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the company pledged to clean
itself up, once
again, they're now facing these
issues.

36:28.686 --> 36:31.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Noreen
Farrell,
I'm going to turn to you now.

36:31.856 --> 36:37.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much -- how common is the
kind of thing
we're hearing and these
accusations from these

36:37.228 --> 36:38.963 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
women?

36:38.997 --> 36:40.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOREEN FARRELL, Executive
Director, Equal
Rights Advocates: You know,
unfortunately,

36:40.999 --> 36:42.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's incredibly common.

36:42.901 --> 36:46.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that sexual harassment
very much remains
the price of a paycheck for
women across the

36:47.005 --> 36:51.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
country in hundreds of
industries, no matter
if they're a low-wage worker or
a high-wage

36:51.943 --> 36:54.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worker, which we have seen a lot
of news about.

36:54.112 --> 36:58.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that this -- this
reporting really
shows the pattern, not just of
multiple complaints

36:58.850 --> 37:04.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within a company, but how often
one person
can receive many complaints and
remain in

37:04.756 --> 37:06.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the embrace of a company, like
Mr. O'Reilly.

37:06.758 --> 37:10.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, based on
The New York
Times' reporting, none of these
women who

37:10.728 --> 37:17.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made these charges against --
legally raised
these charges against Bill
O'Reilly have -- and

37:17.735 --> 37:22.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then the cases were settled --
have gone on
to work in television news
again.

37:22.474 --> 37:27.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In other words, it has had an
impact on their
livelihood.

37:27.278 --> 37:29.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that something you typically
see?

37:29.814 --> 37:31.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you see in that regard?

37:31.516 --> 37:35.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOREEN FARRELL: You know, I
think that when
people talk about sexual
harassment, they

37:35.920 --> 37:39.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minimize it to a particular
occurrence or
one day or a bad act.

37:39.757 --> 37:43.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we have seen from the
fact that these
women are not in TV news is that
it can impact

37:43.862 --> 37:48.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the entire trajectory of
somebody's career,
which has an incredibly chilling
effect on

37:48.566 --> 37:50.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more women stepping forward.

37:50.435 --> 37:54.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, from our perspective,
the fact that
these women are not -- no longer
in the industry

37:54.439 --> 37:58.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is as problematic as the fact
that they were
harassed in the first place,
because clearly

37:58.409 --> 38:03.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
retaliation and blacklisting is
in play, not
just in news, but in many
industries.

38:03.148 --> 38:08.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the other
question, I think,
that of course is on all of our
minds, Noreen

38:08.052 --> 38:15.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Farrell, is, what advice is
there for women
at whatever stage of their
career?

38:15.059 --> 38:20.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they encounter, if a woman
encounters sexual
harassment -- or a man, for that
matter -- what

38:20.231 --> 38:27.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the right recourse, because
for these women,
the few that we know about, the
outcome wasn't

38:27.238 --> 38:28.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
good?

38:28.239 --> 38:29.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, they lost their job.

38:30.008 --> 38:34.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOREEN FARRELL: I think that
especially The
New York Times' article revealed
the power

38:34.812 --> 38:39.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the collective, because, if
you're alone,
you feel like you're an isolated
incident.

38:39.417 --> 38:43.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you talk about what's
happening to
you, not just to human resources
departments,

38:43.655 --> 38:48.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which sometimes don't escalate
the problem
as they should, as we saw in
Uber, for example,

38:48.326 --> 38:51.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but if you also talk to you
colleagues, if
you document what's happening,
if you seek

38:51.930 --> 38:56.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legal help from organizations
like Equal Rights
Advocates to help you assess
your claims and

38:56.901 --> 39:01.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether or not you should go
forward, these
are all things that women should
do at any

39:01.272 --> 39:05.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stage of their career, but most
especially
as they enter the workplace and
are trying

39:05.043 --> 39:07.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to navigate, which is --
sometimes are often
hostile workplaces.

39:07.845 --> 39:11.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I should say
-- I said
they lose their jobs, but, of
course, they

39:11.583 --> 39:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have experienced the trauma of
what they have
gone through.

39:14.252 --> 39:16.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael Schmidt, I want to come
back to you.

39:16.187 --> 39:22.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is the FOX policy toward
women or men
who raise their hand and say, I
have been

39:22.193 --> 39:24.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sexually harassed, something has
happened
to me?

39:24.329 --> 39:27.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: Well, what FOX
would say
is that now, if there are
issues, we would

39:27.832 --> 39:29.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want to know about them.

39:29.634 --> 39:33.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to investigate them, and
we want to
protect those that come forward
to make these

39:33.438 --> 39:34.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
accusations.

39:34.739 --> 39:38.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The problem is, is that FOX has
a history
of not doing that.

39:38.109 --> 39:42.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So women don't feel secure
coming forward
to do that, and they don't --
and they look

39:42.347 --> 39:46.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a story like ours, and they
see what's
happened to other folks, and
they say, I don't

39:46.784 --> 39:48.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want to come forward and make a
complaint.

39:48.253 --> 39:50.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is too risky of a thing for
me to do.

39:50.221 --> 39:57.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Noreen Farrell,
in terms of
companies, employers having
policies to address

39:57.695 --> 40:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sexual harassment, how out in
the open is
that typically when somebody
goes to work

40:02.467 --> 40:04.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at someplace?

40:04.936 --> 40:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that the kind of question
people should
be asking?

40:07.639 --> 40:11.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NOREEN FARRELL: Well, you know
what happens
with these policies.

40:11.142 --> 40:13.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They get thrown in a drawer and
they gather
dust.

40:13.378 --> 40:17.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that if you have --
all the policies
in the world are great if
they're on paper,

40:17.382 --> 40:20.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the problem is, when you're
giving your
high performers, when you're
giving the leaders

40:20.618 --> 40:26.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of your company a free pass
again and again
in a very public way, the
message is, it doesn't

40:26.324 --> 40:28.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really matter what our policies
say.

40:28.693 --> 40:30.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sexual harassment is tolerated
in this workplace.

40:30.528 --> 40:33.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's really damaging to
the culture
of a workplace.

40:33.498 --> 40:37.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're saying
that's the
message that's being sent here?

40:37.402 --> 40:40.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOREEN FARRELL: Without a doubt.

40:40.271 --> 40:46.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Schmidt,
New York Times,
Noreen Farrell, we thank you

NOREEN FARRELL: Thank you.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: a look at
whether having
cameras in the classroom can
protect children

41:06.130 --> 41:12.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with disabilities, who can be
targets for
bullying and can be subject to
abuse by teachers.

41:12.870 --> 41:15.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But cameras raise their own
issues.

41:15.540 --> 41:20.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Kavitha
Cardoza with
our partner Education Week
traveled to Keller,

41:20.311 --> 41:25.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Texas, to see how a
recently-implemented law
is playing out, and all this for
our weekly

41:25.883 --> 41:27.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
series Making the Grade.

41:27.852 --> 41:33.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Breggett Rideau
watches her
son Terrence during his weekly
therapy session.

41:33.391 --> 41:38.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Horseback riding helps him
improve his balance,
muscle tone and confidence.

41:38.062 --> 41:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BREGGETT RIDEAU, Mother of
Terrence Rideau:
I have never seen my son ride on
a horse where

41:41.699 --> 41:43.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he wasn't smiling.

41:43.201 --> 41:48.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Terrence is 21,
but, developmentally,
he's about 2 or 3.

41:48.039 --> 41:52.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BREGGETT RIDEAU: OK, this is a
picture of
little T. when he was just a few
weeks old,

41:52.143 --> 41:53.611 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a few days old.

41:53.644 --> 41:54.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He came out smiling.

41:54.679 --> 41:56.114 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:56.147 --> 41:58.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Breggett says
Terrence was
always a happy little boy.

41:58.316 --> 42:01.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then, in middle school, he
changed.

42:01.219 --> 42:05.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BREGGETT RIDEAU: He would cry
out for no reason,
just out -- just cry out, tears.

42:06.023 --> 42:07.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm like, what's wrong,
babe?

42:07.992 --> 42:09.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
A stomach ache.

42:09.060 --> 42:11.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I had no idea.

42:11.095 --> 42:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: There were
unexplained injuries,
a bump on his head, a broken
thumb, a dislocated

42:15.867 --> 42:17.769 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
knee.

42:17.802 --> 42:22.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Keller School District began
investigating,
and a classroom aide came
forward to substantiate

42:22.106 --> 42:23.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some of Breggett's concerns.

42:23.608 --> 42:25.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BREGGETT RIDEAU: Everyone
started telling
me what that teacher had done.

42:26.010 --> 42:29.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He had dropped him too many
times to count.

42:29.046 --> 42:32.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I found out that he had slammed
little T.
against the wall.

42:32.617 --> 42:34.085 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I had no clue.

42:34.118 --> 42:37.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: The Rideaus
were awarded
a $1 million jury settlement.

42:38.022 --> 42:43.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Keller School District is
appealing, and
declined to speak to us for this
story.

42:43.694 --> 42:45.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But Breggett wasn't done.

42:45.496 --> 42:50.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An aspiring jazz singer, she put
her career
on hold and began a campaign to
install cameras

42:50.935 --> 42:53.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in special education classrooms.

42:53.271 --> 42:58.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She testified in front of the
Texas House
and Senate, saying cameras would
have prevented

42:58.509 --> 42:59.577 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the abuse.

42:59.610 --> 43:02.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BREGGETT RIDEAU: My child
counts.

43:02.513 --> 43:04.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Children like mine count, too.

43:04.449 --> 43:07.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: In 2015, Texas
agreed.

43:07.952 --> 43:12.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It became the first state in the
country to
require cameras in special
education classrooms,

43:12.857 --> 43:14.158 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
if requested.

43:14.192 --> 43:18.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ron Hager is with the National
Disabilities
Rights Network.

43:18.362 --> 43:23.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He says children with
intellectual disabilities
are far more likely to be
abused.

43:23.201 --> 43:25.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON HAGER, National Disabilities
Rights Network:
Students with disabilities make
up about 12

43:25.503 --> 43:29.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
percent of the student
population.

43:29.173 --> 43:32.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been subjected to
about 70 percent
of the restraints and
seclusions, so it's

43:32.710 --> 43:33.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a huge disparity.

43:33.911 --> 43:35.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are very vulnerable.

43:35.513 --> 43:39.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Ryder Warren is
the superintendent
of a nearby school district.

43:39.851 --> 43:41.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He agrees with the law.

43:41.786 --> 43:42.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYDER WARREN, Superintendent,
Northwest Independent
School District: The mantra of
our school

43:42.487 --> 43:44.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
district is, we put kids first.

43:44.422 --> 43:46.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My primary job is to protect
children.

43:46.691 --> 43:50.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, right after that, my job is
to protect
the adults that are in the
buildings, especially

43:50.928 --> 43:52.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our classroom teachers.

43:52.296 --> 43:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Under the
current law, teachers
cannot opt out.

43:55.666 --> 43:58.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Neither can parents of other
children with
special needs.

43:58.135 --> 44:00.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This could lead to privacy
concerns.

44:00.571 --> 44:06.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYDER WARREN: That's been an
issue with some
parents, that their need for
their kids not

44:06.878 --> 44:09.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be under constant supervision
with that
camera.

44:10.014 --> 44:12.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have heard some comments about
that.

44:12.116 --> 44:15.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have really not had any
comments from teachers.

44:15.920 --> 44:18.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: The bigger
issue for him
is cost.

44:18.723 --> 44:23.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under the new law, if even one
parent requests
a camera, every special
education classroom

44:23.961 --> 44:26.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the entire district has to
have one.

44:26.297 --> 44:30.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RYDER WARREN: That would
probably cost to
the tune of over $600,000.

44:30.568 --> 44:33.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is just an astronomical
time and expense.

44:33.170 --> 44:35.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: What would you
say to the
Texas legislature?

44:35.606 --> 44:38.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RYDER WARREN: Pay for it.

44:38.576 --> 44:42.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Adam Feind is
in charge of
technology for the district.

44:42.947 --> 44:45.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The cost of cameras is just the
start.

44:45.116 --> 44:48.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ADAM FEIND, Northwest
Independent School District:
A camera such as this costs
about $800.

44:48.819 --> 44:52.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, when we look at the
total cost of
operation, we have to take into
account the

44:52.456 --> 44:58.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
video storage, the wiring, the
cable, the
cost of installing, the cost of
operations.

44:58.229 --> 45:02.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Samantha Crane
is with the
Autistic Self Advocacy Network.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She opposes cameras in
classrooms.

45:04.635 --> 45:07.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA CRANE, Autistic Self
Advocacy Network:
Parents can't get access to that
footage unless

45:07.672 --> 45:09.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they know something's happened.

45:09.473 --> 45:13.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have to be able to say, I
would like
footage from this day, and
ideally from this

45:13.878 --> 45:15.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
particular time of the day.

45:15.913 --> 45:19.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, parents might think
everything is fine,
everything's being
tape-recorded, but they're

45:19.850 --> 45:23.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
still not getting the
information they need
to know, if their child is safe.

45:23.287 --> 45:27.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Crane worries
abuse may go
underground, and take resources
away from

45:27.992 --> 45:29.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
education.

45:29.894 --> 45:33.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, several disability
advocacy groups
say they would rather see more
special education

45:34.031 --> 45:39.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
students in mainstream
classrooms, more teacher
training, and more background
checks for staff.

45:39.904 --> 45:43.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It isn't clear whether cameras
will actually
protect students.

45:43.040 --> 45:47.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
A lot depends on how the
technology is implemented
and monitored.

45:47.511 --> 45:52.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, last year, after
the cameras
were installed in Terrence's
classroom, Breggett

45:52.683 --> 45:58.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rideau noticed her son came home
looking troubled,
so she asked to review the
footage.

45:58.789 --> 46:03.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Terrence starts choking, and
then eight minutes
of the tape is missing.

46:03.094 --> 46:07.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Breggett believes the tape was
manipulated,
and is urging for systems that
would protect

46:07.498 --> 46:08.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the footage.

46:08.866 --> 46:12.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, she believes cameras are
the best way
to protect children.

46:12.637 --> 46:16.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BREGGETT RIDEAU: Because it's
the only voice
for a child that can't talk.

46:16.507 --> 46:19.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's, like, that simple.

46:19.210 --> 46:22.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: She spends her
time helping
other parents advocate.

46:22.413 --> 46:28.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BREGGETT RIDEAU: My phone was
blowing up from
Canada from Canada to Florida to
North Carolina.

46:28.552 --> 46:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We all have a child that's
vulnerable.

46:30.688 --> 46:35.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Breggett has
gone back to
work part-time, but takes her
fight for her

46:35.993 --> 46:37.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
son's safety along with her.

46:37.962 --> 46:40.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BREGGETT RIDEAU: I have a
special-needs son
who was hurt at school.

46:40.564 --> 46:41.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It almost killed me, but I'm
still here.

46:41.832 --> 46:43.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this song right here I hope
explains how
I feel about it.

46:43.200 --> 46:44.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: The title?

46:44.235 --> 46:46.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"Here's to Life."

46:46.103 --> 46:58.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BREGGETT RIDEAU (singing): I
still have learned
all you give is all you get, so
give it all

46:58.716 --> 47:00.818 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you got.

47:00.851 --> 47:07.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Colum McCann

47:18.803 --> 47:28.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Can writing be
taught, or is
it an inherent gift that some of
us have and

47:28.913 --> 47:30.681 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
others don't?

47:30.715 --> 47:34.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is at the heart of the
National Book
Award winner Colum McCann's
newest work, the

47:34.885 --> 47:37.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
latest addition to the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf.

47:37.855 --> 47:42.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown talked with him at
this year's
Conference of the Association of
American

47:42.193 --> 47:45.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Writers and Writing Programs
here in Washington,
D.C.

47:45.730 --> 47:47.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what is this
book, "Letters
to a Young Writer"?

47:47.865 --> 47:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are you doing?

47:49.667 --> 47:52.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLUM MCCANN, Author, "Letters
to a Young
Writer": I was asked to have an
online presence

47:52.603 --> 47:54.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by my publishers.

47:54.438 --> 47:59.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought, well, maybe every
week I will
post a little bit of advice to a
young writer.

47:59.376 --> 48:00.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it sort of took off.

48:00.478 --> 48:05.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I did it every week for 52
weeks last
year.

48:05.483 --> 48:08.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they decided, well, we're
going to
put it out as a little book.

48:08.919 --> 48:13.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's the sort of
thing I would've
have liked to have gotten myself
as a younger

48:13.891 --> 48:16.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
writer, although I don't always
follow my
own advice.

48:16.827 --> 48:18.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, you teach,
right?

48:18.095 --> 48:19.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COLUM MCCANN: I teach.

48:19.563 --> 48:21.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, you're used
to sort of
talking about these things.

48:21.932 --> 48:22.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COLUM MCCANN: Yes.

48:22.933 --> 48:24.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I love teaching.

48:24.502 --> 48:26.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's always that debate
about whether
you can teach writing or not.

48:26.437 --> 48:28.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

48:28.239 --> 48:33.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLUM MCCANN: But I think I
teach -- I hope
I teach the virtue of fire and
stamina and

48:33.444 --> 48:35.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
desire and perseverance.

48:35.312 --> 48:41.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not so sure that I can teach
people how
to, you know, write dialogue or
create plot

48:41.519 --> 48:43.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or anything like that.

48:43.320 --> 48:47.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if I can get them and grab
them by the
scruff of the neck and say, you
can do this,

48:47.892 --> 48:52.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and if I see that fire in their
eyes, that's
when I think I know a writer.

48:52.396 --> 48:54.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Did you have a
reader in mind,
or...

48:54.532 --> 48:56.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COLUM MCCANN: No, I suppose I
had my younger
self.

48:57.001 --> 48:58.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Oh, really?

48:58.803 --> 49:02.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLUM MCCANN: Yes, back in the
days when I
had hair and I was typing away
and getting

49:02.773 --> 49:03.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all sorts of rejection letters.

49:03.874 --> 49:05.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What did you say
to yourself?

49:05.276 --> 49:07.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COLUM MCCANN: I said, you better
behave yourself.

49:07.178 --> 49:08.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You better learn.

49:08.913 --> 49:13.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I talk in the book
about, like,
these romantic notions about
drinking and

49:13.117 --> 49:14.084 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
drug use.

49:14.118 --> 49:15.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I also talk about plot.

49:15.719 --> 49:17.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I talk about characterization.

49:17.354 --> 49:19.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I talk about empathy.

49:19.123 --> 49:22.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I talk about behaving yourself
and not behaving
yourself.

49:22.493 --> 49:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, really, I want the younger
writer to
know that she or he is
meaningful, that what

49:29.066 --> 49:32.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they have to say is powerful in
this world.

49:32.069 --> 49:37.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they can't come indoors,
they can't close
the curtains, they can't, like,
lock themselves

49:37.942 --> 49:39.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
away from the world and say
nothing.

49:39.777 --> 49:44.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just to give
people a little
flavor of what you're doing, you
address the

49:44.348 --> 49:46.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
old write what you know, right?

49:46.617 --> 49:47.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COLUM MCCANN: Right.

49:47.818 --> 49:49.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, you say,
don't write what
you know.

49:49.820 --> 49:51.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Write toward what you want to
know.

49:51.655 --> 49:52.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COLUM MCCANN: Yes.

49:52.656 --> 49:54.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now explain that.

49:54.058 --> 49:55.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COLUM MCCANN: Ultimately, you
can only ever
write what you know.

49:55.626 --> 49:59.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's logically and
philosophically impossible
to write what you don't know.

49:59.530 --> 50:06.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, if you sort of see
yourself writing
into a space that you don't
always recognize,

50:06.103 --> 50:11.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you sometimes learn things that
you knew,
but weren't entirely aware of.

50:11.275 --> 50:18.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very liberating for a
writer to go into
a space where she or he has not
gone before,

50:18.682 --> 50:24.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because, instead of being a
tourist, you're
like an explorer now, and you're
sort of lost

50:24.722 --> 50:26.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this new idea.

50:26.590 --> 50:31.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another area,
character, knowing
your character, details that you
won't write

50:31.095 --> 50:32.062 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

50:32.096 --> 50:33.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COLUM MCCANN: Right.

50:33.330 --> 50:35.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you know
these people so
intimately.

50:35.266 --> 50:38.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I like what you said, not just
what she had
for breakfast, but what she
wanted for breakfast.

50:38.769 --> 50:39.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COLUM MCCANN: Right, right,
right.

50:39.770 --> 50:41.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right?

50:41.639 --> 50:45.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLUM MCCANN: I call that the
little literary
slice of bacon in the morning,
not just what

50:45.075 --> 50:48.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they had, but what they really,
truly wanted
to have.

50:48.512 --> 50:52.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you know your character
very well,
you will know both of these
things.

50:52.750 --> 50:56.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One other area I
want to -- of
the advice, structure.

50:56.620 --> 51:00.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You talk about the organization
of a piece
of writing and the importance of
that.

51:00.791 --> 51:02.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COLUM MCCANN: Structure can be
really problematic.

51:02.693 --> 51:08.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you have a structure
beforehand, you're
sort of stuffing your story into
a pre-assembled

51:08.132 --> 51:09.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
box.

51:09.133 --> 51:10.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You don't want that to happen.

51:10.634 --> 51:14.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What you want in your writing is
to have a
sort of wildness that occurs.

51:14.405 --> 51:18.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, out of the wildness, a
structure
emerges.

51:18.442 --> 51:23.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really towards the end of
the novel that
most writers actually say, aha,
that's actually

51:23.847 --> 51:25.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how I'm structuring this thing.

51:25.616 --> 51:29.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you don't want to be too
aware beforehand
of what it is that you want to
say or do.

51:29.820 --> 51:32.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's
interesting, because
that sort of goes to everything
that you're

51:32.323 --> 51:33.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
saying in some ways, right?

51:33.490 --> 51:35.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COLUM MCCANN: Yes.

51:35.225 --> 51:41.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So much of what I do, so much of
what we do
as writers is -- operates on the
fume of a

51:41.265 --> 51:42.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gut feeling.

51:42.266 --> 51:44.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

51:44.168 --> 51:46.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLUM MCCANN: A lot of people
think that writers
are much cleverer than they
actually are.

51:46.036 --> 51:47.771 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No, they're not.

51:47.805 --> 51:51.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they're emotionally clever,
and they go
into a character, and they feel
something

51:51.709 --> 51:54.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they weren't entirely aware
of beforehand.

51:54.111 --> 51:57.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I know, personally, that that is
how I operate.

51:57.047 --> 52:00.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How do you know
when you're
encountering good writing
yourself?

52:00.684 --> 52:06.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLUM MCCANN: You know because,
when you walk
outside, and you're about to be
hit by a bus,

52:06.256 --> 52:07.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and you get -- which I call the
bus theory.

52:07.925 --> 52:09.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The bus theory,
yes.

52:09.593 --> 52:13.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLUM MCCANN: And the bus misses
you, you
say thank God, because all I
wanted to do

52:13.664 --> 52:15.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was finish my novel before the
bus hit me.

52:15.833 --> 52:19.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Listen, when I finish my novel,
the bus can
hit me all at once.

52:19.169 --> 52:22.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's when you know you're
doing something,
something relatively good.

52:22.206 --> 52:26.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I want to go back
to this larger
question of the engagement with
the larger

52:26.210 --> 52:27.177 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
culture.

52:27.211 --> 52:28.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COLUM MCCANN: Right.

52:28.946 --> 52:30.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because it's been
a kind of
discussion in American writing
for a long

52:30.881 --> 52:36.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, right, about how engaged
writers are
or internal, too internalized at
different

52:36.854 --> 52:37.821 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
times.

52:37.855 --> 52:39.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COLUM MCCANN: Right.

52:39.823 --> 52:40.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What do you see
today in -- especially
in the younger writers that
you're dealing

52:40.924 --> 52:41.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- that you're working with?

52:42.026 --> 52:44.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COLUM MCCANN: Personally, I like
the social
novel.

52:44.528 --> 52:50.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I like writing that gets in and
under the
hood and looks about -- at
what's going on.

52:50.067 --> 52:52.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don't say to any writer
that that's
absolutely what they should do.

52:52.903 --> 52:57.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it's like the difference
between Whitman
and Dickinson, Emily Dickinson.

52:57.441 --> 53:04.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whitman was big and expansive
and engaged
and political and democratic and
wrote beautifully.

53:04.148 --> 53:05.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Dickinson just came indoors.

53:05.983 --> 53:11.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was small and intimate and
whispering in
your ear -- both incredibly
powerful.

53:11.855 --> 53:14.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
"Letters to a Young
Writer."

53:14.391 --> 53:15.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Colum McCann, thank you very
much.

53:15.692 --> 53:16.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLUM MCCANN: Thank you so much.

53:16.960 --> 53:18.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bring it on.

53:18.829 --> 53:21.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We always need more advice about
writing.

53:21.698 --> 53:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:23.167 --> 53:24.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:25.002 --> 53:28.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wednesday, our Leading Edge
series looks
at efforts to control the
growing number of

53:28.772 --> 53:33.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deer in the U.S., coupled with
the rise of
ticks and Lyme disease.

53:33.077 --> 53:34.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening.

53:34.945 --> 53:41.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.

53:41.351 --> 53:44.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.

54:23.560 --> 54:30.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
