HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:06.573 --> 00:11.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Republicans square
off on the debate stage, the
final face-to-face

00:11.211 --> 00:16.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before Super Tuesday, while
Democrats look
to South Carolina and beyond to
break the

00:16.583 --> 00:18.285 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tie.

00:18.318 --> 00:22.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: looking at the
U.S.'s role in
the possible Syrian cease-fire,
and if the

00:22.456 --> 00:27.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agreement will hold amidst
looming unrest
and political distrust.

00:27.160 --> 00:32.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, we sit down with the
mother of one of
the Columbine shooters to talk
about her new

00:32.199 --> 00:34.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
memoir on living in the
aftermath of tragedy.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUE KLEBOLD, Author, "A Mother's
Reckoning:
Living in the Aftermath of
Tragedy": I stood

00:36.970 --> 00:43.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up and thought I was going to be
sick. I -- it
was such a shock to me, because
it didn't

00:43.043 --> 00:48.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make sense that a child that I
loved could
actually be doing those things
or could have

00:48.682 --> 00:50.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
planned to do those things.

00:50.050 --> 00:57.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:57.491 --> 01:00.360 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:00.394 --> 01:09.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The political
drama over
the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy
took a new

01:09.169 --> 01:15.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
twist today. The Republican
governor of Nevada,
Brian Sandoval, withdrew his
name from consideration.

01:15.442 --> 01:18.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sandoval said in a statement:
"The notion
of being considered for a seat
on the highest

01:18.946 --> 01:23.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
court in the land is beyond
humbling." But
he gave no reason for his
decision. Senate

01:23.884 --> 01:27.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans say they will not
consider any
nominee from President Obama.
Nevertheless,

01:27.988 --> 01:32.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the White House says the
president will meet
with Senate leaders next week.

01:32.159 --> 01:36.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Battered communities across
Southeastern Virginia
began cleaning up today, after
tornadoes struck

01:36.530 --> 01:41.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wednesday evening. The storms
killed four
people and injured dozens more.
Three of the

01:41.635 --> 01:45.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dead were in the small town of
Waverly, about
40 miles southeast of Richmond.

01:45.872 --> 01:49.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Governor Terry McAuliffe
declared a state
of emergency and toured the area
today.

01:49.242 --> 01:53.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. TERRY MCAULIFFE (D),
Virginia: I was
just amazed at the length and
the width of

01:53.213 --> 01:58.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this tornado that struck here.
But as you
go along and then you will see
structures

01:58.218 --> 02:04.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
totally gone, but you will see
just gigantic
areas of trees just snapped in
half, gigantic

02:04.257 --> 02:06.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trees just laying on the ground.

02:06.059 --> 02:09.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Farther north,
in Pennsylvania,
the storm system roared through
Lancaster

02:10.030 --> 02:16.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
County, peeling off roofs and
damaging businesses.
Two 600-foot chicken sheds and
several barns

02:16.169 --> 02:17.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were destroyed.

02:17.637 --> 02:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The number of migrants stranded
in northern
Greece built today

02:23.910 --> 02:27.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The number of migrants stranded
in northern
Greece built today

02:56.443 --> 03:02.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Macedonia allowed only a
trickle to head
north. Some 3,500 people braved
bitter cold

03:02.149 --> 03:07.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a camp on the Greek side this
morning as
they waited to cross. To the
south, thousands

03:08.021 --> 03:13.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more set up camp at a port
terminal outside
Athens after police barred them
from moving

03:13.226 --> 03:15.462 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

03:15.495 --> 03:22.669 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Some people say a lot of
things, make
us worried, and like the
border is closing. And I don't
-- I don't

03:22.669 --> 03:25.505 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Some people say a lot of
things, make
us worried, and like the
border is closing. And I don't
-- I don't

03:50.430 --> 03:57.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know. A lot of things make us
more and more
and more tired. And we only need
to -- these

03:57.170 --> 04:00.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know. A lot of things make us
more and more
and more tired. And we only need
to -- these

04:24.931 --> 04:34.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things to be solved, and to know
what should
we do. We can't, like, only
sleep in the streets.

04:34.975 --> 04:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things to be solved, and to know
what should
we do. We can't, like, only
sleep in the streets.

04:48.822 --> 04:58.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Greece also
recalled its
ambassador to Austria to protest
border restrictions

04:58.865 --> 05:11.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Greece also
recalled its
ambassador to Austria to protest
border restrictions

05:11.945 --> 05:16.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the Austrians and Balkan
states. And Prime
Minister Alexis Tsipras insisted
his country

05:16.583 --> 05:19.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cannot become a warehouse for
refugees.

05:19.619 --> 05:23.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Italy, the national senate
voted to allow
civil unions for gay couples
after a battle

05:23.456 --> 05:28.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that lasted for years. The bill
passed easily
and now goes to the Lower House
of Parliament

05:28.061 --> 05:32.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for final approval. Prime
Minister Matteo
Renzi called the vote historic.
Italy would

05:32.465 --> 05:37.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be the last country in Western
Europe to take
that step. But gay and lesbian
groups denounced

05:37.304 --> 05:41.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the measure because it doesn't
allow gay adoption.

05:41.141 --> 05:46.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, Apple
asked a federal
magistrate to reverse her order
on helping

05:46.313 --> 05:51.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the FBI hack a locked iPhone. It
was used
by one of the killers in the San
Bernardino

05:51.384 --> 05:55.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mass shootings in California.
The company's
court filing accused the
government of seeking

05:55.689 --> 05:59.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dangerous power over digital
privacy.

05:59.059 --> 06:03.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street stayed in the
win column for
a second day. The Dow Jones
industrial average

06:03.296 --> 06:09.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gained 212 points to close near
16700. The
Nasdaq rose nearly 40 points,
and the S&amp;P

06:09.236 --> 06:11.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
500 added almost 22.

06:11.304 --> 06:15.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how Hillary
Clinton and Bernie Sanders fare
among minority

06:15.742 --> 06:22.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters; the tricky diplomacy
surrounding the
Syrian cease-fire; when economic
anxiety meets

06:22.048 --> 06:27.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
politics; and much more.

06:27.520 --> 06:32.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
politics; and much more.

07:07.761 --> 07:14.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This day was a quiet one on the
Republican
campaign trail: five candidates
left, but

07:14.401 --> 07:17.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This day was a quiet one on the
Republican
campaign trail: five candidates
left, but

11:35.061 --> 11:36.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no scheduled events.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, though, they're facing
off in Houston
for debate number 10. Donald
Trump, winner

11:38.631 --> 11:45.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of three straight contests, will
once again
be center stage. The big
question, how the

11:45.271 --> 11:48.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of three straight contests, will
once again
be center stage. The big
question, how the

13:36.849 --> 13:40.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other four candidates try to
slow him down.

13:40.186 --> 13:47.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for the two Democrats, they
were out stumping
today, but hundreds of miles
apart. Hillary

13:47.093 --> 13:51.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton spent the day in South
Carolina, where
Democrats vote this Saturday. In
Kingstree,

13:51.898 --> 13:55.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she stressed one of the central
themes of
her Palmetto State campaign:
equality.

13:55.735 --> 14:01.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I want to break down all the
barriers that

14:01.507 --> 14:06.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stand in the way of people
everywhere in our
country pursuing and achieving
their God-given

14:07.013 --> 14:10.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
potential, because America can't
live up to
its potential unless we remove
the barriers

14:10.283 --> 14:14.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to let every American have the
chance to live
up to his or her potential.

14:14.754 --> 14:18.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Her rival,
Bernie Sanders,
turned his focus away from South
Carolina

14:18.758 --> 14:23.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. He started things off in
Ohio, one
of the many states that vote in
March. From

14:23.129 --> 14:33.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there, he moved on to Flint,
Michigan, the
city still reeling from the
discovery that

14:33.172 --> 14:39.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there, he moved on to Flint,
Michigan, the
city still reeling from the
discovery that

14:39.879 --> 14:42.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its drinking water had been
tainted with lead.

14:42.582 --> 14:46.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
If there's any anything
positive, if there's

14:46.185 --> 14:52.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any silver lining out of this
tragedy, is,
it is my hope that the American
people will

14:52.625 --> 14:59.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look at Flint and say never
again can we allow
a community to undergo this.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

15:01.300 --> 15:07.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On the ground
in South Carolina
today is our own Judy Woodruff,
who joins

15:07.540 --> 15:09.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
us from Columbia.

15:09.208 --> 15:15.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Judy, how important is South
Carolina
for Hillary Clinton's campaign?

15:15.248 --> 15:21.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hi there, Hari,
from across
the street from the state
capitol here in

15:21.187 --> 15:22.922 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Columbia.

15:22.955 --> 15:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's important for Hillary
Clinton. I have
to say, though, that the
expectation is that

15:36.502 --> 15:47.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she clearly is going to win. The
polls all
have her ahead by more than
double -- by double

15:47.647 --> 15:54.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
digits. So it's really a matter
of expectations.
Can she beat that?

15:54.987 --> 15:59.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, I had a professor, a
political science
professor, at the University of
South Carolina

15:59.392 --> 16:04.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say to me today, if she wins by
less than
20 points, it's a moral victory
for Bernie

16:04.797 --> 16:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sanders. That's how far ahead
she is.

16:07.466 --> 16:11.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of that is clearly on the
strength of
the African-American community.
They make

16:11.671 --> 16:18.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
up more than half of the
Democratic primary
vote. And that's going to be in
that report

16:18.110 --> 16:20.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm working on for the
"NewsHour" tomorrow.

16:20.179 --> 16:26.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But her people are working the
state, Hari.
They're not taking it for
granted, but it's

16:26.819 --> 16:28.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all about the margins now for
her.

16:28.955 --> 16:36.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the
Sanders campaign
looks to be doing kind of a
different tactic,

16:36.395 --> 16:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not there nearly as much.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's right.

16:39.999 --> 16:44.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Senator Sanders was here
yesterday, but he
had a morning news conference.
Then he took

16:44.170 --> 16:48.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off for other states, had big
rallies yesterday
out in the Midwest and the
Southwestern U.S.

16:48.574 --> 16:53.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has a strong effort here,
Hari. He was
here in January, but losing
Nevada, coming

16:53.279 --> 16:56.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in five points behind Hillary
Clinton in Nevada
really made a difference.

16:56.883 --> 17:01.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now the Sanders camp say
they are focused
on the Super Tuesday states, the
11 states

17:01.854 --> 17:06.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where Democrats will come out
and vote next
Tuesday. So, they have been very
open about

17:06.626 --> 17:11.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that. It's not that they're
giving up on South
Carolina by any means. They have
got something

17:11.130 --> 17:15.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like 200 people working the
state for them
right now, but their focus is on
the future.

17:15.201 --> 17:21.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's on Missouri. It's on states
like Oklahoma,
where Senator Sanders had that
big turnout

17:21.474 --> 17:28.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last night -- or yesterday -- in
Tulsa. And
they, too, talk about the
margin. They say

17:28.614 --> 17:40.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they don't expect to win here;
they just don't
want to hold down Secretary
Clinton's margin.

17:40.559 --> 17:45.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Do you see and
hear the
evidence on the airwaves, the
political ads,

17:45.731 --> 17:49.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm assuming, on TV and radio as
you travel
through from interview to
interview?

17:49.502 --> 17:51.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You do.

17:51.437 --> 17:54.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see it -- certainly see it
in your hotel
room. People talk about the ads.
Hillary -- Bernie

17:54.573 --> 17:58.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders was on the air here
early, but Hillary
Clinton has stepped up her
advertising in

17:58.911 --> 18:04.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the last week. You see this new
ad they put
on a few days ago featuring the
actor Morgan

18:04.750 --> 18:09.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Freeman with his very
distinctive voice reminding
anybody who's watching that
Hillary Clinton

18:09.121 --> 18:14.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
had been coming to South
Carolina since she
was a law student, recapping her
connection

18:14.293 --> 18:16.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to this state.

18:16.095 --> 18:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That clearly helps her. Sanders
is running
a lot of ads on radio. He spent
over a million

18:21.067 --> 18:25.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dollars, but, at this point, as
we get down
to the vote on Saturday, it's
more of Hillary

18:25.972 --> 18:27.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton on the air.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What are the
issues that
are most important to South
Carolinians now

18:30.843 --> 18:32.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that you're hearing from?

18:32.712 --> 18:35.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hari, it's
probably what you're
hearing in other parts of the
country from

18:35.881 --> 18:37.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats. They talk about the
economy. They
want to see jobs.

18:37.984 --> 18:42.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of discussion about
equality, about
how they feel that part of the
country, part

18:42.288 --> 18:46.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of America has been left out of
the prosperity
we have seen in the recovery
since the financial

18:46.258 --> 18:59.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
collapse. And they -- when you
talk to voters,
they talk about which candidate
is going to

18:59.338 --> 19:10.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be better able to deliver relief
from what
they feel is a growing
inequality.

19:10.316 --> 19:16.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they also bring up who can
beat the Republican
in the fall. They're already
talking about

19:16.655 --> 19:21.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump. They have noticed
how well he's
doing. They want a candidate who
can beat

19:21.794 --> 19:26.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him. And among the candidates --
or among
the voters I have spoken to,
some of them

19:26.165 --> 19:29.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think Hillary Clinton would be
the stronger
candidate against Donald Trump.
Others say

19:29.668 --> 19:31.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that -- Bernie Sanders.

19:31.504 --> 19:35.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I have seen a split in that
way, but these
voters are very practical in
their thinking,

19:36.008 --> 19:40.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I think that may tell you
something about
Super Tuesday as well.

19:40.379 --> 19:46.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Judy Woodruff
on the road in Columbia, South
Carolina, looking

19:46.519 --> 19:50.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forward to your report tomorrow
night. Thanks
so much.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

19:52.258 --> 19:55.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The president
met this afternoon
at the State Department with
members of his

19:55.961 --> 19:59.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national security team to
discuss the fight
against ISIS and the state of
the larger war

19:59.832 --> 20:05.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Syria, as a key deadline
approaches tomorrow
for a cessation of hostilities.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He spoke to reporters moments
ago.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
And none of us are under any
illusions. We're

20:10.910 --> 20:15.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all aware of the many potential
pitfalls.
And there are plenty of reasons
for skepticism.

20:15.781 --> 20:22.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But history would judge us
harshly if we didn't
do our part in at least trying
to end this

20:22.455 --> 20:26.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
terrible conflict with
diplomacy. If implemented
-- and that's a significant if
-- the cessation

20:26.926 --> 20:34.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could reduce the violence and
get more food
and aid to Syrians who are
suffering and desperately

20:34.700 --> 20:36.602 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
need it.

20:36.635 --> 20:41.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It could save lives.
Potentially, it could
also lead to negotiations on a
political settlement

20:41.707 --> 20:46.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to end the civil war, so that
everybody can
focus their attention on
destroying ISIL.

20:46.479 --> 20:50.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why the United States
will do everything
we can to maximize the chances
of success

20:50.983 --> 20:52.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in this cessation of
hostilities.

20:52.818 --> 20:57.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, what are
the realities
for a potential halt to some of
the violence

20:57.423 --> 20:59.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and delivery of much-needed aid
in Syria?

20:59.091 --> 21:00.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner reports.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: There were
definitely mixed
signals of progress before
tomorrow's midnight

21:04.130 --> 21:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cease-fire deadline in Syria.
Aid trucks rolled
into the rebel-held Damascus
suburb of Ghouta

21:08.134 --> 21:10.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yesterday, long besieged by the
Assad regime.

21:10.269 --> 21:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in Syria's east, a U.N.
airdrop of food
went awry. Earlier in the week,
Russia claimed

21:15.441 --> 21:17.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's pared back bombing against
U.S.-backed
rebels.

21:17.576 --> 21:21.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAJ. GEN. IGOR KONASHENKOV,
Russian Ministry
of Defense (through translator):
Russian aviation

21:21.247 --> 21:25.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
performs no strikes in these
regions where
we have received or are
continuing to receive

21:25.918 --> 21:27.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
claims to cease the fire and
start negotiations.

21:27.686 --> 21:30.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But, today,
there were reports
of Russian bombing of rebel-held
areas in

21:30.789 --> 21:33.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syria's northwest and regime
bombing in a
suburb of Damascus.

21:33.058 --> 21:36.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last-ditch agreement,
brokered Monday
by the U.S. and Russia, called
for a -- quote

21:36.896 --> 21:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "cessation of hostilities."
It exempts
operations against ISIS, the
al-Qaida linked

21:40.666 --> 21:43.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jabhat al-Nusra, and terror
groups on a U.N.
list.

21:44.003 --> 21:49.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Syrian government of
President Bashar
Assad has signed on, as have
some rebel groups.

21:49.575 --> 21:54.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the major Saudi-backed
opposition group
said it would commit to just two
weeks.

21:54.947 --> 22:01.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SALEM AL MESLET, High
Negotiations Committee:
To be frank with you, we do not
trust Russia,

22:01.887 --> 22:04.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we do not trust this regime.

22:04.823 --> 22:08.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And U.S. ally
Turkey said
it wants to continue hitting
Syrian Kurds

22:08.761 --> 22:10.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
linked to Turkey's Kurdish
terrorists.

22:10.696 --> 22:15.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The day after it was announced,
in Washington,
senators pressed Secretary of
State John Kerry.

22:15.434 --> 22:17.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I just hope it's not a
rope-a-dope
deal.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.438 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

22:19.471 --> 22:23.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: Well,
it may be. I'm not going to
vouch for this.

22:23.309 --> 22:28.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not going to say this
process is sure
to work, because I don't know.
But I know

22:28.847 --> 22:34.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this is the best way to try
to end the
war, and it's the only
alternative before

22:34.954 --> 22:37.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us, if indeed we're going to
have a political
settlement.

22:37.590 --> 22:40.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Many Syria
experts are skeptical
too. Robert Ford, former
ambassador to Syria,

22:40.626 --> 22:46.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resigned in 2014 over the
president's refusal
to arm the Syrian rebels. Now a
fellow with

22:46.498 --> 22:49.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Middle East Institute in
Washington, he
also teaches at Yale.

22:49.935 --> 22:54.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT FORD, Former U.S.
Ambassador to Syria:
Secretary Kerry has made huge,
huge, huge

22:54.273 --> 23:00.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
efforts, but it's too early to
say if it represents
any progress. The cease-fire is
going to be

23:00.980 --> 23:06.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a huge uphill. The Russians and
the Syrian
regime have incentives to keep
fighting. I

23:06.919 --> 23:10.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't think the war is over by
any means.

23:10.322 --> 23:15.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But Prem Kumar,
who worked
on Syria on the National
Security Council

23:15.894 --> 23:19.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
until last year, says it's an
important first
step.

23:19.064 --> 23:23.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PREM KUMAR, Former National
Security Council
Member: It is an important
process that will

23:23.636 --> 23:28.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hopefully lead to increased
humanitarian assistance,
and then, longer term, if the
process holds,

23:28.140 --> 23:29.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to discussions about the
longer-term political
issues that have bedeviled Syria
for several

23:29.908 --> 23:31.710 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
years now.

23:31.744 --> 23:32.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: He thinks it
marks a welcome
evolution in U.S. thinking, away
from regime

23:32.945 --> 23:34.580 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

23:34.613 --> 23:37.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PREM KUMAR: What is really
important about
this recent initiative is that I
think it

23:37.416 --> 23:43.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
begins to shift from one in
which the U.S.
and its partners were trying to
increase pressure

23:43.922 --> 23:45.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Assad to negotiate his own
departure to
trying to freeze the conflict,
provide humanitarian

23:45.791 --> 23:49.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assistance, and set up a process
to address
the longer-term political
issues.

23:49.295 --> 23:53.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: What has caused
that shift?
The sudden insertion of Russian
bombers and

23:53.599 --> 23:55.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
advisers late last September.

23:55.534 --> 23:58.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): The only right way
to fight international

23:58.904 --> 24:03.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorism in Syria and on the
territory of
the states neighboring it is to
act preemptively.

24:03.809 --> 24:08.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: For months, as
Secretary
Kerry negotiated for a Syria
peace process

24:08.881 --> 24:13.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Russia's foreign minister,
Russian bombers
were dramatically tilting the
battlefield.

24:13.519 --> 24:16.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Five months ago, the rebels were
gaining ground.

24:16.455 --> 24:21.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now Assad's forces have retaken
key areas
in the west and surrounded
Aleppo, Syria's

24:21.060 --> 24:26.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
largest city. And the Islamic
State has expanded
in the east. Ford sees Russia,
along with

24:26.565 --> 24:31.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia,
all backing
different fighting elements, as
exerting far

24:31.704 --> 24:34.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more leverage now than the U.S.

24:34.073 --> 24:39.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT FORD: Russia absolutely
is in the driver's
seat, and the Americans are
watching the car

24:39.678 --> 24:43.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drive by. The Americans are
becoming basically
irrelevant.

24:43.515 --> 24:52.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Former French
Foreign Minister
Laurent Fabius said the U.S.
lost credibility

24:52.791 --> 24:59.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when it didn't follow through on
the President
Obama's threat to strike Syria
for using chemical

24:59.732 --> 25:03.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weapons in 2013. He added, "One
doesn't get
the sense that there is a very
strong commitment.

25:03.969 --> 25:06.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And obviously the Iranians and
Russians feel
that."

25:06.805 --> 25:11.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Indeed, Mr. Obama repeatedly
resisted calls
to arm moderate rebel groups, as
he explained

25:11.677 --> 25:21.120 align:left position:37.5%,start line:86.67% size:62.5%
to
The New York Times in 2014.

25:21.153 --> 25:27.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: It has always been
a fantasy,
this idea that we could provide
some light

25:27.092 --> 25:33.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arms or even more sophisticated
arms to what
was essentially an opposition
made up of former

25:33.065 --> 25:35.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doctors, farmers, pharmacists
and so forth.

25:35.934 --> 25:42.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Mr. Obama's
aides say he
feared arming inexperienced
rebels would draw

25:42.207 --> 25:49.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. down a slippery slope
of deeper military
involvement. But Ford says the
president's

25:49.415 --> 25:51.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unwillingness did just that.

25:51.316 --> 25:58.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT FORD: I think that their
inaction put
us on a slippery slope. Frankly,
we now have

25:58.624 --> 26:03.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American military personnel
operating in Syria,
Margaret. None of us wanted that
in 2011,

26:03.695 --> 26:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2012, in 2013. But now we're
flying combat
operations against the Islamic
State, not

26:07.399 --> 26:10.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syrians taking care of it,
Americans having
to help Syrians take care of it.

26:10.202 --> 26:16.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And, in fact,
the administration
is now asking Congress for
additional funds

26:16.942 --> 26:23.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for those operations. So, what
happens if
this cease-fire fails? On
Tuesday, Kerry hinted

26:23.482 --> 26:25.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that deeper military aid could
be forthcoming.

26:25.951 --> 26:32.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN KERRY: There is a
significant discussion
taking place now about plan B in
the event

26:32.591 --> 26:35.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we don't succeed at the
table.

26:35.060 --> 26:38.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Foreign
Relations Committee
Chair Bob Corker was dubious.

26:38.564 --> 26:44.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BOB CORKER (R), Tennessee:
There is no
plan B. Russia knows there will
be no plan

26:44.636 --> 26:46.371 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
B.

26:46.405 --> 26:50.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT FORD: I saw Secretary
Kerry talk about
plan B. That's nice. We will see
if there's

26:50.843 --> 26:52.778 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
anything there.

26:52.811 --> 26:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Kumar said
there is the possibility
of giving the rebels more
powerful weaponry

26:57.349 --> 27:03.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or creating safe-zones inside
Syria. But even
he doubts how much more the
president will

27:03.822 --> 27:06.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
do in his remaining 11 months.

27:06.358 --> 27:12.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PREM KUMAR: I think it is
unlikely that the
administration is going to do a
180-degree

27:12.498 --> 27:18.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turn in its policy on Syria, but
I think if
the president begins to believe
that there

27:18.704 --> 27:26.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is progress in sight, and that
the U.S. needs
to do more in order to achieve
an end to the

27:26.745 --> 27:30.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conflict, then I think he would
be willing
to consider it.

27:30.349 --> 27:34.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: A long road
ahead that depends
heavily on what happens this
weekend.

27:34.953 --> 27:37.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

27:38.991 --> 27:43.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
the mother
of Columbine shooter Dylan
Klebold came to

27:43.262 --> 27:47.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terms with her son's actions;
the tunnels
that house Tijuana's homeless;
and a poet's

27:47.232 --> 27:49.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
take on the popular term black
girl magic.

27:49.868 --> 27:55.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, first, the economic
recovery may be well
into its sixth year, and the
jobless rate

27:55.073 --> 27:58.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is at its lowest point since
2008. Even so,
it's clear many Americans still
feel plenty

27:58.977 --> 28:04.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of anxiety, either about their
job, their
income, their finances or what
may be happening

28:04.783 --> 28:06.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to their quality of life.

28:06.585 --> 28:10.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman dives
deeper into what's behind that
with the first

28:10.455 --> 28:14.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of two conversations he has on
this subject.
This one features a liberal
perspective, part

28:14.660 --> 28:17.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our weekly series Making
Sense, which airs
every Thursday on the
"NewsHour."

28:17.963 --> 28:19.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AUDIENCE: We love Trump! We love
Trump!

28:19.798 --> 28:22.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Oh, we love you, we love you!

28:22.935 --> 28:23.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

28:23.902 --> 28:25.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Not again, you may
be thinking.

28:25.804 --> 28:28.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to
build a big,
beautiful wall.

28:28.473 --> 28:34.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
There is nothing we cannot
accomplish.

28:34.313 --> 28:39.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Another story on
Trump and Sanders
as political outliers defining
this year's

28:39.885 --> 28:40.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
presidential campaign?

28:40.919 --> 28:43.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're in first
place everywhere.

28:43.255 --> 28:49.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But why have they
taken America
by storm? We put that question
to longtime

28:49.995 --> 28:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
liberal thinker Robert Reich,
friend of Hillary
Clinton since college, secretary
of labor

28:55.434 --> 28:59.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under her husband, Bill, but now
a Bernie
Sanders supporter.

28:59.605 --> 29:05.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you surprised by the turn
America has
taken politically in the last
half-year?

29:05.077 --> 29:11.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT REICH, Former U.S. Labor
Secretary:
I'm surprised at how fast it
happened. I predicted

29:11.883 --> 29:20.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in my book "Saving Capitalism"
that the biggest
political contest in the future
would be between,

29:20.726 --> 29:24.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not Democrats and Republicans,
but between
the anti-establishment populists
and the establishment,

29:24.663 --> 29:32.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because I saw the increase in
this degree
of anxious class, I call it,
anger and frustration

29:32.104 --> 29:35.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the economy and society are
no longer
working for them.

29:35.941 --> 29:41.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Covering economic
developments
in America since the 1970s, I
too have been

29:41.346 --> 29:44.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chronicling this growing anxiety
my entire
career.

29:44.483 --> 29:48.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I met security guard Bobby Hicks
five years
ago.

29:48.487 --> 29:54.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOBBY HICKS, Security Guard: I
am the most
insecure security officer you
will meet, because

29:54.359 --> 29:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm worried. Right now, I live
paycheck to
paycheck.

29:57.062 --> 30:00.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Cookie Sheers is an
administrative
assistant at a Boston nonprofit.

30:00.265 --> 30:02.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COOKIE SHEERS, Administrative
Assistant: We
all feel stuck, like you're just
at that edge

30:02.100 --> 30:07.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of water where you can come up
for air every
few minutes, but never long
enough to feel

30:07.239 --> 30:11.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you have accomplished
something. You
always have to go back down.

30:11.610 --> 30:16.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But anxiety isn't
limited to
the unskilled these days. Mike
Najjar is a

30:16.715 --> 30:18.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lawyer in Lowell, Massachusetts.

30:18.550 --> 30:22.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE NAJJAR, Attorney: I feel
like I'm in
quicksand, not getting ahead,
not having any

30:22.521 --> 30:24.222 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
growth.

30:24.256 --> 30:28.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I don't feel like I'm
getting ahead at
all. As a matter of fact, I was
laid off.

30:29.027 --> 30:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: After 40 years in
the book business,
does Brian McCormick (ph) have a
job now?

30:34.566 --> 30:41.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I do. I do. I'm punching a
cash register
like I did when I was 22 years
old.

30:41.073 --> 30:44.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: As recent college
graduate Biola
Jeje puts it:

30:44.776 --> 30:50.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BIOLA JEJE, Recent Graduate:
Take all this
debt, get an education, and have
it lead nowhere,

30:50.782 --> 30:57.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to like no sustainable
employment, no job
with health benefits or pensions
or any of

30:57.089 --> 30:59.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that, just be out on their own.

30:59.291 --> 31:04.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT REICH: I'm in an Uber,
part of the
explosion in the so-called
sharing economy.

31:04.963 --> 31:06.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This very group includes
independent contractors,
free agents, temporary workers,
the self-employed.

31:06.898 --> 31:12.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Work without
employee benefits,
one of the topics Reich tackles
in a series

31:13.004 --> 31:18.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of videos made with the
so-called progressive
group MoveOn.org.

31:18.610 --> 31:24.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT REICH: It's estimated
that, in five
years, over 40 percent of the
American labor

31:24.249 --> 31:31.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force will be in such uncertain
work, in a
decade, most of us. This shifts
all the risks

31:31.089 --> 31:32.824 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
onto workers.

31:32.858 --> 31:38.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Workers like Uber
driver Kim
Miller, who has to pay for her
own car and

31:38.563 --> 31:40.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all related expenses.

31:40.298 --> 31:45.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KIM MILLER, Uber Driver:
Sometimes, I have
days where I do only maybe
around $12, $15

31:46.004 --> 31:50.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an hour, and I come home feeling
like I wasted
my time.

31:50.709 --> 31:56.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Or retail clerks
like Melody
Pabon, who don't know when they
will work,

31:56.615 --> 32:00.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or for how many hours, from one
week to the
next.

32:00.519 --> 32:06.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELODY PABON, Retail Clerk: Am I
going to
be playing juggling with my
money, and work

32:06.424 --> 32:12.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two days a week, three days a
week, four days
a week not knowing?

32:12.330 --> 32:18.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT REICH: No wonder,
according to polls,
almost a quarter of American
workers worry

32:18.270 --> 32:25.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they won't have enough to live
on in the future.
That's up from 15 percent a
decade ago.

32:25.076 --> 32:29.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And you see it
playing out politically
in both parties, right?

32:29.981 --> 32:36.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT REICH: In both parties.
You have got
a large number of people in
America, in the

32:36.488 --> 32:41.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
middle class, who are working
harder than
ever, but they're angry and
frustrated because

32:41.226 --> 32:45.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're not getting ahead. Their
wages are
either stagnating or actually
dropping. Their

32:45.463 --> 32:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jobs are less secure. Two-thirds
are living
paycheck to paycheck.

32:48.567 --> 32:52.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: When you say
paycheck to paycheck,
the latest data as of this week
were that

32:52.838 --> 33:03.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
63 percent of Americans didn't
have more than
$500 socked away for a sudden
expense.

33:03.281 --> 33:11.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT REICH: Almost nothing
socked away.
Black and minority Americans on
average have

33:11.122 --> 33:16.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
literally nothing socked away
for an emergency.
And some people in the middle
class, particularly

33:16.661 --> 33:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the lower middle class, look
to poor people
and say, well, they're getting
all these benefits.

33:21.199 --> 33:22.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm the one who's stuck.

33:22.434 --> 33:24.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: Happy holidays, uncle
Bob.

33:24.035 --> 33:25.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBERT REICH: What's good about
them?

33:26.004 --> 33:30.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: People like
conservative uncle
Bob, portrayed by Reich himself
in this video.

33:30.542 --> 33:35.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT REICH: I'm paying too
much in taxes
to support poor people who are
sitting on

33:35.714 --> 33:36.681 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their duffs.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Meanwhile, in the
left-wing camp:

33:38.383 --> 33:42.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT REICH: People are caught
in a vise,
and they feel like the game is
rigged.

33:42.420 --> 33:46.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Are they
overstating it? Are
they picking up on something
that's real?

33:46.591 --> 33:48.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBERT REICH: Unfortunately, the
game is rigged.

33:48.727 --> 33:52.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just over a year ago, two
political scientists,
one from Princeton, one from
Northwestern,

33:52.564 --> 34:02.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gilens and Page, did a study
looking very
carefully at about over 2,000
policy issues.

34:02.407 --> 34:12.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And their conclusion was that
the wealthy
and big corporations and Wall
Street were

34:12.450 --> 34:20.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And their conclusion was that
the wealthy
and big corporations and Wall
Street were

34:20.525 --> 34:26.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the only ones that had any
influence.

34:26.932 --> 34:33.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The average American had
literally no influence
at all.

34:33.805 --> 34:40.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to an investigation by
The New York
Times, half of all the money
contributed so

34:40.178 --> 34:44.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
far to Democratic and Republican
presidential
candidates, $176 million, has
come from just

34:44.883 --> 34:47.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
158 families, along with the
companies they
own or control.

34:47.152 --> 34:50.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I used to think -- and I used to
write about
it -- inequality as being the
result of globalization,

34:50.956 --> 34:54.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
technological change. But what
has happened,
particularly over the last 20
years, is that

34:54.793 --> 35:00.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there is a third factor,
political power.
It is this vicious cycle of the
wealthy and

35:00.932 --> 35:04.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big corporations and Wall Street
getting rule
changes, legal changes that
advantage them

35:04.569 --> 35:07.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and really disadvantage most
other people.

35:07.038 --> 35:14.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: When you talk to a
rich person
who doesn't agree with you
politically, what

35:14.145 --> 35:16.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do you say to them?

35:16.381 --> 35:22.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT REICH: I say, you have a
stake in raising
wages, in expanding the middle
class, and

35:22.253 --> 35:25.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more Americans doing better,
because then
you will do better. Who are your
customers,

35:25.557 --> 35:27.258 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
after all?

35:27.292 --> 35:31.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE BARRANT, Unemployed: The
top 1 percent
is living well, and they don't
get it.

35:31.696 --> 35:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Denise Barrant, a
self-described
conservative Republican, was
unemployed and

35:34.966 --> 35:36.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in foreclosure in 2011.

35:36.735 --> 35:40.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE BARRANT: There's tons of
people like
myself out there who are
well-educated, who

35:40.305 --> 35:44.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have had good jobs, who are sort
of the middle
management people, but they have
outsourced

35:44.676 --> 35:49.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our jobs, and the top people are
still making
a lot of money and then
congratulating themselves

35:49.748 --> 35:51.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at how efficient they have been.

35:51.549 --> 35:56.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The term that gets
turned around
over and over again is the
American dream.

35:56.688 --> 36:01.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it doesn't seem as if that's
anywhere
near as true now as in the past.

36:01.826 --> 36:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT REICH: No. This is a
country that prided
itself on upward mobility, on
rags to riches,

36:08.833 --> 36:11.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on Horatio Alger stories.

36:11.636 --> 36:15.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's only over the last two
years that you
see polls saying most Americans
believe that

36:15.707 --> 36:21.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their children are not going to
live as well
as they lived. This is new,
Paul. This is

36:21.479 --> 36:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
counter to our tradition and our
history.

36:24.449 --> 36:30.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Which may help
explain why this
has been, thus far, such an
untraditional

36:30.722 --> 36:32.123 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election year.

36:32.157 --> 36:36.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
economics
correspondent Paul Solman.

36:36.394 --> 36:40.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the coming
weeks, Paul
will return with a second
conversation, from

36:41.032 --> 36:44.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a well-known conservative
thinker and writer,
Charles Murray.

36:44.069 --> 36:53.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now: coming to terms with a
beloved son-turned-killer
in a mass murder that would
shock the nation.

36:53.111 --> 36:58.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has this latest
addition to
the "NewsHour" bookshelf.

36:58.149 --> 37:02.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A warning: The conversation
grapples with
subjects that may be upsetting
to some viewers.

37:02.821 --> 37:06.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: April 20, 1999,
Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colorado.

37:06.458 --> 37:11.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two seniors, Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold,
walked into the school armed
with weapons

37:11.096 --> 37:15.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and homemade bombs. Less than an
hour later,
12 students and one teacher were
dead, 24

37:15.967 --> 37:19.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students injured, and the two
shooters had
turned the guns on themselves.

37:19.437 --> 37:23.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a searing time for the
community, for
the victims' families, and for
the nation.

37:23.475 --> 37:27.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seventeen years later, Sue
Klebold, the mother
of Dylan, writes of a son she
thought she

37:27.846 --> 37:32.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knew, the parent she thought she
was, a tragedy
and its aftermath. Her new book
is, "A Mother's

37:32.450 --> 37:33.284 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Reckoning."

37:33.318 --> 37:34.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sue Klebold joins us now from
Denver.

37:34.986 --> 37:36.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sue Klebold, welcome to you.

37:36.888 --> 37:42.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You write early in this book:
"The ordinariness
of our lives before Columbine
will perhaps

37:42.293 --> 37:49.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be the hardest thing for people
to understand
about my story. For me, it is
also the most

37:49.467 --> 37:50.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
important."

37:50.335 --> 37:52.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why is that the most important
thing?

37:53.004 --> 37:56.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUE KLEBOLD, Author, "A Mother's
Reckoning:
Living in the Aftermath of
Tragedy": Because

37:56.608 --> 37:59.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want people to understand
that, if someone
is struggling with thoughts of
suicide or,

37:59.511 --> 38:01.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in some cases, homicide, that
these issues
can be hidden.

38:01.646 --> 38:08.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we should all try to be more
mindful of
what our loved ones are
thinking, what might

38:08.086 --> 38:14.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
be hidden behind their
expressions, and how
their behaviors can lie if
they're very sophisticated

38:14.692 --> 38:17.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at hiding what they're thinking
and feeling.

38:17.762 --> 38:23.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In fact, just
days before the
shooting, Dylan went to the
prom. You write

38:23.868 --> 38:29.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of seeing him as he came home.
And you write
of saying to yourself that
night, "I have

38:29.374 --> 38:31.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
done a good job with this kid."

38:31.609 --> 38:34.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You truly believed that at that
moment?

38:34.145 --> 38:37.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUE KLEBOLD: I truly believed
that at that
moment.

38:37.448 --> 38:44.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I felt that he had -- he had had
a good year,
a good evening. I felt that he
was contented

38:44.722 --> 38:50.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that he was healthy and that
he was moving
forward with his life.

38:50.094 --> 38:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The questions
from everyone,
of course, whether in sorrow or
anger or just

38:55.767 --> 39:01.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
utter confusion, is, how could
you not have
known, right? How could you not
have known

39:01.673 --> 39:06.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that your son was so troubled
that he was
capable of something like this?

39:06.878 --> 39:11.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you write about incidents
along the way,
which, in retrospect, might have
said something.

39:11.783 --> 39:16.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But how do you answer that
question, how could
you not have known?

39:16.621 --> 39:20.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUE KLEBOLD: Sometimes, teen
behaviors, such
as sullenness, maybe differing
sleep patterns,

39:21.025 --> 39:26.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe they sleep too much or too
little, these
can all be perceived as normal
teen behaviors.

39:26.698 --> 39:31.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dylan did get into trouble in
his junior year
of high school, and he stole
something. He

39:31.402 --> 39:36.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got in trouble at school. He
scratched a locker.
Those were indicators that
something might

39:36.074 --> 39:40.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be wrong, but, at that time, I
wasn't aware
that those could be indicators
of depression

39:40.979 --> 39:47.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or possibly some kind of brain
health issue.

39:47.418 --> 39:53.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what did happen after that
was, he promised
us that he would get his life on
track, and

39:53.124 --> 39:59.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he did. He had a full 14 months
after that,
from that moment until the
tragedy, where

39:59.864 --> 40:08.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was doing all the things a
healthy person
would do. He was going to
school. He held

40:08.539 --> 40:12.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a job. He had applied at four
colleges.

40:12.377 --> 40:20.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just the weekend before the
tragedy, he picked
out his dorm room for college,
and he went

40:20.551 --> 40:29.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to a prom with 12 of his
friends, came home
and told me he had the best time
of his life.

40:29.127 --> 40:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are not behaviors that one
would expect
of someone who is preparing to
die or to kill.

40:35.967 --> 40:43.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, perhaps the
roughest
chapter, at least for me in my
reading, was

40:43.741 --> 40:49.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one titled "The End of Denial,"
and because
you write about the denial that
you were in

40:49.847 --> 40:53.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a long time after the --
after the shootings,
after the killings, even six
months afterwards,

40:53.951 --> 40:58.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until you were shown evidence by
the police,
walked through the timeline of
what happened,

40:58.289 --> 41:04.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see exactly what Dylan had done
in shooting
individuals, what he said to
them, and kind

41:04.362 --> 41:11.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of realizing for the first time
that he had
not been coerced, that he had
not been duped,

41:11.169 --> 41:16.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he had not been whatever it
was you thought,
right?

41:16.207 --> 41:24.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUE KLEBOLD: Well, as you said,
up until that
point, knowing Dylan and knowing
the kind

41:24.349 --> 41:34.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of person he was, those of us
who loved him
and knew him didn't believe he
was capable

41:34.058 --> 41:37.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of intentionally harming people
or killing
people.

41:37.095 --> 41:43.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we clung to beliefs, such as
you suggested,
that he had been coerced or
tricked, or that

41:43.568 --> 41:53.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this was a prank that had
somehow gone wrong.
Six months after the tragedy,
when I was finally

41:54.011 --> 42:04.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shown the evidence at the
sheriff's department,
and we saw things such as the
basement tapes,

42:04.422 --> 42:10.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we saw photographs of some of
their weapons,
I remember being -- feeling just
ill.

42:10.495 --> 42:20.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I stood up and thought I was
going to be sick.
I -- it was such a shock to me,
because it

42:20.938 --> 42:27.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't make sense that the child
that I loved
could actually be doing those
things or could

42:27.245 --> 42:32.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have planned to do those things.
And, for
me, that was almost the
beginning of grief

42:32.383 --> 42:38.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all over again, because I had to
grieve for
a different human being than I
had loved before.

42:38.656 --> 42:43.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You focus later
on, on the
suicide aspect to this, not
pushing aside

42:43.494 --> 42:47.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the murder aspect, but the
suicide of your
own son, which really forces and
focuses the

42:47.899 --> 42:49.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
issue on depression.

42:49.700 --> 42:55.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, explain that. What, in the
end, do you
-- what, in the end, do you
think led him

42:55.039 --> 42:56.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to commit these atrocities?

42:56.841 --> 43:00.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUE KLEBOLD: I think, when we
look at suicide,
and we look at murder-suicide as
one small

43:00.978 --> 43:08.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
subset of suicidal acts, we have
to understand
that this is a very complex
issue, that there

43:08.886 --> 43:12.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are no simple answers or simple
reasons or
explanations.

43:12.657 --> 43:18.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The things that occur for
someone to experience
that level of suicidality, they
are things

43:18.863 --> 43:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
such as biological factors,
genetic factors,
environmental factors, both the
home, the

43:22.834 --> 43:26.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school, the culture, personality
factors,
and also triggering factors,
such as events

43:26.537 --> 43:31.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that occur, losses, bullying,
arrests. And
it is all of those things
working together

43:31.175 --> 43:33.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
operating for that one
vulnerable person.

43:33.177 --> 43:38.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when someone begins to
deteriorate, when
their thoughts are becoming
suicidal, they

43:38.749 --> 43:45.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are in the process of losing
access to their
own tools of self-governments,
of conscience,

43:45.256 --> 43:47.024 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of reason.

43:47.058 --> 43:50.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they reach a state where
they are not
thinking the way the rest of us
are thinking,

43:50.995 --> 43:56.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if we are healthy. They don't
have the same
decision points. And I believe
that Dylan's

43:56.601 --> 44:04.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brain health was the reason that
he was involved.
He wasn't able to act in a way
that he would

44:04.942 --> 44:07.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have if he were not unwell.

44:07.445 --> 44:12.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You write often
here of the
victims, of their families, of
the pain that

44:12.917 --> 44:15.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you have felt from the
beginning.

44:15.086 --> 44:19.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're donating your profits, I
understand,
from the book to charitable
organizations

44:19.423 --> 44:24.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that look at mental health
issues. But why
write the book at all? Why in
the first place?

44:24.428 --> 44:25.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know that, from the moment
this happened
until now, people wonder about
you, wonder

44:25.863 --> 44:29.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about -- probably wonder now
about the motives
in writing the book.

44:29.300 --> 44:31.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why did you want to do it?

44:31.669 --> 44:38.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUE KLEBOLD: The reasons for me,
I think,
were primarily because people
who knew me

44:38.409 --> 44:45.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or knew Dylan or knew our story
would give
me feedback that they were
affected, that

44:45.082 --> 44:47.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their parenting changed because
of this.

44:47.418 --> 44:53.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had met an individual, among
many individuals,
one who had problems with a
youngster who

44:53.658 --> 45:00.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was 13, and her daughter acted a
little bit
different, a little bit more
withdrawn. And

45:00.798 --> 45:07.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the mother told me, "Because I
know you and
because I know that kids can
hide things and

45:07.405 --> 45:13.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of the things that they
hide can be lethal,"
she explored. She dug into the
kid's life,

45:13.878 --> 45:19.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asked her daughter repeatedly
and in depth,
and finally was able to learn
from her daughter

45:19.884 --> 45:25.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that she had been raped while
she had left
the house once when she wasn't
supposed to.

45:25.456 --> 45:31.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I feel that we all have --
the most important
thing we can do is accept the
concept that

45:31.495 --> 45:38.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone we love may not be
feeling inside
the way they present to us, and
that is a

45:38.703 --> 45:42.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responsibility we have as
parents and family
members to try to help them, to
try to elicit

45:42.607 --> 45:46.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from them what they're
experiencing and to
-- and if we do learn that they
are having

45:46.143 --> 45:51.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suicidal thoughts or other
thoughts that are
symptomatic of illness, to get
them help.

45:51.916 --> 45:53.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

45:53.417 --> 45:58.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The book is "A Mother's
Reckoning: Living
in the Aftermath of Tragedy."

45:58.222 --> 45:59.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sue Klebold. Thank you very
much.

45:59.457 --> 46:01.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUE KLEBOLD: Thank you.

46:01.325 --> 46:04.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Among the
homeless population
in Tijuana, Mexico, are migrants
on the way

46:04.228 --> 46:11.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the U.S. And because of
police raids, they're
living in a rival canal, hiding
in the canal's

46:11.035 --> 46:12.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
branching tunnels.

46:12.937 --> 46:17.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KPBS Fronteras reporter Jean
Guerrero went
inside the tunnels to learn
about the struggles

46:17.942 --> 46:19.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these migrants face.

46:19.243 --> 46:23.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A warning: Some of the images in
this story
may be disturbing.

46:23.547 --> 46:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: Jose Alberto
Zavala is one
of hundreds of migrants living
inside the

46:28.352 --> 46:32.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tijuana River Canal's tunnels.
He says he
doesn't feel safe anywhere else.

46:32.490 --> 46:37.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE ALBERTO ZAVALA, Migrant
(through translator):
They see us outside and the
police pick us

46:37.962 --> 46:39.764 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

46:39.797 --> 46:44.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: Zavala is known
as Chapo, like
the Mexican drug lord, because
of his short

46:44.402 --> 46:49.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stature. But the similarities
pretty much
end there. He recently rescued
this cat from

46:49.240 --> 46:51.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the side of the road.

46:51.042 --> 46:55.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE ALBERTO ZAVALA (through
translator):
She's a girl. The other day, I
banged myself

46:55.813 --> 46:59.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up because the police were
trying to put me
in one of the rehab centers. But
that's a

46:59.884 --> 47:05.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kidnapping. What they do is a
violation of
human rights.

47:05.389 --> 47:10.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: For years,
Tijuana's homeless
were living out in the open, in
makeshift

47:10.961 --> 47:14.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tents in a Tijuana River Canal
encampment
known as El Bordo.

47:14.432 --> 47:17.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, last spring, the municipal
government
evacuated the encampment,
placing hundreds

47:17.902 --> 47:22.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of people into rehab centers,
many against
their will. Officials say the
migrants were

47:22.339 --> 47:26.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hurting tourism and committing
crimes. Many
were using heroin or
methamphetamine after

47:26.110 --> 47:29.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being deported from the U.S.,
where they had
families and jobs.

47:29.480 --> 47:35.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some, like Chapo, say they don't
do drugs
at all, but were sent to rehab
anyway. Since

47:35.453 --> 47:39.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then, hundreds have escaped or
were released
from these facilities. They're
now hiding

47:40.024 --> 47:46.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the storm drains. Police
sometimes track
them down and place them back in
rehab. Others

47:46.397 --> 47:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are taken to jail or put on
buses out of town.

47:49.934 --> 47:56.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police raids of the canal are
sometimes proving
fatal. The canal is flanked by
Tijuana's busiest

47:56.440 --> 48:02.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
highways, and when the migrants
run from the
police, some are killed by cars
speeding past.

48:02.913 --> 48:08.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just last month, at least two
were killed
trying to escape police.

48:08.185 --> 48:14.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chapo has erected memorial
wooden crosses
for several friends he says he
lost during

48:14.225 --> 48:15.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
police raids.

48:15.893 --> 48:20.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE ALBERTO ZAVALA (through
translator):
The 18th, also chapitas, and the
guy from

48:20.197 --> 48:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Oaxaca. But I don't know why.

48:22.566 --> 48:27.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: Chapo says the
police sometimes
arrest migrants when they're
just standing

48:27.671 --> 48:33.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the street, trying to find
work in construction,
or washing car windshields with
dirty rags.

48:33.944 --> 48:41.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A migrant who called himself
Carlos Francisco
says he was run over by a car
while running

48:41.085 --> 48:48.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across the highway during a
police raid two
days prior. He was injured so
badly, he couldn't

48:48.192 --> 48:49.693 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
walk.

48:49.727 --> 48:54.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says the police came while he
and his friends
were sleeping in the canal.

48:54.899 --> 48:59.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): They
come and grab
us. They -- they beat us.

48:59.303 --> 49:04.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: Another man had a
large gash
on his head from where he says
police threw

49:04.842 --> 49:07.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him against the asphalt during
the same raid.

49:07.511 --> 49:13.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tijuana's police chief,
Alejandro Lares, defends
his policy of flushing everybody
out of the

49:13.551 --> 49:19.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
canal. He says he is planning a
full-scale
clearing operation in the coming
weeks.

49:19.356 --> 49:22.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEJANDRO LARES VALLADARES,
Tijuana, Mexico,
Police Chief: We're going to
take over the

49:22.626 --> 49:24.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
whole ravine on Tijuana.

49:24.395 --> 49:27.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: The federal
government has
jurisdiction over the canal, but
the Tijuana

49:27.965 --> 49:30.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police Department has permission
to patrol
the area.

49:30.801 --> 49:34.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEJANDRO LARES VALLADARES: It's
a no-man's
land. So, for that, it's easier
for them to

49:34.605 --> 49:37.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
buy drugs, sell drugs, and
obviously to consume
drugs.

49:37.908 --> 49:43.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: Lares says he has
ordered 14
all-terrain vehicles to patrol
the canal.

49:43.047 --> 49:48.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He expects them to arrive any
day now. When
asked about alleged police
beatings, he says

49:48.619 --> 49:51.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
migrants should file complaints
so that he
can investigate.

49:51.088 --> 49:55.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEJANDRO LARES VALLADARES: I'm
not going
to tolerate any abuse from an
officer to a

49:55.826 --> 49:57.628 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
citizen.

49:57.661 --> 50:01.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: Migrants say they
think filing
complaints would do them more
harm than good.

50:01.832 --> 50:04.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They fear being arrested if they
confront
police.

50:04.602 --> 50:09.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in the tunnels, Chapo says
the current
strategy of removing migrants
from the canal

50:09.340 --> 50:15.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
makes life so hard for them,
they have no
choice but to turn to petty
crimes, which

50:15.379 --> 50:17.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can get them arrested. It's a
vicious cycle.

50:17.882 --> 50:22.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE ALBERTO ZAVALA (through
translator):
They kick you and say, you have
to come with

50:22.152 --> 50:27.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them. Why? Because you don't
have an I.D.
You shouldn't be sleeping here.
Where do you

50:27.157 --> 50:33.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want me to sleep if you don't
let me work?
If I go collect cans, you pick
me up. If I

50:33.998 --> 50:36.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go to the dumpster, you pick me
up.

50:36.600 --> 50:41.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: He doesn't think
Tijuana officials
will ever succeed in ridding the
city of homeless

50:41.605 --> 50:43.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
migrants.

50:43.507 --> 50:46.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE ALBERTO ZAVALA (through
translator):
This is the border. There will
always be migrants,

50:46.544 --> 50:48.312 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
always, always.

50:48.345 --> 50:52.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: But as police
raids of the
canal become more sophisticated
and frequent,

50:52.249 --> 50:54.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the tunnel dwellers face a
growing challenge.

50:54.718 --> 50:57.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jean
Guerrero
in Tijuana.

50:57.755 --> 51:03.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Next, we turn
to our year-long
series Race Matters.

51:03.494 --> 51:07.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, special correspondent
Charlayne Hunter-Gault
sits down with Bethann Hardison,
a former

51:07.398 --> 51:10.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
model and current owner of a New
York modeling
agency.

51:10.401 --> 51:15.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Hollywood comes under fire
for the lack
of diversity, Hardison shares
her solution

51:15.172 --> 51:17.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for making the fashion industry
more inclusive.

51:17.141 --> 51:22.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: For
generations, this
was the face of the fashion
industry, beautiful

51:22.546 --> 51:35.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
models in stunning designer
outfits, but that
face came to be almost always
white, with

51:35.960 --> 51:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a few notable exceptions, like
Naomi Campbell
and Iman.

51:42.866 --> 51:48.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Enter Bethann Hardison, herself
a former model,
who decided that just wasn't
good enough.

51:48.505 --> 51:53.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I caught up with her at her home
base in New
York City.

51:53.677 --> 51:56.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bethann Hardison, thank you for
joining us.

51:56.447 --> 52:00.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETHANN HARDISON, Modeling
Agency Owner: Thank
you for having me.

52:00.417 --> 52:05.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You
know, we have
seen all the beautiful models
like Beverly

52:05.723 --> 52:12.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Johnson, Iman, even yourself in
magazines
for many years, but there
weren't many of

52:12.730 --> 52:13.530 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

52:13.564 --> 52:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why was that? What was that
like?

52:16.166 --> 52:18.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETHANN HARDISON: Well, there
were many back
in the day.

52:18.535 --> 52:23.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, back in the '70s and
'80s, there was
a great deal between runway and
print. And

52:23.741 --> 52:28.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then, by, say, 2000 -- well,
'80s and the
'90s, it was pretty good. And
then by '90,

52:28.245 --> 52:29.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mid-'90s, it just began to
disappear.

52:30.014 --> 52:32.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a change of the industry
because of
the Eastern European models
start to come

52:32.082 --> 52:33.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in. Things just changed. The
business changed.

52:33.851 --> 52:37.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, this
influx of
non-black people, non-women of
color really

52:37.688 --> 52:40.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decimated the ranks of black
models on the
runway?

52:40.991 --> 52:46.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETHANN HARDISON: It definitely
did. It changed
everything. And when they began
to bring in

52:46.497 --> 52:52.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more girls from outside, what
changed greatly
was the body alignment of the
Eastern European

52:52.536 --> 52:58.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
girls, because the hips are very
narrow, the
bodies are very long. And that
discovery was

52:58.609 --> 53:00.210 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
something else.

53:00.244 --> 53:07.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What was
wrong with
that, and what did you do about
it?

53:07.584 --> 53:13.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETHANN HARDISON: So, what I did
is, I got
encouraged to, please, do
something. And I

53:13.190 --> 53:18.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thought it, and had the first
press conference,
which was in 2007, and pulled
together editors,

53:18.228 --> 53:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
models, people who basically
represented models,
everyone, writers, in a room of
86 seats,

53:22.699 --> 53:25.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and sat down and discussed the
whole situation.

53:25.035 --> 53:29.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And so
you moved from
being a model to a muse to a
revolutionary.

53:29.173 --> 53:30.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

53:30.941 --> 53:34.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You
called out some
of the most famous designers in
the world

53:34.611 --> 53:39.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of fashion. Did you tell them
they were perpetuating
racism?

53:39.616 --> 53:43.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BETHANN HARDISON: No, I didn't
say that exactly.

53:43.987 --> 53:49.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I said is that the -- no
matter what
your intention is, the result is
racism, so

53:49.560 --> 53:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that if they felt like, well, I
mean, I don't
-- I'm not a racist. Well, I
didn't say you

53:56.500 --> 54:01.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were a racist. I said the act of
eliminating
one race, or not being
inclusive, the result

54:01.672 --> 54:06.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is racism. If you consistently
demonstrate
you not being inclusive, then
the result is

54:06.210 --> 54:07.845 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
racism.

54:07.878 --> 54:10.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, what
was their
reaction, and what happened as a
result?

54:10.447 --> 54:15.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETHANN HARDISON: What I had
done is written
this letter specifically to the
councils of

54:15.385 --> 54:19.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fashion in each fashion city, so
the councils
of fashion got the letter.

54:19.957 --> 54:27.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all the names were written
on each one,
so that's London, Paris, Milan,
and New York.

54:27.364 --> 54:34.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I, before -- as they got
the letter,
I had already spoken to the
press, at the

54:34.471 --> 54:40.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
same time they were getting the
letter, so
the press, which was Women's
Wear Daily, which

54:40.577 --> 54:43.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is our trade paper, contacted
each one of
them.

54:43.714 --> 54:49.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
British was very good. She said,
we have issues
with this ourselves. We would
like you to

54:49.119 --> 54:55.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be able to have you come in and
speak to us.
The Italians said, we never had
this as an

54:55.492 --> 54:57.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issue because no one ever
brought this to
our attention before.

54:58.028 --> 55:05.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Parisians laughed it off.
And New York
said, she knows us. Why couldn't
she have

55:05.435 --> 55:07.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spoken to us directly? She knows
us.

55:07.971 --> 55:13.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, why
did you think
you had to go the way you went,
as opposed

55:13.043 --> 55:15.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to knowing them and speaking to
them like
they said?

55:15.112 --> 55:20.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETHANN HARDISON: When you have
an issue that
big, you have to come, you know,
in a sense

55:20.517 --> 55:23.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it is that serious. It's
not a personal
conversation.

55:23.120 --> 55:27.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once it went -- one publication
picked it
up, then it became important,
that other news

55:27.991 --> 55:35.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medias picked it up, and it
became a very
important issue because it was
done in such

55:35.098 --> 55:36.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a strong way.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But why
was it important?
People would say, oh, they're
just talking

55:38.735 --> 55:40.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about fashion. That's just
something people
play with.

55:40.504 --> 55:42.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETHANN HARDISON: Because of the
fact that
fashion is no longer just in our
tiny island

55:42.606 --> 55:44.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that no one knows anything
about.

55:44.741 --> 55:50.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now it's part of popular
culture. Now it's
influencing young people. Anyone
now is involved

55:50.047 --> 55:52.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with fashion. It's beginning to
show people
what things should look like.
It's giving

55:52.382 --> 55:56.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you the idea of what we see, how
we act, how
we be when it comes down to
race.

55:56.253 --> 55:58.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: All
right, when you
look beyond the fashion industry
and you look

55:58.422 --> 56:01.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the fact that so many -- so
much in the
corporate world is still
dominated by white

56:01.325 --> 56:04.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
males, how much of the solution
that you came
up with can be adapted to other
-- to the

56:04.828 --> 56:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
corporate world and to other
areas, where
-- that it's like even
Hollywood, where you

56:09.633 --> 56:11.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have got major problems with
diversity?

56:11.668 --> 56:15.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What about what you did is
applicable in those
situations?

56:15.138 --> 56:20.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETHANN HARDISON: Because now,
slowly, my
industry is beginning to become
more inclusive.

56:20.744 --> 56:30.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you begin to see in
magazines that
they are now becoming more
inclusive, when

56:30.787 --> 56:40.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you begin to see in
magazines that
they are now becoming more
inclusive, when

56:41.031 --> 56:48.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you start to see runway shows,
you start to
see blacks, girls, guys, it
begins to remind

56:48.705 --> 56:54.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people that it's OK, it doesn't
hurt, it's
not going to make you sick. It's
not a disease

56:54.845 --> 56:56.680 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be inclusive.

56:56.713 --> 57:01.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But I
guess my question
is, in terms of the tactics that
you used,

57:01.418 --> 57:08.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what would you offer as a
solution to parts
of our society that are not
inclusive and

57:08.625 --> 57:11.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not as diverse as they should
be?

57:11.595 --> 57:15.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BETHANN HARDISON: That's a very
good question.

57:15.465 --> 57:22.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the only thing I can
answer is, everyone
has to be responsible. Everyone
has to think

57:23.006 --> 57:29.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
twice about it. And I have to
remind people
that people who are privileged
are the first

57:29.313 --> 57:33.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ones who say: Why do we always
have to talk
about race? What is the problem?
I don't see

57:33.950 --> 57:39.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what is the problem. Race, we're
always bringing
up race. I mean, I really don't
see a problem

57:39.723 --> 57:41.591 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with it.

57:41.625 --> 57:43.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a privileged attitude.
And when you
think -- if you don't think that
you're privileged,

57:43.260 --> 57:45.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you say that, that makes you
privileged, because
there is a problem.

57:45.862 --> 57:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So you
have to stay
on the case.

57:49.566 --> 57:53.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETHANN HARDISON: Yes. You never
can take
your foot off the gas.

57:53.837 --> 57:56.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And this
would apply
to the corporate world, as well
as to the

57:56.239 --> 57:58.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
world of fashion?

57:58.442 --> 58:04.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETHANN HARDISON: Everything.
Can we all stop
thinking so consciously about
race, or should

58:04.581 --> 58:10.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we consciously think about race?
Yes, I think
we should consciously think
about race.

58:10.654 --> 58:16.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And you
need people
like yourself in the corporate
world taking

58:16.326 --> 58:18.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the kinds of positions you took?

58:18.161 --> 58:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETHANN HARDISON: I think also
not only people
like myself. I think I need more
white people

58:23.533 --> 58:29.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like myself, who think like I
do, and not
be afraid to speak up and say,
I'm sorry.

58:29.239 --> 58:35.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to have some. Let's
change some of
this, because it happens in my
industry.

58:35.045 --> 58:43.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do I want it to be all black?
No, I want diversity,
because I think, once you
diversify, it reminds

58:43.920 --> 58:49.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people gently how the world
looks, not -- don't
book a model because she's
black. Book a model

58:49.292 --> 58:55.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
because she's undeniably
beautiful. That's
for him and for her. Then we can
compete with

58:55.232 --> 58:57.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our white counterpart.

58:57.134 --> 59:02.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's not just the black
model I'm fighting
for. I'm fighting for any
fashion model that

59:02.739 --> 59:08.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is non-Caucasian, because the
Caucasian kid
is good. She's got it. She can
run. I'm looking

59:08.178 --> 59:20.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for everyone else who makes up
-- I want the
world to look like when I walk
out on the

59:20.690 --> 59:26.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
street. This is not a Woody
Allen movie.

59:26.363 --> 59:30.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
Bethann Hardison,
thank you for joining us.

59:30.801 --> 59:35.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETHANN HARDISON: And thank you
for having
me.

59:35.138 --> 59:40.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And speaking
of movies,
tomorrow on the "NewsHour,"
Jeffrey Brown

59:40.977 --> 59:48.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
examines the cause and
implications of the
lack of diversity in the
entertainment industry

59:48.218 --> 59:50.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ahead of the Academy Awards this
weekend.

59:50.687 --> 59:53.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, another installment in
our Brief
But Spectacular series.

59:53.757 --> 59:59.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, we hear from poet
Mahogany L. Browne,
who is coordinating a Women of
the World Poetry

59:59.963 --> 01:00:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Slam running March 9 through the
12th in Brooklyn,
New York.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This piece is entitled "Black
Girl Magic."

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:08.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAHOGANY L. BROWNE, Poet: They
say you ain't
supposed to be here.

01:00:08.572 --> 01:00:13.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You ain't supposed to wear red
lipstick. You
ain't supposed to wear high
heels. You ain't

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:20.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supposed to smile in public. You
ain't supposed
to smile nowhere, black girl.
You ain't supposed

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:25.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be no more than a girlfriend.
You ain't
supposed to get married. You
ain't supposed

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:32.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to want no dreams that big. You
ain't supposed
to dream at all.

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:40.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You ain't supposed to do nothing
but carry
babies and carry felons and
carry weaves and

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:52.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carry silence and carry families
and carry
confusion and carry a nation,
but never an

01:00:53.016 --> 01:01:01.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opinion, because you ain't
supposed to have
nothing to say, black girl, not
unless it's

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:11.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a joke, because you ain't
supposed to love
yourself, black girl.

01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:22.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You ain't supposed to find
nothing worth saving
in all that brown. You ain't
supposed to know

01:01:22.479 --> 01:01:28.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Tina, Beyonce, Cecily,
Shonda Rhimes
shine, shine, shine. Black girl,
you ain't

01:01:28.585 --> 01:01:37.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supposed to love your mind. You
ain't supposed
to love. You ain't supposed to
be loved up

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:43.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on. You only supposed to pose
voodoo child
vixen style.

01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:53.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You supposed to pop out babies
and hide the
stretch marks. You supposed to
be still, so

01:01:53.443 --> 01:02:00.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still they think you statue, so
still they
think you a chalked outline, so
still they

01:02:00.617 --> 01:02:06.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
keep thinking you stone, until
you look more
Medusa than Viola Davis, until
you sound more

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:12.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shanaynay than Kerry Washington,
until you
more side eye than Michelle
Obama on a Tuesday

01:02:12.629 --> 01:02:25.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you tell them you are more
than a hot
comb and a wash and set. You are
Kunta Kinte's

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:32.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kin. You are a black girl worth
remembering
and you are a threat knowing
yourself. You

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:45.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are a threat loving yourself.
You are a threat
loving your kin. You are a
threat loving your

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:49.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children, you black girl magic,
you black
girl fly, you black girl
brilliance, you black

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:59.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
girl wonder, you black girl
shine, you black
girl bloom, you black girl,
black girl.

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:08.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
girl wonder, you black girl
shine, you black
girl bloom, you black girl,
black girl.

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:18.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you turning into a beautiful
black woman
right before our eyes.
