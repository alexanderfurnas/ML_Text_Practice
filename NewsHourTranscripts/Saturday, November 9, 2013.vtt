01:02.600 --> 01:04.033
THE EASTERN ISLANDS OF THE

01:04.033 --> 01:04.333
PHILIPPINES.

01:04.333 --> 01:05.967
METEOROLOGIST SAID THE STORM HAD

01:05.967 --> 01:07.767
WINDS OF 200 MILES PER HOUR WHEN

01:07.767 --> 01:08.733
IT CAME ASHORE

01:08.733 --> 01:11.000
IT CRUSHED BUILDINGS, BROUGH

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
DOWN POWER LINES AND LEFT ROAD

01:13.000 --> 01:13.167
IMPASSABLE

01:13.167 --> 01:15.500
WIDESPREAD FLOODING AFTER

01:15.500 --> 01:16.767
POWERFUL STORM SURGE

01:16.767 --> 01:17.833
>> DEVASTATION IS -- I DON'T

01:17.833 --> 01:20.533
HAVE THE WORDS FOR IT.

01:20.533 --> 01:23.767
IT'S REALLY HORRIFIC

01:23.767 --> 01:25.400
IT'S GREAT HUMAN TRAGEDY

01:25.400 --> 01:26.300
THERE'S NO POWER

01:26.300 --> 01:28.933
BY THE TIME THE SUNSETS IT'S

01:28.933 --> 01:31.267
DARK AND, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE JUS

01:31.267 --> 01:33.633
GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE YOUR WAY

01:41.567 --> 01:43.967
HAYIAN IS NOW HEADING TOWARD

01:43.967 --> 01:45.133
VIETNAM WHERE EMERGENC

01:45.133 --> 01:47.600
PREPARATIONS ARE BEING MADE AN

01:47.600 --> 01:49.233
SEVERAL HUNDRED,000 PEOPLE HAV

01:49.233 --> 01:50.833
BEEN EVACUATED

01:50.833 --> 01:53.267
FOR AN EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT WE

01:53.267 --> 01:59.500
SPOKE EARLIER WITH A FREELANCE

01:59.500 --> 01:59.700
JOURNALIST

01:59.700 --> 02:01.000
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

02:01.000 --> 02:02.733
CASUALTIES OCCURRED THERE.

02:02.733 --> 02:05.000
WE ASKED HIM WHAT TO DESCRIB

02:05.000 --> 02:06.033
WHAT WE SAW.

02:06.033 --> 02:07.667
>> Reporter: I GREW UP HERE IN

02:07.667 --> 02:09.900
THE PHILIPPINES AND I KNOW WHA

02:09.900 --> 02:10.900
TYPHOONS WERE LIKE

02:10.900 --> 02:12.800
THIS DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A TYPHOON.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.733
THIS WAS A TORNADO

02:13.733 --> 02:15.500
BUT A TORNADO THAT LASTED FO

02:15.500 --> 02:17.200
THREE, FOUR HOURS.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.733
THE WIND WAS SWIRLING AND THER

02:19.733 --> 02:21.633
WAS DEBRIS FLYING FROM ALL

02:21.633 --> 02:21.900
DIRECTIONS

02:21.900 --> 02:23.200
WE WENT UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR

02:23.200 --> 02:25.967
TO TRY TO ESCAPE THE STORM

02:25.967 --> 02:27.067
SURGE, OBVIOUSLY

02:27.067 --> 02:29.667
BUT DEBRIS FROM THE HOTEL'

02:29.667 --> 02:31.133
HALLWAY WAS FLYING OVER OU

02:31.133 --> 02:33.167
HEADS AND SO WHEN HE TO GO BAC

02:33.167 --> 02:34.600
DOWN THE GROUND FLOOR BUT THEN

02:34.600 --> 02:36.400
WATER WAS RISING REALLY QUICK.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.533
SO WE WENT BACK UP TO THE SECOND

02:38.533 --> 02:41.033
FLOOR AND WE WERE THERE FOR

02:41.033 --> 02:46.400
GOOD PROBABLY 20, 30 MINUTES

02:46.400 --> 02:48.167
BEFORE THE CEILING STARTED

02:48.167 --> 02:49.900
FALLING OFF AND THE ROOF STARTED

02:49.900 --> 02:51.533
FLYING AND IT DID FEEL LIKE IT

02:51.533 --> 02:52.733
WAS GOING CRUMBLE.

02:52.733 --> 02:55.167
IT WAS HONESTLY THE SCARIEST

02:55.167 --> 02:56.933
FOUR HOURS OF MY LIFE.

02:56.933 --> 02:58.333
WE ALL THOUGHT THAT WE WER

02:58.333 --> 03:00.633
GOING TO DIE THERE

03:00.633 --> 03:01.800
BECAUSE IT WAS POSSIBLE.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.267
THE STORM PASSED

03:03.267 --> 03:05.000
AND WHEN WE THOUGHT IT WAS SAF

03:05.000 --> 03:09.633
FOR US TO VENTURE OUT, WE DID,

03:09.633 --> 03:10.833
IT WAS COMPLETE DEVASTATION AN

03:10.833 --> 03:12.867
DESTRUCTION AS FAR AS THE EY

03:12.867 --> 03:15.400
COULD SEE.

03:15.400 --> 03:18.233
THE TYPHOON SPARED NOTHING I

03:18.233 --> 03:19.033
ITS PATH

03:19.033 --> 03:20.867
THE HOUSES WERE DESTROYED,

03:20.867 --> 03:21.733
BUILDINGS WERE DESTROYED, THER

03:21.733 --> 03:23.733
WERE BODIES EVERY WHERE.

03:23.733 --> 03:25.933
THERE WAS A LOT OF PANIC

03:25.933 --> 03:27.967
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD GONE INT

03:27.967 --> 03:31.133
THE SUPERMARKETS AND EVEN TH

03:31.133 --> 03:32.767
APPLIANCE STORES AND THE MALLS

03:32.767 --> 03:34.733
AND THEY WERE LOOTING NOT JUST

03:34.733 --> 03:36.300
FOOD, THEY WERE LOOTING NOT JUST

03:36.300 --> 03:38.733
THE WATER, BUT THEY WERE LOOTING

03:38.733 --> 03:40.067
COMPUTERS, TELEVISION SETS

03:40.067 --> 03:42.333
ANYTHING THAT THEY COULD GET

03:42.333 --> 03:44.567
IT WAS COMPLETE MAYHEM

03:44.567 --> 03:46.100
IT WAS JUST COMPLETE MAYHEM.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.667
THERE WAS NO ONE TO POLICE THE

03:47.667 --> 03:49.233
PEOPLE BECAUSE LOCAL POLIC

03:49.233 --> 03:50.933
THEMSELVES WERE VICTIMS OF THE

03:50.933 --> 03:51.167
TYPHOON.

03:51.167 --> 03:52.867
AND THE MILITARY COULD NOT EVE

03:52.867 --> 03:56.267
GET THROUGH TO THE CITY.

03:56.267 --> 03:58.733
THERE WAS LOSS OF LIVES.

03:58.733 --> 04:01.200
WE WALKED ALONG THE HIGHWAY AN

04:01.200 --> 04:04.200
THERE WERE DEAD BODIES ALONG THE

04:04.200 --> 04:04.567
HIGHWAY.

04:04.567 --> 04:07.833
WE LOOKED INTO THE DEBRIS OF THE

04:07.833 --> 04:10.467
HOUSES THAT HAD COLLAPSED AN

04:10.467 --> 04:14.900
THERE WERE BODIES JUSTING OUT OF

04:14.900 --> 04:15.300
DOORS.

04:15.300 --> 04:16.167
THERE WERE BODIES THAT WER

04:16.167 --> 04:19.733
STUCK IN THE DEBRIS, AND THERE

04:19.733 --> 04:21.267
WERE FAMILIES THAT WERE LOOKIN

04:21.267 --> 04:23.367
FOR THEIR LOVED ONES

04:23.367 --> 04:27.233
IT WAS A VERY HEARTBREAKIN

04:27.233 --> 04:28.867
DEVASTATING SCENE THERE.

04:28.867 --> 04:30.267
>> IN SWITZERLAND TODAY HIGH

04:30.267 --> 04:34.133
LEVEL NEGOTIATIONS ENDED CUSHING

04:34.133 --> 04:35.500
IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM HIT A

04:35.500 --> 04:37.267
SNAG AFTER THE FRENCH MINISTER

04:37.267 --> 04:38.500
WARNED THAT UNITED STATES AN

04:38.500 --> 04:39.733
OTHER MAJOR POWERS WERE BEIN

04:39.733 --> 04:41.633
DRAWN INTO WHAT HE CALLED

04:41.633 --> 04:43.133
FOOL'S GAME THAT COULD WORK TO

04:43.133 --> 04:43.933
IRAN'S ADVANTAGE

04:43.933 --> 04:45.967
THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID FRANCE

04:45.967 --> 04:49.300
HAD REJECTED AN EARLIER DRAF

04:49.300 --> 04:49.600
AGREEMENT.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.533
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY IS

04:50.533 --> 04:52.367
IN GENEVA FOR THE TALKS ALON

04:52.367 --> 04:54.033
WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTERS O

04:54.033 --> 04:56.167
IRAN, BRITAIN, FRANCE, GERMANY

04:56.167 --> 04:58.233
RUSSIA AND CHAMPION.

04:58.233 --> 04:59.867
YESTERDAY ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER

04:59.867 --> 05:02.567
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SHARPLY

05:02.567 --> 05:04.500
CRITICIZED THE DEAL BEIN

05:04.500 --> 05:05.767
DISCUSSED THEN CALLING IT TH

05:05.767 --> 05:09.600
DEAL OF THE CENTURY IN IRAN'

05:09.600 --> 05:09.933
FUTURE

05:09.933 --> 05:11.567
OF COURSE WHENEVER THERE'S ANY

05:11.567 --> 05:13.367
DISCUSSION ABOUT IRAN'S NUCLEA

05:13.367 --> 05:15.233
PROGRAM HOW CLOSE ARE TH

05:15.233 --> 05:18.600
IRANIANS TO DEVELOPING A NUCLEAR

05:18.600 --> 05:19.033
WEAPON

05:19.033 --> 05:22.433
WE ARE JOINED BY DAVID ALBRIGHT.

05:22.433 --> 05:24.500
HE'S A LEADING EXPERT ON IRAN'

05:24.500 --> 05:25.200
NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.200
I THINK IN THE BACKGROUND OF ALL

05:27.200 --> 05:29.067
THESE TALKS, ALL THESE DELEGATES

05:29.067 --> 05:30.733
AND DIPLOMATS HAVE TO WONDER HOW

05:30.733 --> 05:32.867
CLOSE IS IRAN AND WILL THESE

05:32.867 --> 05:33.433
SANCTIONS WORK

05:33.433 --> 05:35.600
>> IRAN HAS BEEN GREATLY

05:35.600 --> 05:36.500
INCREASING ITS NUCLEAR

05:36.500 --> 05:38.967
CAPABILITY OVER THE LAST TWO

05:38.967 --> 05:40.633
YEARS, AND YOU DON'T THINK IRA

05:40.633 --> 05:42.600
HAS MADE A DECISION TO BUILD

05:42.600 --> 05:43.433
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

05:43.433 --> 05:46.800
BUT IF THEY DID, AND THEY US

05:46.800 --> 05:49.500
THEIR CURRENT STOCKPILES OF LO

05:49.500 --> 05:51.500
ENRICHED URANIUM, AND THE NUMBER

05:51.500 --> 05:54.233
OF CENTRIFUGES THEY HAVE

05:54.233 --> 05:56.500
INSTALLED AT THEIR TWO

05:56.500 --> 05:58.000
ENRICHMENT SITES THEN THEY COULD

05:58.000 --> 06:00.400
BREAK OUT IN AS LITTLE -- BREC

06:00.400 --> 06:02.433
OUT AND HAVE ENOUGH WEAPON GRADE

06:02.433 --> 06:06.133
URANIUM FOR A BOMB IN AS LITTL

06:06.133 --> 06:08.933
TO ONE AND ONE AND A HAL

06:08.933 --> 06:09.200
MONTHS

06:09.200 --> 06:10.667
IT COULD TAKE THEM LONGER IF

06:10.667 --> 06:11.567
THINGS WENT WRONG.

06:11.567 --> 06:13.000
IT WOULD TAKE THEM LONGER TO

06:13.000 --> 06:14.733
BUILD THE BOMB ITSELF.

06:14.733 --> 06:15.700
ESTIMATES VARY

06:15.700 --> 06:21.333
IT'S A MURKY AREA TO MAK

06:21.333 --> 06:21.967
ESTIMATES IN

06:21.967 --> 06:23.500
IT VARY FROM A COUPLE OF MONTH

06:23.500 --> 06:25.100
TO A YEAR.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.933
DO THAT HE WANT CRUDE DEVICE

06:26.933 --> 06:29.200
THEY CAN TEST UNDERGROUND OR D

06:29.200 --> 06:31.133
THEY WANT A WAR HEAD FOR A

06:31.133 --> 06:32.567
BALLISTIC MISSILE AND THE LATTER

06:32.567 --> 06:34.733
WOULD TAKE MORE THAN A YEAR TO

06:34.733 --> 06:34.900
ACCOMPLISH

06:34.900 --> 06:37.333
>> WITHOUT GETTING INTO

06:37.333 --> 06:39.467
PHYSICS LESSONS THERE'

06:39.467 --> 06:41.667
DIFFERENT GRADATIONS OF URANIUM,

06:41.667 --> 06:43.600
HOW IT'S PROCESSED AND WHETHER

06:43.600 --> 06:46.200
IT'S FOR NUCLEAR POWER O

06:46.200 --> 06:46.400
NUCLEAR WEAPON

06:46.400 --> 06:48.733
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

06:48.733 --> 06:54.000
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE SAME

06:54.000 --> 06:56.700
3.5% ENRICHED URANIUM PRODUCED

06:56.700 --> 06:59.233
FOR A NUCLEAR POWER REACTOR CA

06:59.233 --> 07:02.067
BE ENRICHED UP TO 90%, THE

07:02.067 --> 07:04.367
ENRICHMENT LEVEL YOU USE IN

07:04.367 --> 07:05.967
NUCLEAR WEAPON

07:05.967 --> 07:08.000
3.5% IN WHICH ENRICHMENT I

07:08.000 --> 07:13.800
QUITE A WAYS, 70% OF THE WAY T

07:13.800 --> 07:17.467
90% ISN'T LINEAR AND A LOT O

07:17.467 --> 07:19.033
WORK GOES INTO THAT.

07:19.033 --> 07:21.300
IT'S ONE OF THE DILEMMAS O

07:21.300 --> 07:21.867
THIS

07:21.867 --> 07:25.000
THERE'S NO CLEAR BENCHMARK O

07:25.000 --> 07:26.667
ACTION ONE CAN TAKE THAT WOULD

07:26.667 --> 07:28.933
PROVIDE A GUARANTEE THAT I

07:28.933 --> 07:32.233
WOULDN'T LATER USE THE ENRICHE

07:32.233 --> 07:33.800
URANIUM TO FURTHER ENRICH IT U

07:33.800 --> 07:34.867
TO WEAPON GRADE.

07:34.867 --> 07:38.333
>> WHAT ABOUT THE DELIVERY

07:38.333 --> 07:38.533
CAPABILITIES

07:38.533 --> 07:39.900
THAT'S PRIMARILY WHY THE REASO

07:39.900 --> 07:41.467
SO MANY PEOPLE IN TH

07:41.467 --> 07:43.833
NEIGHBORHOOD, SO TO SPEAK IS

07:43.833 --> 07:44.033
CONCERNED.

07:44.033 --> 07:46.167
>> LIKELIHOOD IF IRAN BREAKS

07:46.167 --> 07:48.667
OUT, IF IT DECIDED TO DO THAT,

07:48.667 --> 07:51.000
IT WOULD BE SEEKING AT LEAST I

07:51.000 --> 07:53.767
MY VIEW PROBABLY JUST A CRUD

07:53.767 --> 07:54.467
NUCLEAR EXPLOSIVE.

07:54.467 --> 07:56.033
THAT'S WHAT NORTH KOREA DID.

07:56.033 --> 07:57.933
THAT'S WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES DID.

07:57.933 --> 07:58.333
SOUTH AFRICA

07:58.333 --> 08:00.633
THEY JUST TRY TO GET ONE THA

08:00.633 --> 08:02.067
ISN'T THAT DELIVERABLE

08:02.067 --> 08:03.900
CERTAINLY NOT DELIVERABLE BY

08:03.900 --> 08:04.167
MISSILES

08:04.167 --> 08:05.600
AND THAT THEY WOULD BE LOOKING

08:05.600 --> 08:07.733
TO JUST GET ACROSS THE THRESHOLD

08:07.733 --> 08:10.600
AND ESTABLISH THAT

08:10.600 --> 08:12.833
IT COULD BE THROUGH LEAKING IT

08:12.833 --> 08:15.200
HAS NUCLEAR WEAPONS, IT COULD BE

08:15.200 --> 08:16.267
CONDUCTING A FULL SCAL

08:16.267 --> 08:16.833
UNDERGROUND TEST

08:16.833 --> 08:17.800
THAT'S THE PRIORITY.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.333
MORE THAN LIKELY THEY WOULDN'T

08:19.333 --> 08:21.500
NEED A FULL YEAR TO HAVE A

08:21.500 --> 08:23.067
NUCLEAR EXPLOSIVE DEVICE THE

08:23.067 --> 08:25.733
COULD TEST UNDERGROUND OR CLAI

08:25.733 --> 08:26.933
THEY HAVE -- THAT THEY ARE NOW A

08:39.167 --> 08:40.267
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS MADE I

08:40.267 --> 08:41.800
CLEAR THAT HE WOULD PREVENT IRAN

08:41.800 --> 08:44.600
FROM GETTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON,

08:44.600 --> 08:46.867
ISRAEL'S THRESHOLD FOR ATTACK IS

08:46.867 --> 08:48.233
MUCH LOWER THAN IRAN MOVING TO

08:48.233 --> 08:49.233
GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON

08:49.233 --> 08:50.733

09:09.200 --> 09:10.733
OPTIONS TO STOP IRAN AT THAT
