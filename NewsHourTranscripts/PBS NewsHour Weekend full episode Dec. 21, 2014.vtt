06:49.843 --> 06:51.011
OVARIAN CANCER.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.145
THE DRUG LYNPARZA, MANUFACTURED

06:52.145 --> 06:53.246
BY ASTRA ZENECA, WAS FOUND TO

06:53.246 --> 06:54.481
SHRINK OVARIAN TUMORS IN MORE

06:54.481 --> 06:55.348
THAN 30% OF WOMEN WHO HAD

06:55.348 --> 06:56.549
A SPECIFIC GENETIC MUTATION.

06:56.549 --> 06:57.717
FRIDAY'S DECISION CAME A DAY

06:57.717 --> 06:58.985
AFTER THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

06:58.985 --> 07:03.223
APPROVED ITS USE.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.691
ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL CANCER

07:04.691 --> 07:06.059
INSTITUTE, AN ESTIMATED 14,000

07:06.059 --> 07:07.394
AMERICAN WOMEN DIED OF OVARIAN

07:07.394 --> 07:18.838
CANCER THIS YEAR.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.307
>> Sreenivasan: FOR THE LATEST

07:20.307 --> 07:21.574
ABOUT THE MURDER OF THOSE TWO

07:21.574 --> 07:22.509
NEW YORK CITY POLICE OFFICERS,

07:22.509 --> 07:23.410
WE ARE JOINED NOW BY PERVAIZ

07:23.410 --> 07:24.344
SHALLWANI.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.278
HE IS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

07:25.278 --> 07:26.313
REPORTER FOR THE "WALL STREET

07:26.313 --> 07:27.247
JOURNAL."

07:27.247 --> 07:29.015
SO WHAT ARE THE COPS ARE YOU

07:29.015 --> 07:30.650
TALKING TO SAYING RIGHT TO

07:30.650 --> 07:31.518
YOU?

07:31.518 --> 07:32.686
>> THE TOP BRASS AT THE

07:32.686 --> 07:33.620
POLICE DEPARTMENT ARE

07:33.620 --> 07:34.688
TELLING OFFICERS, THAT YOU

07:34.688 --> 07:35.722
KNOW, THEY NEED TO DO THEIR

07:35.722 --> 07:36.489
JOBS AND NOT TO TAKE TO

07:36.489 --> 07:37.791
SOCIAL MEDIA AND TO MOURN IN

07:37.791 --> 07:39.626
PEACE.

07:39.626 --> 07:40.994
BUT THERE ARE UNIONS OUT THERE

07:40.994 --> 07:42.028
WHO ARE EXPRESSING, YOU KNOW, A

07:42.028 --> 07:43.463
VERY DIFFERENT SENTIMENT.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.098
>> Sreenivasan: SO THE POLICE

07:45.098 --> 07:46.433
DEPARTMENT'S UNION OR A

07:46.433 --> 07:47.634
COUPLE OF THEM ACTUALLY EVEN

07:47.634 --> 07:48.668
WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO SAY,

07:48.668 --> 07:49.402
DON'T MAKE ARRESTS UNLESS

07:49.402 --> 07:51.271
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.706
AND DON'T GO OUT AND RESPOND

07:52.706 --> 07:54.107
TO ANY CRIME UNLESS YOU'VE

07:54.107 --> 07:56.376
GOT BACKUP WITH ANOTHER CAR.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.811
>> THERE HAS BEEN SOME RUMOR,

07:57.811 --> 07:59.346
THAT HASN'T COME OUT AS AN

07:59.346 --> 08:00.580
OFFICIAL STATEMENT BUT THERE

08:00.580 --> 08:01.548
HAS BEEN BEHIND THE SCENES

08:01.548 --> 08:03.083
RUMBLINGS ABOUT THAT.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.517
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY, AND SO

08:04.517 --> 08:06.052
WE'VE ALSO SEEN FORMER

08:06.052 --> 08:07.287
OFFICIALS, FORMER MAYOR, RUDY

08:07.287 --> 08:08.588
GIULIANI RECORDED EARLIER IN THE

08:08.588 --> 08:10.023
STORY, BUT ALSO THE FORMER

08:10.023 --> 08:11.124
GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, GOVERNOR

08:11.124 --> 08:13.293
PATAKI.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.861
REALLY LAYING THE BLAME SQUARELY

08:14.861 --> 08:16.062
ON THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AND ALL OF

08:16.062 --> 08:19.632
THE PROTESTORS.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.468
>> YEAH, THERE HAVE DEFINITELY

08:21.468 --> 08:22.736
BEEN DISSENTING VOICES POLITICAL

08:22.736 --> 08:24.637
AS WELL AS FORMER N.Y.P.D.,

08:24.637 --> 08:26.406
TELLING-- SAYING THAT THIS IS

08:26.406 --> 08:27.674
BECOMING A RIFT BETWEEN THE

08:27.674 --> 08:28.508
MAYOR'S OFFICE AND THE POLICE

08:28.508 --> 08:29.809
DEPARTMENT.

08:29.809 --> 08:30.977
>> Sreenivasan: AND HOW ABOUT

08:30.977 --> 08:31.911
THE CONNECTIONS TO WHAT HAPPENED

08:31.911 --> 08:34.047
IN BALTIMORE AT THIS POINT?

08:34.047 --> 08:35.648
>> POLICE HAVE DETERMINED THAT

08:35.648 --> 08:37.183
THE SUSPECT HAD SHOT AN EX-

08:37.183 --> 08:39.152
GIRLFRIEND AT ABOUT 5:45, 6:00

08:39.152 --> 08:40.820
IN THE MORNING, AND THEN A FEW

08:40.820 --> 08:42.622
SEVERAL HOURS LATER LEARNED THAT

08:42.622 --> 08:43.757
HE HAD MADE POSTINGS ON

08:43.757 --> 08:46.259
INSTAGRAM SAYING THAT HE WAS

08:46.259 --> 08:49.863
LOOKING TO KILL POLICE OFFICERS.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.631
THEY WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE BY

08:51.631 --> 08:53.767
CELL PHONE THAT HE WAS IN NEW

08:53.767 --> 08:55.368
YORK CITY, AND AS WELL HAD SENT

08:55.368 --> 08:57.570
OUT AND REACHED OUT TO THE

08:57.570 --> 09:00.306
N.Y.P.D., SENT OUT A WANTED

09:00.306 --> 09:02.242
POSTER TO THE N.Y.P.D. THAT

09:02.242 --> 09:03.076
REACHED THE N.Y.P.D. RIGHT AS

09:03.076 --> 09:04.844
THE SHOOTING WAS OCCURRING.

09:04.844 --> 09:06.112
>> Sreenivasan: SO THE BALTIMORE

09:06.112 --> 09:07.814
POLICE DEPARTMENT GOT THE

09:07.814 --> 09:08.848
MESSAGE TO THE N.Y.P.D. JUST TOO

09:08.848 --> 09:09.716
LATE?

09:09.716 --> 09:10.717
>> NOT NECESSARILY TOO LATE.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.352
THEY GOT THE FIRST CONNECTION

09:12.352 --> 09:13.686
SOUNDS LIKE BETWEEN THE

09:13.686 --> 09:15.355
BALTIMORE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND

09:15.355 --> 09:16.156
THE N.Y.P.D. WAS ABOUT 2:10.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.657
BY THE TIME THERE WAS A WIDER

09:17.657 --> 09:19.125
CONNECTION AND SENT OUT

09:19.125 --> 09:19.993
DEPARTMENT WIDE WAS ABOUT 2:45

09:19.993 --> 09:21.094
AND THE SHOOTING HAPPENED AT

09:21.094 --> 09:22.595
ABOUT 2:47.

09:22.595 --> 09:23.530
SO IT WAS HAPPENING RIGHT AS

09:23.530 --> 09:25.598
THIS WAS OCCURRING.

09:25.598 --> 09:27.700
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHAT DO YOU

09:27.700 --> 09:29.135
KNOW SO FAR ABOUT THE SUSPECT?

09:29.135 --> 09:31.004
>> AT THIS POINT WE KNOW THE

09:31.004 --> 09:32.038
SUSPECT HAS A EXTENSIVE

09:32.038 --> 09:33.706
CRIMINAL HISTORY IN GEORGIA.

09:33.706 --> 09:35.074
HAS SPENT SOME TIME IN JAIL.

09:35.074 --> 09:38.545
HE'S ORIGINALLY FROM BROOKLYN.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.013
AND APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN MOVING

09:40.013 --> 09:41.381
AROUND QUITE A BIT OVER THE LAST

09:41.381 --> 09:42.782
SEVERAL WEEKS.

09:42.782 --> 09:43.683
>> Sreenivasan: IN THAT CRIMINAL

09:43.683 --> 09:44.617
PAST, ANY VIOLENT HIS HISTORY?

09:44.617 --> 09:46.953
>> THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF A

09:46.953 --> 09:49.889
VIOLENT HISTORY.

09:49.889 --> 09:51.991
THERE ARE ALSO REPORTS THAT HE

09:51.991 --> 09:54.194
HAS A MENTAL HEALTH HISTORY.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.462
THE HISTORY INCLUDES EVERYTHING

09:55.462 --> 09:56.563
FROM TERRORIST THREATS AS WELL

09:56.563 --> 09:58.331
AS A PASS GUN POSSESSION CHARGE.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.365
>> Sreenivasan: AL RIGHT,

09:59.365 --> 10:00.233
PERVAIZ SHALLWANI THE "WALL

10:00.233 --> 10:00.733
STREET JOURNAL."

10:00.733 --> 10:01.501
THANKS SO MUCH.

10:01.501 --> 10:09.809
>> THANK YOU.

10:09.809 --> 10:10.743
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO OUR

10:10.743 --> 10:12.378
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

10:12.378 --> 10:13.713
WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT HOW THE

10:13.713 --> 10:14.914
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ISN'T

10:14.914 --> 10:16.249
WORKING.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.450
THE LAST SESSION OF CONGRESS WAS

10:17.450 --> 10:18.351
REPORTEDLY THE SECOND LEAST

10:18.351 --> 10:21.120
PRODUCTIVE IN MODERN TIMES.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.722
BUT TONIGHT, OUR FOCUS IS ON A

10:22.722 --> 10:24.090
LAW THAT MOST DEMOCRATS AND

10:24.090 --> 10:25.592
REPUBLICANS AGREE IS WORKING,

10:25.592 --> 10:26.960
ONE THAT BROUGHT NEARLY SIX

10:26.960 --> 10:28.728
BILLION DOLLARS INTO THE FEDERAL

10:28.728 --> 10:30.096
COFFERS LAST YEAR-- A RECORD.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.097
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S KNOWN

10:31.097 --> 10:37.704
AS THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT.

10:37.704 --> 10:40.773
IT INCENTIVIZES WHISTLEBLOWERS

10:40.773 --> 10:42.375
TO COME FORWARD WITH THE PROMISE

10:42.375 --> 10:43.076
OF A SIGNIFICANT REWARD FOR

10:43.076 --> 10:43.943
THEMSELVES.

10:43.943 --> 10:45.011
NEWSHOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

10:45.011 --> 10:46.279
RICK KARR REPORTS.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.514
>> Reporter: FOR MOST OF THE

10:47.514 --> 10:48.581
EIGHTEEN YEARS THAT SHE SPENT

10:48.581 --> 10:49.616
WORKING FOR THE MEDICAL DEVICE

10:49.616 --> 10:50.717
MANUFACTURER C.R. BARD NEAR

10:50.717 --> 10:51.718
ATLANTA, JULIE DARITY SAYS SHE

10:51.718 --> 10:53.019
HAD UNWAVERING FAITH IN THE

10:53.019 --> 10:54.287
COMPANY'S INTEGRITY.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.288
UPHOLDING IT WAS PART OF HER

10:55.288 --> 10:58.124
JOB.

10:58.124 --> 11:01.327
>> MY ENTIRE CAREER HAD BEEN

11:01.327 --> 11:03.496
COMPLIANCE, AND MAKING SURE THAT

11:03.496 --> 11:04.964
THINGS WERE DONE APPROPRIATELY,

11:04.964 --> 11:07.166
ACCORDING TO THE REGULATIONS.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.468
>> Reporter: YOU BELIEVED IN

11:08.468 --> 11:09.736
THIS COMPANY, YOU THOUGHT THIS

11:09.736 --> 11:11.938
COMPANY WAS DOING THE RIGHT

11:11.938 --> 11:13.273
THING?

11:13.273 --> 11:14.374
>> OH, I DID.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.642
>> Reporter: BUT HER FAITH WAS

11:15.642 --> 11:17.176
TESTED WHEN SHE STARTED WORKING

11:17.176 --> 11:18.311
WITH A TEAM THAT SOLD

11:18.311 --> 11:19.546
RADIOACTIVE PELLETS USED TO

11:19.546 --> 11:20.647
TREAT PROSTATE CANCER.

11:20.647 --> 11:21.848
IT WAS HER JOB TO REVIEW EVERY

11:21.848 --> 11:23.049
TRANSACTION THE TEAM MADE AND

11:23.049 --> 11:25.218
SHE BEGAN TO SUSPECT THEY'D

11:25.218 --> 11:26.352
DEVELOPED A SCHEME TO OVERCHARGE

11:26.352 --> 11:27.954
MEDICARE, WHICH PAID FOR MOST OF

11:27.954 --> 11:28.922
THE PELLETS.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.490
SHE SAYS SALES REPS PERSUADED

11:30.490 --> 11:31.691
CUSTOMERS TO USE BARD'S PRODUCT

11:31.691 --> 11:33.126
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS MORE

11:33.126 --> 11:35.161
EXPENSIVE THAN THE COMPETITION'S

11:35.161 --> 11:37.063
BY GIVING THEM FREE MEDICAL

11:37.063 --> 11:38.631
EQUIPMENT, REBATES, AND GRANTS.

11:38.631 --> 11:39.766
THE INCENTIVES CAME AT THE

11:39.766 --> 11:41.100
EXPENSE OF TAXPAYERS, BECAUSE

11:41.100 --> 11:43.636
MEDICARE WAS PAYING THE HIGHER

11:43.636 --> 11:45.138
PRICE BARD SET.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.472
>> THERE WERE INSTRUCTIONS THAT

11:46.472 --> 11:47.707
I WAS GIVEN TO DO THINGS THAT

11:47.707 --> 11:50.710
CLEARLY WERE INAPPROPRIATE,

11:50.710 --> 11:54.013
PERHAPS ILLEGAL, AND SO WHEN

11:54.013 --> 11:57.050
THOSE THINGS WOULD HAPPEN I

11:57.050 --> 11:58.084
WOULD QUESTION MANAGEMENT ABOUT

11:58.084 --> 12:00.053
IT.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.754
MY HOPE WAS THAT THINGS WOULD BE

12:01.754 --> 12:05.525
RESOLVED.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.093
>> Reporter: SHE SAYS THEY DID

12:07.093 --> 12:08.528
NOTHING, SO ACCORDING TO COURT

12:08.528 --> 12:09.896
DOCUMENTS FILED LATER, SHE

12:09.896 --> 12:11.164
REPORTED HER CONCERNS IN AN

12:11.164 --> 12:12.365
ETHICS COMPLAINT TO BARD'S

12:12.365 --> 12:14.400
CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.569
THE COMPANY SENT INVESTIGATORS

12:16.569 --> 12:18.137
TO VISIT THE SITE AND, AT AROUND

12:18.137 --> 12:19.973
THE SAME TIME, SHE ALLEGES HER

12:19.973 --> 12:22.008
SUPERIORS BEGAN MISTREATING HER.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.409
>> I CAME TO FEEL THAT I WAS A

12:23.409 --> 12:24.377
PROBLEM EMPLOYEE.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.078
>> Reporter: YOU CAME TO FEEL

12:25.078 --> 12:26.379
THAT?

12:26.379 --> 12:30.617
>> YES.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.285
>> Reporter: AFTER A YEAR, C.R.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.553
BARD FIRED HER THE WEEK BEFORE

12:33.553 --> 12:34.921
THANKSGIVING.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.356
TWO DAYS LATER, SHE BEGAN

12:36.356 --> 12:38.091
PREPARING A CIVIL WHISTLEBLOWER

12:38.091 --> 12:39.859
LAWSUIT, BECAUSE FEDERAL MONEY

12:39.859 --> 12:41.728
WAS AT STAKE IN ITS ALLEGATION

12:41.728 --> 12:43.062
OF MEDICARE FRAUD, SHE FILED HER

12:43.062 --> 12:44.197
CASE ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED

12:44.197 --> 12:45.732
STATES, AS WELL AS HERSELF.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.000
THE SCHEME SHE ALLEGED WAS

12:47.000 --> 12:48.368
COMPLEX.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.502
HER LAWYER WOULD NEED TO CONNECT

12:49.502 --> 12:50.970
ALL OF THE DOTS AND SHE HAD TO

12:50.970 --> 12:52.338
PROVIDE THE EVIDENCE.

12:52.338 --> 12:53.606
SHE SPENT THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS

12:53.606 --> 12:55.041
FINDING IT BY PORING OVER

12:55.041 --> 12:56.142
DOCUMENTS AND THE CONTENTS OF A

12:56.142 --> 12:57.510
LAPTOP THAT BARD HAD SOLD TO

12:57.510 --> 13:00.146
HER.

13:00.146 --> 13:01.648
IS THAT LIKE, THE LAPTOP?

13:01.648 --> 13:03.816
>> THIS ISTHELAPTOP.

13:03.816 --> 13:04.917
>> Reporter: GOT A BARD STICKER

13:04.917 --> 13:07.720
ON IT THERE.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.590
>> THAT INFORMATION WAS ONLY

13:10.590 --> 13:12.025
AVAILABLE FROM SALES RECORDS

13:12.025 --> 13:12.925
THAT HAPPENED TO BE ON THIS

13:12.925 --> 13:16.195
LAPTOP.

13:16.195 --> 13:18.197
>> Reporter: HER LAWSUIT WAS

13:18.197 --> 13:19.399
FILED UNDER A PROVISION OF

13:19.399 --> 13:20.433
FEDERAL LAW THAT CONGRESS HAD

13:20.433 --> 13:21.267
STRENGTHENED TWENTY YEARS

13:21.267 --> 13:21.934
EARLIER TO ENCOURAGE

13:21.934 --> 13:25.371
WHISTLEBLOWERS.

13:25.371 --> 13:27.306
>> WE DIDN'T KNOWN THAT IT WAS

13:27.306 --> 13:28.608
GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE THE BEST

13:28.608 --> 13:30.343
TOOL THAT EXISTS IN GOVERNMENT

13:30.343 --> 13:31.210
TODAY FOR FIGHTING FRAUD IN

13:31.210 --> 13:32.378
GOVERNMENT.

13:32.378 --> 13:33.913
>> Reporter: IOWA REPUBLICAN

13:33.913 --> 13:35.014
SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY WAS A

13:35.014 --> 13:36.115
SPONSOR OF THE WHISTLEBLOWER

13:36.115 --> 13:37.150
REFORM IN 1986.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.152
IT CAME ABOUT AFTER AUDITORS

13:39.152 --> 13:41.721
DISCOVERED THAT THE DEFENSE

13:41.721 --> 13:43.089
DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN BUYING $400

AMERICANS MIGHT BE ABLE TO STOP

13:50.063 --> 13:51.931
WASTE AND FRAUD THAT THE

13:51.931 --> 13:54.367
PENTAGON FAILED TO.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.069

13:56.069 --> 13:57.870
OUTSIDE INCENTIVES, EMPOWERING

13:57.870 --> 13:59.205
PEOPLE WHEN GOVERNMENT IS NOT

13:59.205 --> 14:03.443
DOING ITS JOB TO DO ITS JOB.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.911
>> Reporter: THE LAW HAD BEEN ON

14:04.911 --> 14:06.679
THE BOOKS SINCE THE CIVIL WAR.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.381
MILITARY CONTRACTORS HAD

14:08.381 --> 14:09.916
SUPPLIED THE UNION ARMY WITH

14:09.916 --> 14:11.284
SICK HORSES AND MULES, FAULTY

14:11.284 --> 14:12.452
WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION, AND

14:12.452 --> 14:14.387
TAINTED RATIONS.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.855
CONGRESS SENT PRESIDENT ABRAHAM

14:15.855 --> 14:17.290
LINCOLN THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT

14:17.290 --> 14:19.325
WHICH LET WHISTLEBLOWERS FILE

14:19.325 --> 14:20.259
SUIT ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT

14:20.259 --> 14:21.661
AND KEEP A PORTION OF THE

14:21.661 --> 14:22.795
PENALTIES IF A SUIT WAS

14:22.795 --> 14:27.800
SUCCESSFUL.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.769
THE LAW THAT LINCOLN SIGNED WAS

14:29.769 --> 14:30.770
BASED ON A LEGAL CONCEPT THAT

14:30.770 --> 14:32.138
DATES BACK TO MEDIEVAL ENGLAND.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.239
BACK THEN, LAWYERS USED A LATIN

14:33.239 --> 14:34.674
PHRASE TO DESCRIBE IT THAT

14:34.674 --> 14:35.541
MEANS: ONE WHO SUES ON BEHALF OF

14:35.541 --> 14:38.010
THE KING AS WELL AS ONESELF.

14:38.010 --> 14:39.378
TODAY, LAWYERS STILL USE THE

14:39.378 --> 14:40.713
FIRST TWO WORDS OF THAT PHRASE

14:40.713 --> 14:42.315
"QUI TAM" AS THE NAME OF THIS

14:42.315 --> 14:44.617
KIND OF WHISTLEBLOWER LAWSUIT.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.919
IN THE FISCAL YEAR THAT ENDED ON

14:46.919 --> 14:48.354
SEPTEMBER 30, THE FEDERAL

14:48.354 --> 14:50.423
GOVERNMENT RECOVERED $5.69

14:50.423 --> 14:51.257
BILLION UNDER THE FALSE CLAIMS

ACT.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.632
YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH CLOSE TO $6

14:59.632 --> 15:00.666
BILLION THIS FISCAL YEAR, WHICH

15:00.666 --> 15:02.034
IS THE LARGEST AMOUNT WE'VE EVER

15:02.034 --> 15:03.236
RECOVERED.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.804

CHARGE OF FALSE CLAIMS ACT CASES

15:05.838 --> 15:07.707
AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.142
>> I THINK THE SUCCESS OF THE

15:09.142 --> 15:11.110
STATUTE BREEDS SUCCESS.

15:11.110 --> 15:14.347
SO THE MORE CASES ARE FILED AND

15:14.347 --> 15:15.715
THE MORE WE RECOVER UNDER THE

15:15.715 --> 15:16.716
STATUTE, IT GAINS THAT MUCH MORE

15:16.716 --> 15:21.187
NOTORIETY.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.422
>> Reporter: THE SUITS GET

15:23.422 --> 15:24.791
ATTENTION THANKS TO THE AMOUNT

15:24.791 --> 15:25.625
OF MONEY SOME WHISTLEBLOWERS

15:25.625 --> 15:26.626
HAVE MADE, TYPICALLY NO MORE

15:26.626 --> 15:27.560
THAN A QUARTER OF THE MONEY THAT

15:27.560 --> 15:29.595
IS RECOVERED.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.464
DARITY'S SHARE WAS MORE THAN TEN

15:31.464 --> 15:32.598
MILLION DOLLARS WHEN C.R. BARD

15:32.598 --> 15:34.300
PAID MORE THAN $48 MILLION TO

15:34.300 --> 15:35.768
SETTLE THE CASE.

THIS, IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL, THIS

15:38.938 --> 15:40.439
SUIT IS SUCCESSFUL, YOU GET A

15:40.439 --> 15:41.674
CHUNK OF MONEY OUT OF THIS,

15:41.674 --> 15:43.009
YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS OUT OF

15:43.009 --> 15:45.044
PURELY ALTRUISTIC MOTIVES.

15:45.044 --> 15:46.379
>> MY PRIMARY MOTIVATION FOR

15:46.379 --> 15:49.849
THIS WAS FULL VINDICATION.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.151
YES, I WAS COMPENSATED, BUT I

15:52.151 --> 15:54.654
WORKED VERY HARD FOR THE

15:54.654 --> 15:57.423
AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHO RECOVERED

15:57.423 --> 16:00.226
ALMOST $40 MILLION DOLLARS, THEN

16:00.226 --> 16:02.228
THEY GOT ALL MY TAX MONEY, WHICH

16:02.228 --> 16:04.530
WAS SIGNIFICANT, MY LAWYERS GOT

16:04.530 --> 16:06.632
A NICE BIG CHUNK OF IT, AND I

16:06.632 --> 16:09.302
GOT WHAT WAS LEFT.

OFF THIS?

16:46.005 --> 16:47.273
MARGINAL, FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS,

16:47.273 --> 16:49.175
BECAUSE THERE'S POTENTIALLY A

16:49.175 --> 16:50.776
BIG PAYDAY AT THE BACK END, AND

16:50.776 --> 16:52.578
THAT IS AN ISSUE.

16:52.578 --> 16:53.980
>> Reporter: DAVID OGDEN HAS

16:53.980 --> 16:55.615
WORKED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

16:55.615 --> 16:56.816
FALSE CLAIMS ACT, FIRST AT THE

16:56.816 --> 16:58.484
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, AND NOW

16:58.484 --> 16:59.585
AT A D.C. LAW FIRM THAT DEFENDS

16:59.585 --> 17:00.920
COMPANIES IN WHISTLEBLOWER

17:00.920 --> 17:03.923
SUITS.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.925
HE ARGUES THAT THE VAST MAJORITY

17:05.925 --> 17:07.627
OF CASES ARE DISMISSED OR

17:07.627 --> 17:08.394
ABANDONED BECAUSE SO MANY ARE

17:08.394 --> 17:09.662
MERITLESS.

17:09.662 --> 17:10.830
HE'S BECOME THE LEADING ADVOCATE

17:10.830 --> 17:11.697
IN A CAMPAIGN BY THE U.S.

17:11.697 --> 17:12.665
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TO REFORM

17:12.665 --> 17:13.833
THE LAW.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.402
OGDEN SAYS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM

17:16.402 --> 17:17.737
WITH THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT IS

17:17.737 --> 17:18.938
THAT IT CAN IMPOSE PENALTIES

17:18.938 --> 17:19.906
THAT ARE OUT OF PROPORTION TO

17:19.906 --> 17:20.940
THE FRAUD A COMPANY MAY HAVE

17:20.940 --> 17:22.141
COMMITTED.

17:22.141 --> 17:23.509
HE ALSO SAYS IT DOESN'T GIVE

17:23.509 --> 17:24.944
COMPANIES ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY TO

17:24.944 --> 17:25.978
FIX PROBLEMS BEFORE THE FEDERAL

17:25.978 --> 17:29.215
GOVERNMENT GETS INVOLVED.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.150
>> I THINK THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT

17:31.150 --> 17:32.852
IS EXTRAORDINARILY USEFUL AND

17:32.852 --> 17:34.487
HAS REALLY BEEN INNOVATIVE AND

17:34.487 --> 17:36.856
IMPORTANT IN HELPING TO DETECT

17:36.856 --> 17:39.125
FRAUD AFTER IT OCCURS AND

17:39.125 --> 17:41.661
PUNISHING FRAUD AFTER IT OCCURS

AND THEN RECOVERING MONEY FOR

17:43.195 --> 17:44.196
THE GOVERNMENT.

17:44.196 --> 17:45.164
IT'S VERY GOOD AT THAT AND

17:45.164 --> 17:47.400
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.802
WHAT THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT IS NOT

17:49.802 --> 17:51.270
GOOD AT AND WHAT I THINK NEEDS

17:51.270 --> 17:52.371
TO BE FIXED, AND I THINK THERE'S

17:52.371 --> 17:53.406
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT, IS TO

17:53.406 --> 17:57.376
PREVENT FRAUD BEFORE IT OCCURS.

17:57.376 --> 17:59.111
HE PROPOSES AMENDING THE LAW TO

18:06.953 --> 18:08.220
ANY FRAUD IT FINDS TO THE

18:08.220 --> 18:09.088
GOVERNMENT.

18:24.203 --> 18:25.204
THE ONLY CHANGE HE SUPPORTS IS

18:25.204 --> 18:26.072
ONE TO PREVENT COMPANIES FROM

18:26.072 --> 18:27.106
DEFRAUDING THE GOVERNMENT A

IF YOU LIKE DOING BUSINESS WITH

18:43.789 --> 18:44.590
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, YOU

18:44.590 --> 18:49.261
OUGHT TO DO IT IN A HONEST WAY,

18:49.261 --> 18:49.929
NOT IN A FRAUDULENT WAY.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.230
IF YOU DO IT IN A FRAUDULENT

RELATIONS BOARD FILED FORMAL

19:33.272 --> 19:34.407
COMPLAINTS AGAINST McDONALD'S

19:34.407 --> 19:35.841
AND SOME OF ITS FRANCHISEES.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.009
TO UNPACK THIS STORY FURTHER,

19:37.009 --> 19:38.110
WE'RE JOINED NOW BY STEVEN

19:38.110 --> 19:39.512
GREENHOUSE.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.479
UNTIL THIS PAST WEEK, HE WAS A

19:40.479 --> 19:41.414
CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK

TIMES WHO COVERED LABOR ISSUES

19:42.648 --> 19:43.349
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.384
SO WHAT IS THE NRLB ALLEGE THAT

19:45.384 --> 19:46.886
McDONALD'S OR ITS FRANCHISES

19:46.886 --> 19:48.154
DID?

19:48.154 --> 19:49.555
>> THE LABOR BOARD SAID THAT

19:49.555 --> 19:50.923
McDONALD'S AND MANY OF ITS

McDONALD'S, THE OWNING FRANCHISE

20:08.841 --> 20:10.476

20:10.476 --> 20:11.811

20:11.811 --> 20:12.845
BUT WHY ARE THEY LUMPED TOGETHER

20:12.845 --> 20:14.313
IN THIS?

20:14.313 --> 20:15.381

20:15.381 --> 20:16.415
UNDER McDONALD'S AND THE

20:16.415 --> 20:18.551

20:22.555 --> 20:24.890
WITH ITS FRANCHISEES.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.225
IT'S SAYING THAT A FRANCHISE

20:26.225 --> 20:28.260
THAT MIGHT HAVE 30 EMPLOYEES AND

20:28.260 --> 20:30.496
OFTEN ACTS AS IF THE FRANCHISE

20:49.115 --> 20:51.050
ARE A JOINT EMPLOYER AND FOR

20:51.050 --> 20:53.119
McDONALD'S THAT IS QUITE BAD

20:53.119 --> 20:54.887
NEWS BECAUSE IT MEANS IF A

20:54.887 --> 20:56.422
FRANCHISE OWNER IS CHARGED WITH

20:56.422 --> 20:57.857
NOT PAYING OVERTIME OR IF HE IS

20:57.857 --> 20:59.125
CHARGED WITH RETALIATING AGAINST

20:59.125 --> 21:01.160
SOMEONE FOR EXERCISING HIS

21:01.160 --> 21:02.895
RIGHTS TO FORM A UNION, NOT JUST

21:02.895 --> 21:04.363
THE FRANCHISE OPERATOR WILL BE

21:04.363 --> 21:05.364
ACCUSED AND CHARGED, BUT

21:05.364 --> 21:06.832
McDONALD'S ITSELF CAN BE HELD

21:06.832 --> 21:08.334
JOINTLY RESPONSIBLE.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.903
SO THIS HAS REPERCUSSIONS BEYOND

21:10.903 --> 21:12.438
McDONALD'S THEN?

21:12.438 --> 21:13.672
>> YEAH SO, THIS SENT SHOCKWAVES

21:13.672 --> 21:14.540
THROUGH FRANCHISE INDUSTRIES

21:14.540 --> 21:15.641
AROUND THE COUNTRY.

21:15.641 --> 21:19.211
YOU KNOW, RESTAURANTS,

21:19.211 --> 21:20.246
RETAILERS, I GUESS AUTO LUBE

21:20.246 --> 21:21.147
COMPANIES, ALL SORTS OF

21:21.147 --> 21:22.148
COMPANIES.

21:22.148 --> 21:23.582
AND THEN ON FRIDAY, THERE WAS

21:23.582 --> 21:26.118
THIS BIG NEWS CONFERENCE WITH

21:26.118 --> 21:27.253
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, THE

21:27.253 --> 21:28.354
NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION, THE

21:28.354 --> 21:31.857
INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE

21:31.857 --> 21:32.958
ASSOCIATION AND NATIONAL

21:32.958 --> 21:34.727
RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.729
THEY ARE UPSET AND THEY REALLY

21:36.729 --> 21:37.863
WANT TO PERSUADE THE COURTS.

21:37.863 --> 21:38.731
THEY WANT TO PERSUADE CONGRESS

21:38.731 --> 21:39.765
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS

21:39.765 --> 21:40.833
N.R.L.B. ACTION.

21:40.833 --> 21:41.834
>> Sreenivasan: SO NOW IT GOES

21:41.834 --> 21:42.668
IN FRONT OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE

21:42.668 --> 21:43.602
LAW JUDGE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,

21:43.602 --> 21:44.637
WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS IN THIS

21:44.637 --> 21:45.704
FIGHT?

21:45.704 --> 21:46.639
>> SO THESE ARE ONLY

21:46.639 --> 21:47.573
ALLEGATIONS.

21:47.573 --> 21:49.074
THIS IS CIVIL, NOT CRIMINAL.

21:49.074 --> 21:51.343
SO A JUDGE WILL HEAR IT AND IF

21:51.343 --> 21:52.811
THE JUDGE RULES AGAINST

21:52.811 --> 21:54.747
McDONALD'S, THEN THE COUNSEL

21:54.747 --> 21:55.881
WILL LIKELY APPEAL TO THE FIVE

21:55.881 --> 21:57.449
PERSON N.R.L.B. IN WASHINGTON

21:57.449 --> 21:58.951
AND PROBABLY TO THE FEDERAL

21:58.951 --> 22:00.052
COURTS.

22:00.052 --> 22:01.153
UNIONS ARE VERY, VERY

22:01.153 --> 22:03.222
HAPPY ABOUT WHAT THE THEY DID

22:03.222 --> 22:05.291
BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT THIS GIVES

22:05.291 --> 22:06.559
THEM MUCH MORE LEVERAGE PRESSURE

22:06.559 --> 22:07.993
AGAINST McDONALD'S AND ITS

22:07.993 --> 22:09.461
FRANCHISEES.

22:09.461 --> 22:10.496
>> Sreenivasan: STEVEN

22:10.496 --> 22:11.463
GREENHOUSE, THANKS SO MUCH.

22:11.463 --> 22:13.365
>> SURE, GREAT TO BE HERE.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.403

22:17.403 --> 22:18.737

22:24.410 --> 22:25.544

22:25.544 --> 22:26.579
VIEWERS LIKE YOU.

22:26.579 --> 22:27.546
YOUR FEEDBACK ABOUT SOME OF OUR

22:27.546 --> 22:28.647
RECENT WORK.

22:28.647 --> 22:29.682
MANY OF YOU WROTE US ABOUT LAST

22:29.682 --> 22:30.749
NIGHT'S SIGNATURE PIECE

22:30.749 --> 22:32.184
DESCRIBING THE CONTROVERSY ABOUT

22:32.184 --> 22:33.586
A MOSQUE BEING OPENED IN ONE

22:33.586 --> 22:34.853
GEORGIA TOWN.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.889
A FEW SYMPATHIZED WITH OPPONENTS

22:36.889 --> 22:38.190
OF THE PLAN.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.625
VIRGINIA LEE SAID, "CAN'T HELP

22:39.625 --> 22:42.228
WANTING TO EXCLUDE MUSLIM

22:42.228 --> 22:43.062
FUNDAMENTALISTS FROM OUR

22:43.062 --> 22:45.231
COUNTRY.

22:45.231 --> 22:46.899
THEIR RULES CONCERNING WOMEN ARE

22:46.899 --> 22:47.733
DISGUSTING AND SEEN TO

22:47.733 --> 22:48.934
CONTRAVENE OUR LAWS.

22:48.934 --> 22:51.070
ACCEPT OUR CULTURE OR DON'T

22:51.070 --> 22:53.272
COME."

22:53.272 --> 22:55.307
BACHCOLE ADDED THIS, "IF THE

22:55.307 --> 22:56.442
MUSLIMS DO NOT PLEDGE THEIR

22:56.442 --> 22:58.978
BELIEF IN FREEDOM OF RELIGION,

22:58.978 --> 23:00.212
THEN DEPORT THEM.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.113
IF THEY DO PLEDGE THEIR BELIEF

23:01.113 --> 23:02.348
IN FREEDOM OF RELIGION, THEN I

23:02.348 --> 23:03.449
DON'T CARE WHERE THEY SET UP

23:03.449 --> 23:04.650
THEIR MOSQUE."

23:04.650 --> 23:05.884
ONE VIEWER SAID, "MEDIA COVERAGE

23:05.884 --> 23:07.186
OF TERROR ACTS BY MUSLIM

23:07.186 --> 23:09.054
EXTREMISTS OVERSEAS DISTORTS

23:09.054 --> 23:10.889
AMERICANS' VIEWS OF MUSLIMS.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.225
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE

23:13.225 --> 23:14.660
TERRORIST GROUP AFTER ANOTHER

23:14.660 --> 23:15.861
ENGAGES IN MASS MURDER AND

23:15.861 --> 23:16.962
DESTRUCTION IN THE NAME OF

23:16.962 --> 23:17.596
ISLAM.

23:17.596 --> 23:18.731
THE MEDIA REPORTS ALL OF THESE

23:18.731 --> 23:19.632
ATROCITIES AND THIS IS WHAT IS

23:19.632 --> 23:20.733
SEEN.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.301
THE REASON WE HAVE SUCH BACKLASH

23:22.301 --> 23:23.836
AGAINST MUSLIMS HAS TO DO WITH

23:23.836 --> 23:25.437
THE NARRATIVE, AND THAT IS THE

23:25.437 --> 23:26.872
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MEDIA AS

23:26.872 --> 23:28.807
WELL AS MUSLIMS THEMSELVES.

23:28.807 --> 23:31.944
GOOD MUSLIMS NEED TO WORK THAT

23:31.944 --> 23:36.448
MUCH HARDER TO EDUCATE OTHERS."

23:36.448 --> 23:37.816
BUT MOST OF YOU DEFENDED THE

23:37.816 --> 23:39.218
RIGHT OF AMERICAN MUSLIMS TO

23:39.218 --> 23:40.486
WORSHIP, AS THEY PLEASE.

23:40.486 --> 23:41.553
ANGELA MORRISON WROTE, "SORRY

23:41.553 --> 23:42.921
FOLKS.

23:42.921 --> 23:43.822
YOU EITHER BELIEVE IN FREEDOM OF

23:43.822 --> 23:44.790
RELIGION AND THE CONSTITUTION OR

23:44.790 --> 23:45.924
YOU DON'T.

23:45.924 --> 23:46.759
YOU DON'T GET TO PICK AND

23:46.759 --> 23:48.761
CHOOSE."

23:48.761 --> 23:50.462
A.K. SAID, "WE ARE FULL

23:50.462 --> 23:51.897
FUNCTIONING HYPOCRITES.

23:51.897 --> 23:53.465
WE LOVE FREE SPEECH UNTIL WE

23:53.465 --> 23:54.900
DISLIKE WHAT IS BEING SAID.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.268
WE LOVE FREEDOM OF RELIGION AS

23:56.268 --> 23:58.637
LONG AS IT IS OUR RELIGION."

23:58.637 --> 24:00.572
AND GREG COSTELLO ADDED THIS,

24:00.572 --> 24:02.241
"I'VE LIVED NEXT DOOR, LITERALLY

24:02.241 --> 24:03.809
20 YARDS AWAY, FROM A MOSQUE FOR

24:03.809 --> 24:05.244
THE PAST FOUR YEARS HAVEN'T HAD

24:05.244 --> 24:06.478
A SINGLE BAD ENCOUNTER.

24:06.478 --> 24:07.880
PEOPLE FEAR WHAT THEY DON'T

24:07.880 --> 24:09.148
KNOW.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.149
THEY FEAR PEOPLE WHO ARE

24:10.149 --> 24:13.552
DIFFERENT.
