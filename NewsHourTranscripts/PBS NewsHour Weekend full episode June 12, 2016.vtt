WHO ARE LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL

OR TRANSGENDER.

05:54.333 --> 05:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SHOOTER TARGETED A NIGHTCLUB

05:55.633 --> 05:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER TO BE

05:56.733 --> 05:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH FRIENDS, TO DANCE AND TO

05:57.433 --> 05:59.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SING, AND TO LIVE.

05:59.767 --> 06:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE

06:00.867 --> 06:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACKED IS MORE THAN A

06:02.400 --> 06:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NIGHTCLUB-- IT IS A PLACE OF

06:04.100 --> 06:06.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLIDARITY AND EMPOWERMENT WHERE

06:06.367 --> 06:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE HAVE COME TOGETHER TO

06:08.300 --> 06:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAISE AWARENESS, TO SPEAK THEIR

06:09.900 --> 06:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINDS, AND TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR

06:10.700 --> 06:13.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIVIL RIGHTS.

06:13.267 --> 06:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THIS IS A SOBERING REMINDER

06:15.467 --> 06:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ATTACKS ON ANY AMERICAN--

06:17.800 --> 06:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGARDLESS OF RACE, ETHNICITY,

06:20.200 --> 06:23.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELIGION OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION--

06:23.967 --> 06:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS AN ATTACK ON ALL OF US AND ON

06:26.200 --> 06:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES OF

06:28.200 --> 06:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EQUALITY AND DIGNITY THAT DEFINE

06:29.033 --> 06:32.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
US AS A COUNTRY.

06:32.067 --> 06:33.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND NO ACT OF HATE OR TERROR

06:33.867 --> 06:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL EVER CHANGE WHO WE ARE OR

06:35.700 --> 06:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE VALUES THAT MAKE US

06:36.467 --> 06:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICANS.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TODAY MARKS THE MOST DEADLY

06:42.200 --> 06:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOOTING IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

06:46.533 --> 06:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SHOOTER WAS APPARENTLY ARMED

06:47.333 --> 06:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH A HANDGUN AND A POWERFUL

06:48.033 --> 06:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSAULT RIFLE.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS MASSACRE IS THEREFORE A

06:52.367 --> 06:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FURTHER REMINDER OF HOW EASY IT

06:54.567 --> 06:56.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS FOR SOMEONE TO GET THEIR

06:56.267 --> 06:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HANDS ON A WEAPON THAT LETS THEM

06:58.133 --> 06:59.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOOT PEOPLE IN A SCHOOL, OR IN

06:59.967 --> 07:02.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A HOUSE OF WORSHIP, OR A MOVIE

07:02.167 --> 07:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEATER, OR IN A NIGHTCLUB.

07:06.333 --> 07:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE HAVE TO DECIDE IF THAT'S

07:07.400 --> 07:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE WANT TO

07:08.300 --> 07:09.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE.

07:09.967 --> 07:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TO ACTIVELY DO NOTHING IS A

07:11.700 --> 07:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECISION AS WELL.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE COMING HOURS AND DAYS,

07:17.033 --> 07:17.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'LL LEARN ABOUT THE VICTIMS OF

07:17.867 --> 07:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE JOY THAT THEY BROUGHT TO

07:26.167 --> 07:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAMILIES AND TO FRIENDS, AND THE

07:27.567 --> 07:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENCE THAT THEY MADE IN

07:28.533 --> 07:30.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WORLD.

07:30.967 --> 07:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY A PRAYER FOR THEM AND SAY A

07:33.033 --> 07:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRAYER FOR THEIR FAMILIES, THAT

07:35.967 --> 07:36.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOD GIVE THEM THE STRENGTH TO

07:36.867 --> 07:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

STRENGTH TO BE THERE FOR THEM,

AND THE STRENGTH AND COURAGE TO

07:44.900 --> 07:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE.

07:48.300 --> 07:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE

07:55.433 --> 07:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE DEFINED MORE-- AS A COUNTRY

07:57.067 --> 07:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- BY THE WAY THEY LIVED THEIR

07:58.433 --> 07:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

08:45.433 --> 08:46.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

INCLUSIVE.

08:47.567 --> 08:49.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT DOES.

08:49.067 --> 08:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE OFTEN

LIKE TO SAY TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY

INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY.

08:56.767 --> 08:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S MUCH MORE DIVERSE THAN SOME

08:58.033 --> 09:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER PARTS OF FLORIDA.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS A LARGE, THRIVING AND

09:02.933 --> 09:05.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOVING GAY COMMUNITY, AND THIS

09:05.767 --> 09:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCIDENT HAPPENED DURING A LATIN

09:07.500 --> 09:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NIGHT AT THE CLUB, AND OBVIOUSLY

09:08.733 --> 09:10.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS A VERY DIVERSE AREA.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S A LARGE GROUP OF

09:12.133 --> 09:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPANISH-SPEAKING RESIDENTS, BOTH

09:13.700 --> 09:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICANS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE

09:15.733 --> 09:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVED HERE, SO IT SORT OF HITS

09:17.100 --> 09:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT AT THE HEART OF SOME OF

09:18.033 --> 09:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PEOPLE LINING UP AT THE BLOOD

09:27.733 --> 09:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BANK TO DONATE, FOR EXAMPLE.

09:29.733 --> 09:30.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF THINGS

09:30.767 --> 09:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STICK OUT.

09:32.900 --> 09:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE IS AS I REALIZE HOW MUCH

09:34.500 --> 09:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS TOUCHES EVERYONE AS SOON AS

09:35.933 --> 09:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I ARRIVED IN THE NEWSROOM VERY

09:37.633 --> 09:39.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EARLY THIS MORNING, ONE OF OUR

09:39.567 --> 09:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:41.200 --> 09:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE HAD NOT YET HEARD FROM A

09:41.967 --> 09:44.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRIEND.

09:44.067 --> 09:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAD A LOT OF THAT KIND OF

THING HAPPENING IN OUR NEWSROOM

09:46.567 --> 09:47.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OBVIOUSLY ACROSS THE

09:47.167 --> 09:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITY.

09:48.833 --> 09:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T THINK WE'LL ALL HAVE TO

09:50.133 --> 09:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO VERY FAR BEFORE WE FIND

09:51.467 --> 09:52.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEONE WHO WAS EITHER IN THE

09:52.767 --> 09:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLUB OR SADLY A VICTIM.

09:54.967 --> 09:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE RESPONSE TO THE CALL FOR

09:57.133 --> 09:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BLOOD WAS AMAZING.

09:58.700 --> 09:59.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO

09:59.867 --> 10:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
START TURNING PEOPLE AWAY.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICE EVEN TALKED ABOUT HOW

10:03.200 --> 10:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WERE BRINGING WATER AND

10:05.633 --> 10:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOOD DOWN TO AUTHORITIES AND

WERE WAITING FOR NEWS THERE.

10:12.100 --> 10:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

10:23.267 --> 10:24.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BETWEEN THE GROUPS FOR JUST A

10:44.900 --> 10:46.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

10:46.167 --> 10:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE READY TO RESPOND AND

TO ALL OF THOSE WHO WERE

AFFECTED BY THIS TRAGEDY.

12:07.733 --> 12:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS TRAGEDY HAPPENED AT A

12:09.500 --> 12:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POPULAR NIGHTCLUB, PULSE

12:10.700 --> 12:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORLANDO, A GAY NIGHTCLUB.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT HAPPENED DURING L.G.B.T.Q.

12:14.533 --> 12:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRIDE MONTH.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT HAPPENED AT A TIME WHEN THE

12:17.900 --> 12:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLUB WAS AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY.

12:20.033 --> 12:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT'S CLEAR THAT THE SHOOTER

12:22.333 --> 12:24.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD EVERY INTENT OF INFLICTING

12:24.167 --> 12:25.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE

12:25.467 --> 12:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND DAMAGE.

12:27.833 --> 12:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK WHAT'S REALLY

12:29.633 --> 12:32.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT

12:32.267 --> 12:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE L.G.B.T.Q. COMMUNITY HAS

12:35.533 --> 12:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN BE SAFE,

12:46.567 --> 12:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

COMMUNITY.

12:51.767 --> 12:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE'RE DEVASTATED TO SEE THIS

12:53.800 --> 12:55.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TYPE OF VIOLENCE, BUT I THINK

17:48.533 --> 17:52.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEPTEMBER 11th AMERICA DOES

17:52.767 --> 17:53.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT LAUNCH A WAR ON PEPTIC

17:53.667 --> 17:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ULCERS FROM TRYING TO PREVENT

17:54.433 --> 17:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

17:55.300 --> 17:56.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE CREATE THE GLOBAL WAR ON

17:56.567 --> 17:58.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERROR THAT IS CONTINUING, BUT

17:58.967 --> 18:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN PRACTICAL TERMS, EVEN IF

18:02.500 --> 18:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE ARE LONE WOLF ATTACKS, HOW

18:05.033 --> 18:05.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO WE PREVENT AGAINST SOMETHING

18:05.967 --> 18:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE THIS HAPPENING AGAIN?

18:09.500 --> 18:11.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE LONE WOLF ATTACKS IN

18:11.667 --> 18:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULAR ARE REALLY DEVILISHLY

18:13.500 --> 18:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFICULT PROBLEMS TO DEAL WITH.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU'RE DEALING BY DEFINITION

18:16.567 --> 18:17.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH TINY NUMBERS OF

18:17.167 --> 18:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDIVIDUALS.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE COULD RESPOND EVEN MORE

18:23.100 --> 18:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCEFULLY TO THE TERRORISM

18:24.533 --> 18:25.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREAT IN THE UNITED STATES THAN

18:25.967 --> 18:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE, AND IT'S WORTH NOTING

18:27.833 --> 18:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE'VE SPENT $1 TRILLION IN

18:29.533 --> 18:30.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTER-TERRORISM SINCE 2001.

18:30.667 --> 18:31.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT LIKE THE UNITED STATES

18:31.667 --> 18:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS DONE NOTHING.

18:33.033 --> 18:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CAN ALWAYS DO MORE, THE

18:35.533 --> 18:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEM IS THERE ARE TRADE-OFFS

18:36.933 --> 18:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSOCIATED WITH DOING MORE THAT

18:38.633 --> 18:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN SOMETIMES MAKE THE RESPONSE

18:40.133 --> 18:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM THAT IT'S

18:41.167 --> 18:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO SOLVE.

18:42.867 --> 18:44.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE

18:44.367 --> 18:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEM OF LONE WOLVES IN THE

18:46.000 --> 18:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES RESPONDING TO A

18:47.600 --> 18:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERIC CALL OF THE ISLAMIC

18:49.833 --> 18:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE TO ACT AGAINST AMERICANS.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE TINY MINORITY OF

18:57.533 --> 18:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUSLIMS IN THE UNITED STATES

18:59.500 --> 19:01.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENGAGED IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY.

19:01.167 --> 19:04.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF WE ENGAGE IN MORE

19:04.567 --> 19:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCEFUL SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES

19:10.233 --> 19:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO REDUCE THIS TINY NUMBER INTO

19:11.733 --> 19:13.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A TINIER NUMBER, WE RUN THE RISK

19:13.967 --> 19:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF PERSUADING THIS LARGER

19:16.633 --> 19:17.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRACTION TO THINK THE UNITED

19:17.567 --> 19:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES ISN'T WITH THEM.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S A MUCH GREATER THREAT

19:22.267 --> 19:23.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN ONE OR TWO LONE WOLF

19:23.267 --> 19:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACKS OF A KIND THAT ARE VERY

19:24.200 --> 19:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFICULT TO STOP.

19:26.533 --> 19:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS A PROBLEM WHERE IN ALL

19:29.300 --> 19:31.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKELIHOOD SOME KIND OF VERY LOW

19:31.767 --> 19:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEVEL BUT CHRONIC TERRORIST

19:33.800 --> 19:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREAT OF OCCASIONAL ACTS OF

19:35.667 --> 19:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS KIND IS PROBABLY SOMETHING

19:42.900 --> 19:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS GOING TO

19:43.933 --> 19:44.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE TO LIVE WITH FOR QUITE SOME

19:44.767 --> 19:45.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: IT SEEMS THE

19:46.300 --> 19:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRILLION DOLLARS WE MIGHT HAVE

19:47.233 --> 19:48.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPENT IS NOW MUCH BETTER AT

19:48.167 --> 19:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPOTTING CELLS AND GROUPS OF

19:49.033 --> 19:49.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMUNICATING AND

19:49.967 --> 19:51.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLOTTING AND CONSPIRING IN A

19:51.867 --> 19:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULAR ACT THAN IT IS THE

19:53.700 --> 19:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDIVIDUAL THAT DECIDES THIS IS

19:55.567 --> 19:57.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DAY THAT I WANT TO ALIGN

19:57.467 --> 19:58.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MYSELF WITH THIS IDEOLOGY AND DO

19:58.267 --> 20:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT I NEED TO DO.

20:02.833 --> 20:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

20:04.300 --> 20:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, BY DEFINITION, LONE

20:05.633 --> 20:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOLVES WHO ARE INSPIRED BY BUT

20:07.400 --> 20:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT DIRECTED BY FOREIGN

20:08.933 --> 20:10.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS ARE

20:10.467 --> 20:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT TO

20:11.600 --> 20:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPOT IN ADVANCE OF WHAT THEY

20:12.333 --> 20:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHOOSE TO DO.

20:13.700 --> 20:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DON'T LEAVE LARGE

20:14.433 --> 20:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOOTPRINTS.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DON'T ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES

20:18.467 --> 20:19.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT TEND TO MAKE THEM EASY TO

20:19.967 --> 20:21.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPOT AND EASY TO TAKE ACTION

20:21.767 --> 20:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST, AND IF WE TRY AND GET

20:23.433 --> 20:24.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE INFORMATION ON THEM, AGAIN,

20:24.867 --> 20:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WE END UP DOING IS BEING

20:26.133 --> 20:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE INTRUSIVE IN OUR

20:27.267 --> 20:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURVEILLANCE IN A WAY THAT

20:28.600 --> 20:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFFECTS FAR MORE PEOPLE WHO

20:29.733 --> 20:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREN'T GOING TO BECOME

20:31.000 --> 20:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRORISTS THAN THOSE WHO DO.

20:34.133 --> 20:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO ALL OF THESE THINGS INVOLVE A

20:35.400 --> 20:36.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAREFUL BALANCE.

20:36.867 --> 20:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S VERY, VERY EASY TO FALL OFF

20:39.633 --> 20:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT BALANCE, ESPECIALLY IN THE

20:41.067 --> 20:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTERMATH OF AN ATTACK LIKE

20:43.067 --> 20:44.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS, IN THE DIRECTION OF A

20:44.267 --> 20:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSE THAT MAKES THE PROBLEM

20:45.100 --> 20:50.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
