JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.808 --> 00:13.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: the
latest from
Brussels, as the manhunt expands
to a new

00:13.447 --> 00:17.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suspect, and Europe's emergency
meeting to
thwart future attacks.

00:17.718 --> 00:24.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: a day of reckoning for
Radovan Karadzic,
the Bosnian Serb leader
convicted of genocide

00:24.858 --> 00:28.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for orchestrating atrocities
during the war.

00:28.495 --> 00:34.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Making Sense of our economic
anxiety -- a
conservative economist's take on
what's fueling

00:34.501 --> 00:36.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the anger on display this
election.

00:36.536 --> 00:43.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHARLES MURRAY, American
Enterprise Institute:
Trumpism is the expression by
the white working

00:43.277 --> 00:47.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
class of a lot of legitimate
grievances that
it has with the ruling class.

00:47.447 --> 00:55.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:55.656 --> 00:58.525 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:58.558 --> 01:08.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Belgian officials
came under
mounting pressure over Tuesday's
terror attacks

01:08.468 --> 01:15.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Brussels, Islamic State
bombers that killed
31 people and wounded 200 on
Tuesday -- 270

01:15.976 --> 01:22.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Tuesday. Now the list of
suspects is growing,
along with questions about how
it could have

01:22.716 --> 01:24.051 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happened.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Malcolm Brabant reports on the
day's developments
from Brussels.

01:26.687 --> 01:31.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Security at
Brussels' Malcolm
Brabant metro station eased
slightly today,

01:31.525 --> 01:34.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but police and barriers remained
in place.

01:34.328 --> 01:40.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the suicide bombers,
Khalid El Bakraoui,
struck there on Tuesday. Reports
today said

01:40.100 --> 01:45.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigators now believe a
second, unidentified
person was involved in the
subway attack,

01:45.339 --> 01:47.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and may still be at large.

01:47.574 --> 01:53.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
El Bakraoui's brother, Ibrahim,
and another
man blew themselves up at the
airport. A third

01:53.547 --> 02:00.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man spotted there is also being
sought. But
concerns are growing about why
the authorities

02:00.587 --> 02:02.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
didn't foil the plot.

02:02.723 --> 02:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Belgium's justice and interior
ministers offered
their resignations today, but
neither was

02:07.294 --> 02:09.129 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
accepted.

02:09.162 --> 02:11.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAN JAMBON, Belgian Interior
Minister (through
translator): If you put
everything in a row,

02:11.098 --> 02:15.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then you can say that you can
indeed ask big
questions in a number of areas
about the Justice

02:15.369 --> 02:19.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Department and the developments
afterwards
and also about the police.

02:19.106 --> 02:24.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This canal is
an emblem of
Belgium's problems. On the left
side is Brussels,

02:24.177 --> 02:29.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the right, Molenbeek, a poor,
mostly Muslim
district, many from North
Africa. It's a place

02:29.549 --> 02:33.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
regarded as a no-go zone by many
ethnic Belgians.

02:33.353 --> 02:38.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The army is now protecting the
police station
not far from the hideaway of
Salah Abdeslam,

02:38.759 --> 02:44.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the sole survivor of last
November's Paris
attacks, who was captured last
week. Molenbeek

02:44.164 --> 02:49.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been the launch pad for
numerous jihadis,
including fighters who've joined
Islamic State

02:49.369 --> 02:51.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Syria and Iraq.

02:51.505 --> 02:56.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the district's deputy mayor,
Ahmed El
Khannouss, resents suggestions
that it is

02:56.109 --> 02:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Europe's main jihadi breeding
ground.

02:58.145 --> 03:03.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMED EL KHANNOUSS, Molenbeek
Deputy Mayor
(through translator): Molenbeek
is not a bastion

03:03.550 --> 03:09.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of terrorism. Molenbeek is not a
fertile ground
for terrorism. There is no
lawless area in

03:09.489 --> 03:13.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Molenbeek. That doesn't mean
there are not
any problems. We have big
problems, and this

03:13.827 --> 03:18.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is just one of them. It's true
that Molenbeek
has a link with certain
terrorist activities

03:18.165 --> 03:22.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because the perpetrators passed
through here,
but the local and national
authorities were

03:22.469 --> 03:24.137 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not aware of it.

03:24.171 --> 03:28.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: It increasingly
appears that
the same ISIS network was behind
both the

03:28.375 --> 03:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks in Brussels and in Paris
last November.
Salah Abdeslam was summoned to
court in Brussels

03:34.748 --> 03:38.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today. His lawyer said he no
longer opposes
extradition to France.

03:38.351 --> 03:39.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SVEN MARY, Attorney for Salah
Abdeslam: In
the beginning, he wanted that
his extradition

03:39.686 --> 03:48.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to France took some more time.
Yesterday,
he changed his mind.

03:48.929 --> 03:54.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This was also
the first of
three days of mourning in
Belgium, and the

03:54.701 --> 03:59.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prime minister spoke ahead of
another moment
of silence, saying his nation
was hit at its

04:00.006 --> 04:01.842 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
heart.

04:01.875 --> 04:06.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES MICHEL, Belgian Prime
Minister (through
translator): At the airport, at
the subway

04:06.246 --> 04:11.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
station, the liberty of daily
life was slaughtered.
That same liberty is at the
foundation of

04:11.218 --> 04:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our democracy, our desire to
live together
in harmony, that same liberty
upon which the

04:16.857 --> 04:18.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
European project was built.

04:18.758 --> 04:23.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Nearby, the
Place de la Bourse
has become the focal point for
grief, defiance

04:23.363 --> 04:28.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and solidarity. This young
Syrian held up
a sign today saying she may be a
Muslim, but

04:28.869 --> 04:31.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
she's not a terrorist.

04:31.037 --> 04:35.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Belgian Xavier Hannon came
here to chalk
a simple message on the
sidewalk. "For you

04:35.942 --> 04:38.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who have departed," he wrote.

04:38.345 --> 04:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
XAVIER HANNON, Belgium (through
translator):
I came to write a couple of
words for my friend

04:43.817 --> 04:48.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who died in the metro. He was
just on his
way to a lesson. And now he will
never come

04:48.188 --> 04:53.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back. He had nothing to do with
this. We have
nothing to do with this. It's
not our war.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're just young people.

04:55.529 --> 04:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Throughout
Brussels, was
evidence that this country is
involved in

04:59.199 --> 05:05.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a war with an enemy it can't
see. The army
was on guard at the main
Eurostar train station.

05:05.038 --> 05:10.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Every suitcase, however
harmless, represents
a potential threat in this
difficult climate.

05:10.744 --> 05:14.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Brussels Airport has
canceled flights
until at least Monday.

05:14.447 --> 05:19.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This afternoon, European Union
justice and
interior ministers held an
emergency meeting

05:19.819 --> 05:25.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to discuss enhancing security.
With more than
5,000 jihadis said to be roaming
Europe, the

05:25.992 --> 05:27.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
issue could not be more urgent.

05:27.861 --> 05:32.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nevertheless, the Belgian
authorities have
lowered the terror threat level,
despite saying

05:32.432 --> 05:36.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that another attack is -- quote
-- "likely
and possible" -- Judy.

05:36.536 --> 05:41.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. State
Department said
today that it's still trying to
account for

05:41.408 --> 05:45.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the Americans known to have
been in Brussels
on Tuesday.

05:45.612 --> 05:50.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And this evening, French
authorities said
they have arrested a suspect in
Paris who

05:50.083 --> 05:52.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was planning an attack there.

05:52.819 --> 05:57.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
United States
has indicted seven computer
hackers for large-scale

05:57.857 --> 06:03.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks on American banks. They
worked for
companies tied to Iran's
government and its

06:03.663 --> 06:11.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hard-line Revolutionary Guard.
Between 2011
and 2013, they allegedly used
malware to attack

06:11.271 --> 06:13.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
46 financial institutions.

06:13.707 --> 06:18.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington today, Attorney
General Loretta
Lynch said the assault cost the
targets tens

06:18.878 --> 06:20.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of millions of dollars.

06:20.680 --> 06:24.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: The
attacks were relentless, they
were systematic,

06:24.484 --> 06:28.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they were widespread. They
threatened
our economic well-being and our
ability to

06:28.989 --> 06:34.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compete fairly in the global
marketplace,
both of which are directly
linked to our national

06:34.327 --> 06:36.196 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
security.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the
hackers also allegedly
accessed the controls of a small
dam outside

06:39.799 --> 06:45.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New York City, but did no
damage. All of the
suspects remain at large.

06:45.171 --> 06:51.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Iraq, government troops
opened a military
offensive today to retake Mosul,
the country's

06:51.444 --> 06:53.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
second largest city.

06:53.513 --> 06:57.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Jane
Ferguson is in
Iraq, and reports from Irbil.

06:57.817 --> 07:04.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Iraqi forces
spent weeks chipping
away at Islamic State positions
in the north.

07:04.924 --> 07:08.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, this morning, came the
announcement
on state television.

07:08.528 --> 07:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
Iraqi security
troops have begun the conquest
operation of

07:13.366 --> 07:17.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
liberating the Mosul region. Our
troops have
been waging pitched battles, and
they are

07:17.404 --> 07:20.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heading toward the drawn-up and
planned targets.

07:20.106 --> 07:26.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Officials said
Kurdish militia
and U.S. airstrikes are
supporting the assault.

07:26.746 --> 07:32.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi
tweeted, the
first stage was swift and
decisive. It began

07:32.552 --> 07:38.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by capturing several villages
near Makhmour,
about 40 miles south of Mosul.
The ultimate

07:38.391 --> 07:41.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
goal is to reclaim Mosul itself.

07:41.594 --> 07:48.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS forces captured the city in
June of 2014,
routing government troops, who
left behind

07:48.535 --> 07:57.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
troves of weapons and
ammunition, even
American-supplied
vehicles and artillery pieces.

07:57.310 --> 08:03.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Since then, Iraq's army,
supported on the
ground by Shiite militias and
Iranian advisers,

08:03.083 --> 08:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has retaken Tikrit, oil-rich
Baiji and most
recently Ramadi. But Mosul,
which once had

08:10.290 --> 08:15.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a population of two million, is
by far its
biggest challenge.

08:15.195 --> 08:21.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington today, a State
Department spokesman,
Mark Toner, said the U.S. is
standing by its

08:21.267 --> 08:23.002 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ally.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK TONER, State Department
Spokesman: We
certainly support and share with
the Iraqi

08:24.838 --> 08:29.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
government its goal of
liberating Mosul as
quickly as possible, but this
has to be an

08:29.476 --> 08:31.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Iraqi led effort.

08:31.311 --> 08:35.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Already, there's
been an American
casualty linked to the battle
for Mosul. A

08:35.348 --> 08:41.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Marine was killed Saturday
by a rocket
attack near there. His newly
deployed unit

08:41.054 --> 08:44.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is helping defend an Iraqi
military base.

08:44.557 --> 08:50.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By all accounts, a decisive
victory in Mosul
is not going to be quick.
Instead, say Iraqi

08:50.697 --> 08:57.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military officials, the battle
will be a lengthy,
street-by-street, hard-fought
campaign. Today's

08:57.637 --> 09:03.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offensive is the very early
stage of that
battle, drawing the noose a
little tighter

09:03.209 --> 09:07.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the biggest city under
Islamic State's
control.

09:07.313 --> 09:10.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Ferguson
in Irbil.

09:10.617 --> 09:14.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the
Syrian government
announced its troops have fought
their way

09:14.954 --> 09:21.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into Palmyra, with support from
Russian airstrikes.
The Roman-era city is held by
Islamic State

09:21.594 --> 09:28.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fighters and lies at a key
crossroads in Central
Syria. State TV today showed
military units

09:28.134 --> 09:34.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
entering the outskirts of
Palmyra. But they're
too late to save ancient
temples, tombs and

09:34.407 --> 09:38.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other artifacts already
destroyed by the militants.

09:38.878 --> 09:43.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry
and Russian
President Vladimir Putin talked
up prospects

09:43.483 --> 09:49.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for peace in Syria today. The
two men met
in Moscow. Kerry welcomed
Russia's withdrawal

09:49.489 --> 09:56.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of most of its military forces
from Syria.
Putin said that U.S./Russian
cooperation has

09:56.062 --> 10:02.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
helped bring progress.
Meanwhile, the latest
round of Syrian peace talks
ended in Geneva.

10:02.168 --> 10:05.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're to resume on April 9.

10:05.538 --> 10:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama spent a final
day in Argentina,
paying tribute to victims of
brutal military

10:11.811 --> 10:17.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rule. And he acknowledged the
United States
was slow to condemn it. He
visited a memorial

10:17.550 --> 10:25.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to thousands killed in the
so-called Dirty
War from 1976 to 1983. It began
with the overthrow

10:25.458 --> 10:31.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Argentina's government 40
years ago today,
and Mr. Obama discussed it later
at a briefing.

10:31.898 --> 10:35.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
The United States, when it
reflects on what

10:35.702 --> 10:42.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened here, has to examine
its own policies
as well and its own past.
Democracies have

10:42.609 --> 10:47.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to have the courage to
acknowledge when we
don't live up to the ideals that
we stand

10:47.146 --> 10:54.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for. And we have been slow to
speak out for
human rights, and that was the
case here.

10:54.487 --> 11:00.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
pledged to declassify
more military and intelligence
documents on

11:00.193 --> 11:05.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the issue. There've been
protests against
his visit, accusing the U.S. of
backing the

11:05.131 --> 11:08.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
former military dictatorship.

11:08.034 --> 11:13.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, a spring
blizzard that
blasted Denver is moving on,
into the Northern

11:13.139 --> 11:19.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plains and the Midwest. High
winds and heavy
snow were reported today from
Wyoming to Michigan.

11:19.445 --> 11:25.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Up to a foot of snow blanketed
Minnesota's
Twin Cities, and parts of
Colorado got 30

11:25.685 --> 11:31.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inches. Denver International
Airport was fully
operational after canceling
almost all its

11:31.491 --> 11:33.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
flights yesterday.

11:33.660 --> 11:39.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vice President Joe Biden charged
today that
Senate Republicans have
distorted his past

11:39.132 --> 11:45.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remarks to justify blocking the
President
Obama's latest Supreme Court
nominee. In 1992,

11:45.972 --> 11:52.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then-Senator Biden warned that
the first President
Bush not name a court nominee
until after

11:52.779 --> 11:57.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that year's election. Today, he
said he was
simply urging consultation to
get a -- quote

11:57.850 --> 12:00.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- "moderate nominee."

12:00.053 --> 12:04.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street finished a shortened
workweek
in quiet trading. The Dow Jones
industrial

12:04.891 --> 12:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average gained 13 points to
close at 17515.
The Nasdaq rose four points, and
the S&amp;P 500

12:13.533 --> 12:19.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
slipped a fraction. The markets
are closed
tomorrow for Good Friday.

12:19.138 --> 12:25.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Actor and comedian Garry
Shandling died today
in Los Angeles of an undisclosed
cause. He's

12:25.478 --> 12:32.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perhaps best known for his
Emmy-winning "Larry
Sanders Show," which debuted in
1992. Shandling

12:32.685 --> 12:40.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
later won an American Comedy
Award in 1999.
He also hosted the Emmy Awards
show in 2004.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Garry Shandling was 66 years
old.

12:43.663 --> 12:50.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, finally, after years of
rumor, archaeologists
have concluded that yes, William
Shakespeare's

12:50.470 --> 12:57.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
skull seems to be missing. They
used ground-penetrating
radar to scan the playwright's
tomb at Holy

12:58.011 --> 13:04.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Trinity Church in
Stratford-Upon-Avon, England.
Until now, scholars dismissed
claims that

13:04.350 --> 13:08.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grave robbers stole the skull in
the 18th
century.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's good to have all that
cleared up.

13:11.758 --> 13:17.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
The U.N.
finds a former Bosnian leader
guilty of genocide;

13:17.163 --> 13:24.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how North Carolina signed a bill
called the
most anti-LGBT law in the
country; why anger

13:24.504 --> 13:38.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
over economics fuels
front-runner Donald Trump's
campaign; and much more.

13:38.651 --> 13:44.223 align:left position:37.5%,start line:80% size:62.5%
9
Today was a day of reckoning for
the former

13:44.257 --> 13:49.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bosnian-Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic, who
faced verdict in The Hague for
his actions

13:49.429 --> 13:52.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
during the war in Bosnia in the
1990s.

13:52.665 --> 13:57.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We begin with this report from
James Mates
of Independent Television News.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The International Criminal
Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia is now in
session.

14:01.007 --> 14:05.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: The wheels of
international justice
may turn painfully slowly, but
they do still

14:05.344 --> 14:10.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turn, and at least some of those
leaders who
commit crimes against humanity
one day pay

14:10.717 --> 14:12.585 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a price.

14:12.618 --> 14:18.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's 24 years since this man,
Radovan Karadzic,
embarked on a brutal war in
Bosnia. He was

14:18.391 --> 14:25.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the leader of the Bosnian Serbs
who ordered
the siege of Sarajevo; 21 years
ago, men under

14:25.965 --> 14:32.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his command murdered 8,000
Muslim men and
boys at Srebrenica, the worst
act of genocide

14:32.905 --> 14:34.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
since World War II.

14:34.407 --> 14:37.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Mr. Karadzic, could you
please stand?

14:37.577 --> 14:41.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: Today, he was
cleared of one
charge of genocide, but that did
nothing to

14:41.380 --> 14:44.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mitigate the list of crimes he
was convicted
of.

14:45.017 --> 14:55.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Count two, genocide. Count
three, persecution
of crimes against humanity.
Count four, extermination,

14:55.728 --> 15:02.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a crime against humanity. Count
five, murder,
the crime against humanity.

15:02.802 --> 15:08.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: The sentence for
these and six
more counts means this
65-year-old should

15:08.341 --> 15:09.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
die in jail.

15:09.575 --> 15:14.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: To a single sentence of 40,
4-0, years
of imprisonment.

15:14.313 --> 15:19.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES MATES: Survivors,
relatives and victims
of Karadzic filed out of the
courtroom having

15:19.185 --> 15:24.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
watched the verdict, among them
a man who
had been imprisoned in one of
the camps first

15:24.090 --> 15:30.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
revealed to the world by ITV
News back in
1992. He was happy, but the
acquittal on one

15:30.630 --> 15:32.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the two charges of genocide
hurt badly.

15:33.032 --> 15:37.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SATKO MUJAGIC, Survivor: But the
11o~th one
was about genocide in
(INAUDIBLE) where I

15:37.603 --> 15:43.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come and other municipalities
back in 1992,
in the time when actually whole
process of

15:43.676 --> 15:46.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
genocide started and ended with
Srebrenica.

15:46.412 --> 15:50.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: Karadzic's lawyer
emerged to
say his client continued to
maintain his innocence

15:50.917 --> 15:52.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and would appeal.

15:52.685 --> 15:56.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We take a closer
look at the
significance of today's
conviction of the

15:56.155 --> 16:01.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Serbian leader with Nicholas
Burns. He was
a State Department spokesman
during the conflict

16:01.327 --> 16:06.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Bosnia. He went on to become
undersecretary
of state for political affairs.
He is now

16:06.332 --> 16:11.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Harvard university. And David
Rohde covered
the war in Bosnia for The
Christian Science

16:11.838 --> 16:17.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Monitor. He's the author of the
book "Endgame:
The Betrayal and Fall of
Srebrenica: Europe's

16:17.810 --> 16:22.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Worst Massacre Since World War
II." He's now
and editor at Reuters.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we welcome both of you.

16:24.717 --> 16:30.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, Nicholas Burns,
remind us. This
was a period almost a
quarter-century ago.

16:30.289 --> 16:34.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a small corner of
Europe. Remind us
who Radovan Karadzic was and
what happened.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS, Former U.S.
Undersecretary
of State for Political Affairs:
Well, Judy,

16:37.096 --> 16:42.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was the leader of the Bosnian
Serbs. He
led that community and its
parliament.

16:42.435 --> 16:47.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was a war by the Bosnian
Serbs to conquer
the Bosnian Muslims, to combat
the Croat community,

16:47.874 --> 16:52.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Slovenian community as
Yugoslavia broke
up. The Serbs wanted to create a
greater Serbia.

16:52.979 --> 16:57.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Karadzic and Ratko Mladic,
the general,
the leading general of the
Bosnian Serbs,

16:57.650 --> 16:59.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
led a vicious campaign.

16:59.685 --> 17:06.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That war took 100,000 lives at
least, 2.5
million refugees, and it
culminated in this

17:06.959 --> 17:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
great, great tragedy at
Srebrenica in July
1995, when the Bosnian Serbs,
under Karadzic's

17:13.766 --> 17:19.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
orders, murdered 8,000 Muslim
men and boys
in two-and-a-half days in a
soccer stadium.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was the worst massacre
in Europe
since the Nazis.

17:22.875 --> 17:27.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It galvanized the United States
and Europe
to act, because we had not acted
sufficiently

17:27.446 --> 17:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between '91 and '95. And it led
to the U.S.
air campaign in September and
October of that

17:33.552 --> 17:36.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year, and it led to the Dayton
peace talks.
And that's where the peace was
made. So this

17:36.856 --> 17:40.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was a significant event in the
history of
Europe.

17:40.393 --> 17:45.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Rohde, as a
reporter,
who covered that war, what would
you add?

17:45.298 --> 17:50.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROHDE, Reuters: I would
just say, in
a sense, this is the largest
verdict, the

17:50.436 --> 17:54.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
largest war crimes verdict in
Europe since
the Nuremberg trials.

17:54.073 --> 17:59.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Karadzic is the highest-level
civilian official
who will face justice, who has
faced justice.

18:00.012 --> 18:04.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Slobodan Milosevic, the former
president of
Serbia, would have been, but he
died in captivity.

18:04.717 --> 18:10.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's an enormous verdict. I
was here in
New York today, and by chance,
the hostess

18:10.489 --> 18:17.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a restaurant I was at was a
Bosnian American,
a Bosnian Muslim, and she burst
into tears

18:17.163 --> 18:21.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking about, you know, the
fact that this
verdict had come down and he had
been convicted

18:21.867 --> 18:23.669 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of genocide.

18:23.703 --> 18:27.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, David Rohde,
staying with
you -- again, you covered that
war. What does

18:27.974 --> 18:31.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it mean to you, as somebody who
saw much of
this on the ground?

18:31.177 --> 18:33.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID ROHDE: Well, it's
accountability.

18:33.846 --> 18:40.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a sense for years as
the war dragged
on, as Nic said, 100,000 people
were killed,

18:40.419 --> 18:44.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and NATO and the U.N. kept --
and the international
community said they were going
to act, but

18:44.957 --> 18:49.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they didn't act. And there was a
sense that
that emboldened the Bosnian
Serbs to do this.

18:49.595 --> 18:53.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the real tragedy of
Srebrenica, the town
itself, it wasn't simply that
the world didn't

18:53.366 --> 18:58.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
act. Srebrenica was declared a
United Nations
protected safe area. U.N.
peacekeepers went

18:58.971 --> 19:04.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in and they actually took away
the heavier
weapons that Bosnian Muslims in
the surrounding

19:04.110 --> 19:09.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town of Srebrenica had. And they
promised
that the U.N. and NATO would
protect them.

19:09.882 --> 19:15.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Bosnian Muslims, with less
weaponry then,
weren't protected, the town was
overrun, and,

19:15.054 --> 19:18.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
again, 8,000 men and boys
systematically executed.

19:18.858 --> 19:24.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nicholas Burns,
why does it
matter that 20 -- again, almost
a quarter-of-a-century

19:24.897 --> 19:28.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
later, someone like Radovan
Karadzic is held
accountable?

19:28.534 --> 19:34.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS: Well, Judy, the
arc of the
moral universe is long, but it
bends toward

19:34.907 --> 19:39.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
justice. That's what Martin
Luther King said.
And he obviously was right.
Justice has been

19:39.245 --> 19:40.980 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
done here.

19:41.013 --> 19:45.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was genocide against an
entire people,
against a Muslim population, and
it took 21

19:46.018 --> 19:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very painful, very frustrating,
long years
for justice to work. But it has.
And so this

19:50.990 --> 19:56.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
war crimes tribunal is very
important, as
has been the war crimes tribunal
in Rwanda,

19:56.495 --> 19:59.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where there was a genocide as
well the year
before.

19:59.532 --> 20:05.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we in positions of power,
the United States
and other countries, have to see
justice as

20:05.571 --> 20:10.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very important priority for us
and have
to see peace as an important
priority. So

20:10.409 --> 20:14.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's very important that
these efforts
continue and that the United
States continues

20:14.246 --> 20:16.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to support them.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Rohde, how,
looking back,
does one explain what happened
here? This

20:18.851 --> 20:27.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was, what, 50 years after World
War II, the
Holocaust in Germany. How do you
explain something

20:27.927 --> 20:31.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
like this, this ethnic
cleansing, genocide
that took place?

20:31.897 --> 20:38.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROHDE: Well, it was
disturbing. My time
speaking to Bosnian Serb
soldiers about this,

20:38.471 --> 20:43.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they saw themselves as the
victim of some
sort of giant Muslim conspiracy
to take over

20:43.576 --> 20:48.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Europe, and that they had to act
this way
to save Europe.

20:48.080 --> 20:54.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they were deluded, but,
again, they were
abetted by a failure to act. We
see the consequences

20:54.553 --> 20:59.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of that in Syria today. It's not
that the
West has to necessarily act, but
it can't

20:59.091 --> 21:04.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
promise to act. It can't, you
know, call for
President Assad to step down in
Syria, and

21:04.363 --> 21:06.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then not follow up on those
promises.

21:06.265 --> 21:10.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the real lesson of all this
is to not
promise to bring justice, to not
promise to

21:10.769 --> 21:15.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of remove a brutal leader
and then to
not act. That's the mistake. If
we're going

21:15.741 --> 21:21.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do nothing, say nothing. But
it's the raising
the expectations and doing
nothing that then

21:21.680 --> 21:24.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
emboldens the perpetrators of
these crimes.

21:24.416 --> 21:28.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nicholas Burns,
why did the
U.S. and other nations wait so
long to get

21:28.988 --> 21:30.789 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
involved here?

21:30.823 --> 21:33.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS: I think, on the
part of the
United States and the part of
President George

21:33.592 --> 21:37.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
H.W. Bush and then Bill Clinton,
this was
a job that they thought the
Europeans would

21:37.496 --> 21:39.298 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
handle.

21:39.331 --> 21:41.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Europeans took this
opportunity to say,
we will be the ones that will
lead here. They

21:41.901 --> 21:46.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were incapable of doing that,
unfortunately.
The United Nations and the
Europeans did not

21:46.238 --> 21:48.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have a significant enough
mission.

21:48.040 --> 21:53.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What really turned this whole
war was that
massacre at Srebrenica. I think,
Judy, it

21:53.846 --> 21:59.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shamed the United States, it
shamed Europe
into acting. And we had two
things that ended

21:59.418 --> 22:04.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this war. It was the decision by
President
Clinton -- and he was right --
to use military

22:04.123 --> 22:09.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force, an air campaign against
the Bosnian
Serbs in September and October
of 1995, and

22:09.762 --> 22:13.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then the brilliant diplomacy of
the late Ambassador
Richard C. Holbrooke.

22:14.033 --> 22:19.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It was his will, his
determination to see
a peace made at Dayton that I
think was the

22:19.905 --> 22:24.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
singular factor that that war
ended. And we
should pay tribute to Ambassador
Holbrooke,

22:24.743 --> 22:26.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Dick Holbrooke, and remember
him today.

22:26.545 --> 22:31.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, David Rohde,
what does
this verdict mean, if anything,
for the people

22:31.317 --> 22:32.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Bosnia today?

22:32.785 --> 22:38.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID ROHDE: To be frank, it's
not a great
situation in Bosnia today.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's a sense that the
international community
has shifted away from there.
There's a need

22:41.794 --> 22:48.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to sort of reform the
constitution that was
created after the Dayton
accords. And there's

22:48.234 --> 22:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concern that if not -- if there
isn't more
engagement there, there could be
more division.

22:52.938 --> 22:59.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The current leader of the
Bosnian Serbs, Milorad
Dodik, just recently as last
week dedicated

22:59.445 --> 23:05.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new dormitory for university
students. That
dormitory is named after Radovan
Karadzic,

23:05.784 --> 23:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the man convicted of genocide
today. So we
have to keep our eye on Bosnia
and follow

23:11.290 --> 23:14.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through, huge step forward
today, but more
work to do.

23:14.426 --> 23:19.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we thank
both of you
very much for reminding us of
the significance

23:19.531 --> 23:20.599 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of all of this.

23:20.633 --> 23:23.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Rohde, Nicholas Burns, we
thank you
both.

23:23.636 --> 23:29.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS: Thank you.

23:29.341 --> 23:34.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID ROHDE: Thank you.

23:35.014 --> 23:42.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn now to
North Carolina,
where a new measure restricting
protections

23:42.321 --> 23:48.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and
transgender
people is being called the
toughest law of

23:48.193 --> 23:50.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
its kind in the nation.

23:50.062 --> 23:55.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We begin our story with
Wednesday's dramatic
emergency session of state
lawmakers.

23:55.467 --> 23:57.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

23:57.136 --> 24:02.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Senate Democrats
walked out in
protest, leaving their empty
chairs.

24:02.041 --> 24:06.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Thirty-two having voted in
the affirmative
and zero in the negative, House
Bill 2 passes.

24:06.812 --> 24:11.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The vote repealed a
new ordinance
in Charlotte, North Carolina,
that expanded

24:11.583 --> 24:18.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protections for LGBTQ people,
including letting
transgender people choose which
bathroom to

24:18.057 --> 24:24.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
use. The new state law goes even
further,
barring any city from passing
anti-discrimination

24:24.229 --> 24:26.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
laws in the future.

24:26.365 --> 24:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lawmakers heard testimony on
both sides.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH PRESTON, American Civil
Liberties Union
of North Carolina: Half of the
transgender

24:30.202 --> 24:33.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individuals surveyed in North
Carolina recently
reported being harassed in
public accommodations.

24:33.872 --> 24:37.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHLOE JEFFERSON, Student: What
about my rights
to privacy and wishes not to be
exposed to

24:37.810 --> 24:40.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
young males changing and
showering beside
me?

24:40.079 --> 24:44.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Late Wednesday night,
Republican
Governor Pat McCrory signed it
into law, saying

24:44.616 --> 24:50.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a statement that Charlotte
violated "the
basic expectation of privacy in
the most personal

24:50.456 --> 24:53.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of settings, a restroom or
locker room."

24:53.692 --> 24:58.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He accused the leaders of the
state's largest
city of government overreach and
intrusion.

24:59.031 --> 25:02.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Charlotte Mayor Jennifer
Roberts, a Democrat,
fired back.

25:02.534 --> 25:05.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER ROBERTS (D), Mayor of
Charlotte,
North Carolina: This legislation
is literally

25:05.104 --> 25:13.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most anti-LGBT legislation
in the country.
And it does this not just in
Charlotte, but

25:13.112 --> 25:14.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all across our state.

25:14.980 --> 25:19.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Activists and legal
rights groups,
like the ACLU, say they're
already exploring

25:19.251 --> 25:22.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a court challenge to the law.

25:22.688 --> 25:27.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We explore this issue at the
local and national
level with Loretta Boniti,
senior political

25:27.092 --> 25:33.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reporter for Time Warner Cable
News in North
Carolina, and Dominic Holden,
national LGBT

25:33.399 --> 25:36.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reporter for BuzzFeed News.

25:36.902 --> 25:38.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dominic and Loretta, thanks for
joining us.

25:38.470 --> 25:40.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Loretta, let me start with you.

25:40.339 --> 25:44.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You covered this legislative
action yesterday.
As I understand it, the
Charlotte ordinance

25:44.877 --> 25:50.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this is targeting hasn't
even gone into
effect yet. Did the legislative
leaders say

25:50.482 --> 25:53.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why they felt the need for a
special session
here?

25:53.252 --> 25:56.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA BONITI, Time Warner
Cable News North
Carolina: Well, the legislative
leaders said

25:56.355 --> 26:00.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they could have waited
until after the
ordinance went into effect on
April 1, but

26:00.826 --> 26:05.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they thought it was smart not to
let it go
into effect and then to go back
and say, by

26:05.297 --> 26:09.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the way, no, you can't do that
once they go
into their special session on
April -- or

26:09.334 --> 26:11.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their regular session on April
25.

26:11.136 --> 26:16.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they said, we should come
back beforehand
and never let this go into
effect. And they

26:17.009 --> 26:20.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
felt like this was necessary,
even though
the governor had said he thought
that they

26:20.279 --> 26:23.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could wait until the end of
April to take
care of this.

26:23.081 --> 26:27.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: A lot of the
discussion that I
heard, Loretta, on the floor
debate focused

26:27.786 --> 26:33.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the provision about allowing
transgender
people to choose which bathroom
the use.

26:33.192 --> 26:37.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think, if that -- if it
hadn't been
for that, they might not have
acted so quickly?

26:37.529 --> 26:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA BONITI: I think that's
the issue that
really prompted folks to say
that they needed

26:42.167 --> 26:45.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to come back. That's what they
were getting
the phone calls from, from their
constituents,

26:45.237 --> 26:50.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying that, to them, this seems
like something
that was a concern. They say it
was a safety

26:50.876 --> 26:54.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concern. They wanted to make
sure that someone
who is biologically a male
cannot go into

26:54.580 --> 26:57.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a female restroom legally in
North Carolina.

26:57.483 --> 27:00.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they said they wanted to
stop that from
happening before it became law.

27:00.819 --> 27:05.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Dominic, help us put
this in perspective.
How does both what Charlotte did
in their

27:05.657 --> 27:11.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ordinance and what the North
Carolina state
legislature did fit into the
spectrum, as

27:11.163 --> 27:16.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it were, of what's going on
around the country
in city councils and in state
legislatures?

27:16.869 --> 27:22.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMINIC HOLDEN, BuzzFeed: What
the city council
did in Charlotte was very common
in the United

27:22.641 --> 27:28.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States. There are about 200
cities with ordinances
like these that ban
discrimination against

27:28.780 --> 27:30.883 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
LGBT people.

27:30.916 --> 27:37.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the lawmakers did in the
North Carolina
capitol in response is
increasingly common

27:37.489 --> 27:43.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this year. There were more than
100 bills
filed that target LGBT people in
some way,

27:43.562 --> 27:50.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an unprecedented number, and
that is seen
as a backlash to the decision
last year by

27:50.035 --> 27:57.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. Supreme Court, which
allowed marriage
in all 50 states between
same-sex couples.

27:57.943 --> 28:02.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These bills have a number of
forms. Some of
them are religious protection
bills, such

28:02.981 --> 28:09.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as one in Missouri, and another
one in Georgia
right now, although the one in
North Carolina

28:09.922 --> 28:14.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was somewhat unique, in that it
combined two
other types of bills we have
seen.

28:14.593 --> 28:22.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is a preemption bill that
overrides local
jurisdictions, and the other
would ban transgender

28:22.401 --> 28:29.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students from school restrooms
that correspond
with their gender identity. And
so North Carolina

28:29.775 --> 28:31.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
put these two together.

28:31.743 --> 28:38.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the second one about banning
students
from school restrooms is the
first of its

28:38.150 --> 28:43.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind in the entire country. And
there are
questions then raised about what
this means

28:43.722 --> 28:50.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legally for the state. The Obama
administration
has said that civil rights laws
ban that sort

28:50.529 --> 28:55.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of discrimination against
transgender people
in schools, and so this seems
like it's ripe

28:55.100 --> 28:57.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for a legal challenge.

28:57.069 --> 29:01.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Dominic, have
local communities
been establishing rights for
transgender people

29:01.440 --> 29:06.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in terms of restrooms? Is that
something that
we're seeing a lot of, or is it
just because

29:06.511 --> 29:09.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Caitlyn Jenner we're paying
more attention
to it?

29:09.915 --> 29:11.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOMINIC HOLDEN: This is very
standard.

29:11.750 --> 29:16.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the way that many of these
laws are written
is that they ban discrimination
on the basis

29:16.054 --> 29:22.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of sexual orientation or gender
identity in
places of employment, in
housing, and in public

29:22.961 --> 29:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accommodation. And this is
widely been interpreted
to say that transgender people
can use restrooms

29:28.300 --> 29:30.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that correspond with their
gender identity.

29:30.135 --> 29:36.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are 17 states with such
laws, more than
200 cities, but, in recent
times, the last

29:36.041 --> 29:40.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
few years in particular,
conservative activists
have latched onto this to
suggest that there

29:40.879 --> 29:42.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is some sort of safety threat
presented.

29:42.781 --> 29:46.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Loretta, what's been
the reaction
around North Carolina,
particularly the business

29:46.818 --> 29:50.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community, which has been
important in these
cases in other states?

29:50.856 --> 29:55.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA BONITI: We have heard a
lot from the
business community come out and
say that they

29:55.327 --> 29:58.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really don't like the sounds of
this law.
I think they're still trying to
figure out

29:58.163 --> 30:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exactly what it will do here in
North Carolina.

30:01.533 --> 30:05.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We haven't heard anybody come
outright and
say, well, I'm leaving North
Carolina because

30:05.170 --> 30:09.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this law, but we have several
big businesses,
like Red Hat, American Airlines
that are based

30:09.775 --> 30:13.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here who have said they don't
like the way
that this law works. And,
obviously, when

30:13.412 --> 30:18.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you start seeing big businesses
like that
speak out against something,
that will lead

30:18.083 --> 30:21.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to probably a ripple effect of
more and more
businesses coming out against
it.

30:21.787 --> 30:26.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Dominic, you
mentioned the same-sex
marriage decision by the Supreme
Court last

30:26.091 --> 30:32.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year. We have also seen gays in
the military
issue being resolved. Is this
now the new

30:32.531 --> 30:38.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
battleground for LGBTQ rights in
state legislatures
over issues like this?

30:38.303 --> 30:42.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMINIC HOLDEN: After marriage
equality, there's
no question that the primary
interests of

30:42.674 --> 30:48.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the LGBT movement is to pass
nondiscrimination
protections federally.

30:48.947 --> 30:53.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where they're running into
problems is on
the local level with this issue
about bathrooms.

30:53.785 --> 30:59.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's important to note that
in the 200
cities and 17 states with laws
like this already

30:59.624 --> 31:06.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the books, there are no
examples documented
of someone using it for
nefarious purposes,

31:06.465 --> 31:10.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a transgender person who is
this sex predator
in the bathroom.

31:10.435 --> 31:15.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's got no factual foothold. If
anything,
the irony in this is that it
actually would

31:15.607 --> 31:22.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
require -- and North Carolina
now requires
transgender men who have beards,
who are muscular,

31:22.080 --> 31:27.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to use the women's restroom. So
it actually
creates the very problem that it
claims to

31:27.119 --> 31:28.854 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
solve.

31:28.887 --> 31:32.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nonetheless, it's really put
LGBT advocates
in a difficult place because
they haven't

31:32.924 --> 31:36.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
figured out how to respond to
this. And for
the most part, they have not
taken it on directly.

31:36.728 --> 31:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Dominic Holden,
Loretta Boniti,
thanks very much.

31:44.770 --> 31:55.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

31:55.881 --> 32:02.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": why
economists
missed the anger that led to the
rise of Trumpism;

32:02.554 --> 32:08.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and with big banks in the
political spotlight,
we sit down with Barney Frank;
plus, an inventor's

32:08.660 --> 32:13.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
take on death and technology.

32:13.131 --> 32:17.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no question that one of
the key issues
in this election year has been
the frustration

32:17.769 --> 32:24.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of workers over wages, debt and
a sense of
economic stagnation in too many
households.

32:24.142 --> 32:29.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
recently sat down with Robert
Reich to hear

32:29.247 --> 32:31.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a more progressive take on these
issues.

32:32.017 --> 32:37.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, Paul gets a more
conservative view
on how it helps explain the
Trump phenomenon.

32:38.023 --> 32:43.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's part of his weekly
reporting on financial
news, Making Sense, which airs
every Thursday.

32:43.695 --> 32:47.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: The poor are getting
everything for free,
and the rich are getting all the
tax breaks.

32:47.566 --> 32:53.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Marginalized for so
long, economically
anxious voters are now center
stage in the

32:53.405 --> 32:55.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
daily drama of the presidential
campaign.

32:55.740 --> 33:00.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I am currently unemployed.
I think the
middle class, they really don't
really care

33:00.278 --> 33:01.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about as much as they should.

33:01.780 --> 33:05.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I lost my job, so my one
full-time
job is now three part-time jobs.

33:05.851 --> 33:09.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: That's what America
needs. That's what
the people need. They need their
jobs back.

33:09.788 --> 33:12.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: To which Donald
Trump responds
loud and clear.

33:12.924 --> 33:17.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I will be the greatest
jobs-producing president

33:17.395 --> 33:19.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that God ever created.

33:19.197 --> 33:24.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Economics is a key
driver of
the voter anger Charles Murray
calls Trumpism,

33:24.870 --> 33:30.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conservative Charles Murray,
who's been a
lightning rod of controversy
since "The Bell

33:30.041 --> 33:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Curve," his co-authored book of
the 1990s
on genetics and economic
success.

33:35.247 --> 33:37.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is Trumpism?

33:37.182 --> 33:42.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHARLES MURRAY, American
Enterprise Institute:
Trumpism is the expression by
the white working

33:42.254 --> 33:47.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
class of a lot of legitimate
grievances that
it has with the ruling class.

33:47.525 --> 33:52.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everything from the cultural
disdain that
the ruling class holds the
working class in,

33:52.297 --> 33:57.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the loss of all kinds of
manufacturing
jobs, the importation of
low-skilled labor,

33:57.636 --> 34:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the ways in which, if you're
a member
of the working class, you have
over the last

34:02.574 --> 34:04.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
30 or 40 years been screwed.

34:04.342 --> 34:08.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Murray says he
would never vote
for Donald Trump, but he's been
forced to

34:08.880 --> 34:13.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
acknowledge the appeal of, say,
Trump's diatribes
against outsourcing jobs.

34:13.251 --> 34:20.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: The best way to stay
competitive is to
move production from our
facility in Indianapolis

34:20.058 --> 34:22.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Monterrey, Mexico.

34:22.794 --> 34:30.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: This cell phone
video gone viral
from February showed workers, at
an Indianapolis

34:30.735 --> 34:34.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Carrier plant, getting
prospective pink slips.

34:34.739 --> 34:39.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Although it's been widely
reported that Donald
Trump's own products are made
overseas, on

34:39.744 --> 34:42.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the campaign trail, he denounced
Carrier,
and issued a threat.

34:42.447 --> 34:44.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I'm going to call
up Carrier,
and I'm going to tell the head
of Carrier,

34:44.316 --> 34:47.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope you enjoy your stay in
Mexico, folks,
but every single unit that you
make and send

34:47.786 --> 35:00.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across our border, which now
will be real,
you're going to pay a 35 percent
tax.

35:00.665 --> 35:02.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

35:02.367 --> 35:04.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No more Oreos.

35:04.169 --> 35:06.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And there's the
campaign chant
Trump initiated after Oreo maker
Nabisco said

35:06.938 --> 35:09.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it was moving jobs from Chicago
to Mexico.

35:09.574 --> 35:14.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No more Oreos. Oh,
it's going
to be tough getting off Oreos.

35:14.713 --> 35:21.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Another familiar,
yet grave grievance
of Trump supporters, insourcing
of cheap labor

35:21.720 --> 35:27.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
via immigration. The recent
furor over it
has forced Charles Murray to
change his mind.

35:27.559 --> 35:31.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES MURRAY: I have always
believed in
enforcing the border, and doing
that before

35:31.629 --> 35:36.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you do amnesty. I have always
considered myself
to be, you know, very stern on
those issues.

35:36.735 --> 35:41.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I also have not written
about saying,
maybe we shouldn't have so many
low-skilled

35:41.473 --> 35:47.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people coming in anymore, and
because my libertarian
principles are in favor of
immigration and

35:47.145 --> 35:54.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all that. And until the last few
months, it
didn't hit home to me the degree
to which

35:54.452 --> 36:03.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the immigration policy that I,
as one of the
elites, find good is good only
because I don't

36:03.428 --> 36:04.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pay any of the price for it.

36:04.662 --> 36:07.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that's the
great revelation
of Trumpism.

36:07.065 --> 36:13.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES MURRAY: That the ruling
class in this
country is governing in its own
self-interest,

36:13.671 --> 36:19.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and ignoring the legitimate
complaints of
the working class and, for that
matter, of

36:19.844 --> 36:21.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the middle class.

36:21.713 --> 36:27.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: I spent a day with
Murray in
2012, exploring his book on
inequality, "Coming

36:27.118 --> 36:30.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Apart." It featured a "Do you
live in a bubble?"
quiz.

36:30.355 --> 36:34.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES MURRAY: And I got a
really high score,
because, after all, I made up
the quiz. So,

36:34.592 --> 36:36.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm supposedly not in the bubble
at all.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Right.

36:38.630 --> 36:44.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES MURRAY: But I have been
shocked by
the degree of self-recognition
of the ways

36:44.302 --> 36:50.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I, too, am in the bubble,
except it's
been an unpleasant shock, and
it's because

36:50.041 --> 36:51.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the presidential campaign.

36:51.810 --> 36:56.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Though he lives in
a small town
in rural Maryland, by education,
income and

36:56.748 --> 37:01.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
social class, Murray now
realizes he is also
in an elitist bubble.

37:01.853 --> 37:07.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES MURRAY: You now have the
option of
going to live in communities
which are filled

37:07.492 --> 37:12.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with interesting people, people
who do share
your tastes and preferences, who
get your

37:12.464 --> 37:16.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jokes, who know about the
allusions, who,
for that mater, share your
politics. That's

37:16.434 --> 37:17.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happening all the time.

37:17.969 --> 37:20.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: While so many
average Americans
pine for the good old days.

37:20.805 --> 37:26.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Make America great again $5
rally flag
right here. I got one left. Who
wants it?

37:26.311 --> 37:32.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But popular TV, a
product of
those in the upper echelons,
makes fun of

37:32.851 --> 37:34.652 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those below.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTRESS: The plant called and
said, if you
don't come in tomorrow, don't
bother coming

37:36.654 --> 37:37.355 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Monday.

37:37.388 --> 37:39.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTOR: Woo-hoo! Four-day
weekend.

37:39.190 --> 37:44.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES MURRAY: There is one
group that is
more consistently portrayed as
ineffectual,

37:45.029 --> 37:51.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as unvirtuous, as incompetent,
as objects
of fun, and that is white
working class guys.

37:51.369 --> 37:54.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: Evel Knievel gloves. I
bet I could
do a wheelie with these. How
much for the

37:55.006 --> 37:55.673 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gloves?

37:55.707 --> 37:57.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTOR: Peter, those are yours.

37:57.475 --> 38:03.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: Ten bucks, two, seven,
four, 5.50,
10. Sold. Sucker, I would have
gone to 15

38:03.114 --> 38:05.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
easy. I am so stupid.

38:05.049 --> 38:11.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: How much of the
anxiety and resentment
of the working middle class is
due, do you

38:11.289 --> 38:19.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think, to the attitude of the
elites in this
country with respect to those
working middle-class

38:19.898 --> 38:21.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people?

38:21.666 --> 38:26.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES MURRAY: A big chunk. You
don't think
that they don't notice when we
talk about

38:26.504 --> 38:32.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flyover country? Try to think of
any kind
of ethnic slur that you can get
away with

38:32.377 --> 38:35.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at a dinner party you attend
without getting
immediate pushback.

38:35.747 --> 38:38.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Oh, you would get
kicked out
of the room.

38:38.616 --> 38:41.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES MURRAY: I will give you
one. I will
give you an ethnic slur where
you won't. Try

38:41.186 --> 38:45.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it out at your next dinner
party. Refer to
rednecks.

38:45.123 --> 38:49.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Talk to a friend of mine who
bought a weekend
place in West Virginia, and have
him tell

38:49.661 --> 38:57.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you what his Georgetown
neighbors said without
the slightest sense of shame
about their expectations

38:57.368 --> 39:02.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of what his neighbors would be
like, that
they would be dumb, illiterate,
have missing

39:02.874 --> 39:04.809 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
teeth.

39:04.842 --> 39:07.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It's not as if
Trump supporters
like John Lehanka haven't
noticed the condescension.

39:07.679 --> 39:12.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN LEHANKA, Trump Supporter:
We're not stupid.
We're not clowns. We're not
zombies. We know

39:12.884 --> 39:14.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what we want. We want America to
be great
again.

39:14.919 --> 39:21.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: As any number of
recent plays
illustrate, many artists have
deep sympathy

39:21.259 --> 39:23.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the economically
subordinated.

39:23.061 --> 39:27.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: They squeeze us like a
sponge. They
drain out every last drop of
blood, and then

39:27.932 --> 39:29.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they throw us away.

39:29.701 --> 39:34.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Though, arguably,
the artists
are members of the elite
themselves, not to

39:34.038 --> 39:35.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mention their audiences.

39:35.873 --> 39:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: I thought I would be
settled by my
age, but, man, it never ends.
Mortgage, car

39:41.946 --> 39:44.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
payments, Internet. Our
dishwasher just gave
out.

39:44.682 --> 39:46.017 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ACTOR: Oh, man.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: Yes. Yes. Don't you think
it should
cost less to be alive?

39:48.820 --> 39:54.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And yet, says
Murray, even the
most aware among the socially
elite have done

39:54.225 --> 39:58.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
little to cut the widening
distance between
them and more typical Americans.

39:58.830 --> 40:02.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES MURRAY: There is a sense
that the
people who run the country are a
separate

40:02.900 --> 40:08.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group of people who don't like
them, who don't
understand them, and who have
been punishing

40:08.373 --> 40:10.141 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

40:10.174 --> 40:12.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Donald Trump's
sales pitch, of
course, is that he does
understand them, and

40:12.477 --> 40:13.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will protect them.

40:13.978 --> 40:16.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to
build a wall,
folks. Don't worry about it.

40:16.981 --> 40:23.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," this
is economics correspondent Paul
Solman.

40:23.454 --> 40:27.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Who is going to
pay for the
wall?

40:27.659 --> 40:28.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AUDIENCE: Mexico!

40:28.459 --> 40:29.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Who?

40:29.727 --> 40:31.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

JUDY WOODRUFF: And on our Web
site, you can
take Charles Murray's bubble
quiz to see if

40:35.566 --> 40:45.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you live in a social and
cultural bubble.
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

40:45.610 --> 40:52.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you live in a social and

That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

40:52.650 --> 40:58.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now our conversation series on
another economic
issue that's been a major theme
on the campaign

40:58.122 --> 41:04.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trail this year: Are some banks
still too
big to fail, and do they pose a
risk to the

41:04.829 --> 41:05.697 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country?

41:05.730 --> 41:07.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our latest
interview.

41:07.532 --> 41:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In our first
conversation,
we talked with Neel Kashkari,
president of

41:11.369 --> 41:16.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Federal Reserve Bank in
Minneapolis. As
a Treasury official during the
financial crisis,

41:16.374 --> 41:20.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he helped oversee the bailout of
the banks.
He now argues that the system
remains in danger

41:20.978 --> 41:24.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that giant financial firms
should be broken
up.

41:24.282 --> 41:27.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a view being heard on the
campaign
trail from Senator Bernie
Sanders.

41:27.985 --> 41:31.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his interview with Judy
yesterday, here's
how he described the problem and
his plan

41:31.956 --> 41:33.891 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for it.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
It will be important to point
out that three

41:35.760 --> 41:41.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of the four largest banks in
this country
today are bigger than they were
when we bailed

41:41.332 --> 41:45.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them out because they were too
big to fail,
that you have the six largest
banks in this

41:45.636 --> 41:50.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country that have assets of 58
percent of
our GDP.

41:50.174 --> 41:55.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I happen the believe that when
you have a
few financial institutions with
unbelievable

41:55.313 --> 42:01.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
economic power, with
unbelievable financial
power, that what we should do is
reestablish

42:01.285 --> 42:06.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a modern Glass-Steagall
legislation, and what
we should do, in fact, is break
them up, not

42:06.424 --> 42:12.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only from a risk perspective of
not seeing
their greed and illegal behavior
destroy our

42:12.397 --> 42:18.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economy, as happened eight years
ago, but
also from creating a competitive
financial

42:18.903 --> 42:23.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
system, where we don't have so
few financial
institutions with so much power.

42:23.307 --> 42:26.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And we get a
response now from
one of the leading players in
the aftermath

42:26.811 --> 42:28.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the financial crisis.

42:28.746 --> 42:33.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Barney Frank served as a
Democratic congressman
from Massachusetts from 1981
until his retirement

42:33.484 --> 42:38.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2013. As chairman of the
House Financial
Services Committee, he played a
lead role

42:38.256 --> 42:42.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in crafting the Dodd-Frank law,
which enacted
the most sweeping changes to
U.S. financial

42:42.894 --> 42:45.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
regulation since the Great
Depression.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome back to you.

42:47.398 --> 42:50.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The starting point of the
critique we have
heard is that the banks are
bigger than ever,

42:50.935 --> 42:54.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the potential for another
bailout remains
strong. Dodd-Frank was a start,
but didn't

42:54.972 --> 42:56.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
go nearly far enough.

42:56.707 --> 42:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you see a different picture?

42:58.142 --> 43:00.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BARNEY FRANK (D), Former
Massachusetts Congressman:
Oh, very much so.

43:00.144 --> 43:06.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the first place, both Senator
Sanders and
Mr. Kashkari continue to evade
the biggest

43:06.884 --> 43:14.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
question. That is, how big is
too big? The
crisis which touched off when
Lehman Brothers

43:14.158 --> 43:20.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
couldn't make its payment,
Lehman Brothers
was about $650 billion in
assets. We have

43:20.998 --> 43:24.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
banks four and five times that
size

43:24.569 --> 43:28.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the question is, does
everybody have to
be smaller than Lehman Brothers
is today?

43:28.739 --> 43:33.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But that would have
consequences. Getting
there would be a problem. By the
way, it should

43:33.211 --> 43:37.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be very clear, Glass-Steagall
doesn't do it.
There is a disconnect between
Senator Sanders

43:37.648 --> 43:42.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insisting that the banks be
broken down to
the point where they won't by
their own size

43:42.520 --> 43:47.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threaten, if they have too much
debt, to undermine
it.

43:47.258 --> 43:52.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Glass-Steagall --
Glass-Steagall would
reduce -- it wouldn't do
anything to Goldman

43:52.897 --> 43:59.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sachs and to Morgan Stanley,
which are almost
Glass-Steagall-ized themselves.
But looked

43:59.704 --> 44:05.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Citicorp, or J.P. Morgan
Chase, or Bank
of America, Wells Fargo, even if
they were

44:05.743 --> 44:09.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
subject to Glass-Steagall, they
would still
be well beyond the size that
Lehman Brothers

44:09.914 --> 44:11.649 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
was.

44:11.682 --> 44:15.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is just a disconnect
between saying
we're going to do Glass-Steagall
and getting

44:15.653 --> 44:20.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the banks down to a size where,
if there was
a complete failure, you would
get damaged

44:20.758 --> 44:22.560 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by it.

44:22.593 --> 44:24.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But let me ask
you about the
too big -- the size question,
because when

44:24.395 --> 44:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I talked to Neel Kashkari, for
example, he
cited the example of the S&amp;L
crisis, where

44:29.367 --> 44:34.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you had maybe 1,000 institutions
go under,
but the system wasn't at risk.

44:34.138 --> 44:36.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, why not -- are you saying
that size...

44:36.574 --> 44:37.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARNEY FRANK: Excuse me. Did
you...

44:37.742 --> 44:38.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:38.309 --> 44:40.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Go ahead.

44:40.077 --> 44:43.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARNEY FRANK: I'm saying size is
a factor,
but did you ask Mr. Kashkari how
big was too

44:43.548 --> 44:45.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
big? That's a major factor.

44:45.483 --> 44:54.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By the way, it cost us more --
the S&amp;L crisis
cost the taxpayers more than the
TARP did

44:54.959 --> 44:58.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2008. So, I don't know why he
would cite
that. In fact, the failure of a
very large

44:58.963 --> 45:03.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number of smaller institutions
turned out
to be much more expensive to the
taxpayers.

45:03.200 --> 45:09.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, as far as the bailout
of 2008 was
concerned, we made money on that
in the money

45:09.307 --> 45:11.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that was extended to financial
institutions.

45:11.876 --> 45:16.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by the way, it wasn't just
to big ones
then. It was to small ones as
well. The only

45:16.347 --> 45:19.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
institutions that weren't able
to pay us back
were the auto companies. And I
don't think

45:19.150 --> 45:21.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- I thought it was a good idea
to pay them.

45:21.886 --> 45:26.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As to size, the question is not
just to the
size, but what would happen if
they couldn't

45:26.824 --> 45:31.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pay their debts. And that's what
people ignore.
We did two things in the
legislation to deal

45:31.062 --> 45:36.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with that. First of all, we made
it much,
much less likely that they would
get so indebted

45:36.734 --> 45:38.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they couldn't pay them
back.

45:38.569 --> 45:43.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not their overall size.
It's the indebtedness
that's the threat. You could not
now have

45:44.008 --> 45:50.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an AIG, which got itself $170
billion beyond
what it could pay off in
derivatives, because

45:50.081 --> 45:54.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we do not allow institutions
under the law
now to get so indebted without
the capital

45:54.585 --> 45:56.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to back it up.

45:56.354 --> 45:59.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secondly and most importantly,
what we said
is this: If a large institution
can't pay

45:59.557 --> 46:05.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its debts, it fails. It is not
too big to
fail. It is put out of business,
by law. No

46:05.496 --> 46:11.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal official can advance any
money to
pay its debts under the law
until it is dissolved.

46:11.535 --> 46:16.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What then happens is this: It
may be that
we would have to borrow from the
taxpayers

46:16.107 --> 46:20.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pay some of the debts, not
all, as the
previous law required, but if we
have to pay

46:20.378 --> 46:25.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of the debts to prevent the
failure of
a large institution from having
serious economic

46:26.017 --> 46:31.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consequences, the treasury
secretary is mandated
by law to recover every penny
from large -- other

46:31.656 --> 46:33.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
large financial institutions.

46:33.557 --> 46:39.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, it's not the size of
the institution,
but the size of the unpaid
indebtedness. Well,

46:39.130 --> 46:43.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have dealt with that by
reducing the indebtedness
and requiring that the
institution will be

46:43.434 --> 46:45.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dissolved if it fails.

46:45.269 --> 46:48.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What about the
argument from
Senator Sanders, we just heard
it -- and I

46:48.673 --> 46:52.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think we should say you're a
supporter of
Hillary Clinton in the
Democratic presidential

46:52.977 --> 46:57.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race -- but what about the
argument from Senator
Sanders on the political issue,
the political

46:57.481 --> 47:04.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
power of banks who have, as he
said -- he
said six of them have assets
totaling 50 percent

47:04.121 --> 47:05.756 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the U.S. GDP.

47:05.790 --> 47:07.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that a problem for our
democracy?

47:07.692 --> 47:12.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARNEY FRANK: No, I don't think
-- the problem
for our democracy is the one
that both Senator

47:12.897 --> 47:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanders and Hillary Clinton
would fix, unlike
the Republicans.

47:15.933 --> 47:20.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That would be to appoint a
Supreme Court justice
who would overturn the Citizens
United decision,

47:20.604 --> 47:26.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which allows money to go in
uninhibited. I
will tell you this. In the
legislation in

47:26.210 --> 47:29.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2008 -- and people who study
this understand
it -- it was the community banks
that had

47:29.914 --> 47:33.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more power than the big banks.
We did several
things in that bill that favored
the small

47:34.018 --> 47:36.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
banks other over the bigger
banks.

47:36.854 --> 47:43.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a threat, if they are
so indebted,
that their debts don't get paid
and they solve

47:43.427 --> 47:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- they cause an economic
crisis. That's the
one I believe we have addressed.
By the way,

47:48.599 --> 47:53.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
once again, with Glass-Steagall
-- and I would
ask you, did you ask either
Senator Sanders

47:53.204 --> 47:55.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or Mr. Kashkari how big was too
big?

47:55.406 --> 48:00.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How can someone claim to be
responsibly advocating
reducing the size of the
institution without

48:00.978 --> 48:04.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ever telling you what size they
have to be
reduced? That's a fundamental
question.

48:04.548 --> 48:05.516 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

48:05.549 --> 48:06.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, I can just
tell you that...

48:06.250 --> 48:08.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARNEY FRANK: I think -- yes.

48:08.085 --> 48:10.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I will just tell
you that Mr.
Kashkari said he was going the
study it this

48:10.054 --> 48:11.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
year. So that's -- I did ask.

48:11.822 --> 48:14.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARNEY FRANK: Oh. In other
words, he came
out -- that's pretty
irresponsible. I think,

48:14.358 --> 48:18.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frankly, Mr. Kashkari is acting
still more
like the candidate for governor
he was in

48:18.095 --> 48:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
California than a Federal
Reserve official.

48:22.466 --> 48:28.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the answer is that
it might be
too small for them to want to
stand behind

48:28.606 --> 48:31.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that. But I want to get back to
the political
point.

48:31.142 --> 48:36.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Glass-Steagall, which is Senator
Sanders'
only remedy, doesn't resolve
that problem.

48:36.781 --> 48:40.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
People should understand
Glass-Steagall doesn't
break them into three and four
and five pieces.

48:40.918 --> 48:47.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Glass-Steagall says to Citicorp
and Bank of
America and J.P. Morgan Chase,
you cannot

48:47.391 --> 48:51.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a securities division, as
well as a commercial
bank decision.

48:51.462 --> 48:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the Volcker rule already
reduces their
securities decision. But if you
applied Glass-Steagall

48:56.367 --> 49:02.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to those institutions, you
wouldn't significantly
diminish their size, certainly
not below the

49:02.139 --> 49:04.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
level that Lehman Brothers was
in 2008.

49:04.842 --> 49:07.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

49:07.178 --> 49:13.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Barney Frank, thank you so much.

49:13.184 --> 49:26.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to
another in our Brief
But Spectacular series.

49:26.564 --> 49:33.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from inventor
and futurist
Ray Kurzweil about immortality
and the exponential

49:33.270 --> 49:38.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growth of technology. Since
2012, Kurzweil
has been a director of
engineering at Google.

49:38.709 --> 49:42.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAY KURZWEIL, Director of
Engineering, Google:
Our immediate reaction to death
is that it's

49:42.046 --> 49:44.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a tragedy. And that's really the
correct reaction.

49:44.515 --> 49:49.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have rationalized it, saying,
oh, that
tragic thing that's looming,
that's actually

49:49.653 --> 49:55.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a good thing. But now we can
actually seriously
talk about a scenario where we
will be able

49:55.159 --> 50:05.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to extend our longevity
indefinitely.

50:05.302 --> 50:09.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I decided to become an inventor
when I was
5. I would bring back broken
bicycles, radios.

50:09.840 --> 50:14.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was an era where you would
allow a 5-year-old
to roam the neighborhood and do
this. And

50:14.879 --> 50:18.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had this idea, if I could just
figure out
how to put all these things
together, I could

50:18.816 --> 50:20.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
solve any problem.

50:20.584 --> 50:26.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wrote a program that could
recognize the
patterns in melodies from famous
composers

50:26.090 --> 50:31.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and write original music. So I
went on this
show "I've Got a Secret" hosted
by Steve Allen.

50:31.362 --> 50:33.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My name is Raymond Kurzweil, and
I'm from
Queens, New York.

50:33.264 --> 50:35.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVE ALLEN, Host: Queens, New.

50:35.199 --> 50:39.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAYMOND KURZWEIL: And my secret
was, I had
built and programmed a computer
that composed

50:39.436 --> 50:41.272 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
music.

50:41.305 --> 50:44.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I created a program that could
recognize printed
letters in any type and created
a reading

50:44.642 --> 50:46.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
machine for the blind.

50:46.377 --> 50:50.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Probably, the most important
theme I have
talked about is the exponential
growth of

50:50.614 --> 50:56.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information technology. Price,
performance,
and capacity of information
technology progresses

50:56.320 --> 51:00.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
predictably and exponentially.
It doubles
every period of time.

51:00.424 --> 51:04.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this little computer is
actually billions
of times more powerful per
dollar than the

51:04.762 --> 51:07.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
computer I used when I was an
undergraduate.
We will do that again in the
next 25 years.

51:08.032 --> 51:12.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will have computers the
size of blood
cells, little robotic devices
that can go

51:12.937 --> 51:18.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through our bloodstream, its
capability thousands
or millions-fold by connecting
to the cloud.

51:18.208 --> 51:19.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a 2030s scenario.

51:20.010 --> 51:25.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been expanding our life
expectancy
for thousands of years. It was
19 1,000 years

51:25.049 --> 51:31.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago, 37 in 1800. We're going to
get to a point
10, 15 years from now where
we're adding more

51:31.188 --> 51:35.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time than is going by to our
remaining life
expectancy.

51:35.559 --> 51:39.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People say, oh, I don't want to
live past
90, but, you know, I talk to
90-year-olds,

51:39.563 --> 51:44.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they definitely want to live
to 91 and
to 100. People sometimes say
that death gives

51:44.435 --> 51:48.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meaning to life because it makes
time short,
but, actually, death is a great
robber of

51:48.973 --> 51:51.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
meaning, of relationships, of
knowledge.

51:51.141 --> 51:55.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to be able to
overcome disease
and aging. Most of our thinking
will be nonbiological.

51:55.579 --> 52:01.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That will be backed up, so part
of it gets
wipes away, you can recreate it.
And we will

52:01.218 --> 52:06.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be able to extend our lives
indefinitely.
I would rather use that word
than forever.

52:06.290 --> 52:12.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Ray Kurzweil, and
this is my Brief
But Spectacular take on our
exponential future.

On the "NewsHour" online, in our
weekly Medicare
column, a reader wants to know
why she was

52:27.378 --> 52:33.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charged an exorbitant fee for
medication she
received in a hospital.
Journalist Philip

52:33.250 --> 52:38.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moeller writes that Medicare
drug coverage
can be very confusing, with
several different

52:38.989 --> 52:44.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parts. He explains them each
