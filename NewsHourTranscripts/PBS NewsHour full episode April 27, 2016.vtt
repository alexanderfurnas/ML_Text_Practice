00:05.072 --> 00:06.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.039 --> 00:07.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:07.875 --> 00:10.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the
"NewsHour"s tonight:
Front-runners Donald Trump and
Hillary Clinton

00:10.777 --> 00:17.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
win big in yesterday's
delegate-rich primaries,
pushing the two closer to their
party's nomination

00:17.084 --> 00:20.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- what this means for the rest
of the candidates
in the race.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Wednesday:

00:22.222 --> 00:26.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We will always save lives, and
indeed humanity

00:26.693 --> 00:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
itself. But to play that role,
we must make
America strong again.

00:32.933 --> 00:36.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In an
issue-focused moment
of Donald Trump's campaign, the
self-presumed

00:36.937 --> 00:42.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eventual nominee makes a crucial
foreign policy
speech, outlining his views on
the United

00:42.242 --> 00:44.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
States' role in the world.

00:44.044 --> 00:49.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a writer
follows the case
of a grisly rape and murder to
find out if

00:49.182 --> 00:50.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it could have been avoided.

00:51.018 --> 00:56.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELI SANDERS, Author, "While the
City Slept":
You can see how relatively
little potentially

00:56.957 --> 01:04.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it might have cost to steer him
or forcefully
nudge him in a different
direction much earlier

01:04.064 --> 01:05.399 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

01:05.432 --> 01:11.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:11.905 --> 01:14.708 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:14.741 --> 01:24.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today brought a
sizable shift
in the presidential race. The
Republican front-runner

01:25.018 --> 01:30.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turned his attention from his
rivals to his
world view. But one of those
rivals rolled

01:30.490 --> 01:32.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out a running mate.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang reports on this
campaign day.

01:34.227 --> 01:37.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
It's time to shake the rust off
America's

01:37.431 --> 01:43.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foreign policy. It's time to
invite new voices
and new visions into the fold.

01:43.804 --> 01:48.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Donald Trump, fresh
from a decisive
sweep of Tuesday's primaries,
delivered his

01:48.575 --> 01:51.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first major speech on foreign
policy.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Carly Fiorina!

01:53.880 --> 01:58.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ted Cruz answered
with a headline
of his own, naming former rival
Carly Fiorina

01:58.418 --> 02:00.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as his running mate.

02:00.287 --> 02:06.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: This ticket is
about the future.
It is about our children. It is
about our

02:06.560 --> 02:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grandchildren. The stakes of
this election,
we are not simply wagering on a
sporting contest.

02:12.499 --> 02:15.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CARLY FIORINA (R), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
This is a fight worth having.
This is a fight

02:15.602 --> 02:20.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worth winning. And with your
help, we will
win this fight!

02:20.173 --> 02:25.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Cruz is banking on
next week's
Indiana primary to give him new
life. Trump

02:25.912 --> 02:31.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now has more than three-quarters
of the delegates
he needs for a first-ballot
victory. Last

02:31.752 --> 02:36.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night, he declared himself the
presumptive
nominee, and took aim at the
Democrats' likely

02:36.623 --> 02:38.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
standard-bearer, Hillary
Clinton.

02:38.525 --> 02:42.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think the
only card
she has is the woman's card. She
has nothing

02:42.129 --> 02:46.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
else going for her. And,
frankly, if Hillary
Clinton were a man, I don't
think she would

02:46.900 --> 02:48.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get 5 percent of the vote.

02:48.635 --> 02:54.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clinton answered the
jibe after
winning four states, putting her
90 percent

02:54.174 --> 02:56.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the way to clinching the
nomination.

02:56.109 --> 02:59.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Well, if fighting for women's
health care

02:59.079 --> 03:06.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and paid family leave and equal
pay is playing
the woman card, then deal me in!

03:06.453 --> 03:08.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:08.188 --> 03:13.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But Bernie Sanders is
not ready
to throw in his hand. The
Vermont senator

03:13.226 --> 03:15.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spoke today in West Lafayette,
Indiana.

03:15.195 --> 03:23.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
We are in this campaign to win
and to become

03:23.403 --> 03:23.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Democratic nominee.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:25.772 --> 03:27.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: At the same time,
Sanders told
The New York Times he plans to
lay off hundreds

03:27.541 --> 03:31.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of campaign workers and focus on
winning California.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:34.014 --> 03:38.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will examine
the race, and
hear more of Donald Trump's
foreign policy

03:38.051 --> 03:39.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
speech, after the news summary.

03:40.020 --> 03:44.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
The U.S. Supreme Court lent a
seemingly sympathetic

03:44.157 --> 03:48.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ear to former Virginia Governor
Bob McDonnell.
He faces two years in prison for
accepting

03:48.562 --> 03:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thousands of dollars in gifts
and loans from
a businessman. But in today's
arguments, both

03:53.066 --> 03:58.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
liberal and conservative
justices suggested
the federal bribery law is
overbroad. A decision

03:58.238 --> 04:00.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
could come in June.

04:00.040 --> 04:04.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former House
Speaker Dennis
Hastert was sentenced today to
15 months in

04:04.211 --> 04:10.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal prison for paying hush
money to cover
up sexual abuse. The Illinois
Republican admitted

04:10.417 --> 04:15.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he abused at least one
teenager as a
wrestling coach in high school.
He told a

04:15.455 --> 04:19.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
federal court in Chicago: "What
I did was
wrong and I regret it."

04:19.993 --> 04:24.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will hear about Hastert's day
in court
later in the program.

04:24.131 --> 04:30.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The fight over
federal funding
to control the Zika virus will
likely go unresolved

04:31.004 --> 04:36.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before next week's congressional
recess. The
White House asked for $1.9
billion back in

04:36.843 --> 04:42.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
February. But House Speaker Paul
Ryan suggested
today that may be more than
necessary.

04:42.315 --> 04:45.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
The administration has a bit of
a track record

04:45.685 --> 04:50.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of over-requesting what they
need. So we will
sit down with the appropriators
to figure

04:50.090 --> 04:53.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out the best way forward, to
make sure that
we're good stewards of the
taxpayers' money

04:53.693 --> 04:57.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to make sure that we have
what we need
to combat and stay ahead of the
Zika virus

04:57.297 --> 04:59.032 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

04:59.065 --> 05:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At the White
House, Press
Secretary Josh Earnest fired
back, saying

05:00.901 --> 05:02.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the delay is putting the country
at risk.

05:02.769 --> 05:06.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
You had the director of the
National Institutes

05:06.373 --> 05:11.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Health and a high-ranking
official from
the Centers for Disease Control
stand at this

05:11.411 --> 05:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
podium about three weeks ago and
say they
didn't have the resources that
they needed

05:16.850 --> 05:22.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that should be used to fully
prepare for the
onset of the Zika virus.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Zika has been
linked to
a rare birth defect, and is
spreading rapidly

05:25.392 --> 05:27.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through the Americas.

05:27.127 --> 05:31.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For a second day,
a severe
weather system menaced a large
swathe of the

05:31.131 --> 05:35.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nation. The threat of tornadoes
waned, but
Kansas City suffered significant
flooding

05:35.936 --> 05:41.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
early today. And winds of 60
miles an hour
tore through the greater Houston
area, blowing

05:41.508 --> 05:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trees onto houses. So far, one
death is blamed
on the storms.

05:46.146 --> 05:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the Middle
East, Israeli
security forces killed a
Palestinian woman

05:50.150 --> 05:55.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and her teenage brother, the
latest in a wave
of violent incidents. It
happened at a security

05:55.322 --> 05:59.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
checkpoint between the West Bank
and Jerusalem.
Police said they fired after the
woman pulled

06:00.026 --> 06:04.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a knife on an officer. They said
they found
knives on the boy's body as
well.

06:04.598 --> 06:09.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The only
surviving suspect
in November's terrorist attacks
in Paris was

06:09.603 --> 06:15.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
extradited to France today.
Salah Abdeslam
is the alleged logistical
planner of the assault

06:16.009 --> 06:21.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that left 130 people dead. He
was taken to
a Paris court after an
early-morning transfer

06:21.982 --> 06:25.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Brussels, and his lawyer
said he plans
to cooperate.

06:25.819 --> 06:29.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANK BERTON, Attorney for Salah
Abdeslam
(through translator): He gave a
spontaneous

06:29.356 --> 06:33.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
statement to the investigating
judge, and
he insisted he would explain
himself later.

06:33.660 --> 06:37.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The judge put him under formal
investigation
on charges of murder, complicity
of murder

06:37.931 --> 06:42.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a terrorist organization,
holding weapons
and explosives, and kidnapping.

06:42.702 --> 06:46.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Abdeslam was
captured in Brussels
last month.

06:46.673 --> 06:50.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country, it's
being called the biggest gang
crackdown ever

06:50.277 --> 06:55.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New York City. In pre-dawn
raids, federal
agents and police arrested
scores of suspects.

06:55.515 --> 07:01.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said two rival gangs have
terrorized
housing projects in the Bronx.
In all, 120

07:01.721 --> 07:03.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people are being charged.

07:03.456 --> 07:07.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The latest
nation's report
card shows high school seniors
are losing

07:07.460 --> 07:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ground. The U.S. Department of
Education reports
that average math scores dropped
last year

07:13.199 --> 07:19.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for the first time since
assessments began
in 1992. Reading scores were
flat, but they

07:19.439 --> 07:25.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have dropped five points since
1992. As a
result, only 37 percent of all
seniors were

07:25.545 --> 07:28.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
judged college-ready in math and
reading.

07:28.114 --> 07:31.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Federal
Reserve today
left short-term interest rates
unchanged for

07:32.018 --> 07:36.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
now. In a statement,
policy-makers said there's
been solid job growth, but
economic activity

07:36.723 --> 07:41.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appears to be slowing. As a
result, the Fed
decided to hold off on a further
hike until

07:41.628 --> 07:43.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
June at the earliest.

07:43.496 --> 07:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street took
the Fed's
news in stride. The Dow Jones
industrial average

07:47.434 --> 07:56.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gained 51 points to close at
18041. The Nasdaq
fell 25 points, as Apple slumped
6 percent,

07:56.609 --> 07:58.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the S&amp;P 500 added three.

07:58.878 --> 08:03.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
is it game over for Ted Cruz and
John Kasich?;

08:03.750 --> 08:09.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump calls for a hard
line on negotiations
abroad; former House Speaker
Dennis Hastert

08:09.322 --> 08:23.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sentenced in a hush money
scandal; and much
more.

08:23.570 --> 08:28.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To dig into last
night's election
results and discuss the race's
dramatic shift

08:28.074 --> 08:33.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going into the last leg of the
primary contest,
we are joined once again by
Susan Page of

08:33.813 --> 08:37.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
USA Today and Reid Wilson of the
Morning Consult.

08:37.984 --> 08:39.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome back to both of you.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Big night last night.

08:41.488 --> 08:45.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reid, how did the results last
night change
the trajectory of this race? And
let's start

08:45.558 --> 08:47.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the Republicans.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON, Morning Consult: On
the Republican
side, Donald Trump swept just
about everything

08:49.329 --> 08:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he possibly could have. The only
place where
John Kasich or Ted Cruz picked
up any delegates

08:53.967 --> 08:57.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who will be pledged to them at
the convention
was in Rhode Island. And there
was just a

08:57.804 --> 08:59.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
small handful of delegates.

08:59.672 --> 09:05.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More dramatically, I think,
there were some
reports that suggest that about
39 of the

09:05.278 --> 09:09.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unpledged delegates that came
out of Pennsylvania
are going to back Donald Trump
on the first

09:09.315 --> 09:15.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ballot. That puts him a lot
closer to a glide
path towards the nomination than
he was just

09:15.789 --> 09:19.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a few days ago, even after his
big wins earlier
this month.

09:19.092 --> 09:24.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem for Trump, though,
is that coming
up in May, he's still about 250
delegates

09:24.164 --> 09:29.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
short of the number he needs.
But in the five
contests in May, there are only
199 delegates

09:29.469 --> 09:33.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
available. So if Ted Cruz and
John Kasich
want to stick around, they sure
can, least

09:33.706 --> 09:35.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
until June.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Susan, where
does this
leave Ted Cruz and John Kasich?

09:37.777 --> 09:40.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
Well, I think that leaves them
in a predicament,

09:40.713 --> 09:45.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because Donald Trump is now --
he called himself
last not the presumptive
nominee. Now, maybe

09:45.552 --> 09:48.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're just a step short of that,
but he is
certainly now the likely
nominee.

09:48.488 --> 09:52.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is now likely to be able to
get a majority
of convention delegates on that
first ballot

09:53.026 --> 09:58.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or come so close, it is
impossible politically
to deny him the nomination. And
you saw him

09:58.097 --> 10:01.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reflect that today by giving a
big speech
on foreign policy that we had
never heard

10:01.634 --> 10:03.403 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You also saw Ted Cruz trying to
get back in
the story by doing something
that seemed a

10:06.372 --> 10:09.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
little premature, which was
announcing his
vice presidential pick.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's still April.

10:11.644 --> 10:17.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what about that, Reid? I
mean, normally,
the nominee of the party waits
until either

10:17.584 --> 10:21.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the convention or right before
the convention.
Ted Cruz is clearly trying to
get some headlines.

10:21.921 --> 10:25.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: And it looks like
this may have
been a little bit rushed.
Remember, it was

10:25.425 --> 10:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just a few days ago when the
Cruz campaign
leaked that they were vetting
Carly Fiorina.

10:29.863 --> 10:34.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The vice presidential vetting
process takes
weeks and weeks to go through
tax records

10:34.534 --> 10:38.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and check and parse interviews
for controversial
statements.

10:38.905 --> 10:44.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this clearly is Ted Cruz
trying to change
the conversation from Donald
Trump being the

10:44.143 --> 10:48.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presumptive nominee to some kind
of two-person
race. I'm not sure how
successful he was.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: You know, the one
thing it did
do, we're now talking about his
vice presidential

10:50.984 --> 10:54.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pick and whether it makes sense
and what will
she do, rather than talking
about the fact

10:54.420 --> 10:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, as of last night, he
doesn't have a
mathematical way to be nominated
on the first

10:58.525 --> 11:00.360 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ballot.

11:00.393 --> 11:03.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's now mathematically -- it's
now mathematically
impossible for him to go to the
convention

11:03.830 --> 11:05.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with a majority of delegates.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: His hope, you're
saying, is
if there's a contested
convention.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But does the pick of Carly
Fiorina help him
in any way, Susan?

11:10.737 --> 11:14.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: She doesn't have any
delegates.
Maybe it helps her -- if you're
trying to

11:14.307 --> 11:18.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look at where she might help, it
helps him
maybe with today's news cycle.
It may help

11:18.845 --> 11:20.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
him a bit in California.

11:20.647 --> 11:27.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You remember in 2010 she ran for
the Senate
in California. That's that big
final primary.

11:27.086 --> 11:29.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this feels, I think, just a
little desperate.

11:29.155 --> 11:33.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: I think one way in
which Carly
Fiorina will help is that she
has been one

11:33.226 --> 11:37.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the more effective surrogates
to attack
Donald Trump. When she took him
on head to

11:37.363 --> 11:42.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
head earlier in this campaign
process, you
remember Rick Perry attacked him
and then

11:42.235 --> 11:45.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dropped out. And Bobby Jindal
attacked him
and then dropped out.

11:45.271 --> 11:49.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carly Fiorina was the only
candidate to attack
Donald Trump and then she got
boosted to the

11:49.442 --> 11:55.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
main stage in that second
debate. So, I think
that as somebody who can draw a
contrast with

11:55.114 --> 11:56.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump, that's where she
helps Cruz.

11:56.950 --> 12:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She also had some
tough words
to say about Ted Cruz earlier in
the campaign,

12:00.587 --> 12:02.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which we were hearing again.

12:02.455 --> 12:05.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But just quickly, Susan, you
brought up Donald
Trump's speech today on foreign
policy. Are

12:05.892 --> 12:11.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we learning something different
from this,
as you say, first major speech
on the subject?

12:11.097 --> 12:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: The speech was more
prepared than
the previous comments he's made
on foreign

12:14.968 --> 12:19.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy. He actually had a
script. He read
it off a teleprompter. He does
that only rarely.

12:19.205 --> 12:23.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But it was pretty much
consistent with what
he has said about foreign policy
issues in

12:23.176 --> 12:27.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the past, and, in that way, at
odds with a
lot of traditional American
foreign policy,

12:27.947 --> 12:29.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
especially in the Republican
Party.

12:29.983 --> 12:36.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it was a natural
thing for him
to do as he prepares to run in a
general election

12:36.289 --> 12:38.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against Hillary Clinton.

12:38.191 --> 12:42.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's move over
to the Democrats,
Reid. Hillary Clinton won four
of the five

12:42.128 --> 12:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states last night. Bernie
Sanders picks up
Rhode Island. Where does this
race stand?

12:47.533 --> 12:52.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We learned today that Bernie
Sanders is -- and
we heard that in John Yang's
report -- is

12:52.305 --> 12:56.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
telling some of his staffers
they can't -- they
won't be staying on the payroll
any longer.

12:56.909 --> 12:58.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where does he go from here?

12:58.711 --> 13:02.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: So, like the
Republican side,
Hillary Clinton is as close to
the Democratic

13:02.348 --> 13:05.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nomination as Donald Trump is.
Actually, she's
a little closer.

13:05.284 --> 13:10.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's about 200 delegates shy.
But there are
only about 226 delegates that
are going to

13:10.356 --> 13:15.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be awarded in May. So, if Bernie
Sanders does
want to stick around, he can,
and essentially

13:15.194 --> 13:22.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wait until the very last several
days of the
race before Hillary Clinton
reaches that 2,383

13:22.168 --> 13:24.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
delegates she needs.

13:24.037 --> 13:27.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Sanders' problem is that,
while he's raised
a lot of money, he's spent a lot
of money,

13:27.573 --> 13:32.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
too. He spent $46 million last
month. And
though he raised more than $40
million, he

13:32.178 --> 13:36.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is still bleeding some money. I
think that's
what the staff departures are
all about, trying

13:36.549 --> 13:41.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to conserve as long as possible.
As his momentum
starts to fade, the donations
are going to

13:41.320 --> 13:43.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
start to fade, too.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: But you already see
him pivot
from the person who think he
actually has

13:45.258 --> 13:48.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a chance of winning the
nomination, which
I think he no longer does, to
someone who

13:48.828 --> 13:50.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is figuring out, what is his
role going to
be?

13:50.697 --> 13:55.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wants to push for progressive
-- a progressive
platform. He wants to affect the
party's stance

13:55.068 --> 13:59.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Hillary Clinton's stance on
issues like
on regulating Wall Street or
paying for college

13:59.839 --> 14:04.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tuition for young people. He's
got a big role
in this party. But I think you
can see him

14:04.277 --> 14:07.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in his comments and the
statement he put out
last night that he understands
his role in

14:07.847 --> 14:12.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this fight is changing now that
Hillary Clinton
is on a clear path to be the
nominee.

14:12.351 --> 14:15.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Susan, what
does Hillary
Clinton need to do at this
point?

14:15.154 --> 14:19.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Well, she needs
Bernie Sanders
to get on her side. You know,
he's gotten

14:19.659 --> 14:24.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
70 percent of the votes of
millennials. And,
you know, those voters I don't
think would

14:24.397 --> 14:28.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
naturally go to Trump if they
don't like Clinton.
But they might stay home.

14:28.801 --> 14:34.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think she needs Sanders to
embrace her
and to give her some of the
enthusiasm he's

14:34.173 --> 14:37.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been able to engender on the
left side of
the Democratic Party.

14:37.143 --> 14:40.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that something
he can do,
Reid? Can Bernie Sanders say to
these young

14:40.480 --> 14:43.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people and everybody else who
has been enthusiastically
showing up at his rallies, now I
want you

14:43.983 --> 14:46.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to turn around and vote for
Hillary Clinton?

14:46.119 --> 14:48.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REID WILSON: Well, it's not
something he has
done a lot in the past.

14:48.554 --> 14:52.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders doesn't have a
long track record
of working for other Democrats
around the

14:52.492 --> 14:57.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rest of the country, though he
had done some
fund-raising before his
presidential campaign.

14:57.430 --> 15:03.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I think Sanders is most
likely to do
is give as much of a blessing as
he possibly

15:03.703 --> 15:07.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can. Let's not forget that if
Clinton is the
nominee and Democrats take back
the Senate,

15:07.673 --> 15:10.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he gets a pretty prominent
committee chairmanship.

15:10.243 --> 15:14.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, though,
Clinton is going
to try to mobilize these voters
by pointing

15:14.380 --> 15:18.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out her contrasts with Donald
Trump. Negative
advertising is something that
voters all say

15:18.751 --> 15:22.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they hate, but, boy, it sure
works. That's
why we are going to see a lot of
it this year,

15:22.155 --> 15:24.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
especially when you're
contrasting Hillary
Clinton with someone like Donald
Trump.

15:25.024 --> 15:27.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Susan, just
quickly, he
is saying he is staying in until
the convention,

15:27.994 --> 15:31.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even if it's to see that the
platform reflects
language he likes.

15:31.364 --> 15:35.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: I think he's
guaranteed to stay
until the California primary on
June 7, as

15:35.434 --> 15:39.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton did in 2008. But
what he -- whether
he goes to the convention in a
disruptive

15:40.006 --> 15:41.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
role, I don't think so.

15:41.841 --> 15:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he is coming around to
the idea that
he wants to make sure -- he
doesn't want to

15:44.410 --> 15:46.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
create problems in defeating
Donald Trump
in November.

15:46.979 --> 15:49.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan Page, Reid
Wilson, thank
you both.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REID WILSON: Thank you.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Appreciate it.

15:53.152 --> 15:57.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we return to that Donald
Trump and
the -- or Donald Trump's speech
that he gave

15:57.323 --> 16:02.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this morning here in downtown
Washington.
It laid out his foreign policy
vision, or

16:02.295 --> 16:02.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at least part of it.

16:02.995 --> 16:04.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here are some excerpts.

16:04.864 --> 16:08.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
My foreign policy will always
put the interests

16:08.701 --> 16:17.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the American people, and
American security,
above all else. Has to be first.
Has to be.

16:17.143 --> 16:25.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That will be the foundation of
every decision
that I will make. After the Cold
War, our

16:25.117 --> 16:31.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreign policy veered badly off
course. We
went from mistakes in Iraq to
Egypt to Libya,

16:32.024 --> 16:38.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to President Obama's line in the
sand in Syria.
Each of these actions have
helped to throw

16:38.431 --> 16:44.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the region into chaos, and gave
ISIS the space
it needs to grow and prosper.

16:44.370 --> 16:52.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have a simple message for
them. Their days
are numbered. I won't tell them
where and

16:52.812 --> 16:59.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I won't tell them how. Our
allies are not
paying their fair share. And I
have been talking

16:59.619 --> 17:06.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about this recently a lot. Our
allies must
contribute toward their
financial, political

17:06.859 --> 17:11.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and human costs, have to do it,
of our tremendous
security burden.

17:11.631 --> 17:20.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, if not, the U.S. must be
prepared to
let these countries defend
themselves. We

17:20.640 --> 17:26.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will discuss how we can upgrade
NATO's outdated
mission and structure grown out
of the Cold

17:26.979 --> 17:34.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
War to confront our shared
challenges, including
migration and Islamic terrorism.

17:34.220 --> 17:40.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We desire to live peacefully and
in friendship
with Russia and China. We have
serious differences

17:40.793 --> 17:46.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with these two nations and must
regard them
with open eyes, but we are not
bound to be

17:46.565 --> 17:53.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adversaries. I believe an easing
of tensions
and improved relations with
Russia, from a

17:53.673 --> 17:57.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
position of strength only, is
possible.

17:57.743 --> 18:05.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fixing our relations with China
is another
important step. China respects
strength, and

18:05.818 --> 18:12.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by letting them take advantage
of us economically,
which they are doing like never
before, we

18:12.258 --> 18:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have lost all of their respect.
We have a
massive trade deficit with
China, a deficit

18:20.800 --> 18:25.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we have to find a way
quickly to balance.

18:25.204 --> 18:31.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under a Trump administration, no
American
citizen will ever again feel
that their needs

18:31.744 --> 18:35.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come second to the citizens of a
foreign country.

18:35.514 --> 18:37.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

18:37.350 --> 18:43.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will view as president the
world through
the clear lens of American
interests. I will

18:43.956 --> 18:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be America's greatest defender
and most loyal
champion. We will not apologize
for becoming

18:50.763 --> 18:58.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
successful again, but will
instead embrace
the unique heritage that makes
us who we are.

18:58.504 --> 19:05.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The world is most peaceful and
most prosperous
when America is strongest.

19:05.411 --> 19:10.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For two
perspectives on Donald
Trump's foreign policy approach,
I'm joined

19:10.616 --> 19:17.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now by Walid Phares. He's a
scholar and terrorism
expert who advises the Trump
campaign. And

19:17.423 --> 19:23.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ambassador Nicholas Burns, he's
been a top
foreign policy adviser and
diplomat for both

19:23.229 --> 19:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican and Democratic
presidents. He is
currently a visiting fellow at
the Hoover

19:27.933 --> 19:30.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Institution at Stanford
University.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the program.

19:33.572 --> 19:35.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ambassador Burns, to you first.

19:35.441 --> 19:40.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard Donald Trump call the
current American
foreign policy a complete and
total disaster.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What was your overall reaction
to the speech?

19:43.382 --> 19:45.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS, Former U.S.
Undersecretary
of State for Political Affairs:
Judy, I thought

19:45.918 --> 19:48.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was a very revealing speech
about Donald
Trump.

19:48.888 --> 19:53.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, frankly, as a citizen and
voter, I think
that it revealed that he doesn't
have the

19:53.159 --> 19:57.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
qualities to be a commander in
chief and our
top diplomat. If you think about
the speech

19:57.430 --> 20:03.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, it betrayed, I think, a
lack of in-depth
knowledge, a lack of
sophistication and nuance

20:03.636 --> 20:09.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the very complex world
that we face,
and a lack of humility about the
restraint

20:09.675 --> 20:12.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that America sometimes has to
apply in the
world.

20:12.178 --> 20:16.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those were the qualities, in my
mind, that
our best Republican presidents
of the last

20:16.082 --> 20:22.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
50 years had, Dwight D.
Eisenhower, Ronald
Reagan, George H.W. Bush. You
saw very little

20:22.254 --> 20:24.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of that balance and restraint
today.

20:24.390 --> 20:29.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, what Mr. Trump did
today was, he
cast a series of ultimatums and
threats mainly

20:29.628 --> 20:34.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against our allies, against NATO
and against
Japan and South Korea. He was
very soft on

20:34.900 --> 20:37.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia. I thought it was a very
unwise speech.

20:37.269 --> 20:40.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Walid Phares, a
lack of knowledge
and a lack of humility.

20:40.840 --> 20:44.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID PHARES, Donald Trump
Foreign Policy
Adviser: I wouldn't opine on his
lack of humility,

20:44.610 --> 20:49.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because that would be basically
the position
of his critics. That's how they
perceive him.

20:49.315 --> 20:54.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would look at Mr. Trump's new
policy that
he is proposing, that it is
something new.

20:54.386 --> 20:59.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His critics usually try to put
him in a box.
Either they would accuse him of
being an isolationist.

20:59.992 --> 21:05.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he's not, because,
precisely, he spoke
about many alliances he would
like to develop.

21:05.131 --> 21:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or they would criticize him that
he is an
interventionist, precisely
because the fact

21:10.069 --> 21:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he has opined on many
regions and what
to do about it. In my view, this
speech is

21:15.007 --> 21:19.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
revealing a new school of
thought which will
develop soon and with other
speeches, which

21:19.145 --> 21:23.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is functionalist, meaning the
question that
he has always asked, why are we
doing this?

21:23.482 --> 21:27.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why are we, for example, drawing
this policy
in Syria and failed? Why did we
take that

21:27.987 --> 21:33.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
action in Libya and failed? Why
haven't we
found some joint principles with
Russia while

21:33.425 --> 21:38.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we are firm in negotiations? He
is trying
to propose something new based
on a critique,

21:38.797 --> 21:43.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his critique of the past eight
years, but
also most likely of the last 20
years.

21:43.836 --> 21:47.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nicholas Burns,
why couldn't
this be seen as a new approach?
He talked

21:47.973 --> 21:53.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about the U.S. shouldn't
continue to be involved
in the business of
nation-building, but he

21:53.312 --> 21:57.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said we need a new rational
approach and we
need to seek stability in the
world.

21:57.983 --> 22:02.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS: Well, Judy, he
made a point
about three-quarters of the way
through the

22:02.154 --> 22:06.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speech. He says, we have to
return to diplomacy
and he wants to focus on
diplomacy.

22:06.392 --> 22:11.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is the presidential
candidate who
has maligned the entire nation
of Mexico,

22:11.096 --> 22:17.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1.6 billion Muslims, our NATO
allies and our
Asian allies. So, it's a curious
way to return

22:17.269 --> 22:20.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to diplomacy to basically be
very critical
of our allies.

22:20.706 --> 22:25.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I want to go back to the
point I ended
on before. He was quite soft on
Vladimir Putin.

22:25.544 --> 22:31.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, right now, the next
American president
will face Putin, who has annexed
Crimea, divided

22:31.517 --> 22:35.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ukraine, and threatened our NATO
allies in
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and
Poland.

22:35.588 --> 22:40.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the next American president
needs to join
with our European allies, with
the Germans,

22:40.326 --> 22:45.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
British, and French, in
containing Putin.
We didn't hear any of that
today. I think

22:45.197 --> 22:49.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was a very naive speech in
that respect,
because he appears to want to
try to sidle

22:49.268 --> 22:54.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up to Putin, and yet be so tough
on our allies,
all of which whom are
democracies, that he's

22:54.740 --> 22:56.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to alienate them from
American leadership.

22:56.775 --> 23:01.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Walid Phares,
what about that,
Nicholas Burns' point, that he
is being tough

23:01.914 --> 23:06.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- or, rather, being soft on Mr.
Putin, at
the same time he's coming down
hard on America's

23:06.285 --> 23:08.053 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
allies?

23:08.087 --> 23:10.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID PHARES: In comparison with
the current
administration and maybe the
last few years

23:10.556 --> 23:15.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the previous administration
in terms of
being tough or being nice with
our allies,

23:15.394 --> 23:19.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you have a feeling in
the region,
first in the Middle East, but
also in Europe,

23:19.698 --> 23:21.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that there has been abandonment.

23:21.867 --> 23:26.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ask the Eastern Europeans about
our policy
with regard to supporting them
and the weapon

23:26.105 --> 23:30.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
systems that we withdrew from
the area. Ask
the Czechs, ask the Poles, but
attack also

23:30.576 --> 23:35.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Egyptians. I mean, an
overwhelming majority
of Egyptians feel that the Obama
administration,

23:35.748 --> 23:39.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which would be continued with
the Clinton
administration, has abandoned
them, has supported

23:39.585 --> 23:41.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Muslim Brotherhood.

23:41.387 --> 23:44.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's only recently that we have
started to
change the policy because the
people of Egypt

23:44.623 --> 23:50.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have spoken. Ask the Iranians,
when they demonstrated
in 2009, how we actually
abandoned them. So,

23:50.362 --> 23:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yes, we can criticize the
beginning of a new
foreign policy because it didn't
develop yet

23:54.500 --> 23:56.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the ground.

23:56.302 --> 24:00.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to say that he is basically
developing
something that has been tested
before, I don't

24:00.039 --> 24:01.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
think so. It's a new policy.

24:01.974 --> 24:07.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But just staying
with you quickly,
Mr. Phares, what about
Ambassador Burns' point

24:07.179 --> 24:10.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Mr. Trump was soft on
Vladimir Putin?

24:10.249 --> 24:15.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID PHARES: He is soft on
Vladimir Putin
if the policy would be
containment of Russia

24:15.888 --> 24:17.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no questions asked.

24:17.756 --> 24:21.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yes, he doesn't want to
contain Russia
with no questions asked. He
wants to sit down

24:21.560 --> 24:26.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Russian leadership, the
same way
Reagan engaged them, and when
there was an

24:26.665 --> 24:31.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue, he confronted them. But
at the same
time, they were joint issues
against terrorism,

24:31.403 --> 24:36.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we saw how it ended, how the
Soviet Union
ended, when a new policy was
developed by

24:36.175 --> 24:37.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Reagan and those who came after
him.

24:37.609 --> 24:39.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ambassador Burns?

24:39.445 --> 24:42.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS: Well, I think
it's naive to
think you can sit down with
Vladimir Putin

24:42.314 --> 24:44.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and negotiate the future of
Europe.

24:44.350 --> 24:49.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama and President
Bush before
him dealt with Putin from a
position of strength.

24:49.054 --> 24:54.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now have sanctions against
Putin because
he crossed the brightest red
line in international

24:54.626 --> 24:58.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police. He invaded another
country and took
over its territory. There was
nothing in the

24:58.497 --> 25:00.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
speech about that.

25:00.265 --> 25:04.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was very little in the
speech about
Chinese assertiveness in East
Asia. And I

25:04.436 --> 25:09.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think, Judy, the thing that
bothered me the
most about this speech, the lack
of humility.

25:09.708 --> 25:14.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump castigated 35 years
of American
foreign policy. That includes
George H.W.

25:14.813 --> 25:17.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bush. It includes Bill Clinton
and George
W. Bush.

25:17.649 --> 25:22.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have had a number of
successes over the
last 35 years, some failures,
too. But to

25:22.287 --> 25:27.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say that we have an entirely --
we have been
entirely unsuccessful for three
decades is

25:27.493 --> 25:33.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
simply untrue. And I think it
really means
to me that he's out campaigning,
and he doesn't

25:33.132 --> 25:36.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really have an in-depth sense of
how the world
works.

25:36.135 --> 25:40.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we need to have that
confidence in a commander
in chief. Hillary Clinton has
those qualities,

25:40.672 --> 25:42.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but he surely doesn't.

25:42.474 --> 25:46.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Phares, was
Donald Trump
saying that American foreign
policy has been

25:46.245 --> 25:48.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wrong for the last 30-plus
years?

25:48.647 --> 25:53.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID PHARES: He actually said,
basically,
and gave examples in this speech
and in previous

25:53.786 --> 25:59.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
statements that there were
mistakes made.
He didn't say everything made
since 1991 until

25:59.124 --> 26:00.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his event has been wrong.

26:00.926 --> 26:05.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he has drawn the attention
of the public
and the voters and the citizens,
because he

26:05.397 --> 26:08.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was addressing the American
public at large,
to the failures, actually, and I
mentioned

26:09.001 --> 26:14.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a few of them, only in Syria and
Iraq, the
fact that ISIS wasn't
dismantled, the fact

26:14.573 --> 26:18.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we have abandoned the Arab
alliance.
It was very clear in the media
over past few

26:18.610 --> 26:23.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weeks that there was a -- sort
of a rejection
in the region, at least from the
perspective

26:23.682 --> 26:25.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of what the Obama administration
has abandoned.

26:25.584 --> 26:29.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, also, on the other hand --
and I keep
going back to that point --
Europeans are

26:29.888 --> 26:34.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe critical of what they
think Mr. Trump
is going to do. But if you ask
the Europeans

26:34.793 --> 26:38.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Central Europe and Eastern
Europe, the
abandonment was done way before.

26:38.263 --> 26:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
gentlemen, we are
going to have to leave it there.

26:41.934 --> 26:45.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Walid Phares, Ambassador
Nicholas Burns, we
thank both of you.

26:45.471 --> 26:46.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALID PHARES: Thank you.

26:46.438 --> 26:51.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS: Thank you very
much.

26:51.610 --> 27:00.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

27:00.419 --> 27:05.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
path to murder
and how the mental health care
system failed

27:05.491 --> 27:11.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to stop it; how a unique therapy
helped a
man born with autism understand
emotions;

27:11.697 --> 27:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and helmets being used to
measure concussion
risks.

27:14.833 --> 27:20.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, to the sentencing of
former House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, and the
accusations

27:20.205 --> 27:23.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of sexual abuse that became a
central part
of this case.

27:23.675 --> 27:27.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The federal judge overseeing the
proceedings,
Thomas Durkin, had tough words
for the man

27:27.379 --> 27:32.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who was once second in line to
the presidency.
He said -- quote -- "Nothing is
more disturbing

27:32.351 --> 27:36.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
than having serial child
molester and speaker
of the House in the same
sentence."

27:37.022 --> 27:40.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get more now on what happened
inside the
courtroom today from Natasha
Korecki, who

27:40.692 --> 27:44.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
covers Illinois politics and
politicians for
Politico.

27:44.363 --> 27:48.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The trial and the sentencing
were not about
sexual abuse, but, really, this
last phase

27:48.867 --> 27:54.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, it was pretty much a
trial about sexual
abuse. The victims came forward.
He actually

27:54.640 --> 27:56.074 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
admitted to it?

27:56.108 --> 28:00.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NATASHA KORECKI, Politico:
That's right.

28:00.112 --> 28:06.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when Hastert finally did go
up and speak,
he kind of glossed over that,
the abuse part

28:06.618 --> 28:13.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of it. He said -- quote, unquote
-- "I regret,
I'm sorry" for mistreating my
athletes when

28:13.492 --> 28:16.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was a coach more than three
decades ago.

28:16.094 --> 28:22.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the judge specifically held
his feet to
the fire and made him spell out
each individual,

28:22.801 --> 28:28.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asking him, did you sexually
abuse individual
A? And he went through the
different numbers

28:28.206 --> 28:33.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have been laid out in the
past. And,
eventually, Hastert did admit to
it.

28:33.345 --> 28:40.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It became this very, very
pointed, dramatic
court hearing, where the victims
were just

28:40.052 --> 28:44.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feet away from Hastert himself,
and there
was a very direct confrontation
there.

28:44.323 --> 28:48.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You had one of
the victims
directly, had one of the
victim's family members.

28:48.894 --> 28:53.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it seemed that Dennis
Hastert was actually
asking for support, a letter of
support from

28:53.932 --> 28:59.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of those victims' brothers.
It just is
appalling.

28:59.304 --> 29:05.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATASHA KORECKI: You know, that
really seemed
to rub the judge the wrong way,
because I

29:05.444 --> 29:09.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think Hastert, going in, his
lawyers had been
making, you know, this argument
that all of

29:09.581 --> 29:11.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this conduct was old. It was
decades-old.

29:11.650 --> 29:17.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the judge said he was so
disturbed by
that specifically, that he
called, you know,

29:17.489 --> 29:22.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this -- a politician well
known-here in Illinois,
Tom Cross, who used to be the
leader of the

29:22.160 --> 29:29.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOP in the Illinois House.
Hastert was a mentor
to Tom Cross. He called him and
asked him

29:29.301 --> 29:31.136 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for a letter.

29:31.169 --> 29:37.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, the Cross family
contacted federal
authorities, and Scott Cross,
Tom's brother,

29:37.776 --> 29:44.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came forward and gave very
pointed and very
tearful, emotional testimony
today. And he

29:44.249 --> 29:49.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was really -- is really the
first victim that
we have heard from publicly. We
have heard

29:49.187 --> 29:55.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from a deceased victim's sister
who has been,
you know, unrelenting in all of
this. And,

29:55.827 --> 29:59.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, she finally heard what
she wanted
to hear from Hastert today as
well.

29:59.564 --> 30:03.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, the
criminal proceedings
on this case are done. But
there's still a

30:03.035 --> 30:04.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
civil lawsuit pending?

30:04.836 --> 30:08.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATASHA KORECKI: The initial
transaction that
got us here, the structuring
count, this was

30:08.907 --> 30:14.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
involving this individual A, who
we still
don't know the identity of, or
-- it's not

30:14.646 --> 30:16.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been reported publicly yet.

30:16.815 --> 30:24.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this individual said they
had an agreement,
that Hastert had agreed to pay
him $3.5 million.

30:24.189 --> 30:30.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The individual initially wanted
to get a lawyer
involved and so forth. Hastert
paid part of

30:30.328 --> 30:35.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the money, about almost $1
million. And this
individual says, you still owe
me the rest

30:35.200 --> 30:39.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of that money, and filed a
complaint in a
state court.

30:39.671 --> 30:43.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that's going to be
litigated. One of the
little turns in that case now is
that individual

30:43.742 --> 30:48.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is trying to see if he can
remain an unnamed
victim. That part is going to --
actually,

30:48.880 --> 30:51.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's a hearing tomorrow to
discuss that
aspect of it.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what
happens to Dennis
Hastert now? We didn't see him
led off in

30:54.920 --> 30:56.722 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
chains today.

30:56.755 --> 31:01.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATASHA KORECKI: No, we didn't.
He was wheeled
out of court. His attorneys
described him

31:01.860 --> 31:05.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as frail and very ill.

31:05.363 --> 31:08.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is going to be able to
self-surrender.
That's very typical, actually,
in federal

31:08.967 --> 31:14.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government for white-collar
crimes, so-called
white-collar crimes. But he's
going to report

31:14.573 --> 31:18.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to prison. He's going to be
designated to
a prison. It usually takes the
Bureau of Prisons

31:18.744 --> 31:22.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
60 days or more to find a place.

31:22.214 --> 31:26.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has -- the judge said he
would recommend
what they call a level four
medical facility

31:26.852 --> 31:33.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for him to deal with diabetes
and some other
ailments that he has described
in detail to

31:33.892 --> 31:35.660 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the judge.

31:35.694 --> 31:37.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Natasha Korecki
of Politico joining us from
Chicago, thanks

31:37.796 --> 31:39.564 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so much.

31:39.598 --> 31:46.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATASHA KORECKI: Thank you.

31:46.738 --> 31:56.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: the
harrowing account
of how a mentally ill man
attacked and raped

31:56.414 --> 32:01.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a young couple in Seattle and
how it exposed
gaps in our system.

32:01.119 --> 32:08.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since the great recession, an
estimated $4.3
billion has been cut from mental
health services,

32:08.226 --> 32:13.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and only a fraction of those
funds have been
restored. Most often, this
leaves people to

32:13.298 --> 32:19.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suffer quietly and alone, but on
rare occasions,
that illness can lead to violent
behavior,

32:19.571 --> 32:24.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Pulitzer Prize winner Eli
Sanders recounts
in a new book.

32:24.543 --> 32:28.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William Brangham talked with
Sanders and with
the surviving victim.

32:28.446 --> 32:31.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER HOPPER, Survivor: I
think most people
who know me, they think of me as
this, like,

32:31.850 --> 32:38.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gregarious, outgoing person. And
with Teresa,
I was the quiet one. She'd walk
into a room,

32:38.423 --> 32:43.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you couldn't not notice her. She
just lit
up the room with her
personality.

32:43.428 --> 32:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELI SANDERS, Author, "While the
City Slept":
Jennifer and Teresa were two
women who took

32:48.200 --> 32:53.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a long time and long roads
towards finding
themselves and then each other.

32:53.738 --> 32:57.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER HOPPER: We knew we
wanted to be married.
We knew we wanted to spend our
life together.

32:57.843 --> 33:05.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The night before the attack, we
went to our
favorite bar. We had this
incredible conversation

33:05.550 --> 33:08.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about what life would look like
and what we
wanted to create for ourselves.

33:08.653 --> 33:13.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she went to go get us
another drink, and
she just turned around and just
mouthed, like,

33:13.425 --> 33:15.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
"I love you."

33:15.227 --> 33:19.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The very next
night, Jennifer
Hopper and Teresa Butz's plans
would come

33:19.531 --> 33:25.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
apart in the worst way
imaginable. They went
to sleep in their home in the
South Park neighborhood

33:25.604 --> 33:26.438 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Seattle.

33:26.471 --> 33:28.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They had no warning of what was
to come.

33:28.306 --> 33:32.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELI SANDERS: A young man named
Isaiah Kalebu
came in through an open window
in the house

33:32.711 --> 33:35.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that Jennifer and Teresa shared.

33:35.513 --> 33:41.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He sexually assaulted each of
them under the
threat that, if they didn't do
what he wanted,

33:41.152 --> 33:48.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he would harm the other. He used
their love
against them. He raped both of
them. And he

33:48.193 --> 33:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
began to cut both of them, and,
as they resisted,
he stabbed Teresa in the heart.
She ultimately

33:55.533 --> 33:59.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
died. And Jennifer was able to
escape out
into the street in front of
their house.

33:59.638 --> 34:04.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The attack and
murder shocked
the city. An immediate manhunt
for the suspect

34:04.209 --> 34:10.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
began. Thanks to DNA from the
crime scene
which matched DNA left at this
2008 break-in

34:10.649 --> 34:14.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attempt, Isaiah Kalebu was
arrested.

34:14.920 --> 34:20.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eli Sanders reported the story
for Seattle's
alternative weekly The Stranger.
In 2012,

34:20.091 --> 34:24.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he won the Pulitzer Prize for
this feature,
"The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"
which was

34:24.429 --> 34:29.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about Jennifer Hopper. And now,
Sanders has
widened the story into this
book, "While the

34:29.367 --> 34:34.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
City Slept: A Love Lost to
Violence and a
Young Man's Descent Into
Madness."

34:34.339 --> 34:39.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In it, Sanders tells the stories
of Jennifer
Hopper and Teresa Butz and their
life together.

34:39.644 --> 34:44.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders spent months with Hopper
and other
family members. But he also
examines the troubled

34:44.382 --> 34:46.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
life of their attacker.

34:46.217 --> 34:54.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELI SANDERS: He was, at the time
of this crime,
a nearly 24-year-old young man
who came out

34:54.559 --> 34:59.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of very difficult circumstances
and had been
living for quite some time with
a serious

34:59.631 --> 35:04.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mental illness that wasn't
well-treated.

35:04.536 --> 35:09.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he had bounced in and out of
the criminal
justice and mental health
systems in the years

35:09.708 --> 35:15.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before this crime, and had
actually been engaged
in a series of escalating
violent acts.

35:15.714 --> 35:21.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Your book
documents so many
different instances where people
spent some

35:21.619 --> 35:26.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time with Isaiah and clearly
recognized that
this was a young man who was in
serious trouble

35:26.825 --> 35:30.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and needed some help, and yet
that help was
never coming.

35:30.095 --> 35:31.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELI SANDERS: Yes.

35:31.863 --> 35:38.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, as young as elementary
school, he
had teachers showing signs of
concern. But

35:38.136 --> 35:45.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it wasn't clear exactly what was
going on
with him. So, as an adult, for
example, his

35:45.944 --> 35:52.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mother at one point, when he was
acting very
worrisome, and when she urged
him to get care,

35:52.717 --> 35:59.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he turned on her. He threatened
her. He told
her, she said, to enjoy her last
day on earth.

35:59.124 --> 36:04.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the day after that, he was
smashing the
windows of her van with a rock
and swinging

36:04.162 --> 36:10.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his dog's chain at her and hit
her in the
head with the metal end of his
dog's leash.

36:10.101 --> 36:18.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As Kalebu's
mental state
deteriorated, he got into more
and more trouble

36:18.043 --> 36:21.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the law, and cycled through
courtroom
after courtroom.

36:21.546 --> 36:25.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just days before the attack, a
fight with
a police officer landed Kalebu
in district

36:25.683 --> 36:29.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
court. But the system couldn't
see the looming
threat.

36:29.054 --> 36:34.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELI SANDERS: In Washington
state, the state
that birthed Microsoft, a
district court judge's

36:34.759 --> 36:39.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
computer cannot speak to a
superior court
judge's computer in another
county in a way

36:39.931 --> 36:45.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was sufficient for the
district court
judge to see who he had in front
of him. And

36:45.470 --> 36:47.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so Isaiah Kalebu was released.

36:47.972 --> 36:54.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And not long after that, he
scared his aunt
so badly that she filed for a
restraining

36:54.112 --> 37:00.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
order against him. And that
again failed to
set off any alarms in these
fragmented, fractured,

37:00.285 --> 37:02.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unintegrated systems.

37:02.053 --> 37:07.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The day after, she was killed in
an arson.
And he was a suspect in that
arson, but was

37:07.959 --> 37:14.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then released. And as his
defense attorneys
later put it, he wandered after
that, homeless

37:14.933 --> 37:20.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for days, accompanied only by
his dog and
his delusions, until early in
the morning

37:20.839 --> 37:24.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of July 19, he encountered
Teresa Butz and
Jennifer Hopper.

37:24.442 --> 37:28.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At Kalebu's
trial, where
he had to be restrained in a
chair because

37:28.546 --> 37:33.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his regular outbursts,
Jennifer Hopper
relived that terrible night on
the witness

37:33.084 --> 37:38.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stand. One of the prosecutors
said she was
the strongest witness he'd seen
in 20 years.

37:38.056 --> 37:45.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER HOPPER: There was never
any question
as to whether I would or could
testify. There

37:45.563 --> 37:52.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wouldn't be justice for my
family without
speaking the truth about what
happened, but

37:52.437 --> 37:54.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there would never have been
justice for her.

37:54.439 --> 38:03.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I got to survive, and
her family had
to bury her. I can't -- I can't
imagine what

38:03.314 --> 38:08.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was like for them, so how
could I have
ever not given them that peace?
I think it

38:08.753 --> 38:14.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helped complete that night for a
lot of people,
including myself.

38:14.259 --> 38:18.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Kalebu was
sentenced to
life in prison with no chance of
parole.

38:18.596 --> 38:22.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Eli Sanders spent the next
years researching
Kalebu's life, how he'd slipped
through the

38:22.934 --> 38:27.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cracks so many times, he became
convinced
that our system for dealing with
mentally

38:27.605 --> 38:29.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ill people in America is
terribly broken.

38:29.841 --> 38:34.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELI SANDERS: I believe that if
you just look
at this one case of Isaiah
Kalebu in Washington

38:34.812 --> 38:39.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state -- but Washington state
is, in the end,
a microcosm of the failures of
our nation's

38:39.350 --> 38:45.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mental health and criminal
justice systems
around the country -- you can
see how relatively

38:45.256 --> 38:52.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
little, potentially, it might
have cost to
steer him or forcefully nudge
him in a different

38:52.263 --> 38:54.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
direction much earlier on.

38:54.098 --> 38:58.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It seems like
we have this
conversation every time someone
with clear

38:58.970 --> 39:03.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mental illness goes on a violent
spree. We
always talk about how we need to
address this.

39:03.441 --> 39:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it seems like we never do.

39:04.976 --> 39:06.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELI SANDERS: Yes.

39:06.744 --> 39:10.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in a way, it is unfortunate
that we only
have this conversation in
conjunction with

39:10.748 --> 39:16.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
violent incidents, because the
vast majority
of people who live and struggle
with mental

39:16.187 --> 39:21.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
illness are nonviolent and more
likely to
be victims of violence than
perpetrators.

39:21.326 --> 39:26.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you want to add up the
cost to taxpayers,
which we are constantly doing in
this country,

39:26.531 --> 39:34.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so let's add it up. It cost more
than $3 million
for the taxpayers of Washington
state to jail

39:34.038 --> 39:38.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Isaiah Kalebu before his trial,
and then try
him at public expense. And now
we are going

39:38.977 --> 39:42.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pay to put him in prison for
life and keep
him there. It wouldn't have cost
more than

39:42.981 --> 39:47.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
$3 million to have tried to
intervene.

39:47.218 --> 39:57.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Today,
Jennifer Hopper,
who is a lifelong classically
trained singer,

39:57.629 --> 40:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is using those talents to help
other victims
of sexual assault. She's part of
the Angel

40:02.133 --> 40:05.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Band Project, set up by Teresa
Butz's best
friends.

40:05.737 --> 40:19.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their records and concerts help
other survivors
get the care they need. Jennifer
says this

40:19.651 --> 40:25.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work and Eli Sanders' book
telling their story
have helped honor Teresa's
memory.

40:25.323 --> 40:30.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER HOPPER: Through Eli, in
the book,
she got to be very alive. To
have that relationship

40:30.461 --> 40:35.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that joy that I had told in
his voice,
like, the way he told it, it's
just -- it's

40:35.900 --> 40:43.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so beautiful. Like, she is still
here. She
still gets to be, you know,
alive.

40:43.508 --> 40:50.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Again, the book
is called "While
the City Slept: A Love Lost to
Violence and

40:50.448 --> 40:54.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Young Man's Descent Into
Madness." It's
by Eli Sanders.

40:54.152 --> 40:58.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will continue our Broken
Justice series
tomorrow on the "NewsHour" with
a conversation

40:58.856 --> 41:04.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Deputy Attorney General
Sally Yates about
the challenges the newly
released face after

41:04.295 --> 41:08.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
leaving prison.

41:08.966 --> 41:20.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the latest
"NewsHour"
Bookshelf conversation, a look
into a potential

41:20.578 --> 41:23.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
new treatment for autism.

41:23.214 --> 41:27.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Transcranial magnetic
stimulation, or TMS,
can be used to diagnose damage
from brain

41:27.518 --> 41:32.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
injuries and disorders. But a
new study investigates
whether the therapy can help
some autistic

41:32.824 --> 41:37.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
patients make connections and
understand emotions
they have never experienced.

41:37.862 --> 41:40.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I recently spoke with one such
patient.

41:40.131 --> 41:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Robison, thanks so much for
joining us.

41:42.166 --> 41:47.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, first, let's start with,
what is transcranial
magnetic stimulation, and why
did you decide

41:47.705 --> 41:49.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to participate in this research?

41:49.540 --> 41:56.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN ELDER ROBISON, Author,
"Switched On":
It's a therapy where they use
focused bursts

41:56.781 --> 42:05.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of electromagnetic energy to
transmit tiny
amounts of electricity through
the scalp and

42:06.023 --> 42:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through the skull, and into your
brain.

42:07.825 --> 42:12.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your brain's an electrical
organ, so if you
want to change how it functions,
you can change

42:12.263 --> 42:19.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it most directly with targeted
electricity.
When I heard that there was a
study that might

42:19.837 --> 42:26.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
help autistic people like me see
emotional
cues in other people, the idea
of it just

42:26.277 --> 42:31.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spoke to the heart of something
that I felt
had been a disability in me all
my life, being

42:31.682 --> 42:36.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unable to read body language and
expressions
and cues in other people.

42:36.254 --> 42:39.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, you
describe this. I
want to quote a paragraph.

42:39.090 --> 42:43.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It says: "Imagine that, all your
life, you
have seen the world in black and
white. Meanwhile,

42:43.728 --> 42:47.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everyone around you describes
the beauty and
richness of color. After a
while, their talk

42:48.032 --> 42:52.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of color frustrates you. Which
do you believe,
their words or the evidence
before your eyes?"

42:52.470 --> 42:54.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So did you get a glimpse of
color?

42:54.539 --> 42:56.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN ELDER ROBISON: Absolutely.

42:56.307 --> 43:01.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's really the transformative
thing about
this. You can be an intelligent
adult, and

43:01.646 --> 43:08.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all your life, you hear about
color, and yet
eventually you start getting
angry because

43:08.119 --> 43:10.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the evidence in your eyes is
gray.

43:10.221 --> 43:14.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then imagine the doctor does
something
and they turn on color for
half-an-hour. And

43:14.792 --> 43:19.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even if color goes away, for the
rest of your
life, you're going to know it's
real. And

43:19.797 --> 43:24.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's kind of how it is for me.
They stimulated
me, and it was a temporary
thing.

43:25.002 --> 43:30.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The effects lasted for some
months, I would
say. Some of them faded away
quickly, some

43:30.174 --> 43:37.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
longer. And that built an
ability that's in
me today based on that real
experience. And

43:37.815 --> 43:42.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it's something words and
teaching and talk
could never have achieved.

43:42.253 --> 43:47.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The premise of
the stimulation
wasn't that you don't have the
wiring, so

43:47.391 --> 43:51.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to speak, to pick up on
emotional cues. It's
just that your wiring was almost
dormant.

43:51.095 --> 43:56.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN ELDER ROBISON: Well, you
know, the magical
thing is, the premise of the
experiment exploited

43:56.901 --> 44:01.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the hope that I did have the
wiring.

44:01.105 --> 44:07.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when they fired the energy
into my head,
it wasn't like this gradually
came on. It

44:07.044 --> 44:11.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was like I went to bed and I
woke up and the
next morning, bang, it was
there. And I could,

44:11.716 --> 44:17.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like, look in your eyes, and it
was like seeing
into your soul. And never in my
life did I

44:17.088 --> 44:21.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have experience like that
before. So, it was
from nothing to everything.

44:21.626 --> 44:28.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You know, one
of the things
that you point out is that you
were overwhelmed

44:28.099 --> 44:29.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just by waves of emotion.

44:29.867 --> 44:32.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN ELDER ROBISON: Just you and
me talking
like this, I would look at you,
and I would

44:32.837 --> 44:41.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sense a curiosity or worry or
fear or something,
and I would almost be brought to
tears by

44:41.078 --> 44:42.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an ordinary conversation.

44:42.980 --> 44:48.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that happened to me the
first day. I would
say, excuse me. I got to just
step away and

44:48.352 --> 44:50.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
calm down.

44:50.221 --> 44:57.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was crazy. I thought not
seeing emotion
was disabling, but seeing it in
such tremendous

44:57.562 --> 45:03.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intensity was, frankly, really
disabling and,
of course, thankfully, it
moderated.

45:03.935 --> 45:08.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But what did
you see? Did
you have an expectation that
there was a world

45:08.339 --> 45:11.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of joy and happiness that you
weren't plugging
into?

45:11.709 --> 45:16.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN ELDER ROBISON: I did. And I
was just
a -- I was just a crazy fool for
that, because

45:16.447 --> 45:21.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anyone who looks at the news
knows that the
world is not beauty and joy and
light.

45:21.052 --> 45:25.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I thought those are the
messages I'm
missing, and if I could get
them, I would

45:25.056 --> 45:31.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be happy. And instead, the
messages were angst,
and jealousy and fear and worry
and...

45:31.128 --> 45:33.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This is what
people around
you were exhibiting?

45:33.264 --> 45:37.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN ELDER ROBISON: It was a
pretty big shock
to me.

45:37.335 --> 45:43.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the thing that was maybe the
hardest was
seeing people looking at me,
sometimes with

45:43.741 --> 45:51.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contempt or derision. And even
my memories,
for me to remember a time when I
was laughing

45:51.215 --> 45:56.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with somebody, and after the
enlightenment
of the TMS, I realized they were
laughing

45:56.654 --> 45:59.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at me. And that made me really,
really sad.

45:59.757 --> 46:03.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This also cost
you the relationship
at home with your wife.

46:03.661 --> 46:11.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN ELDER ROBISON: It cost me
my marriage.
It cost me clients at work, who
I felt were

46:11.869 --> 46:17.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- didn't like me. And, of
course, it's a
business, right? And should I
even care if

46:17.475 --> 46:19.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
somebody likes me? But I did.

46:19.577 --> 46:26.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it cost me friends. And,
like I said,
it cost me even my memories.

46:26.651 --> 46:30.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, you go
out of your
way in the book to mention that
this is the

46:30.421 --> 46:34.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experiences that you had, that
even other
people that participated in the
research had

46:34.325 --> 46:38.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very different experiences.
You're not advocating
automatically that this is a
cure for autism

46:38.529 --> 46:39.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or anything like that.

46:39.397 --> 46:41.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN ELDER ROBISON: Oh,
absolutely not.

46:41.232 --> 46:47.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is -- this is not a cure
for autism.
But what it is, is, it's a story
of a powerful

46:47.605 --> 46:52.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transformative experience that
ultimately
had a very positive effect on
me, but it was

46:52.610 --> 46:59.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a rough ride. It shows, though,
the tremendous
power of this TMS technology
that's basically

46:59.984 --> 47:04.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
unknown. Even as it's
FDA-approved to treat
depression, nobody knows it.

47:04.755 --> 47:09.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You know, this
also makes
me think, looking forward, is
there an era

47:09.493 --> 47:14.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you see where people say,
well, I want
to do something to my brain to
perhaps enhance

47:14.565 --> 47:18.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and wake up certain parts of my
brain that
might not be as active or
efficient as they

47:18.636 --> 47:20.271 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
could be?

47:20.304 --> 47:23.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN ELDER ROBISON: I think that
that's a
very real thing that we need to
start the

47:23.941 --> 47:25.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
conversation about now.

47:25.743 --> 47:31.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's actually one reason I
wrote "Switched
On," because I'm concerned that
people are

47:31.782 --> 47:37.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to read my story, which,
frankly, is
like a stepping up of my
emotional intelligence,

47:37.121 --> 47:39.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they're going to read some
of the other
accounts in newspapers, and
they're going

47:39.757 --> 47:43.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to think, I'm going to do this
to get my mathematical
I.Q. hopped up.

47:43.928 --> 47:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if it's you or me, if we're
intelligent
adults, we can go into it with
our eyes open.

47:48.899 --> 47:52.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what if people start saying,
I'm going
to do this to my child to speed
him up in

47:52.903 --> 48:00.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school? I think we have some
real serious
ethical crises coming with this
kind of technology

48:00.177 --> 48:01.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and how it's going to be used.

48:01.479 --> 48:03.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, the
book is called
"Switched On."

48:03.881 --> 48:10.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Elder Robison, thanks so
much for joining
us.

48:10.855 --> 48:15.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN ELDER ROBISON: Thank you.

48:15.626 --> 48:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, with
growing concern
over concussions and related
injuries, a start-up

48:22.767 --> 48:28.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
company in Upstate New York is
using wearable
technology to help keep athletes
safer.

48:28.105 --> 48:33.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a device that sends head
injury alerts
as soon as they happen on the
field and in

48:33.844 --> 48:38.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the ring and also measures the
cumulative
effect of multiple hits.

48:38.649 --> 48:45.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From member station WXXI and
Public Media's
Innovation Trail, Sasha-Ann
Simons WXXI.

48:45.322 --> 48:53.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL ROBERTSON, Student: We
start off with
a 10-minute run. After the run,
we do what's

48:53.697 --> 49:01.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called a set. We do jumping
jacks, pushups,
squats, like all that kind of
stuff. And we

49:02.006 --> 49:03.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wrap our hands.

49:03.808 --> 49:07.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: It's a daily
ritual for
Michael Robertson. The
16-year-old is on the

49:07.711 --> 49:13.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high school boxing team at
Aquinas Institute.
Six days a week, he gears up to
get in the

49:13.184 --> 49:15.052 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ring.

49:15.085 --> 49:21.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His head gear is high-tech.
Before every match,
he slips a small sensor inside
his headband

49:21.559 --> 49:32.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then puts a helmet on. Jab
after jab,
the sensor, this one called the
LINX Impact

49:32.436 --> 49:39.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Assessment System, or IAS, sends
real-time
data to his coach and parents
through an app.

49:39.543 --> 49:44.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not only does the sensor help
spot signs of
a concussion. It also can
uncover other, more

49:44.381 --> 49:46.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
common types of brain injuries.

49:46.283 --> 49:49.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMINIC ARIOLI, Boxing Coach:
One of the things
that I look at with the device
is not only

49:49.620 --> 49:55.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how hard they're getting hit,
but if they're
getting hit, getting hit how
often with blows

49:55.526 --> 49:57.361 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that register.

49:57.394 --> 50:01.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: Aquinas has
been field testing
the concussion sensor for about
two years.

50:01.131 --> 50:05.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Inside the helmet, the sensor
registers the
amount of force from a blow and
will trigger

50:05.236 --> 50:11.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a green, yellow, or red light,
with red being
the indicator that the hit was
too hard to

50:11.475 --> 50:16.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ignore. The data's available in
real time
and can be stored for review
after the match.

50:16.447 --> 50:21.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMINIC ARIOLI: We will check
with the system,
and we will also check with the
student, how

50:21.685 --> 50:24.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did their blow feel? And they're
a pretty
good system.

50:24.622 --> 50:30.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: The blow is
also given an
impact assessment score.

50:30.661 --> 50:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BORKHOLDER, BlackBox
Biometrics: That
gives a number from one to 100,
and so you

50:36.267 --> 50:42.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can -- the individual can gauge
the severity
of each of those impacts on that
scale. But

50:42.740 --> 50:46.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we also capture all the detailed
data, which
is really critical for research.

50:46.043 --> 50:50.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: David
Borkholder is in charge
of the technology at BlackBox
Biometrics,

50:50.714 --> 50:56.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which created LINX IAS. His team
is brainstorming
ways to push the technology
forward.

50:56.086 --> 51:00.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BORKHOLDER: Another
emerging area that
I think is actually going to be
even more

51:00.257 --> 51:03.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
important are repetitive
subconcussive hits.

51:03.994 --> 51:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: Recent
research has shown
that many brain injuries are
from subconcussive

51:09.266 --> 51:13.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hits, which don't display the
symptoms of
a concussion.

51:13.737 --> 51:18.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And according to Dr. Jeff
Bazarian of the
University of Rochester Medical
center, it's

51:18.208 --> 51:21.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important for wearable sensors
to be able
to pick up on those, too.

51:21.378 --> 51:23.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JEFF BAZARIAN, University of
Rochester
Medical Center: There are
football players

51:23.180 --> 51:26.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that get hit all the time, day
in and day
out, never have a concussion. We
look at their

51:26.617 --> 51:28.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brains, it looks like they have
some mild
brain injury.

51:28.552 --> 51:32.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: Over the
years, more companies
have introduced impact sensors
and more doctors

51:32.856 --> 51:34.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have diagnosed concussions.

51:34.858 --> 51:36.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bazarian says that wasn't always
the case.

51:36.961 --> 51:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JEFF BAZARIAN: People would
say, these
problems that you're having are
not rooted

51:42.866 --> 51:46.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in anything real. They're just a
psychiatric
response to being hit.

51:46.737 --> 51:51.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now that we can see it,
people are saying,
oh, wow, this is kind of like a
stroke or

51:51.175 --> 51:53.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a ministroke. There's actually
injury here.

51:54.011 --> 52:00.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: There's an
adage in boxing
that the best defense is to not
get hit.

52:00.818 --> 52:06.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arioli is a firm believer
technology can't
take the place of his experience
and good

52:06.657 --> 52:10.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
training, but says he thinks
devices like
LINX IAS are useful.

52:10.394 --> 52:14.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMINIC ARIOLI: I can see if
they need to
keep their hands up, but it
gives me something

52:14.798 --> 52:20.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to show them, physically show
them, look how
often you're getting hit. What's
the story

52:20.170 --> 52:21.905 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here?

52:21.939 --> 52:26.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: For the "PBS
NewsHour,"
I'm Sasha-Ann Simons in
Rochester, New York.

HARI SREENIVASAN: On the
"NewsHour" online:
For many, life after retirement
can be an

52:31.148 --> 52:36.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opportunity to travel and
explore new horizons,
but how does Medicare coverage
work while

52:36.086 --> 52:37.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you're on the road?

52:37.855 --> 52:41.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our Medicare guru has advice on
receiving
care and prescriptions while
you're away from

52:41.925 --> 52:44.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
home. That's in this week's Ask
Phil.

52:44.962 --> 52:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And applying for financial aid
is a daunting
task for college students, but
some universities

52:48.999 --> 52:53.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have found that pairing students
with their
peers can help them manage
financial hurdles.
