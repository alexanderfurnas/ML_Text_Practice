02:17.871 --> 02:20.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
member stations across the
country tuning in tonight.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the sixth time the
Democrats have met face to

02:23.910 --> 02:24.878 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
face.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Each time, we learn
more about them and the

02:27.047 --> 02:29.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
presidents they say
they want to be.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know you're watching
-- whether you're a

02:31.551 --> 02:34.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democrat, a Republican,
or neither -- because you

02:34.321 --> 02:37.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
believe the outcome of the
election is important to

02:37.157 --> 02:37.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we believe that, too.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
With that, let's welcome
the candidates to the

02:41.995 --> 02:42.829 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stage.

02:42.929 --> 02:45.098 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Senator Bernie
Sanders of Vermont.

02:45.198 --> 02:47.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

02:47.467 --> 02:52.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Welcome,
Senator, great to see you.

03:03.383 --> 03:08.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And former Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.423 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

03:09.523 --> 03:14.528 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Very good to be
here with you.

03:15.228 --> 03:17.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Thank you.

03:17.697 --> 03:21.668 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
IFILL: Welcome
to you both.

03:21.768 --> 03:26.573 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
WOODRUFF: Now, a
word about format.

03:26.673 --> 03:31.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There will be two short
breaks, and the rules are

03:34.848 --> 03:40.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
simple: 90 seconds for
each answer and 30 seconds

03:40.987 --> 03:42.522 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
for the other
candidate to respond.

03:42.622 --> 03:44.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
IFILL: With Iowa and New
Hampshire behind us, we

03:44.991 --> 03:47.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are now broadening the
conversation to America's

03:47.694 --> 03:50.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
heartland and beyond,
including here in

03:50.330 --> 03:51.798 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Wisconsin.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now let's turn to the
candidates for their

03:53.934 --> 03:54.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
opening statements.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.270 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
The order was
decided by coin toss.

03:57.370 --> 03:58.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, Senator Sanders,
you go first.

03:58.705 --> 04:01.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Well, Gwen and
Judy, thank you very much

04:01.141 --> 04:02.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for hosting this event.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And, PBS, thank you.

04:05.278 --> 04:10.317 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Nine months ago,
our campaign began.

04:10.417 --> 04:14.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And when it began, we had
no political organization,

04:14.721 --> 04:18.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
no money, and not much
name recognition outside

04:18.758 --> 04:20.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the state of Vermont.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A lot has happened
in nine months.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And what has happened
is, I think, the American

04:26.166 --> 04:31.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people have responded to
a series of basic truths,

04:31.905 --> 04:36.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and that is that we have
today a campaign finance

04:36.309 --> 04:40.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
system which is corrupt,
which is undermining

04:40.147 --> 04:43.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
American democracy, which
allows Wall Street and

04:43.884 --> 04:47.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
billionaires to pour huge
sums of money into the

04:47.687 --> 04:51.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
political process to elect
the candidates of their

04:51.291 --> 04:52.359 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
choice.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: And aligned with
a corrupt campaign finance

04:55.662 --> 04:58.632 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
system is a
rigged economy.

04:58.732 --> 05:02.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's an economy
where ordinary Americans

05:02.335 --> 05:05.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are working longer
hours for low wagers.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They are worried to death
about the future of their

05:08.008 --> 05:09.442 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kids.

05:09.543 --> 05:12.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And yet they are seeing
almost all new income and

05:12.946 --> 05:16.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all new wealth going
to the top 1 percent.

05:17.717 --> 05:20.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And then in addition to
that, the American people

05:20.687 --> 05:25.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are looking around and
they see a broken criminal

05:25.492 --> 05:27.394 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
justice system.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They see more people in
jail in the United States

05:31.031 --> 05:35.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of America than any other
country on earth, 2.2

05:35.368 --> 05:36.469 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
million.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're spending $80 billion
a year locking up fellow

05:39.339 --> 05:40.006 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Americans.

05:40.840 --> 05:44.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They see kids getting
arrested for marijuana,

05:44.844 --> 05:49.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting in prison, getting
a criminal record, while

05:49.416 --> 05:53.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they see executives
on Wall Street who pay

05:53.653 --> 05:59.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
billions of dollars in
settlements and get no

05:59.926 --> 06:01.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
prosecution at all.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.097 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
No criminal
records for them.

06:05.398 --> 06:09.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think what our campaign
is indicating is that the

06:09.269 --> 06:14.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
American people are tired
of establishment politics,

06:14.407 --> 06:17.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tired of establishment
economics.

06:17.577 --> 06:20.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They want a political
revolution in which

06:20.680 --> 06:23.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
millions of Americans
stand up, come together,

06:24.084 --> 06:27.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not let the Trumps of the
world divide us, and say,

06:27.587 --> 06:30.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you know what, in this
great country, we need a

06:30.257 --> 06:34.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government that represents
all of us, not just a

06:34.594 --> 06:37.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
handful of wealthy
campaign contributors.

06:37.797 --> 06:39.032 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

06:39.132 --> 06:42.369 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
IFILL: Thank you,
Senator Sanders.

06:42.469 --> 06:43.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

06:43.303 --> 06:46.373 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
IFILL: Thank you,
Senator Sanders.

06:46.473 --> 06:47.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: I'm running for
president to knock down

06:50.577 --> 06:53.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all the barriers that are
holding Americans back,

06:53.913 --> 06:56.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and to rebuild the ladders
of opportunity that will

06:56.650 --> 06:59.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
give every American
a chance to advance,

06:59.286 --> 07:02.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
especially those who have
been left out and left

07:02.522 --> 07:03.189 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
behind.

07:04.057 --> 07:07.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I know a lot of Americans
are angry about the

07:07.427 --> 07:08.261 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
economy.

07:08.361 --> 07:09.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And for good cause.

07:09.863 --> 07:13.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Americans haven't had
a raise in 15 years.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There aren't enough
good-paying jobs,

07:15.101 --> 07:17.203 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
especially for
young people.

07:17.304 --> 07:21.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And yes, the economy is
rigged in favor of those

07:21.241 --> 07:21.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the top.

07:23.310 --> 07:26.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We both agree that we have
to get unaccountable money

07:26.780 --> 07:30.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out of our political
system and that we have to

07:30.150 --> 07:34.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do much more to ensure
that Wall Street never

07:34.220 --> 07:35.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wrecks main street again.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I want to go further.

07:39.225 --> 07:41.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I want to tackle those
barriers that stand in the

way of too many
Americans right now.

housing, and the criminal

justice system.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hardworking immigrant
families living in fear,

07:57.777 --> 08:00.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who should be brought out
of the shadows so they and

08:00.146 --> 08:03.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their children can
have a better future.

08:03.683 --> 08:07.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Guaranteeing that women's
work finally gets the pay,

the equal pay
that we deserve.

08:10.657 --> 08:14.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think America can only
live up to its potential

08:14.461 --> 08:17.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when we make sure that
every American has a

08:17.664 --> 08:20.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
chance to live up to
his or her potential.

08:20.967 --> 08:23.803 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
That will be my
mission as president.

08:23.903 --> 08:26.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think together
we will make progress.

08:27.073 --> 08:32.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Thank you both.

08:32.979 --> 08:34.381 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

08:34.481 --> 08:39.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Thank you both.

08:39.285 --> 08:41.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we'll be right back
after a short break to

08:41.488 --> 08:42.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
begin questions.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

08:43.323 --> 08:45.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: And, welcome
back to this PBS Newshour

08:45.225 --> 08:48.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
debate, Democratic
debate, here in Milwaukee.

08:48.895 --> 08:53.900 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Let's get right
to the questions.

08:54.334 --> 08:59.506 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Senator Sanders,
to you first.

08:59.606 --> 09:04.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Coming off the results in
Iowa and New Hampshire,

09:09.215 --> 09:14.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there are many voters who
are taking a closer look

09:19.793 --> 09:24.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at you, and your ideas,
and they're asking how big

09:30.370 --> 09:35.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a role do you foresee for
the federal government?

09:39.913 --> 09:44.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's already spending
21% of the entire U.S.

09:48.354 --> 09:49.389 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
economy.

09:49.489 --> 09:55.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How much larger would
government be in the lives

09:55.962 --> 10:00.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Americans under a
Sanders presidency?

10:31.698 --> 10:36.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Well, to put
that in a context, Judy, I

10:40.507 --> 10:41.975 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
think we have to
understand that in the

10:42.075 --> 10:48.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
last 30 years in this
country there has been a

10:48.681 --> 10:53.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
massive transfer of wealth
going from the hands of

10:59.459 --> 11:02.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
working families into the
top one-tenth of 1% whose

11:03.062 --> 11:04.297 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
percentage of
wealth has doubled.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In other words, the very
rich are getting richer,

11:05.765 --> 11:07.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
almost everybody is
going -- getting poorer.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What I believe is the
United States, in fact,

11:08.434 --> 11:09.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
should join the rest of
the industrialized world

11:09.769 --> 11:14.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and guarantee healthcare
to all people.

11:42.001 --> 11:44.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our Medicare for all
single-payer proposal will

11:44.804 --> 11:48.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
save the average middle
class family $5,000 a

11:48.641 --> 11:49.642 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

11:49.742 --> 11:52.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I do believe that in the
year 2016 we have to look

11:52.845 --> 11:56.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in terms of public
education as colleges as

11:56.182 --> 11:59.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
part of public education
making public colleges and

11:59.519 --> 12:01.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
universities tuition free.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I believe that when real
unemployment is close to

12:04.557 --> 12:07.894 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
10%, and when our
infrastructure, our roads,

12:07.994 --> 12:10.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
our bridges, our water
systems, Flint, Michigan

12:10.396 --> 12:11.631 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
comes to mind.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our waste water plants,
our rail, our airports, in

12:14.467 --> 12:16.202 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
many places are
disintegrating.

12:16.469 --> 12:20.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yeah, we can create 13
million jobs by rebuilding

12:20.373 --> 12:22.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
our infrastructure at
a cost of a trillion

12:22.475 --> 12:23.376 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dollars.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.510 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
WOODRUFF: But, my
question is how big would

12:24.611 --> 12:25.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government be?

12:25.745 --> 12:28.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Would there be any limit
on the size of the role of

12:28.247 --> 12:29.282 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government...

12:29.382 --> 12:30.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: ... Of course
there will be a limit, but

12:30.583 --> 12:32.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when today you have
massive levels of income

12:33.086 --> 12:35.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and wealth inequality,
when the middle class is

12:35.622 --> 12:38.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
disappearing, you have
the highest rate of child

12:38.491 --> 12:41.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
poverty of almost any
major country on Earth.

12:41.594 --> 12:45.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yes, in my view, the
government of a democratic

12:45.164 --> 12:49.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
society has a moral
responsibility to play a

12:49.402 --> 12:52.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vital role in making sure
all of our people have a

12:52.271 --> 12:53.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
decent standard of living.

12:53.406 --> 12:57.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Judy, I think
that the best analysis

12:57.543 --> 13:00.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that I've seen based on
Senator Sanders plans is

13:00.780 --> 13:03.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that it would probably
increase the size of the

13:03.650 --> 13:07.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
federal government by
about 40%, but what is

13:07.820 --> 13:11.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
most concerning to me is
that in looking at the

13:11.524 --> 13:13.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
plans -- let's take
healthcare for example.

13:14.060 --> 13:18.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Last week in a CNN town
hall, the Senator told a

13:18.131 --> 13:22.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
questioner that the
questioner would spend

13:22.468 --> 13:25.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about $500 dollars in
taxes to get about $5,000

13:25.538 --> 13:27.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dollars in healthcare.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.876 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Every progressive
economist who has analyzed

13:29.976 --> 13:33.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that says that the numbers
don't add up, and that's a

13:33.546 --> 13:36.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
promise that cannot be
kept, and it's really

13:36.749 --> 13:39.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
important now that we are
getting into the rest of

13:39.185 --> 13:43.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the country that both of
us are held to account for

13:43.222 --> 13:45.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
explaining what we
are proposing because,

13:45.625 --> 13:48.061 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
especially with
healthcare, this is not

13:48.161 --> 13:49.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about math.

13:49.529 --> 13:52.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is about people's
lives, and we should level

13:52.465 --> 13:54.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the American people
about what we can do to

13:55.068 --> 13:57.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make sure they get quality
affordable healthcare.

13:57.670 --> 14:02.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Well, let us
level with the American

14:02.141 --> 14:03.176 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Secretary Clinton has been
going around the country

14:05.078 --> 14:07.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying Bernie Sanders
wants to dismantle the

14:07.714 --> 14:09.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Affordable Care Act,
people are going to lose

14:10.083 --> 14:11.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their MedicAid, they're
going to lose their CHIP

14:11.784 --> 14:12.785 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

14:12.885 --> 14:15.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have fought my entire
life to make sure that

14:15.588 --> 14:17.256 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
healthcare is a
right for all people.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're not going to
dismantle everything.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But, here is the truth.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Twenty-nine million people
have no health insurance

14:22.695 --> 14:24.430 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
today in America.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We pay, by far, the
highest prices in the

14:26.566 --> 14:28.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:86.67% size:62.5%
world for
prescription drugs.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One out of five Americans
can't even afford the

14:30.403 --> 14:32.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
prescriptions their
doctors are writing.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Millions of people have
high deductibles and

14:34.474 --> 14:35.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
co-payments.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What I said, and let me
repeat it, I don't know

14:37.610 --> 14:40.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what economists Secretary
Clinton is talking to, but

14:40.613 --> 14:43.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what I have said, and let
me repeat it, that yes,

14:43.216 --> 14:45.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the middle -- the family
right in the middle of the

14:45.551 --> 14:49.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
economy would pay $500
dollars more in taxes, and

14:49.789 --> 14:54.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
get a reduction in their
healthcare costs of $5,000

14:54.127 --> 14:55.228 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dollars.

14:55.328 --> 14:58.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In my view healthcare is a
right of all people, not a

14:58.865 --> 15:00.500 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
privilege, and I
will fight for that.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.601 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

15:01.701 --> 15:06.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: I can only say
that we both share the

15:06.839 --> 15:09.075 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
goal of universal
health care coverage.

15:09.175 --> 15:12.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know, before it was
called Obamacare, it was

15:12.311 --> 15:13.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
called Hillarycare.

15:13.412 --> 15:17.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I took on the drug
companies and I took on

15:17.383 --> 15:19.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the insurance companies
to try to get us universal

15:19.485 --> 15:20.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health care coverage.

15:20.186 --> 15:21.154 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

15:21.254 --> 15:23.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And why I am a staunch
supporter of President

15:23.723 --> 15:26.659 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Obama's principal
accomplishment -- namely

15:26.759 --> 15:29.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Affordable Care Act --
is because I know how hard

15:29.595 --> 15:31.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it was to get that done.

15:31.297 --> 15:33.332 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We are at 90
percent coverage.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.368 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We have to get
the remaining 10.

15:35.468 --> 15:38.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I've set forth very
specific plans about how

15:38.104 --> 15:40.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to get costs down,
especially prescription

15:40.139 --> 15:41.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
drug costs.

15:41.307 --> 15:45.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it is difficult to
in any way argue with the

15:45.745 --> 15:47.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
goal that we both share.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think the American
people deserve to know

15:49.816 --> 15:51.551 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
specifically how
this would work.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If it's Medicare for all,
then you no longer have

15:54.854 --> 15:57.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Affordable Care Act,
because the Affordable

15:57.323 --> 16:00.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Care Act, as you know
very well, is based on the

16:00.526 --> 16:03.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
insurance system, based
on exchanges, based on a

16:03.696 --> 16:05.064 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
subsidy system.

16:05.164 --> 16:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Children's Health
Insurance Program, which I

16:07.166 --> 16:09.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
helped to create, which
covers 8 million kids, is

16:10.069 --> 16:11.871 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
also a different
kind of program.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So if you're having
Medicare for all,

16:14.340 --> 16:17.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
single-payer, you need to
level with people about

16:17.677 --> 16:21.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what they will have at the
end of the process you are

16:21.948 --> 16:22.849 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
proposing.

16:22.949 --> 16:26.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And based on every
analysis that I can find

16:26.118 --> 16:28.788 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
by people who are
sympathetic to the goal,

16:28.888 --> 16:31.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the numbers don't add
up, and many people will

16:32.024 --> 16:35.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
actually be worse off
than they are right now.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.062 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
IFILL: Final
thought, Senator.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.630 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
SANDERS: That is
absolutely inaccurate.

16:37.730 --> 16:41.000 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Look, here is the
reality, folks.

16:41.100 --> 16:44.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is one major country
on Earth that does not

16:44.337 --> 16:46.706 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
guarantee health
care to all people.

16:46.806 --> 16:49.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is one major country
-- the United States --

16:49.742 --> 16:51.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which ends up spending
almost three times per

16:52.078 --> 16:53.579 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
capita what they
do in the U.K.

16:53.679 --> 16:54.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
guaranteeing health care
to all people, 50 percent

16:55.047 --> 16:56.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more than they do in
France guaranteeing health

16:56.382 --> 17:01.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
care to all people, far
more than our Canadian

17:01.787 --> 17:03.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
neighbors, who guarantee
health care to all people.

17:04.190 --> 17:07.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Please do not tell me that
in this country, if -- and

17:07.793 --> 17:11.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
here's the if -- we have
the courage to take on the

17:11.330 --> 17:14.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
drug companies, and have
the courage to take on the

17:14.600 --> 17:17.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
insurance companies, and
the medical equipment

17:17.403 --> 17:20.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
suppliers, if we do that,
yes, we can guarantee

17:20.806 --> 17:23.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
health care to all people
in a much more cost

17:23.576 --> 17:24.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
effective way.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, let me just
-- let me just say, once

17:27.313 --> 17:27.880 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again...

17:27.980 --> 17:28.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

17:29.081 --> 17:31.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
... that, having been in
the trenches fighting for

17:31.617 --> 17:34.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this, I believe strongly
we have to guarantee

17:34.720 --> 17:35.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
health care.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I believe we are on
the path to doing that.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The last thing we need is
to throw our country into

17:40.927 --> 17:43.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a contentious debate
about health care again.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we are not England.

17:45.197 --> 17:46.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are not France.

17:46.365 --> 17:49.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We inherited a system that
was set up during World

17:49.168 --> 17:52.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
War II; 170 million
Americans get health

17:52.505 --> 17:54.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
insurance right now
through their employers.

17:54.941 --> 17:57.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So what we have tried
to do and what President

17:57.176 --> 18:01.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obama succeeded in doing
was to build on the health

18:01.347 --> 18:04.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
care system we have, get
us to 90 percent coverage.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to get the other
10 percent of the way to

18:07.253 --> 18:08.254 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
100.

18:08.354 --> 18:10.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I far prefer that and
the chances we have to be

18:10.856 --> 18:13.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
successful there than
trying to start all over

18:13.559 --> 18:15.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
again, gridlocking our
system, and trying to get

18:15.828 --> 18:18.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from zero to 100 percent.

18:18.164 --> 18:18.898 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

18:18.998 --> 18:20.700 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
IFILL: I'd like
to move along.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'd like to move along.

18:22.668 --> 18:25.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton, you
might -- you also have

18:25.671 --> 18:28.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
proposed fairly expansive
ideas about government.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You may remember this
pledge from a State of the

18:30.977 --> 18:33.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Union Address at which I
believe you were present,

18:33.212 --> 18:35.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in which these words were
said: "The era of big

18:35.581 --> 18:37.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government is over."
You may remember that.

18:38.384 --> 18:40.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
When asked your feelings
about the federal

18:40.353 --> 18:42.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government this week, 61
percent of New Hampshire

18:43.089 --> 18:45.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democrats told exit
pollsters that they are

18:45.524 --> 18:47.927 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
angry or at least
dissatisfied.

18:48.027 --> 18:51.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Given what you and Senator
Sanders are proposing, an

18:51.330 --> 18:54.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
expanding government in
almost every area of our

18:54.333 --> 18:56.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lives, is it fair for
Americans who fear

18:57.036 --> 18:58.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
government to fear you?

18:58.304 --> 18:59.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CLINTON: No.

18:59.338 --> 19:02.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But it is absolutely
fair and necessary for

19:03.075 --> 19:05.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Americans to vet both of
our proposals, to ask the

19:06.078 --> 19:09.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really hard questions
about, what is it we think

19:09.548 --> 19:12.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we can accomplish, why do
we believe that, and what

19:12.251 --> 19:14.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would be the results
for the average American

19:14.820 --> 19:15.488 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
family?

19:15.988 --> 19:18.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In my case, whether it's
health care, or getting us

19:19.025 --> 19:22.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to debt-free tuition,
or moving us toward paid

19:23.029 --> 19:26.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
family leave, I have been
very specific about where

19:26.766 --> 19:29.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I would raise the money,
how much it would cost,

19:29.902 --> 19:32.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and how I would move
this agenda forward.

19:32.972 --> 19:35.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I've tried to be as
specific to answer

19:35.141 --> 19:38.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
questions so that my
proposals can be vetted,

19:38.444 --> 19:40.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because I feel like we
have to level with people

19:41.080 --> 19:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the very reason, Gwen,
that you are mentioning.

19:44.050 --> 19:47.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is a great deal
of skepticism about the

19:47.153 --> 19:47.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
federal government.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm aware of that.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It comes from the right,
from the left, from people

19:51.157 --> 19:53.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on all sides of the
political spectrum.

19:53.959 --> 19:57.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: So we have a
special obligation to make

19:57.563 --> 20:00.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
clear what we stand for,
which is why I think we

20:00.533 --> 20:03.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
should not make promises
we can't keep, because

20:03.202 --> 20:06.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that will further, I
think, alienate Americans

20:06.572 --> 20:10.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from understanding and
believing we can together

20:10.743 --> 20:13.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make some real changes
in people's lives.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: But I haven't heard
either of you put a price

20:15.514 --> 20:16.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tag on your -- you say...

20:16.715 --> 20:17.450 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

20:17.550 --> 20:18.651 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLINTON: I will
put a price tag.

20:18.751 --> 20:22.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My price tag is about
$100 billion a year.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And again, paid for.

20:25.091 --> 20:29.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And what I have said is I
will not throw us further

20:29.462 --> 20:30.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into debt.

20:30.529 --> 20:33.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I believe I can get the
money that I need by

20:33.599 --> 20:35.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
taxing the wealthy, by
closing loopholes, the

20:35.668 --> 20:37.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
things that we are
way overdue for doing.

20:38.003 --> 20:40.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think once I'm in
the White House we will

20:40.840 --> 20:43.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have enough political
capital to be able to do

20:43.509 --> 20:44.543 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

20:44.643 --> 20:47.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I am conscious of the
fact that we have to also

20:47.413 --> 20:51.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be very clear, especially
with young people, about

20:51.450 --> 20:54.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what kind of government is
going to do what for them

20:54.553 --> 20:55.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and what it will cost.

20:55.654 --> 20:56.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
IFILL: Senator?

20:56.789 --> 20:58.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Well, Secretary
Clinton, you're not in the

20:58.991 --> 21:00.993 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House yet.

21:02.128 --> 21:06.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And let us be clear that
every proposal that I have

21:06.265 --> 21:09.001 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
introduced has
been paid for.

21:09.101 --> 21:12.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For example, all right,
who in America denies that

21:12.538 --> 21:14.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we have an infrastructure
that is crumbling?

21:14.673 --> 21:17.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Roads, bridges, water
systems, wastewater

21:17.309 --> 21:18.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
plants, who denies that?

21:19.211 --> 21:21.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Who denies that real
unemployment today,

21:21.347 --> 21:23.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
including those who have
given up looking for work

21:23.582 --> 21:26.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and are working part-time
is close to 10 percent?

21:26.652 --> 21:28.654 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Who denies that
African-American youth

21:28.754 --> 21:32.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
unemployment, real,
is over 50 percent.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We need to create jobs.

21:34.493 --> 21:37.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So yes, I will do away
with the outrageous

21:37.863 --> 21:41.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
loopholes that allow
profitable multinational

21:41.467 --> 21:44.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
corporations to stash
billions of dollars in the

21:44.370 --> 21:47.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cayman Islands and Bermuda
and in a given year pay

21:47.973 --> 21:50.809 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
zero, zero in
federal income tax.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.244 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Yes, I'm going to
do away with that.

21:52.344 --> 21:53.846 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We will use those
proceeds, a hundred

21:53.946 --> 21:55.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
billion a year, to
invest in rebuilding our

21:56.048 --> 21:57.049 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
infrastructure.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yes, I believe that as
a result of the illegal

22:00.186 --> 22:03.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
behavior on Wall Street,
that they are a Wall

22:03.622 --> 22:06.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Street that drove this
country into the worst

22:06.125 --> 22:08.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
economic downturn since
the Great Recession --

22:09.061 --> 22:10.329 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Great Depression.

22:10.429 --> 22:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, I do believe that now
after the American people

22:13.866 --> 22:17.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bailed Wall Street out,
yes, they should pay a

22:17.169 --> 22:21.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Wall Street speculation
tax so that we can make

22:21.440 --> 22:24.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
public colleges and
universities tuition-free.

22:24.410 --> 22:25.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We bailed them out.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now it is their time to
help the middle class.

22:28.847 --> 22:31.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

22:31.717 --> 22:36.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: You know, I
think, again, both of us

22:37.022 --> 22:39.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
share the goal of trying
to make college affordable

22:39.325 --> 22:41.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for all young Americans.

22:41.694 --> 22:45.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I have set forth a
compact that would do just

22:45.731 --> 22:47.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:86.67% size:62.5%
that for
debt-free tuition.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We differ, however, on
a couple of key points.

22:50.569 --> 22:54.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One of them being that
if you don't have some

22:54.206 --> 22:57.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
agreement within the
system from states and

22:57.209 --> 23:00.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from families and from
students, it's hard to get

23:00.145 --> 23:01.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to where we need to go.

23:01.614 --> 23:04.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Senator Sanders's plan
really rests on making

23:04.817 --> 23:08.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sure that governors like
Scott Walker contribute

23:08.387 --> 23:12.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
$23 billion on the first
day to make college free.

23:12.391 --> 23:15.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I am a little skeptical
about your governor

23:15.761 --> 23:18.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
actually caring enough
about higher education to

23:18.430 --> 23:22.701 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
make any kind of
commitment like that.

23:22.801 --> 23:23.569 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

23:23.669 --> 23:26.705 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
WOODRUFF: Next,
we're going to...

23:26.805 --> 23:28.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SANDERS: A brief response.

23:28.340 --> 23:29.575 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
WOODRUFF: Very
brief, thank you.

23:29.675 --> 23:31.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Here is where we
are with public education.

23:31.310 --> 23:35.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A 100, 150 years ago
incredibly brave Americans

23:35.180 --> 23:37.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said, you know what,
working class kids, low

23:37.750 --> 23:41.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
income kids should not
have to work in factories

23:41.387 --> 23:42.788 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or on the farms.

23:42.888 --> 23:45.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Like rich kids, they
deserve to get a free

23:45.791 --> 23:46.458 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
education.

23:46.959 --> 23:49.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that free education
of extraordinary

23:49.194 --> 23:53.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
accomplishment was from
first grade to 12th grade.

23:53.365 --> 23:54.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The world has changed.

23:54.733 --> 23:56.535 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is 2016.

23:56.635 --> 24:00.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In many ways, a college
degree today is equivalent

24:01.073 --> 24:04.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to what a high school
degree was 50, 60 years

24:04.743 --> 24:05.811 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

24:05.911 --> 24:08.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, yes, I do believe that
when we talk about public

24:08.380 --> 24:11.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
education in America,
today, in a rapidly

24:11.617 --> 24:15.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
changing world, we should
have free tuition at

24:15.888 --> 24:17.823 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
public colleges
and universities.

24:17.923 --> 24:21.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That should be a right of
all Americans regardless

24:21.327 --> 24:22.695 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
of the income of
their families.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.196 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

24:24.296 --> 24:30.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Secretary
Clinton, your campaign --

24:31.003 --> 24:35.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you and your campaign have
made a clear appeal to

24:35.808 --> 24:36.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
women voters.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have talked repeatedly
about the fact, we know

24:39.845 --> 24:42.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you would be, if elected,
the first woman president.

24:43.015 --> 24:46.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But in New Hampshire
55 percent of the women

24:46.218 --> 24:49.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
voters supported and
voted for Senator Sanders.

24:49.855 --> 24:51.924 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
What are women
missing about you?

24:52.024 --> 24:55.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, first,
Judy, I have spent my

24:56.061 --> 24:59.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
entire adult life working
toward making sure that

24:59.665 --> 25:03.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
women are empowered to
make their own choices,

25:03.135 --> 25:06.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
even if that choice
is not to vote for me.

25:06.205 --> 25:09.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I believe that it's most
important that we unleash

25:09.408 --> 25:12.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the full potential of
women and girls in our

25:12.244 --> 25:12.945 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
society.

25:13.445 --> 25:16.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I feel very strongly
that I have an agenda, I

25:16.582 --> 25:20.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have a record that really
does respond to a lot of

25:20.519 --> 25:25.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the specific needs that
the women in our country

25:25.391 --> 25:26.225 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
face.

25:26.325 --> 25:27.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I'm going to keep
making that case.

25:27.593 --> 25:31.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm going to keep making
sure that everything I've

25:31.330 --> 25:34.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
done, everything that I
stand for is going to be

25:34.266 --> 25:34.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
well known.

25:35.634 --> 25:40.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I have no argument
with anyone making up her

25:40.172 --> 25:41.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mind about who to support.

25:41.940 --> 25:44.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I just hope that by the
end of this campaign there

25:44.476 --> 25:46.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will be a lot more
supporting me.

25:46.345 --> 25:47.579 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
That's what I'm
working towards.

25:47.679 --> 25:48.714 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

25:48.814 --> 25:54.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: As you know,
just quickly, as you know,

25:54.953 --> 25:57.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your strong supporter,
former Secretary of State

25:57.656 --> 26:00.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Madeleine Albright, said
the other day that there's

26:00.826 --> 26:03.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a special place in Hell
for women who don't

26:03.262 --> 26:05.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
support other women.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.199 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Do you agree with
what she said?

26:07.299 --> 26:10.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, look, I
think that she's been

26:10.169 --> 26:12.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying that for as long as
I've known her, which is

26:12.371 --> 26:14.273 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about 25 years.

26:14.373 --> 26:18.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But it doesn't change
my view that we need to

26:18.210 --> 26:21.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
empower everyone, women
and men, to make the best

26:21.747 --> 26:24.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
decisions in their minds
that they can make.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.984 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
That's what I've
always stood for.

26:26.318 --> 26:29.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And when it comes to the
issues that are really on

26:29.855 --> 26:32.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the front lines as to
whether we're going to

26:32.391 --> 26:34.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have equal pay, paid
family leave, some

26:35.060 --> 26:38.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opportunity for, you know,
women to go as far as

26:38.530 --> 26:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their hard work and talent
take them, I think that we

26:42.100 --> 26:44.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
still have some barriers
to knock down, which is

26:44.136 --> 26:46.939 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
why that's at the
core of my campaign.

26:47.306 --> 26:50.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I would note, just for a
historic aside, somebody

26:50.909 --> 26:53.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
told me earlier today
we've had like 200

26:53.979 --> 26:57.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
presidential primary
debates, and this is the

26:57.116 --> 26:59.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first time there have been
a majority of women on the

26:59.451 --> 27:00.419 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stage.

27:00.519 --> 27:05.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, you know, we'll take
our progress wherever we

27:05.157 --> 27:09.127 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can find it.

27:09.228 --> 27:10.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

27:10.562 --> 27:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders,
you're in the minority,

27:14.566 --> 27:17.302 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
but we still want
to hear from you.

27:17.402 --> 27:22.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
(LAUGHTER) SANDERS: Look,
we are fighting for every

27:22.140 --> 27:26.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vote that we can get from
women, from men, straight,

27:26.945 --> 27:30.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gay, African-Americans,
Latinos, Asian-Americans.

27:33.118 --> 27:36.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are trying to bring
America together around an

27:36.922 --> 27:40.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
agenda that works for
working families and the

middle class.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I am very proud, if my
memory is not correct -- I

27:44.830 --> 27:47.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think I am -- that I have
a lifetime -- and I've

27:47.633 --> 27:50.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been in Congress a few
years -- a lifetime 100

percent pro-choice
voting record.

27:54.373 --> 27:59.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I am very proud that over
the years we have had the

28:00.012 --> 28:02.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
support in my state
of Vermont from very

28:02.981 --> 28:05.450 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
significant
majorities of women.

28:05.984 --> 28:09.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm very proud that I
support legislation that

28:09.755 --> 28:12.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is currently in the
Congress, got support of

28:12.791 --> 28:14.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
almost all progressive
Democrats in the House and

28:14.860 --> 28:19.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senate, which says we will
end the absurdity of women

28:19.298 --> 28:22.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
today making 79 cents on
the dollar compared to

28:22.834 --> 28:23.869 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
men.

28:23.969 --> 28:26.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we will join the
rest of the other -- the

industrialized world in
saying that paid family

28:31.209 --> 28:35.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and medical leave should
be a right of all working

IFILL: Senator, do you
worry at all that you will

28:43.355 --> 28:46.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be the instrument of
thwarting history, as

28:46.925 --> 28:48.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senator Clinton keeps
claiming, that she might

28:48.694 --> 28:50.262 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
be the first
woman president?

28:50.362 --> 28:54.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Well, you know,
I think, from a historical

28:54.166 --> 28:57.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
point of view, somebody
with my background,

28:58.036 --> 29:02.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
somebody with my views,
somebody who has spent his

29:02.374 --> 29:05.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
entire life taking on the
big money interests, I

29:05.911 --> 29:08.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think a Sanders victory
would be of some

29:08.380 --> 29:10.048 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
historical
accomplishment, as well.

29:10.148 --> 29:11.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

CLINTON: You know, I have
said -- I have said many

29:15.988 --> 29:20.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
times, you know, I'm not
asking people to support

29:20.525 --> 29:22.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
me because I'm a woman.

29:22.127 --> 29:24.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm asking people to
support me because I think

29:24.363 --> 29:26.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm the most qualified,
experienced, and ready

29:27.065 --> 29:30.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
person to be the president
and the commander-

29:30.902 --> 29:31.470 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

(APPLAUSE)

29:32.671 --> 29:35.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I appreciate greatly
Senator Sanders' voting

29:35.240 --> 29:36.308 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
record.

29:36.408 --> 29:39.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I was very proud to
get the endorsement of the

29:39.678 --> 29:42.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Planned Parenthood Action
Fund, because I've been a

29:42.414 --> 29:44.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
leader on these issues.

29:44.116 --> 29:47.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have gone time and
time again to take on the

29:47.719 --> 29:51.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vested interests who would
keep women's health care

29:51.590 --> 29:53.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
decisions the province of
the government instead of

29:53.992 --> 29:55.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
women ourselves.

29:55.160 --> 29:58.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: I'm very proud
that NARAL endorsed me

29:58.296 --> 30:01.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because when it comes to
it we need a leader on

30:01.366 --> 30:02.334 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
women's issues.

30:02.434 --> 30:05.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Somebody who, yes, votes
right, but much more than

30:05.671 --> 30:09.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that, leads the efforts
to protect the hard-fought

30:09.941 --> 30:12.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gains that women have
made, that, make no

30:12.344 --> 30:14.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mistake about it, are
under tremendous attack,

30:15.013 --> 30:17.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not just by the Republican
presidential candidates

30:18.016 --> 30:22.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but by a whole national
effort to try to set back

30:22.454 --> 30:23.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
women's rights.

30:23.555 --> 30:27.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I'm asking women, I'm
asking men, to support me

30:27.359 --> 30:29.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because I'm ready to go
into the White House on

30:29.961 --> 30:34.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
January 20th, 2017 and get
to work on both domestic

30:34.132 --> 30:35.767 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%

policy challenges.

30:35.867 --> 30:36.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

30:36.535 --> 30:38.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Final comment.

30:38.603 --> 30:43.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Let me concur
with the secretary, no

30:44.042 --> 30:46.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
question women's rights
are under fierce attack

30:46.311 --> 30:47.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all over this country.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I will tell you
something that really

30:49.614 --> 30:50.682 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
galls me.

30:50.782 --> 30:53.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I will not shock anybody
to suggest that in

30:53.185 --> 30:56.021 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
politics there is
occasionally a little bit

30:56.121 --> 30:56.955 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of hypocrisy.

30:57.055 --> 30:58.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Just a little bit.

30:59.324 --> 31:02.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All over this country we
have Republican candidates

31:03.095 --> 31:05.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for president saying
we hate the government.

31:06.098 --> 31:07.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Government is the enemy.

31:07.966 --> 31:10.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're going to cut Social
Security to help you.

31:10.902 --> 31:12.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're going to cut
Medicare and Medicaid,

31:12.604 --> 31:14.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
federal aid to education
to help you, because the

31:14.806 --> 31:15.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
government is so terrible.

31:16.007 --> 31:20.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, by the way, when it
comes to a woman having to

31:20.378 --> 31:25.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make a very personal
choice, ah, in that case,

31:25.817 --> 31:28.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
my Republican colleagues
love the government and

31:28.987 --> 31:31.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
want the government to
make that choice for every

31:31.556 --> 31:32.958 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
woman in America.

31:33.058 --> 31:37.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If that's not hypocrisy, I
don't know what hypocrisy

31:37.329 --> 31:37.896 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

31:37.996 --> 31:38.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

31:38.663 --> 31:40.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IFILL: Thank you both.

31:40.665 --> 31:46.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
IFILL: We turn now to the
first of several questions

31:46.271 --> 31:47.606 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
from our partners
at Facebook.

31:47.706 --> 31:51.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They were selected from
a curated group of people

31:51.643 --> 31:54.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we've been following
of undecided voters.

31:54.279 --> 31:57.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The first comes from
Claudia Looze, a

31:57.315 --> 32:00.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
54-year-old woman who
works as a program manager

32:00.118 --> 32:02.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at a public affairs
cable network in Madison,

32:02.254 --> 32:03.255 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Wisconsin.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she writes: "Wisconsin
is number one in

32:05.791 --> 32:08.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
African-American male
incarceration, according

32:08.794 --> 32:10.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to a University of
Wisconsin study.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.898 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
They found that
Wisconsin's incarceration

32:12.998 --> 32:15.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rate for black men, which
is at 13 percent, was

32:15.867 --> 32:18.570 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
nearly double the
country's rate.

32:18.670 --> 32:21.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What can we do across the
nation to address this?"

32:21.807 --> 32:22.874 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Senator Sanders.

32:22.974 --> 32:27.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: This is one of
the great tragedies in our

32:27.279 --> 32:28.980 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
country today.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we can no longer
continue to sweep it under

32:31.783 --> 32:32.450 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the rug.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It has to be dealt with.

32:34.753 --> 32:38.890 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Today a male
African-American baby born

32:38.990 --> 32:43.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today stands a one-in-four
chance of ending up in

32:44.062 --> 32:45.764 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jail.

32:45.864 --> 32:48.066 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
That is beyond
unspeakable.

32:48.800 --> 32:52.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So what we have to do is
the radical reform of a

32:52.704 --> 32:55.140 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
broken criminal
justice system.

32:55.240 --> 32:56.374 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

32:56.474 --> 33:01.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: What we have to
do is end over-policing in

33:04.516 --> 33:07.052 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
African- American
neighborhoods.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The reality is that both
the African-American

33:09.921 --> 33:12.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
community and the white
community do marijuana at

33:12.858 --> 33:13.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about equal rates.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The reality is four
times as many blacks get

33:17.762 --> 33:19.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
arrested for marijuana.

33:19.631 --> 33:22.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Truth is that far more
blacks get stopped for

33:22.834 --> 33:24.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
traffic violations.

33:24.636 --> 33:27.706 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
The truth is that
sentencing for blacks is

33:27.806 --> 33:29.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
higher than for whites.

33:30.175 --> 33:34.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need fundamental police
reform, clearly, clearly,

33:34.512 --> 33:36.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when we talk about a
criminal justice system.

33:36.915 --> 33:40.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would hope that we could
all agree that we are sick

33:40.452 --> 33:45.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and tired of seeing videos
on television of unarmed

33:45.557 --> 33:48.460 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
people, often
African-Americans, shot by

33:48.560 --> 33:49.861 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
police officers.

33:50.295 --> 33:53.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What we have got to do
is make it clear that any

33:53.465 --> 33:57.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
police officer who breaks
the law will, in fact, be

33:57.769 --> 33:58.904 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
held accountable.

33:59.004 --> 34:00.338 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

34:00.438 --> 34:05.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: You know, I
completely agree with

34:08.446 --> 34:09.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Senator Sanders.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The first speech I gave
in this campaign back in

34:11.416 --> 34:14.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
April was about criminal
justice reform and ending

34:14.552 --> 34:16.221 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the era of mass
incarceration.

34:16.755 --> 34:19.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The statistics from
Wisconsin are particularly

34:19.457 --> 34:22.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
troubling, because it
is the highest rate of

34:22.861 --> 34:25.530 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
incarceration for
African-Americans in our

34:25.630 --> 34:28.600 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
nation, twice the
national average.

34:28.700 --> 34:33.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we know of the tragic,
terrible event that lead

34:33.605 --> 34:36.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the death of Dontre
Hamilton right here in

34:36.241 --> 34:42.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Milwaukee, a young man
unarmed, who should still

34:42.881 --> 34:43.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be with us.

34:44.516 --> 34:45.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His family certainly
believes that.

34:46.051 --> 34:47.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And so do I.

34:47.686 --> 34:48.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So we have work to do.

34:48.887 --> 34:51.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There have been some good
recommendations about what

34:51.856 --> 34:52.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
needs to happen.

34:52.991 --> 34:55.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama's policing
commission came out with

34:55.794 --> 34:56.494 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
some.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.496 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I have fully
endorsed those.

34:58.596 --> 35:03.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: But we have to
restore policing that will

35:03.335 --> 35:05.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
actually protect the
communities that police

35:05.837 --> 35:08.073 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
officers are
sworn to protect.

35:08.540 --> 35:11.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, then we have to go
after sentencing, and

35:11.409 --> 35:13.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's one of the problems
here in Wisconsin because

35:13.345 --> 35:15.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so much of what happened
in the criminal justice

35:15.146 --> 35:16.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
system doesn't happen
at the federal level, it

35:17.082 --> 35:18.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happens at the state
and local level.

35:18.883 --> 35:20.418 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But, I would
also add this.

35:20.518 --> 35:24.122 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
There are other
racial discrepancies.

35:24.222 --> 35:27.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Really systemic racism in
this state, as in others,

35:27.192 --> 35:33.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
education, in employment,
in the kinds of factors

35:33.231 --> 35:38.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that too often lead from
a position where young

35:38.203 --> 35:41.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people, particularly young
men, are pushed out of

35:41.439 --> 35:44.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
school early, are denied
employment opportunities.

35:44.943 --> 35:47.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, when we talk about
criminal justice reform,

35:47.112 --> 35:49.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and ending the era of mass
incarceration, we also

35:49.647 --> 35:53.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have to talk about jobs,
education, housing, and

35:53.885 --> 35:58.256 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
other ways of
helping communities.

35:58.356 --> 35:59.357 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

35:59.457 --> 36:05.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Nothing that
Secretary Clinton said do

36:05.530 --> 36:08.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I disagree with.

36:08.233 --> 36:12.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This mandatory sentencing,
a very bad idea.

36:12.837 --> 36:16.708 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
It takes away
discretion from judges.

36:16.808 --> 36:19.611 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We have got to
demilitarize local police

36:19.711 --> 36:23.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
departments so they do
not look like occupying

36:23.348 --> 36:24.315 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
armies.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.450 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

36:25.550 --> 36:27.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have got to make
sure that local police

36:27.919 --> 36:31.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
departments look like the
communities they serve in

36:31.923 --> 36:34.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their diversity.

36:34.859 --> 36:38.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, where we are failing
abysmally is in the very

36:38.596 --> 36:40.799 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
high rate of
recidivism we see.

36:40.899 --> 36:43.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People are being released
from jail without the

36:43.535 --> 36:46.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
education, without the
job training, without the

36:46.538 --> 36:48.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
resources that they
need to get their lives

36:49.040 --> 36:51.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
together, then they end up
-- we're shocked that they

36:51.676 --> 36:53.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
end up back in jail again.

36:53.978 --> 36:55.914 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
So, we have a lot
of work to do.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, here is a pledge
I've made throughout this

36:58.349 --> 37:01.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
campaign, and it's really
not a very radical pledge.

37:01.753 --> 37:04.422 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
When we have more
people in jail,

37:04.522 --> 37:07.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disproportionately African
American and Latino, than

37:07.725 --> 37:11.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
China does, a communist
authoritarian society four

37:11.629 --> 37:12.931 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
times our size.

37:13.031 --> 37:16.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Here's my promise, at the
end of my first term as

37:16.334 --> 37:20.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president we will not have
more people in jail than

37:20.238 --> 37:21.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
any other country.

37:21.673 --> 37:24.109 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We will invest in
education, and jobs for

37:24.209 --> 37:26.578 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
our kids, not
incarceration and more

37:26.678 --> 37:27.612 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jails.

37:27.712 --> 37:32.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
(APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF:
Secretary Clinton, I was

37:34.686 --> 37:37.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talking recently with a 23
year old black woman who

37:37.722 --> 37:40.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
voted for President Obama
because she said she

37:40.758 --> 37:43.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thought relations between
the races would get better

37:43.928 --> 37:47.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
under his leadership,
and his example.

37:47.398 --> 37:49.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hardly anyone believes
that they have.

37:50.068 --> 37:53.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why do you think race
relations would be better

37:53.538 --> 37:54.906 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
under a Clinton
presidency?

37:55.006 --> 37:58.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What would you do that
the nation's first African

37:58.376 --> 38:00.712 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
American has not
been able to?

38:00.812 --> 38:03.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, I'm
just not sure I agree

38:03.648 --> 38:06.618 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
completely with
that assessment.

38:06.718 --> 38:10.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think under President
Obama we have seen a lot

38:10.288 --> 38:13.424 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
of advances, the
Affordable Care Act has

38:13.525 --> 38:16.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
helped more African
Americans than any other

38:16.194 --> 38:19.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
group to get insurance, to
be taken care of, but we

38:19.130 --> 38:21.432 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
also know a lot
more than we did.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have a lot more social
media, we have everybody

38:23.701 --> 38:24.602 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with a cellphone.

38:25.003 --> 38:28.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, we are seeing the
dark side of the remaining

38:29.040 --> 38:33.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
systemic racism that we
have to root out in our

38:33.178 --> 38:34.212 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
society.

38:34.312 --> 38:37.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think President Obama
has set a great example.

38:37.148 --> 38:40.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think he has addressed
a lot of these issues that

38:40.351 --> 38:44.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been quite difficult,
but he has gone forward.

38:44.556 --> 38:48.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, what we have to do
is to build on an honest

38:48.793 --> 38:51.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
conversation about
where we go next.

38:51.429 --> 38:54.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We now have much more
information about what

38:54.465 --> 38:57.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
must be done to fix our
criminal justice system.

38:57.769 --> 39:01.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We now have some good
models about how better to

39:01.339 --> 39:04.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
provide employment,
housing and education.

39:04.709 --> 39:08.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think what President
Obama did was to exemplify

39:08.780 --> 39:11.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the importance of this
issue as our first African

39:12.016 --> 39:16.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American president, and to
address it both from the

39:16.120 --> 39:19.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President's office, and
through his advocacy, such

39:19.991 --> 39:22.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as working with young men,
and Mrs. Obama's work with

39:22.794 --> 39:23.461 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
young women.

39:24.128 --> 39:25.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But, we can't rest.

39:25.663 --> 39:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have work to do, and we
now know a lot more than

39:28.666 --> 39:30.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we ever did before.

39:30.168 --> 39:33.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it's going to be my
responsibility to make

39:33.304 --> 39:37.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sure we move forward to
solve these problems that

39:37.375 --> 39:38.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are now out in the open.

39:38.743 --> 39:40.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nobody can deny them.

39:40.311 --> 39:42.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
To use the Justice
Department, as we just

39:42.280 --> 39:45.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saw, they have said they
are going to sue Ferguson,

39:45.149 --> 39:47.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that entered into a
consent agreement, and

39:47.118 --> 39:48.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
then tried to back out.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we're going to enforce
the law, we're going to

39:50.421 --> 39:52.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change policing practices,
we're going to change

39:52.690 --> 39:54.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
incarceration practices,
but we're also going to

39:55.026 --> 39:57.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
emphasize education,
jobs, and housing.

39:57.862 --> 39:58.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

39:58.529 --> 40:00.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders?

40:00.698 --> 40:01.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

40:01.766 --> 40:06.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Well, I think,
Judy, what has to be

40:06.938 --> 40:10.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
appreciated is that, as a
result of the disastrous

40:10.541 --> 40:13.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and illegal behavior on
Wall Street, millions of

40:13.645 --> 40:14.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lives were hurt.

40:14.779 --> 40:16.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People lost their jobs,
their homes, their life

40:16.981 --> 40:17.949 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
savings.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Turns out that the
African-American community

40:20.051 --> 40:23.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the Latino community
were hit especially hard.

40:23.121 --> 40:25.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
As I understand it, the
African-American community

40:25.990 --> 40:29.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lost half of their wealth
as a result of the Wall

40:29.927 --> 40:31.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Street collapse.

40:31.763 --> 40:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So when you have childhood
African-American poverty

40:35.466 --> 40:39.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rates of 35 percent,
when you have youth

40:39.370 --> 40:43.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
unemployment at 51
percent, when you have

40:43.641 --> 40:47.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
unbelievable rates of
incarceration -- which, by

40:47.312 --> 40:50.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the way, leaves the
children back home without

40:50.982 --> 40:55.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a dad or even a mother --
clearly, we are looking at

40:55.119 --> 40:57.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
institutional racism.

40:57.588 --> 41:00.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are looking at an
economy in which the rich

41:00.391 --> 41:02.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
get richer and the
poor get poorer.

41:02.860 --> 41:06.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And sadly, in America
today, in our economy, a

41:06.464 --> 41:08.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whole lot of those
poor people are

41:08.232 --> 41:09.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
African-American.

41:09.367 --> 41:11.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So race relation
was be better under a

41:11.703 --> 41:13.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sanders presidency
than they've been?

41:13.438 --> 41:16.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Absolutely,
because what we will do is

41:16.240 --> 41:19.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say, instead of giving tax
breaks to billionaires, we

41:19.744 --> 41:22.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are going to create
millions of jobs for

41:22.513 --> 41:25.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
low-income kids so they're
not hanging out on street

41:25.750 --> 41:26.751 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
corners.

41:26.851 --> 41:28.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're going to make sure
that those kids stay in

41:28.820 --> 41:32.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
school or are able to
get a college education.

41:33.157 --> 41:35.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think when you
give low-income kids --

41:35.993 --> 41:38.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
African-American, white,
Latino kids -- the

41:38.763 --> 41:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opportunities to get their
lives together, they are

41:41.966 --> 41:43.067 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
not going to
end up in jail.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're going to end up
in the productive economy,

41:45.536 --> 41:46.604 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
which is where
we want them.

41:46.704 --> 41:47.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

41:47.872 --> 41:52.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: Let me turn this on
its head, because when we

41:52.377 --> 41:53.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
talk about race in this
country, we always talk

41:53.711 --> 41:54.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about African-Americans,
people of color.

41:55.046 --> 41:56.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I want to talk about
white people, OK?

41:56.748 --> 41:57.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SANDERS: White people?

41:57.415 --> 41:57.982 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
IFILL: I know.

41:58.082 --> 41:59.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:59.217 --> 42:01.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So many people will be
surprised to find out that

42:02.019 --> 42:03.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we are sitting in one
of the most racially

42:04.055 --> 42:07.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
polarized metropolitan
areas in the country.

42:07.892 --> 42:09.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
By the middle of this
century, the nation is

42:09.527 --> 42:11.396 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
going to be
majority nonwhite.

42:11.496 --> 42:13.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our public schools
are already there.

42:13.831 --> 42:16.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If working- class, white
Americans are about to be

42:16.768 --> 42:19.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
outnumbered, are already
underemployed in many

42:19.904 --> 42:23.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cases, and one study found
they are dying sooner,

42:23.775 --> 42:26.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
don't they have a reason
to be resentful, Senator

42:26.477 --> 42:27.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- Secretary Clinton?

42:27.612 --> 42:29.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Look, I am deeply
concerned about what's

42:29.614 --> 42:34.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happening in every
community in America, and

42:34.986 --> 42:38.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that includes white
communities, where we are

42:38.990 --> 42:44.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seeing an increase in
alcoholism, addiction,

42:44.529 --> 42:46.330 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
earlier deaths.

42:46.431 --> 42:49.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People with a high school
education or less are not

42:50.001 --> 42:52.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
even living as long as
their parents lived.

42:52.904 --> 42:56.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is a remarkable
and horrifying fact.

42:57.708 --> 43:00.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's why I've come
forward with, for example,

43:01.012 --> 43:04.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a plan to revitalize coal
country, the coalfield

43:04.482 --> 43:07.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
communities that have
been so hard hit by the

43:07.852 --> 43:10.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
changing economy, by the
reduction in the use of

43:10.888 --> 43:11.923 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
coal.

43:12.023 --> 43:14.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know, coal miners and
their families who helped

43:14.192 --> 43:16.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
turn on the lights and
power our factories for

43:16.661 --> 43:20.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
generations are now
wondering, has our country

43:20.865 --> 43:21.799 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
forgotten us?

43:21.899 --> 43:24.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do people not care about
all of our sacrifice?

43:25.169 --> 43:26.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I'm going to do
everything I can to

43:26.904 --> 43:29.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
address distressed
communities, whether they

43:29.373 --> 43:31.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are communities of color,
whether they are white

43:31.676 --> 43:34.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
communities, whether they
are in any part of our

43:34.479 --> 43:35.379 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

43:35.480 --> 43:38.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I particularly appreciate
the proposal that

43:38.649 --> 43:41.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Congressman Jim Clyburn
has -- the 10-20-30

43:41.352 --> 43:45.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
proposal -- to try to
spend more federal dollars

43:45.389 --> 43:47.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in communities with
persistent generational

43:47.859 --> 43:48.593 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
poverty.

43:48.693 --> 43:49.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And you know what?

43:49.627 --> 43:50.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If you look at the
numbers, there are

43:50.962 --> 43:54.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
actually as many, if not
more white communities

43:54.332 --> 43:57.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that are truly being
left behind and left out.

43:57.902 --> 44:01.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, yes, I do think
it would be a terrible

44:01.939 --> 44:05.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
oversight not to try to
address the very real

44:05.877 --> 44:08.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
problems that white
Americans -- particularly

44:08.913 --> 44:14.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
those without a lot of
education whose jobs have

44:14.485 --> 44:17.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
-- you know, no longer
provided them or even no

44:17.154 --> 44:19.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
longer present in their
communities, because we

44:19.824 --> 44:22.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have to focus where
the real hurt is.

44:22.527 --> 44:24.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's why, as
president, I will look at

44:24.962 --> 44:27.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
communities that need
special help and try to

44:27.632 --> 44:28.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deliver that.

44:28.299 --> 44:29.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

44:29.433 --> 44:32.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: Senator -- Senator,
I want you to respond to

44:32.470 --> 44:36.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that, but I also want
you to -- am I wrong?

44:36.674 --> 44:39.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is it even right to be
describing this as a

44:40.044 --> 44:41.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
matter of race?

44:41.178 --> 44:44.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Yeah, you can,
because African-Americans

44:44.415 --> 44:48.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and Latinos not only
face the general economic

44:48.920 --> 44:53.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
crises of low wages, and
high unemployment, and

44:53.257 --> 44:56.427 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
poor educational
opportunities, but they

44:56.527 --> 44:57.962 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
face other
problems, as well.

44:58.062 --> 45:01.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, yes, we can talk about
it as a racial issue.

45:01.899 --> 45:03.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But it is a general
economic issue.

45:03.401 --> 45:05.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: And here's what
the economic issue is.

45:06.170 --> 45:10.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The wages that high school
graduates receive today

45:10.241 --> 45:12.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are significantly less,
whether you are white or

45:12.343 --> 45:13.611 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
black, than
they used to be.

45:13.711 --> 45:14.912 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why is that?

45:15.012 --> 45:18.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Because of a series of
disastrous trade policies

45:19.083 --> 45:21.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which have allowed
corporate America through

45:21.919 --> 45:24.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NAFTA and Permanent Normal
Trade Relations with

45:24.655 --> 45:27.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
China, Secretary Clinton
and I disagree on those

45:27.358 --> 45:28.025 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

45:28.492 --> 45:31.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But view is those trade
policies have enabled

45:31.362 --> 45:34.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
corporate America to shut
down in this country,

45:34.665 --> 45:36.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
throw millions of people
out on the street.

45:37.034 --> 45:38.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now no one thinks that
working in the factory is

45:38.903 --> 45:40.171 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the greatest job
in the world.

45:40.271 --> 45:43.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you know what, you can
make a middle class wage,

45:43.140 --> 45:45.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you have decent health
care, decent benefits.

45:45.576 --> 45:47.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You once had a pension.

45:47.378 --> 45:49.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Those jobs, in many
cases, are now gone.

45:49.981 --> 45:51.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're off to China.

45:51.682 --> 45:54.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now you are a worker,
white worker, black

45:54.352 --> 45:58.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
worker, who had a decent
job, that manufacturing

45:58.356 --> 45:58.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
job is gone.

45:59.023 --> 45:59.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What have you got now?

45:59.857 --> 46:00.858 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
You are working
at McDonald's?

46:00.958 --> 46:04.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is why there is
massive despair all over

46:04.395 --> 46:05.262 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this country.

46:05.363 --> 46:07.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People have worked
their entire lives.

46:07.665 --> 46:09.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're making a half,
two-thirds what they used

46:09.867 --> 46:10.935 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to make.

46:11.035 --> 46:13.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Their kids are having a
hard time finding any work

46:13.237 --> 46:14.305 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at all.

46:14.405 --> 46:16.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's why this study,
which shows that if you

46:16.841 --> 46:20.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can believe it today, for
white working class people

46:20.444 --> 46:24.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
between 45 and 54, life
expectancy is actually

46:24.782 --> 46:25.449 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going down.

46:26.350 --> 46:31.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Suicide, alcoholism,
drugs, that's why we need

46:31.422 --> 46:33.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to start paying attention
to the needs of working

46:34.091 --> 46:37.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
families in this country,
and not just a handful of

46:37.428 --> 46:39.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
billionaires who have
enormous economic and

46:39.997 --> 46:40.665 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
political power.

46:40.765 --> 46:42.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

46:42.900 --> 46:47.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Thank you.

46:49.373 --> 46:52.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senator Sanders, one of
the causes of anxiety for

46:52.143 --> 46:56.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
working class Americans is
connected to immigrants.

46:56.280 --> 46:58.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President Obama, as you
know, has issued executive

46:58.683 --> 47:01.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
actions to permit some
5 million undocumented

47:01.686 --> 47:04.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
immigrants who are living
now in the United States

47:04.455 --> 47:06.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to come out of the
shadows without fear of

47:06.691 --> 47:08.359 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
deportation to
get work permits.

47:08.893 --> 47:10.628 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Would you go
further than that?

47:10.728 --> 47:14.231 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And if so, how
specifically would you do

47:14.331 --> 47:15.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

47:15.366 --> 47:17.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Should an undocumented
family watching this

47:17.468 --> 47:21.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
debate tonight, say, in
Nevada, rest easy, not

47:21.338 --> 47:23.340 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
fear of further
deportations under a

47:23.441 --> 47:24.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sanders presidency?

47:24.508 --> 47:26.744 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
SANDERS: The
answer is yes.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We've got 11 million
undocumented people in

47:29.447 --> 47:30.881 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this country.

47:30.981 --> 47:34.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have talked to some of
the young kids with tears

47:34.385 --> 47:37.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rolling down their cheeks,
are scared to death that

47:37.221 --> 47:40.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
today they may or their
parents may be deported.

47:42.026 --> 47:45.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I believe that we have
got to pass comprehensive

47:45.863 --> 47:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
immigration reform,
something that I strongly

47:48.933 --> 47:50.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supported.

47:50.468 --> 47:53.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I believe that we have
got to move toward a path

47:54.038 --> 47:55.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
toward citizenship.

47:56.073 --> 47:59.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I agree with President
Obama who used executive

47:59.677 --> 48:04.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
orders to protect families
because the Congress, the

48:04.281 --> 48:07.418 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
House was unable
or refused to act.

48:07.518 --> 48:08.753 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And in fact I
would go further.

48:08.853 --> 48:11.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What would motivate me and
what would be the guiding

48:11.722 --> 48:15.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
light for me in terms of
immigration reform, Judy,

48:15.459 --> 48:19.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is to bring families
together, not divide them

48:19.697 --> 48:20.264 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

48:20.364 --> 48:21.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And let me say this also.

48:21.465 --> 48:23.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Somebody who is very fond
of the president, agrees

48:23.934 --> 48:27.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with him most of the time,
I disagree with his recent

48:27.438 --> 48:29.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deportation policies.

48:29.140 --> 48:31.776 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And I would not
support those.

48:32.076 --> 48:35.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Bottom line is a path
towards citizenship for 11

48:35.746 --> 48:38.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
million undocumented
people, if Congress

48:38.983 --> 48:40.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doesn't do the right
thing, we use the

48:40.751 --> 48:42.286 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
executive orders
of the president.

48:42.386 --> 48:44.054 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

48:44.155 --> 48:50.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: I strongly
support the president's

48:50.694 --> 48:52.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
executive actions.

48:52.296 --> 48:53.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I hope the Supreme
Court upholds them.

48:54.098 --> 48:56.600 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I think there is
constitutional and legal

48:56.700 --> 48:58.469 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
authority for the
president to have done

48:58.569 --> 48:59.236 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what he did.

49:00.004 --> 49:01.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am against the raids.

49:01.705 --> 49:06.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm against the kind of
inhumane treatment that is

49:06.410 --> 49:10.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now being visited upon
families, waking them up

49:10.514 --> 49:12.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the middle of the
night, rounding them up.

49:12.750 --> 49:15.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We should be deporting
criminals, not hardworking

49:15.519 --> 49:18.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
immigrant families who do
the very best they can and

49:18.355 --> 49:21.392 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
often are keeping
economies going in many

49:21.492 --> 49:22.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
places in our country.

49:23.561 --> 49:25.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm a strong supporter of
comprehensive immigration

49:25.963 --> 49:26.864 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reform.

49:26.964 --> 49:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Have been ever since
I was in the Senate.

49:29.133 --> 49:31.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I was one of the original
sponsors of the DREAM Act.

49:31.969 --> 49:34.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I voted for comprehensive
immigration reform in

49:34.138 --> 49:35.139 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2007.

49:35.339 --> 49:37.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senator Sanders voted
against it at that time.

49:38.075 --> 49:40.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Because I think we have
to get to comprehensive

49:40.644 --> 49:42.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
immigration reform with
a path to citizenship.

49:42.613 --> 49:45.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And as president I would
expand enormous energy,

49:45.749 --> 49:48.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
literally call every
member of Congress that I

49:48.152 --> 49:49.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thought I could persuade.

49:49.553 --> 49:52.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hopefully after the 2016
election, some of the

49:52.289 --> 49:54.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans will come to
their senses and realize

49:54.992 --> 49:59.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we are not going to deport
11 or 12 million people in

49:59.463 --> 50:00.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this country.

50:00.598 --> 50:02.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they will work with
me to get comprehensive

50:02.633 --> 50:04.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
immigration reform.

50:04.168 --> 50:05.035 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

50:05.135 --> 50:10.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Secretary
Clinton, I do have a

50:10.341 --> 50:11.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
disagreement here.

50:11.942 --> 50:16.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If my memory is correct, I
think when we saw children

50:16.914 --> 50:20.317 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
coming from these
horrendous, horrendously

50:20.417 --> 50:25.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
violent areas of Honduras
and neighboring countries,

50:25.689 --> 50:28.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people who are fleeing
drug violence and cartel

50:28.559 --> 50:31.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violence, I thought it was
a good idea to allow those

50:31.462 --> 50:33.631 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
children to stay
in this country.

50:33.731 --> 50:35.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was not, as I
understand it, the

50:35.165 --> 50:36.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
secretary's position.

50:36.500 --> 50:40.404 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
In terms of 2007
immigration reform, yeah,

50:40.504 --> 50:41.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I did vote against it.

50:42.039 --> 50:45.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I voted against it because
the Southern Poverty Law

50:45.109 --> 50:47.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Center, among other
groups, said that the

50:47.678 --> 50:52.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
guest-worker programs
that were embedded in this

50:52.783 --> 50:56.287 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
agreement were
akin to slavery.

50:56.387 --> 50:58.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Akin to slavery, where
people came into this

50:58.822 --> 51:04.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
country to do guest
work were abused, were

51:04.628 --> 51:07.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
exploited, and if they
stood up for their rights,

51:07.164 --> 51:08.499 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
they'd be thrown
out of this country.

51:08.933 --> 51:10.367 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
So it wasn't just
me who opposed it.

51:10.467 --> 51:15.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was LULAC, one of the
large Latino organizations

51:15.139 --> 51:16.140 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this country.

51:16.240 --> 51:18.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was the AFL-CIO.

51:18.309 --> 51:20.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was some of the most
progressive members of the

51:20.778 --> 51:23.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
United States Congress
who opposed it for that

51:23.614 --> 51:24.348 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reason.

51:24.448 --> 51:26.583 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But we are where
we are right now.

51:26.684 --> 51:29.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And where we are right now
is we have got to stand up

51:29.787 --> 51:33.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the Trumps of the world
who are trying to divide

51:33.357 --> 51:34.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us up.

51:34.758 --> 51:38.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What we have to do right
now is bring our people

51:38.228 --> 51:41.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
together and understand
that we must provide a

51:41.932 --> 51:44.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
path towards citizenship
for 11 million

51:45.002 --> 51:46.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
undocumented people.

51:46.103 --> 51:47.538 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLINTON: Two
quick responses.

51:47.638 --> 51:51.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One, with respect to the
Central American children,

51:51.275 --> 51:55.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I made it very clear that
those children needed to

51:55.112 --> 51:57.915 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
be processed
appropriately, but we also

51:58.015 --> 52:01.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had to send a message to
families and communities

52:01.485 --> 52:04.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Central America not
to send their children on

52:04.621 --> 52:08.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this dangerous journey in
the hands of smugglers.

52:08.559 --> 52:11.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I've also called for the
end of family detention,

52:11.362 --> 52:14.231 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
for the end of
privately-run detention

52:14.331 --> 52:16.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
centers, along with
private prisons, which I

52:16.667 --> 52:20.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think are really against
the common good and the

52:20.504 --> 52:21.205 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rule of law.

52:21.672 --> 52:25.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And with respect to the
2007 bill, this was Ted

52:25.809 --> 52:26.810 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Kennedy's bill.

52:26.910 --> 52:29.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think Ted Kennedy
had a very clear idea

52:29.446 --> 52:30.681 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
about what needed
to be done.

52:30.781 --> 52:32.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I was proud to stand
with him and support it.

52:32.850 --> 52:33.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

52:35.619 --> 52:36.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: I'd like...

52:36.754 --> 52:37.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Well, let
me just respond.

52:38.088 --> 52:39.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I worked with Ted Kennedy.

52:39.189 --> 52:40.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He was the chairman
of my committee.

52:40.924 --> 52:43.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I loved Ted Kennedy.

52:43.160 --> 52:45.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But on this issue, when
you have one of the large

52:45.763 --> 52:49.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Latino organizations in
America saying vote no,

52:49.233 --> 52:52.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and you have the AFL-CIO
saying vote no, and you

52:52.703 --> 52:55.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have leading progressive
Democrats, in fact, voting

52:55.773 --> 52:58.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
no, I don't apologize
for that vote.

52:58.542 --> 53:00.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But in terms of the
children, I don't know to

53:00.944 --> 53:02.046 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
whom you're
sending a message.

53:02.146 --> 53:04.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Who are you sending
a message to?

53:04.314 --> 53:08.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
These are children who
are leaving countries and

53:08.886 --> 53:12.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
neighborhoods where
their lives are at stake.

53:12.523 --> 53:13.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was the fact.

53:14.058 --> 53:16.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think we use
them to send a message.

53:16.226 --> 53:18.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think we welcome them
into this country and do

53:19.063 --> 53:21.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the best we can to help
them get their lives

53:21.532 --> 53:22.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
together.

53:22.199 --> 53:23.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

53:23.333 --> 53:25.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, that just
wasn't -- that just wasn't

53:25.702 --> 53:26.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the fact, Senator.

53:26.904 --> 53:29.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The fact is that there was
a great effort made by the

53:29.239 --> 53:32.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obama administration and
others to really send a

53:32.743 --> 53:35.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
clear message, because we
knew that so many of these

53:36.013 --> 53:39.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
children were being
abused, being treated

53:39.416 --> 53:42.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
terribly while they tried
to get to our border.

53:43.087 --> 53:44.788 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
So we have a
disagreement on this.

53:44.888 --> 53:47.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think now what I've
called for is counsel for

53:47.858 --> 53:51.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
every child so that no
child has to face any kind

53:52.096 --> 53:55.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of process without someone
who speaks and advocates

53:55.466 --> 53:57.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for that child so that the
right decision hopefully

53:58.035 --> 53:58.602 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can be made.

53:58.702 --> 53:59.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

53:59.803 --> 54:03.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
IFILL: If you would allow
me now to move on, we've

54:03.740 --> 54:06.276 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
been talking
about children.

54:06.376 --> 54:07.311 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I want to talk
about seniors.

54:07.411 --> 54:08.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That takes us to our
second Facebook question

54:08.579 --> 54:09.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from Farheen Hakeem, who
writes, "My father" --

54:09.913 --> 54:11.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she's a 40-year-old woman
who works for a nonprofit

54:11.248 --> 54:12.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here in Milwaukee.

54:12.382 --> 54:13.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she writes, "My father
gets just $16 in food

54:13.517 --> 54:16.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
assistance per month as
part of Medicaid's family

54:16.487 --> 54:21.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
community program in
Milwaukee County for

54:23.627 --> 54:24.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
low-income seniors.

54:24.761 --> 54:28.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How will you as president
work to ensure low-income

54:28.966 --> 54:31.468 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
seniors get their
basic needs met?"

54:31.802 --> 54:34.872 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Start with you,
Senator Sanders.

54:34.972 --> 54:36.473 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SANDERS: OK.

54:36.573 --> 54:40.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know, you judge a
nation not by the number

54:40.944 --> 54:44.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of millionaires and
billionaires it has, but

54:44.148 --> 54:47.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by how you treat, we
treat, the most vulnerable

54:48.018 --> 54:52.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and fragile people
in our nation.

54:52.689 --> 54:54.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And by those standards,
we're not doing

54:54.525 --> 54:55.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
particularly well.

54:55.592 --> 54:58.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: We have the
highest rate of childhood

54:58.295 --> 55:01.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
poverty among almost any
major country on Earth.

55:01.498 --> 55:05.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And in terms of seniors,
there are millions of

55:05.235 --> 55:06.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seniors -- and I've talked
to them in my state of

55:07.070 --> 55:09.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Vermont and all over this
country -- who are trying

55:09.706 --> 55:13.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to get by on $11,000,
$12,000, $13,000 a year

55:13.810 --> 55:15.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Social Security.

55:15.445 --> 55:16.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And you know what?

55:16.747 --> 55:18.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You do the arithmetic.

55:18.248 --> 55:21.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can't get by on
$11,000, $12,000, $13,000

55:21.785 --> 55:22.786 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a year.

55:22.886 --> 55:24.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And here's an area where
Secretary Clinton and I

55:24.154 --> 55:26.223 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
believe we have
a difference.

55:26.323 --> 55:30.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have long supported the
proposition that we should

55:30.260 --> 55:34.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lift the cap on taxable
income coming into the

55:34.364 --> 55:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Social Security Trust
Fund, starting at

55:36.600 --> 55:37.601 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
$250,000.

55:38.135 --> 55:39.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

55:39.303 --> 55:44.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And when we -- and when we
do that, we don't do what

55:44.174 --> 55:46.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Republicans want,
which is to cut Social

55:46.276 --> 55:47.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Security.

55:47.377 --> 55:50.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We do what the American
people want, to expand

55:50.380 --> 55:56.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Social Security by $1,300
a year for people under

55:56.720 --> 56:00.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
$16,000, and we extend the
life of Social Security

56:00.924 --> 56:02.259 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for 58 years.

56:02.359 --> 56:05.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yes, the wealthiest
people, the top 1.5

56:05.729 --> 56:08.699 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
percent, will pay
more in taxes.

56:08.799 --> 56:13.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But a great nation like
ours should not be in a

56:13.103 --> 56:15.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
position where elderly
people are cutting their

56:15.973 --> 56:18.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pills in half, where
they don't have decent

56:19.009 --> 56:21.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
nutrition, where they
can't heat their homes in

56:21.979 --> 56:22.813 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the wintertime.

56:22.913 --> 56:25.782 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
That is not what
America should be about.

56:25.882 --> 56:29.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If elected president, I
will do everything I can

56:29.486 --> 56:32.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to expand Social Security
benefits, not just for

56:32.589 --> 56:35.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seniors, but for disabled
veterans, as well.

56:35.359 --> 56:36.360 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

56:36.460 --> 56:41.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: I think -- I
think it's fair to say we

56:41.898 --> 56:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
don't have a disagreement.

56:43.233 --> 56:45.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We both believe there has
to be more money going

56:45.936 --> 56:47.671 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
into the Social
Security system.

56:47.771 --> 56:50.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I've said I'm looking at a
couple of different ways,

56:50.107 --> 56:53.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one which you mentioned,
Senator, but also trying

56:53.510 --> 56:58.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to expand the existing
tax to passive income that

56:58.782 --> 57:02.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wealthy people have
so that we do get more

57:02.786 --> 57:06.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
revenue into the Social
Security Trust Fund.

57:06.356 --> 57:08.625 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I have a slightly
different approach,

57:08.725 --> 57:10.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
though, about what we
should do with that

57:10.460 --> 57:11.461 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
initially.

57:11.561 --> 57:14.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
First, rather than expand
benefits for everyone, I

57:14.598 --> 57:17.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do want to take care of
low-income seniors who

57:17.234 --> 57:18.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
worked at low-wage jobs.

57:18.969 --> 57:21.538 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I want to take
care of women.

57:21.638 --> 57:25.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
When the Social Security
program was started in the

57:25.175 --> 57:27.678 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
1930s, not very
many women worked.

57:27.778 --> 57:30.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And women have been
disadvantaged ever since.

57:30.514 --> 57:33.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They do not get any credit
for their care-taking

57:33.317 --> 57:34.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
responsibilities.

57:34.418 --> 57:38.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the people who are
often the most hard-hit

57:38.388 --> 57:41.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are widows, because when
their spouse dies, they

57:41.491 --> 57:44.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can lose up to one-half
of their Social Security

57:44.361 --> 57:45.529 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
monthly payment.

57:45.629 --> 57:48.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we have no disagreement
about the need to buttress

57:48.865 --> 57:52.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Social Security, get more
revenue into the program.

57:52.469 --> 57:55.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I want to start by
helping those people who

57:55.305 --> 57:58.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are most at risk, the
ones who, yes, are cutting

57:58.675 --> 58:01.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their pills in half, who
don't believe they can

58:01.278 --> 58:03.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make the rent, who are
worried about what comes

58:04.081 --> 58:04.815 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
next for them.

58:04.915 --> 58:06.249 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
SANDERS: In all
due respect...

58:06.350 --> 58:07.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

58:07.317 --> 58:10.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: In all due
respect, Secretary

58:10.487 --> 58:14.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Clinton, a lot of the
progressive groups, the

58:14.891 --> 58:17.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
online groups have
really asked you a simple

58:17.861 --> 58:18.662 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
question.

58:18.762 --> 58:21.565 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Are you coming
onboard a proposal?

58:21.665 --> 58:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what is that proposal?

58:23.300 --> 58:25.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, the proposal that I
have outlined, you know,

58:26.036 --> 58:28.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
should be familiar to
you, because it is what

58:28.605 --> 58:31.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
essentially Barack Obama
campaigned on in 2008.

58:31.608 --> 58:32.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You opposed him then.

58:33.643 --> 58:36.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I would hope that you
would come onboard and say

58:36.246 --> 58:39.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that this is the simple
and straightforward thing

58:39.416 --> 58:40.450 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do.

58:40.550 --> 58:44.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're asking the top 1.5
percent, including passive

58:44.721 --> 58:48.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
income, to start paying
a little bit more so that

58:48.392 --> 58:52.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the elderly and disabled
vets in this country can

58:52.996 --> 58:54.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
live with security
and dignity.

58:54.798 --> 58:57.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I hope you will make a
decision soon on this.

58:57.100 --> 58:58.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, Senator,
look, I think we're in

58:58.435 --> 58:59.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vigorous agreement here.

58:59.336 --> 59:02.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We both want to get
more revenue in.

59:02.372 --> 59:04.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have yet to see a
proposal that you're

59:04.808 --> 59:06.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
describing that the --
raising the cap would

59:07.077 --> 59:07.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
apply to passive income.

59:07.944 --> 59:08.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That has not been...

59:08.845 --> 59:09.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SANDERS: That's my bill.

59:09.713 --> 59:10.781 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Check it out.

59:10.881 --> 59:13.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, that has
not been a part of most of

59:13.483 --> 59:14.718 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the proposals
that I've seen.

59:14.818 --> 59:18.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm interested in making
sure we get the maximum

59:18.422 --> 59:22.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
amount of revenue from
those who can well afford

59:22.826 --> 59:23.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to provide it.

59:23.994 --> 59:27.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I'm going to come up
with the best way forward.

59:27.631 --> 59:29.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're going to end
up in the same place.

59:29.433 --> 59:30.801 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We're going to
get more revenue.

59:30.901 --> 59:33.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm going to prioritize
those recipients who need

59:34.037 --> 59:35.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the most help first.

59:35.272 --> 59:36.039 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

59:36.139 --> 59:40.644 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
WOODRUFF: We're
going to move on.

59:40.744 --> 59:43.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton, your
campaign has recently

59:43.213 --> 59:45.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ramped up criticism
of Senator Sanders for

59:45.515 --> 59:48.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attending Democratic Party
fundraisers from which you

59:48.485 --> 59:49.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
say he benefited.

59:49.986 --> 59:53.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But nearly half of your
financial sector donations

59:53.723 --> 59:56.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
appear to come from just
two wealthy financiers,

59:56.726 --> 01:00:00.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
George Soros and Donald
Sussman, for a total of

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:01.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about $10 million.

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:04.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: You have said
that there's no quid pro

01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:05.936 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
quo involved.

01:00:06.036 --> 01:00:12.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that also true of the
donations that wealthy

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:16.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans give to
Republican candidates,

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
contributors including
the Koch Brothers?

01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:20.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: I can't speak for
the Koch Brothers, you're

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:24.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
referring to a Super PAC
that we don't coordinate

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:27.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with, that was set up to
support President Obama,

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:30.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that has now decided that
they want to support me.

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:33.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They are the ones who
should respond to any

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:34.397 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
questions.

01:00:34.498 --> 01:00:36.166 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Let's talk about
our campaigns.

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:40.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm very proud of the fact
that we have more than 750

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:44.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thousand donors, and the
vast majority of them are

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:47.744 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
giving small
contributions.

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:50.480 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
So, I'm proud of
Senator Sanders, and his

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.648 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supporters.

01:00:51.748 --> 01:00:55.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think it's great that
Senator Sanders, President

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:59.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obama and I have more
donors than any three

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:01.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people who have every
run, certainly on the

01:01:02.092 --> 01:01:03.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Democratic side.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's the way it should
be, and I'm going to

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
continue to reach out
to thank all my online

01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:11.167 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
contributors for
everything they are doing

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:15.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for me, to encourage them
and help me do more just

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:16.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as Senator Sanders is.

01:01:16.373 --> 01:01:20.510 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I think that is
the real key here.

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:23.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We both have a lot
of small donors.

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:25.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think that sets us
apart from a lot of what's

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:27.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happening right now on
the Republican side.

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:31.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Koch Brothers have
a very clear political

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:32.455 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
agenda.

01:01:32.556 --> 01:01:35.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is an agenda, in my
view, that would do great

01:01:35.926 --> 01:01:37.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
harm to our country.

01:01:37.928 --> 01:01:39.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to fight it as
hard as we can, and we're

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:42.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to fight whoever the
Republicans nominate who

01:01:42.499 --> 01:01:45.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will depend on the Koch
Brothers, and others.

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:46.469 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:49.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: I'm asking if
Democratic donors are

01:01:49.773 --> 01:01:51.808 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
different than
Republican donors.

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:56.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: What we are
talking about in reality

01:01:56.346 --> 01:01:58.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a corrupt campaign
finance system, that's

01:01:58.648 --> 01:01:59.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what we're talking about.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.318 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We have to be
honest about it.

01:02:01.418 --> 01:02:03.687 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
It is undermining
American democracy.

01:02:04.354 --> 01:02:07.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
When extraordinarily
wealthy people make very

01:02:07.257 --> 01:02:11.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
large contributions to
Super PACs, and in many

01:02:11.161 --> 01:02:15.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cases in this campaign,
Super PACs have raised

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:18.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more money than individual
candidates have, OK?

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:21.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We had a decision to make
early on, do we do a Super

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:22.439 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
PAC?

01:02:22.539 --> 01:02:23.607 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And, we said no.

01:02:23.707 --> 01:02:26.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't represent Wall
Street, we don't represent

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:28.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the billionaire class, so
it ends up I'm the only

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:32.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
candidate up here of the
many candidates who has no

01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:34.284 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Super PAC.

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:36.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, what we did is
we said to the working

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:37.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
families of this country,
look, we know things are

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:42.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tough, but if you want
to help us go beyond

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:44.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
establishment politics,
and establishment

01:02:44.628 --> 01:02:47.197 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
economics, send
us something.

01:02:47.297 --> 01:02:49.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, it turns out that
up until -- and this has

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:53.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
blown me away, never in a
million years would I have

01:02:53.336 --> 01:02:55.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believed that I would
be standing here tonight

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:58.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
telling you that we have
received three and a half

01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:02.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
million individual
contributions from well

01:03:02.312 --> 01:03:03.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over a million people.

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:06.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, Secretary Clinton's
Super PAC, as I understand

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:11.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it, received $25 million
dollars last reporting

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:14.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
period, $15 million
dollars from Wall Street.

01:03:14.858 --> 01:03:19.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our average contribution
is $27 dollars, I'm very

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:20.630 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
proud of that.

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:21.631 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:25.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
IFILL: Senator Sanders,
are you saying...

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:30.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: We are mixing
apples and oranges.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:34.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My 750,000 donors have
contributed more than a

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:36.212 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
million and a
half donations.

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:37.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm very proud.

01:03:37.547 --> 01:03:40.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That, I think, between the
two of us demonstrates the

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:44.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
strength of the support we
have among people who want

01:03:44.721 --> 01:03:46.956 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
to see change
in our country.

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:51.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, the real issue, I
think, that the Senator is

01:03:51.361 --> 01:03:54.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
injecting into this is
that if you had a Super

01:03:54.631 --> 01:03:57.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAC, like President Obama
has, which now says it

01:03:58.034 --> 01:03:58.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wants to support me.

01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:01.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not my PAC.

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:05.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you take donations from
Wall Street, you can't be

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:06.242 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
independent.

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:08.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I would just say, I
debated then Senator Obama

01:04:08.645 --> 01:04:13.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
numerous times on stages
like this, and he was the

01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:16.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
recipient of the largest
number of Wall Street

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:19.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
donations of anybody
running on the Democratic

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:20.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
side ever.

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:25.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, when it mattered, he
stood up and took on Wall

01:04:26.096 --> 01:04:27.063 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Street.

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:30.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He pushed through, and
he passed the Dodd-Frank

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:34.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
regulation, the toughest
regulations since the

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:35.972 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1930's.

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:39.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, let's not in anyway
imply here that either

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:45.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama or myself,
would in anyway not take

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:48.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on any vested interested,
whether it's Wall Street,

01:04:48.852 --> 01:04:51.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or drug companies, or
insurance companies, or

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:55.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
frankly, the gun lobby to
stand up to do what's best

01:04:55.258 --> 01:04:57.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the American people.

01:04:57.193 --> 01:04:57.961 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:04:58.061 --> 01:04:59.129 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
SANDERS: The
people aren't dumb.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.297 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Why in God's name
does Wall Street...

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:02.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:05.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But let's not -- but let's
not -- let's not insult --

01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:07.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
let's not insult the
intelligence of the

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:08.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
American people.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:09.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People aren't dumb.

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:12.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why in God's name does
Wall Street make huge

01:05:12.809 --> 01:05:14.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
campaign contributions?

01:05:14.811 --> 01:05:17.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I guess just for the fun
of it; they want to throw

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:17.680 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
money around.

01:05:17.781 --> 01:05:18.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:05:18.715 --> 01:05:21.217 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Why does the
pharmaceutical industry

01:05:21.317 --> 01:05:23.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make huge campaign
contributions?

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:26.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Any connection maybe to
the fact that our people

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:29.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pay the highest prices in
the world for prescription

01:05:29.359 --> 01:05:30.026 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
drugs?

01:05:30.527 --> 01:05:35.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why does the fossil fuel
industry pay -- spend huge

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:38.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
amounts of money on
campaign contributions?

01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:40.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Any connection to the fact
that not one Republican

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:44.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
candidate for president
thinks and agrees with the

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:48.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
scientific community that
climate change is real and

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:51.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we have got to
transform our energy

01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:51.681 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system?

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:52.782 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:05:52.882 --> 01:05:54.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And when we talk about
Wall Street, let's talk

01:05:54.851 --> 01:05:55.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about Wall Street.

01:05:56.019 --> 01:05:58.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I voted for Dodd-Frank,
got an important amendment

01:05:58.321 --> 01:05:59.355 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in it.

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:02.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In my view, it doesn't go
anywhere near far enough.

01:06:02.225 --> 01:06:06.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But when we talk about
Wall Street, you have Wall

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:10.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Street and major banks
have paid $200 billion in

01:06:11.034 --> 01:06:15.238 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
fines since the
great crash.

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:17.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
No Wall Street executive
has been prosecuted.

01:06:17.907 --> 01:06:18.975 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:22.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, let's just
-- let's just follow up on

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:25.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this, because, you know,
I've made it very clear

01:06:25.582 --> 01:06:29.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that no bank is too big
to fail, no executive too

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:33.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
powerful to jail, and
because of Dodd-Frank, we

01:06:33.223 --> 01:06:37.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now have in law a process
that the president, the

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:41.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Federal Reserve, and
others can use if any bank

01:06:41.231 --> 01:06:42.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
poses a systemic risk.

01:06:43.066 --> 01:06:45.034 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I think that's a
major accomplishment.

01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:48.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I agree, however, it
doesn't go far enough,

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:51.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because what it focuses on
are the big banks, which

01:06:51.274 --> 01:06:55.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Sanders has talked
about a lot, for good

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:56.379 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reason.

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:58.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I go further in the plan
that I've proposed, which

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has been called the
toughest, most effective,

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:05.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
comprehensive plan for
reining in the other risks

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:07.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that the financial
system could face.

01:07:07.891 --> 01:07:10.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was an investment bank,
Lehman Brothers, that

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.328 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
contributed to
our collapse.

01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:15.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was a big insurance
company, AIG.

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:17.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was Countrywide
Mortgage.

01:07:17.567 --> 01:07:21.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My plan would sweep all
of them into a regulatory

01:07:22.005 --> 01:07:25.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
framework so we can try to
get ahead of what the next

01:07:25.608 --> 01:07:26.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
problems might be.

01:07:27.243 --> 01:07:30.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I believe that not
only Barney Frank, Paul

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:33.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Krugman, and others, have
said that what I have

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:35.518 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
proposed is the
most effective.

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:37.053 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
It goes in the
right direction.

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:38.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have Dodd-Frank.

01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:41.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We can use it to break
up the banks, if that's

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:42.325 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
appropriate.

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:44.027 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But let's not
kid ourselves.

01:07:44.127 --> 01:07:47.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As we speak, there are new
problems on the horizon.

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:49.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I want to get ahead of
those, and that's why I've

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:51.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
proposed a much more
comprehensive approach to

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:54.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deal with all of these...

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:55.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:56.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:58.341 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
WOODRUFF: We have
to go to a break.

01:07:58.441 --> 01:07:59.409 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
We...

01:07:59.509 --> 01:08:01.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Let me, you
know, again, respectfully

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:02.845 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
disagree with
Secretary Clinton here.

01:08:02.946 --> 01:08:05.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When you have three out of
the four largest financial

01:08:06.015 --> 01:08:09.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
institutions in this
country bigger today than

01:08:09.886 --> 01:08:11.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they were when we bailed
them out because they were

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:14.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
too big to fail, when
you have six financial

01:08:14.691 --> 01:08:18.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
institutions having assets
equivalent to 58 percent

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:22.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the GDP of America,
while issuing two-thirds

01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:25.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the credit cards and
a third of the mortgages,

01:08:25.335 --> 01:08:27.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
look, I think if Teddy
Roosevelt were alive

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:29.439 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
today, that great
trust-buster would have

01:08:29.539 --> 01:08:31.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
said break them up.

01:08:31.507 --> 01:08:33.343 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I think he would
have been right.

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:36.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think he would have said
bring back a 21st-century

01:08:36.646 --> 01:08:38.114 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Glass-Steagall
legislation.

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:39.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think that would have
been right, as well.

01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:40.383 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's my view.

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:41.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:43.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: All right.

01:08:43.386 --> 01:08:44.988 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you both.

01:08:45.088 --> 01:08:47.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is time for a break.

01:08:47.423 --> 01:08:48.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And when we come back,
we're going to turn to

keep America safe.

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:54.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
IFILL: There's a lot more

01:09:24.027 --> 01:09:29.032 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And it is to
Senator Sanders.

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:36.706 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Senator, it comes
from Bill Corfield.

01:09:36.806 --> 01:09:41.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He is a 55-year-old
musician from Troy, Ohio.

01:09:45.782 --> 01:09:48.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he asks: "Are there
any areas of government

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:50.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you would like to reduce?"

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:54.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Hey, I'm in the
United States Senate, and

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:59.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anyone who doesn't think
that there is an enormous

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:01.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
amount of waste and
inefficiency and

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:04.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bureaucracy throughout
government would be very,

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:06.602 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very mistaken.

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:07.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I believe in government,
but I believe in efficient

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.272 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
government, not
wasteful government.

01:10:09.372 --> 01:10:10.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
IFILL: How about you,
Senator Clinton --

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:11.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton?

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:12.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Absolutely.

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:17.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, you know, there are a
number of programs that I

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:45.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think are duplicative
and redundant and not

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:54.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
producing the results
that people deserve.

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:59.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There are a lot of
training programs and

01:10:59.822 --> 01:11:04.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
education programs that I
think can be streamlined

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:14.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and put into a much better
format so that if we do

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:28.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
continue them they can
be more useful, in public

01:11:34.657 --> 01:11:39.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
schools, community
colleges, and colleges and

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:42.965 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
universities.

01:11:43.065 --> 01:11:48.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I would like to take a
hard look at every part of

01:11:57.446 --> 01:12:02.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the federal government
and really do the kind of

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:05.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
analysis that would
rebuild some confidence in

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:09.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people that we're taking
a hard look about what we

01:12:09.926 --> 01:12:13.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have, you know, and what
we don't need anymore.

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:17.099 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And that's what
I intend to do.

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:21.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: If I could just
answer that, we have also

01:12:21.771 --> 01:12:26.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
got to take a look at the
waste and inefficiencies

01:12:26.309 --> 01:12:30.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the Department of
Defense, which is the one

01:12:30.413 --> 01:12:34.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
major agency of government
that has not been able to

01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:35.985 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be audited.

01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:40.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I have the feeling
you're going to find a lot

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:48.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of cost overruns there
and a lot of waste and

01:12:58.307 --> 01:13:01.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
duplicative activities.

01:13:01.344 --> 01:13:02.745 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:07.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
IFILL: We spent the
first part of this debate

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:14.857 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
talking about
domestic insecurity.

01:13:14.957 --> 01:13:19.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The second part, we want
to talk about our foreign

01:13:26.335 --> 01:13:28.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
policy insecurities.

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:33.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we want to start
with a question for you,

01:13:39.949 --> 01:13:44.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton, about
America's role in the

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:48.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:55.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Americans are becoming
increasingly worried that

01:13:55.865 --> 01:14:00.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attacks abroad are coming
home, that they already

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:09.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are, in fact, here.

01:14:09.545 --> 01:14:14.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
According to exit polls
from last week, from

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:23.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
earlier this week, more
than two- thirds of

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:32.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats in New Hampshire
are concerned about

01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:40.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sending their children to
fight in wars they can't

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:46.916 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
win.

01:14:47.016 --> 01:14:52.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They fret that the next
attack is just around the

01:14:58.394 --> 01:15:05.167 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
corner and we
are not ready.

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:07.436 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Are we?

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:12.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Look, I think we
are readier than we used

01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:23.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be, but it's a constant
effort that has to be

01:15:31.394 --> 01:15:36.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
undertaken to make sure we
are as ready as we need to

01:15:45.007 --> 01:15:46.041 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be.

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:51.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have made a lot of
improvements in our

01:15:56.385 --> 01:16:01.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
domestic security since
9/11, and we have been

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:09.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
able to foil and prevent
attacks, yet we see the

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:12.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
terrible attack in San
Bernardino and know that

01:16:12.368 --> 01:16:13.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we haven't done enough.

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:17.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we have to go after
this both abroad and at

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:18.574 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
home.

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:20.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to go after
terrorist networks,

01:16:20.476 --> 01:16:23.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
predominantly ISIS --
that's not the only one,

01:16:23.279 --> 01:16:26.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but let's focus on
that for a minute.

01:16:26.115 --> 01:16:29.185 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We have to lead a
coalition that will take

01:16:29.285 --> 01:16:30.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back territory from ISIS.

01:16:30.686 --> 01:16:33.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is principally an
American-led air campaign

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:35.157 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
that we are
now engaged in.

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:38.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to support the
fighters on the ground,

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:41.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
principally the Arabs and
the Kurds who are willing

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:44.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to stand up and take
territory back from Raqqa

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:45.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Ramadi.

01:16:45.835 --> 01:16:48.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to continue to
work with the Iraqi army

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:52.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so that they are better
prepared to advance on

01:16:53.075 --> 01:16:58.447 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
some of the other
strongholds inside Iraq,

01:16:58.547 --> 01:17:03.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like Mosul, when they
are able to do so.

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:08.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have to cut off the
flow of foreign funding

01:17:08.591 --> 01:17:09.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and foreign fighters.

01:17:09.525 --> 01:17:14.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we have to take
on ISIS online.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:29.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They are a sophisticated
purveyor of propaganda, a

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:50.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
celebrator of violence,
an instigator of attacks

01:18:02.711 --> 01:18:07.783 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
using their
online presence.

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:15.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Here at home, we've
got to do a better job

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:17.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coordinating between
federal, state, and local

01:18:17.493 --> 01:18:18.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
law enforcement.

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:20.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We need the best possible
intelligence not only from

01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:23.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
our own sources, but from
sources overseas, that can

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:28.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be a real-time fusion
effort to get information

01:18:28.137 --> 01:18:29.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
where it's needed.

01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:31.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the final thing I want
to say about this is the

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:32.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
following.

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:36.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know, after 9/11, one
of the efforts that we did

01:18:36.946 --> 01:18:39.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in New York was if you
see something or hear

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:42.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something suspicious,
report it.

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:44.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we need to do that
throughout the country.

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:47.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we need to understand
that American Muslims are

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:50.025 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
on the front line
of our defense.

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:52.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They are more likely to
know what's happening in

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:54.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their families and their
communities, and they need

01:18:55.097 --> 01:19:00.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to feel not just invited,
but welcomed within the

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:01.270 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
American society.

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:03.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So when somebody like
Donald Trump and others...

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:04.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:09.078 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
... stirs up the
demagoguery against

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:16.852 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
American Muslims,
that hurts us at home.

01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:19.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not only offensive;
it's dangerous.

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:21.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the same goes for
overseas, where we have to

01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:24.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
put together a coalition
of Muslim nations.

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:25.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I know how to do that.

01:19:25.327 --> 01:19:27.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I put together the
coalition that imposed the

01:19:27.129 --> 01:19:29.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sanctions on Iran that
got us to the negotiating

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:31.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
table to put a lid on
their nuclear weapons

01:19:31.867 --> 01:19:32.434 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:33.535 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:19:33.636 --> 01:19:35.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And you don't go tell
Muslim nations you want

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:37.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them to be part of a
coalition when you have a

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:41.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leading candidate for
president of the United

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:42.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
States who insults
their religion.

01:19:42.578 --> 01:19:45.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So this has to be looked
at overall, and we have to

01:19:45.314 --> 01:19:47.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
go at it from every
possible angle.

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:50.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IFILL: Senator Sanders...

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:57.359 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
SANDERS: Let me
just say this.

01:19:57.459 --> 01:20:00.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What a president of the
United States has got to

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:04.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do -- and what is his
or her major, I think,

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:06.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
responsibility -- is to,
A, make certain that we

01:20:07.002 --> 01:20:12.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
keep our people safe, that
we work with allies around

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:13.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the world to protect...

01:20:13.409 --> 01:20:14.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
... president of the
United States has got to

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:15.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do, and what is his
or her major, I think,

01:20:16.078 --> 01:20:17.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
responsibility, is to, A,
make certain that we keep

01:20:17.413 --> 01:20:18.347 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our people safe.

01:20:18.447 --> 01:20:19.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That we work with allies
around the world to

01:20:19.415 --> 01:20:20.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
protect democratic values.

01:20:20.616 --> 01:20:21.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That we do all that we can
to create a world of peace

01:20:21.417 --> 01:20:22.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and prosperity.

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:26.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I voted against the war
in Iraq because I listened

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:30.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very carefully to what
President Bush and Vice

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:33.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President Cheney had to
say and I didn't believe

01:20:34.096 --> 01:20:36.198 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:40.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And if you go to my Web
site, berniesanders.com,

01:20:40.769 --> 01:20:42.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what you find is not only
going to help lead the

01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:47.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opposition to that war,
but much of what I feared

01:20:47.643 --> 01:20:50.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would happen when I spoke
on the floor of the House,

01:20:50.612 --> 01:20:54.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in fact, did happen in
terms of the instability

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:54.850 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that occurred.

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:58.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now I think an area in
kind of a vague way, or

01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:00.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not so vague, where
Secretary Clinton and I

01:21:00.823 --> 01:21:05.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
disagree is the area
of regime change.

01:21:05.494 --> 01:21:07.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Look, the truth is that a
powerful nation like the

01:21:07.930 --> 01:21:11.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
United States, certainly
working with our allies,

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:16.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we can overthrow dictators
all over the world.

01:21:16.505 --> 01:21:18.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And God only knows Saddam
Hussein was a brutal

01:21:18.907 --> 01:21:20.008 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dictator.

01:21:20.109 --> 01:21:23.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We could overthrow Assad
tomorrow if we wanted to.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:25.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We got rid of Gadhafi.

01:21:25.647 --> 01:21:29.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the point about
foreign policy is not just

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:31.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to know that you can
overthrow a terrible

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:34.923 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
dictator, it's to
understand what happens

01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:35.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the day after.

01:21:36.925 --> 01:21:40.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in Libya, for example,
the United States,

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:42.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton, as
secretary of state,

01:21:42.798 --> 01:21:44.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
working with some other
countries, did get rid of

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:48.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a terrible dictator
named Gadhafi.

01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:50.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But what happened is
a political vacuum

01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:51.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
developed.

01:21:51.406 --> 01:21:54.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ISIS came in, and now
occupies significant

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:59.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
territory in Libya, and
is now prepared, unless we

01:21:59.515 --> 01:22:03.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stop them, to have a
terrorist foothold.

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:04.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But this is nothing new.

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:08.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This has gone on 50 or
60 years where the United

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:11.660 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
States has been
involved in overthrowing

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:12.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
governments.

01:22:12.628 --> 01:22:14.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mossadegh back in 1953.

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:16.765 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Nobody knows who
Mossadegh was,

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:20.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
democratically-elected
prime minister of Iran.

01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:22.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He was overthrown by
British and American

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:25.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interests because he
threatened oil interests

01:22:25.474 --> 01:22:26.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the British.

01:22:26.809 --> 01:22:29.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And as a result of that,
the shah of Iran came in,

01:22:29.645 --> 01:22:30.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
terrible dictator.

01:22:30.813 --> 01:22:33.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The result of that, you
had the Iranian Revolution

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:35.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coming in, and that
is where we are today.

01:22:35.751 --> 01:22:37.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Unintended consequences.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:42.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I believe as president
I will look very carefully

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:44.226 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
about unintended
consequences.

01:22:44.326 --> 01:22:47.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will do everything I can
to make certain that the

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:49.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
United States and our
brave men and women in the

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:53.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
military do not get bogged
down in perpetual warfare

01:22:53.936 --> 01:22:55.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the Middle East.

01:22:55.237 --> 01:22:56.038 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:22:56.138 --> 01:23:00.609 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLINTON: If I
could just respond.

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:02.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Two points.

01:23:02.277 --> 01:23:07.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One, Senator Sanders voted
in 1998 on what I think is

01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:10.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fair to call a regime
change resolution with

01:23:10.586 --> 01:23:13.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
respect to Iraq, calling
for the end of Saddam

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:14.623 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hussein's regime.

01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:16.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He voted in favor of
regime change with Libya,

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:18.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
voted in favor of the
Security Council being an

01:23:18.894 --> 01:23:22.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
active participate in
setting the parameters for

01:23:22.798 --> 01:23:29.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what we would do, which of
course we followed through

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:30.439 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:34.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I do not believe a vote in
2002 is a plan to defeat

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:36.912 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ISIS in 2016.

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:39.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's very important we
focus on the threats we

01:23:39.882 --> 01:23:43.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
face today, and that we
understand the complicated

01:23:43.919 --> 01:23:45.687 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
and dangerous
world we are in.

01:23:46.188 --> 01:23:50.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
When people go to vote
in primaries or caucuses,

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:52.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they are voting not only
for the president, they

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:54.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are voting for the
commander-in- chief.

01:23:54.463 --> 01:23:57.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's important that
people really look hard at

01:23:58.066 --> 01:24:01.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what the threats and
dangers we face are, and

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:03.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who is best prepared
for dealing with them.

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:06.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
As we all remember,
Senator Obama, when he ran

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:09.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
against me, was against
the war in Iraq.

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:13.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And yet when he won, he
turned to me, trusting my

01:24:13.315 --> 01:24:16.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
judgment, my experience,
to become secretary of

01:24:16.418 --> 01:24:17.419 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
state.

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:18.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I was very honored to be
asked to do that and very

01:24:18.654 --> 01:24:22.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
honored to serve with him
those first four years.

01:24:23.025 --> 01:24:23.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:24:24.092 --> 01:24:29.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Judy, if I can,
there is no question,

01:24:29.464 --> 01:24:31.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton and I
are friends, and I have a

01:24:32.034 --> 01:24:34.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lot of respect for her,
that she has enormous

01:24:34.603 --> 01:24:37.205 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
experience in
foreign affairs.

01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:38.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Secretary of state
for four years.

01:24:38.707 --> 01:24:40.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You've got a bit of
experience, I would

01:24:40.142 --> 01:24:40.809 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
imagine.

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:44.613 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But judgment
matters as well.

01:24:44.713 --> 01:24:47.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judgment matters as well.

01:24:48.016 --> 01:24:50.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And she and I looked at
the same evidence coming

01:24:51.086 --> 01:24:53.355 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
from the Bush
administration regarding

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:54.723 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iraq.

01:24:54.823 --> 01:24:56.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I lead the opposition
against it.

01:24:56.792 --> 01:24:57.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She voted for it.

01:24:57.859 --> 01:24:59.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But more importantly,
in terms of this Libya

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:03.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
resolution that you have
noted before, this was a

01:25:03.565 --> 01:25:05.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:86.67% size:62.5%
virtually
unanimous consent.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:09.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Everybody voted for it
wanting to see Libya move

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:11.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
toward democracy, of
course we all wanted to do

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:12.841 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:14.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: That is very
different than talking

01:25:14.509 --> 01:25:18.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about specific action for
regime change, which I did

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:18.914 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not support.

01:25:19.014 --> 01:25:20.916 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLINTON: You did
support a U.N.

01:25:21.016 --> 01:25:25.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Security Council approach,
which we did follow up on.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, look, I think it's
important to look at what

01:25:28.857 --> 01:25:32.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the most important
counterterrorism judgment

01:25:32.361 --> 01:25:35.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the first four years of
the Obama administration

01:25:35.497 --> 01:25:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was, and that was the very
difficult decision as to

01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:40.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whether or not to advise
the president to go after

01:25:40.535 --> 01:25:41.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bin Laden.

01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:43.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I looked at the evidence.

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:44.773 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I looked at the
intelligence.

01:25:44.873 --> 01:25:45.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I got the briefings.

01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:48.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I recommended that the
president go forward.

01:25:48.844 --> 01:25:50.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a hard choice.

01:25:50.612 --> 01:25:54.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Not all of his top
national security advisors

01:25:55.050 --> 01:25:56.284 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agreed with that.

01:25:56.385 --> 01:25:58.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And at the end of the day,
it was the president's

01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.054 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decision.

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:01.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So he had to leave the
Situation Room after

01:26:01.323 --> 01:26:04.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hearing from the small
group advising him and he

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:06.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had to make that decision.

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:07.929 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I'm proud that I
gave him that advice.

01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:10.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I'm very grateful to
the brave Navy SEALs who

01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:11.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
carried out that mission.

01:26:11.733 --> 01:26:12.601 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:26:12.701 --> 01:26:15.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Judy, one
area very briefly...

01:26:15.637 --> 01:26:17.939 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
WOODRUFF: Just
a final word.

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:20.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Where the
secretary and I have a

01:26:20.242 --> 01:26:23.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very profound difference,
in the last debate -- and

01:26:23.879 --> 01:26:27.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I believe in her book --
very good book, by the way

01:26:27.349 --> 01:26:30.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- in her book and in this
last debate, she talked

01:26:31.053 --> 01:26:34.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about getting the approval
or the support or the

01:26:34.156 --> 01:26:37.959 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
mentoring of
Henry Kissinger.

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:41.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, I find it rather
amazing, because I happen

01:26:41.163 --> 01:26:44.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to believe that Henry
Kissinger was one of the

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:47.502 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
most destructive
secretaries of state in

01:26:47.602 --> 01:26:48.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the modern history
of this country.

01:26:48.937 --> 01:26:49.905 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:26:50.372 --> 01:26:53.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I am proud to say that
Henry Kissinger is not my

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:55.043 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
friend.

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:58.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I will not take advice
from Henry Kissinger.

01:26:58.413 --> 01:27:03.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And in fact, Kissinger's
actions in Cambodia, when

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:05.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the United States bombed
that country, overthrew

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:09.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Prince Sihanouk, created
the instability for Pol

01:27:09.424 --> 01:27:12.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Pot and the Khmer Rouge
to come in, who then

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:16.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
butchered some 3 million
innocent people, one of

01:27:16.131 --> 01:27:18.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the worst genocides in
the history of the world.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So count me in as somebody
who will not be listening

01:27:22.771 --> 01:27:24.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Henry Kissinger.

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:25.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:27:25.774 --> 01:27:27.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IFILL: Secretary Clinton?

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:31.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, I know
journalists have asked who

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:33.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you do listen to on
foreign policy, and we

01:27:33.448 --> 01:27:34.716 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
have yet to know
who that is.

01:27:34.816 --> 01:27:36.051 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
SANDERS: Well, it
ain't Henry Kissinger.

01:27:36.151 --> 01:27:36.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's for sure.

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:37.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: That's fine.

01:27:37.486 --> 01:27:38.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's fine.

01:27:38.186 --> 01:27:39.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:27:39.287 --> 01:27:41.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know, I listen to a
wide variety of voices

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:45.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that have expertise
in various areas.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:48.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it is fair to say,
whatever the complaints

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:51.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that you want to make
about him are, that with

01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:53.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
respect to China, one
of the most challenging

01:27:53.969 --> 01:27:58.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relationships we have, his
opening up China and his

01:27:58.273 --> 01:28:01.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ongoing relationships with
the leaders of China is an

01:28:02.043 --> 01:28:04.980 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
incredibly useful
relationship for the

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:06.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
United States of America.

01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:07.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:28:07.582 --> 01:28:09.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So if we want to pick and
choose -- and I certainly

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:12.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do -- people I listen to,
people I don't listen to,

01:28:12.554 --> 01:28:15.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people I listen to for
certain areas, then I

01:28:15.757 --> 01:28:18.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think we have to be fair
and look at the entire

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:20.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
world, because it's a
big, complicated world out

01:28:20.562 --> 01:28:21.129 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:22.264 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SANDERS: It is.

01:28:22.364 --> 01:28:23.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: And, yes, people
we may disagree with on a

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:26.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
number of things may have
some insight, may have

01:28:26.234 --> 01:28:28.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some relationships that
are important for the

01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:31.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president to understand in
order to best protect the

01:28:31.439 --> 01:28:32.007 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States.

01:28:32.107 --> 01:28:33.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:39.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: I find -- I
mean, it's just a very

01:28:39.714 --> 01:28:41.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
different, you know,
historical perspective

01:28:41.883 --> 01:28:43.051 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:45.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kissinger was one of those
people during the Vietnam

01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:48.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
era who talked about
the domino theory.

01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:50.325 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Not everybody
remembers that.

01:28:50.425 --> 01:28:50.992 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
You do.

01:28:51.092 --> 01:28:52.060 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I do.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The domino theory, you
know, if Vietnam goes,

01:28:54.029 --> 01:28:55.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
China, da, da, da,
da, da, da, da.

01:28:56.097 --> 01:28:58.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's what he talked
about, the great threat of

01:28:58.366 --> 01:28:59.034 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
China.

01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:01.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And then, after the war,
this is the guy who, in

01:29:01.937 --> 01:29:04.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fact, yes, you're right,
he opened up relations

01:29:04.706 --> 01:29:09.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with China, and now pushed
various type of trade

01:29:09.144 --> 01:29:13.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
agreements, resulting in
American workers losing

01:29:13.381 --> 01:29:17.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their jobs as corporations
moved to China.

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:20.155 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
The terrible,
authoritarian, Communist

01:29:20.255 --> 01:29:23.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
dictatorship he warned
us about, now he's urging

01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:26.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
companies to shut down
and move to China.

01:29:26.995 --> 01:29:28.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Not my kind of guy.

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:29.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:29:30.532 --> 01:29:32.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Senator, let
me -- let me move on to

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:33.902 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
another country
with which the U.S.

01:29:34.002 --> 01:29:36.071 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
has a complicated
relationship, Senator

01:29:36.171 --> 01:29:38.039 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Sanders, and
that's Russia.

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:42.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
On the one hand, we're
aware that Russia is a

01:29:42.811 --> 01:29:45.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
country that the United
States needs to cooperate

01:29:45.814 --> 01:29:46.848 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with.

01:29:46.948 --> 01:29:47.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Just tonight,
Secretary of State John

01:29:48.083 --> 01:29:51.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Kerry has announced what
appears to be an agreement

01:29:51.553 --> 01:29:55.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the Russians to lead
-- that could lead toward

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:58.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a ceasefire in Syria,
would be the first

01:29:58.159 --> 01:30:01.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cessation of conflict
in that country, in that

01:30:01.763 --> 01:30:03.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
civil war in five years,
but it comes at a very

01:30:03.498 --> 01:30:06.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
high price, because not
only have all -- have we

01:30:06.401 --> 01:30:09.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seen the deaths, the
removal of so many people,

01:30:09.371 --> 01:30:12.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
millions of people, we now
see the Russians in the

01:30:12.207 --> 01:30:16.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last few weeks have bombed
in a way that benefits

01:30:17.045 --> 01:30:20.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President Assad, has
not gone after ISIS.

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:23.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So my question to you is,
when it comes to dealing

01:30:23.118 --> 01:30:24.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with Russia, are you
prepared -- how hard are

01:30:25.053 --> 01:30:26.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you prepared to be?

01:30:26.655 --> 01:30:29.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are you prepared to
institute further economic

01:30:29.357 --> 01:30:30.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sanctions?

01:30:30.458 --> 01:30:32.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Would you be prepared to
move militarily if Russia

01:30:32.594 --> 01:30:33.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
moves on Eastern Europe?

01:30:33.828 --> 01:30:36.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It seems to me that Russia
recently has gotten the

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:37.666 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
better of the
United States.

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:39.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Well, this
is what I would say.

01:30:40.001 --> 01:30:42.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is a complicated
relationship.

01:30:42.504 --> 01:30:45.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I congratulate Secretary
of State John Kerry and

01:30:45.373 --> 01:30:47.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the president for working
on this agreement.

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:51.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
As you've indicated, what
is happening in Syria, the

01:30:51.346 --> 01:30:53.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
number of people, the
hundreds of thousands of

01:30:53.782 --> 01:30:55.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people who have been
killed -- men, women,

01:30:55.884 --> 01:30:58.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
20,000 children, the
people who are forced to

01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:02.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
flee their own country --
their own country -- it is

01:31:02.424 --> 01:31:03.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unspeakable.

01:31:03.158 --> 01:31:04.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is a real horror.

01:31:04.259 --> 01:31:08.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, what I think is that
right now we have got to

01:31:08.663 --> 01:31:12.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do our best in developing
positive relations with

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:13.034 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Russia.

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:14.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But let's be clear:
Russia's aggressive

01:31:14.936 --> 01:31:19.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
actions in the Crimea and
in Ukraine have brought

01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:23.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about a situation where
President Obama and NATO

01:31:23.211 --> 01:31:25.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- correctly, I believe --
are saying, you know what,

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:29.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we're going to have to
beef up our troop level in

01:31:29.718 --> 01:31:33.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that part of the world
to tell Putin that his

01:31:33.722 --> 01:31:38.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
aggressiveness is not
going to go unmatched,

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:40.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that he is not going to
get away with aggressive

01:31:40.862 --> 01:31:41.529 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
action.

01:31:41.963 --> 01:31:45.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I happen to believe that
Putin is doing what he is

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:48.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doing because his economy
is increasingly in

01:31:48.403 --> 01:31:51.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shambles and he's trying
to rally his people in

01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:53.074 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
support of him.

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:55.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But bottom line is:
The president is right.

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:57.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to put more money.

01:31:57.212 --> 01:32:00.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to work with NATO
to protect Eastern Europe

01:32:00.215 --> 01:32:02.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
against any kind of
Russian aggression.

01:32:02.484 --> 01:32:06.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Well, with
respect to Syria, I really

01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:11.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do appreciate the efforts
that Secretary Kerry has

01:32:11.393 --> 01:32:12.260 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
made.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:15.697 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
The agreement on
humanitarian relief now

01:32:15.797 --> 01:32:19.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
needs to be implemented,
because there are enclaves

01:32:19.567 --> 01:32:22.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that are literally filled
with starving people

01:32:22.437 --> 01:32:24.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
throughout Syria.

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:28.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The agreement on a
cease-fire, though, is

01:32:28.143 --> 01:32:31.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something that has to be
implemented more quickly

01:32:31.513 --> 01:32:33.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than the schedule that
the Russians agreed to.

01:32:33.882 --> 01:32:36.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know, the Russians
wanted to buy time.

01:32:36.785 --> 01:32:39.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are they buying time to
continue their bombardment

01:32:39.354 --> 01:32:42.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on behalf of the Assad
regime to further decimate

01:32:42.857 --> 01:32:46.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what's left of the
opposition, which would be

01:32:46.795 --> 01:32:52.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a grave disservice to
any kind of eventual

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:53.368 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cease-fire?

01:32:53.468 --> 01:32:56.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I know Secretary Kerry
is working extremely hard

01:32:56.771 --> 01:32:59.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to try to move that
cease-fire up as quickly

01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:00.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as possible.

01:33:00.809 --> 01:33:01.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I would add this.

01:33:01.943 --> 01:33:04.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know, the Security
Council finally got around

01:33:04.813 --> 01:33:06.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to adopting a resolution.

01:33:06.347 --> 01:33:08.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
At the core of that
resolution is an agreement

01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:12.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I negotiated in June of
2012 in Geneva, which set

01:33:12.921 --> 01:33:18.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
forth a cease-fire and
moving toward a political

01:33:18.359 --> 01:33:22.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
resolution, trying to
bring the parties at stake

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:23.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Syria together.

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:26.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is incredibly
complicated, because we've

01:33:26.935 --> 01:33:29.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
got Iran as a big player,
in addition to Russia.

01:33:29.971 --> 01:33:32.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have Saudi Arabia,
Turkey, and others who

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:35.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have very important
interests in their view.

01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:37.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is one of the areas
I've disagreed with

01:33:37.745 --> 01:33:39.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senator Sanders on, who
has called for Iranian

01:33:40.081 --> 01:33:41.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
troops trying to end civil
war in Syria, which I

01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:43.084 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
think would be
a grave mistake.

01:33:43.184 --> 01:33:44.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Putting Iranian troops
right on the border of the

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:45.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Golan right next to Israel
would be a nonstarter for

01:33:45.386 --> 01:33:46.321 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

01:33:46.421 --> 01:33:47.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trying to get Iran and
Saudi Arabia to work

01:33:47.489 --> 01:33:48.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
together, as he has
suggested in the past, is

01:33:48.723 --> 01:33:49.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
equally a nonstarter.

01:33:49.824 --> 01:33:50.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So let's support what
Secretary Kerry and the

01:33:50.892 --> 01:33:51.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president are doing, but
let's hope that we can

01:33:52.093 --> 01:33:53.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accelerate the cease-fire,
because I fear that the

01:33:53.428 --> 01:33:54.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russians will continue
their bombing, try to do

01:33:54.762 --> 01:33:55.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
everything they can to
destroy what's left of the

01:33:56.097 --> 01:33:57.131 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
opposition.

01:33:57.232 --> 01:33:58.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And remember, the Russians
have not gone after ISIS

01:33:58.132 --> 01:33:59.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or any of the other
terrorist groups.

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:00.702 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
So as we get a
cease-fire and maybe some

01:34:00.802 --> 01:34:02.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
humanitarian corridors,
that still leaves the

01:34:02.136 --> 01:34:03.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
terrorist groups on the
doorstep of others in

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:04.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Syria, Turkey, Lebanon,
Jordan, and the like.

01:34:04.806 --> 01:34:06.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we've got some real
work to do, and let's try

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:07.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to make sure we actually
implement what has been

01:34:07.575 --> 01:34:08.142 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
agreed to with
the Russians.

01:34:08.243 --> 01:34:09.077 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:34:09.177 --> 01:34:10.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Let me just
-- just say this.

01:34:10.345 --> 01:34:13.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For a start, the secretary
and I disagree -- and I

01:34:13.648 --> 01:34:18.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think the president does
not agree with her -- in

01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:26.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
terms of the concept of
a no-fly zone in Syria.

01:34:31.466 --> 01:34:36.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think you do have a
humanitarian tragedy

01:34:39.274 --> 01:34:46.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there, as I mentioned
a moment ago.

01:34:46.114 --> 01:34:50.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I applaud Secretary Kerry
and the president for

01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:52.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
trying to put together
this agreement.

01:34:52.353 --> 01:34:57.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's hope that it holds.

01:35:06.901 --> 01:35:11.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: But furthermore,
what we have got to do,

01:35:11.606 --> 01:35:14.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm sorry, yes, I do
believe that we have got

01:35:14.576 --> 01:35:17.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to do everything that
we can, and it will not

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:19.480 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happen tomorrow.

01:35:19.581 --> 01:35:22.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I do hope that in
years to come, just as

01:35:22.917 --> 01:35:26.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
occurred with Cuba, 10,
20 years ago, people would

01:35:26.287 --> 01:35:29.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
say, reach normalized
relations with Cuba.

01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:32.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And by the way, I hope we
can end the trade embargo

01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:33.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with Cuba as well.

01:35:33.828 --> 01:35:38.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the idea that we some
day maybe have decent

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:41.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relations with Iran, maybe
put pressure on them so

01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:44.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they end their support
for terrorism around the

01:35:44.906 --> 01:35:46.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
world, yes, that is
something I want to

01:35:46.808 --> 01:35:47.475 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
achieve.

01:35:48.009 --> 01:35:50.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I believe that the
best way to do that is to

01:35:50.378 --> 01:35:53.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be aggressive, to be
principled, but to have

01:35:53.548 --> 01:35:56.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the goal of trying
to improve relations.

01:35:56.818 --> 01:35:59.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's how you make
peace in the world.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:01.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You sit down and you work
with people, you make

01:36:02.056 --> 01:36:07.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
demands of people, in this
case demanding Iran stop

01:36:07.295 --> 01:36:09.330 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the support of
international terrorism.

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:10.264 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:36:10.365 --> 01:36:12.400 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLINTON: Well, I
respectfully disagree.

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:16.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think we have achieved
a great deal with the

01:36:16.671 --> 01:36:19.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Iranian nuclear agreement
to put a lid on the

01:36:19.307 --> 01:36:21.275 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Iranian nuclear
weapons program.

01:36:21.376 --> 01:36:24.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That has to be enforced
absolutely with

01:36:24.212 --> 01:36:28.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
consequences for Iran at
the slightest deviation

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:30.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from their requirements
under the agreement.

01:36:31.219 --> 01:36:33.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I do not think we should
promise or even look

01:36:33.788 --> 01:36:35.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
toward normalizing
relations because we have

01:36:35.857 --> 01:36:38.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a lot of other business
to get done with Iran.

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:40.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yes, they have to stop
being the main state

01:36:41.029 --> 01:36:42.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sponsor of terrorism.

01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:44.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yes, they have to stop
trying to destabilize the

01:36:45.066 --> 01:36:47.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Middle East, causing
even more chaos.

01:36:47.568 --> 01:36:49.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yes, they've got to
get out of Syria.

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:52.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They've got to quit
sponsoring Hezbollah and

01:36:52.173 --> 01:36:53.141 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hamas.

01:36:53.241 --> 01:36:54.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have got to quit
trying to ship rockets

01:36:54.575 --> 01:36:56.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into Gaza that can be
used against Israel.

01:36:56.744 --> 01:36:58.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have a lot of work to
do with Iran before we

01:36:58.913 --> 01:37:01.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ever say that they could
move toward normalized

01:37:01.849 --> 01:37:02.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
relations with us.

01:37:02.917 --> 01:37:03.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:37:03.851 --> 01:37:06.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: We have a
lot of work to do.

01:37:06.721 --> 01:37:08.222 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We have a lot
of work to do.

01:37:08.322 --> 01:37:10.692 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But I recall when
Secretary Clinton ran

01:37:10.792 --> 01:37:14.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
against then-Senator
Obama, she was critical of

01:37:14.195 --> 01:37:16.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
him for suggesting that
maybe you want to talk to

01:37:16.731 --> 01:37:19.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Iran, that you want to
talk to our enemies.

01:37:19.734 --> 01:37:20.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have no illusion.

01:37:20.802 --> 01:37:22.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Of course you are right.

01:37:22.603 --> 01:37:25.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Iran is sponsoring
terrorism in many parts of

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:27.108 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the world,
destabilizing areas.

01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:28.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everybody knows that.

01:37:28.776 --> 01:37:33.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But our goal is, in fact,
to try over a period of

01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:37.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time to, in fact, deal
with our enemies, not just

01:37:37.719 --> 01:37:38.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ignore that reality.

01:37:38.653 --> 01:37:39.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:37:39.721 --> 01:37:40.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: ... Senator
Sanders, from a debate in

01:37:40.788 --> 01:37:43.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
2008, quote what I said.

01:37:43.424 --> 01:37:47.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The question was, would
you meet with an adversary

01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:48.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
without conditions?

01:37:48.529 --> 01:37:49.564 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I said no.

01:37:49.664 --> 01:37:52.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And in fact, in Obama
administration, we did not

01:37:52.467 --> 01:37:54.769 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
meet with anybody
without conditions.

01:37:54.869 --> 01:37:58.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is the appropriate
approach in order to get

01:37:58.372 --> 01:38:00.575 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the results that
you are seeking.

01:38:00.675 --> 01:38:01.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:38:01.809 --> 01:38:04.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: No, I think the
idea was that president --

01:38:04.612 --> 01:38:07.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
then-Senator Obama was
wrong for suggesting that

01:38:07.982 --> 01:38:10.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it is a good idea to
talk to your opponents.

01:38:10.451 --> 01:38:12.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's easier to talk
to your friends.

01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:14.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's harder to talk
to your enemies.

01:38:14.122 --> 01:38:14.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think we should do both.

01:38:15.022 --> 01:38:15.590 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:38:15.690 --> 01:38:16.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IFILL: Let me move on.

01:38:16.858 --> 01:38:20.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have both mentioned
the humanitarian tragedies

01:38:20.361 --> 01:38:21.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which have been an
outgrowth in part of what

01:38:21.829 --> 01:38:23.097 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
has happened in
Syria and in Libya.

01:38:23.197 --> 01:38:24.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
More than a million
refugees entered Europe in

01:38:25.099 --> 01:38:26.167 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2015.

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:30.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Another 76,000 just last
month, that is about 2,000

01:38:30.171 --> 01:38:31.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
arrivals every day.

01:38:32.306 --> 01:38:35.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nearly 400 people have
been lost at sea so far

01:38:35.743 --> 01:38:37.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this year, crossing
the Mediterranean.

01:38:37.779 --> 01:38:40.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And there are reports
that 10,000 children are

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:41.249 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
missing.

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:44.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If we are leaders in this
world, where should the

01:38:44.318 --> 01:38:44.886 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
U.S.

01:38:44.986 --> 01:38:46.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be on this?

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:48.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What should the United
States be doing, Secretary

01:38:48.456 --> 01:38:49.290 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton?

01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:50.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, I was
pleased that NATO

01:38:50.758 --> 01:38:52.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
announced just this week
that they're going to

01:38:53.027 --> 01:38:57.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
start doing patrols in
the Mediterranean, in the

01:38:57.565 --> 01:39:01.936 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Aegean, to try to
interdict the smugglers,

01:39:02.036 --> 01:39:04.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to try to prevent the kind
of tragedies that we have

01:39:04.505 --> 01:39:08.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seen all too often, also
to try to prevent more

01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:12.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
refugees from coming
to the European Union.

01:39:12.413 --> 01:39:14.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's especially
significant that they are

01:39:14.849 --> 01:39:17.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
working with both Turkey
and Greece in order to do

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:18.820 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:20.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
With respect to the United
States, I think our role

01:39:20.922 --> 01:39:24.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in NATO, our support for
the E.U., as well as our

01:39:24.325 --> 01:39:26.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
willingness to take
refugees so long as they

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:30.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are thoroughly vetted and
that we have confidence

01:39:30.264 --> 01:39:33.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from intelligence and
other sources that they

01:39:33.835 --> 01:39:36.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can come to our country,
we should be doing our

01:39:37.071 --> 01:39:38.072 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
part.

01:39:38.172 --> 01:39:40.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we should back up the
recent donors conference

01:39:40.608 --> 01:39:43.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to make sure we have made
our contribution to try to

01:39:43.978 --> 01:39:48.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
deal with the enormous
cost that these refugees

01:39:48.850 --> 01:39:53.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are posing to Turkey and
to members of the E.U.

01:39:53.221 --> 01:39:54.155 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in particular.

01:39:54.255 --> 01:39:56.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: This is a
humanitarian catastrophe.

01:39:57.091 --> 01:40:00.595 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
There is no other
description of it.

01:40:00.695 --> 01:40:03.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we do as the United
States have to support our

01:40:03.397 --> 01:40:06.067 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
friends, our
allies in Europe.

01:40:06.167 --> 01:40:07.401 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We have to
stand with them.

01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:10.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to provide
financial support to them.

01:40:10.137 --> 01:40:13.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to provide the
NATO support to back up

01:40:13.407 --> 01:40:14.575 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the mission that
is going on.

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:17.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we have to take
properly vetted refugees

01:40:17.612 --> 01:40:18.713 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ourselves.

01:40:18.813 --> 01:40:21.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SANDERS: A couple of years
ago, I had the opportunity

01:40:21.649 --> 01:40:24.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to go on a congressional
delegation.

01:40:25.086 --> 01:40:29.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I went to one of these
Turkish refugee camps

01:40:29.323 --> 01:40:30.358 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
right on the
border of Syria.

01:40:30.458 --> 01:40:36.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And what a sad sight that
was: Men, women, children

01:40:36.464 --> 01:40:38.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
forced out of their homes.

01:40:38.633 --> 01:40:41.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Turkey, by the way,
did a very decent thing,

01:40:41.736 --> 01:40:44.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
providing what was
reasonable housing and

01:40:44.805 --> 01:40:46.807 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
conditions for
those people.

01:40:47.975 --> 01:40:52.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It seems to me that given
our history as a nation

01:40:52.914 --> 01:40:56.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that has been a beacon of
hope for the oppressed,

01:40:56.684 --> 01:41:00.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the downtrodden, that
I very strongly disagree

01:41:01.022 --> 01:41:02.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with those Republican
candidates who say, you

01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:06.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
know what, we've got to
turn our backs on women

01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:09.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and children who left
their home with nothing,

01:41:09.664 --> 01:41:10.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nothing at all.

01:41:10.865 --> 01:41:13.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is not what America
is supposed to be about.

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:17.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I believe that working
with Europe -- and, by the

01:41:17.104 --> 01:41:19.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
way, you know, we've
got some very wealthy

01:41:19.507 --> 01:41:21.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
countries there in
that part of the world.

01:41:21.876 --> 01:41:25.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You got Kuwait and you got
Qatar and you got Saudi

01:41:25.379 --> 01:41:26.180 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Arabia.

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.149 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
They have a
responsibility, as well.

01:41:28.849 --> 01:41:32.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think this is a
worldwide -- that the

01:41:32.687 --> 01:41:36.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entire world needs to come
together to deal with this

01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:40.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
horrific refugee crisis
we're seeing from Syria

01:41:40.428 --> 01:41:41.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Afghanistan, as well.

01:41:41.529 --> 01:41:44.498 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:41:44.598 --> 01:41:49.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: And we have a
final question from our

01:41:50.071 --> 01:41:51.505 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Facebook family.

01:41:51.605 --> 01:41:54.275 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And it goes to
Senator Sanders.

01:41:54.375 --> 01:41:56.777 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
It comes from
Robert Andrews.

01:41:56.877 --> 01:42:00.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's a 40-year-old
stay-at-home dad in Dover,

01:42:00.414 --> 01:42:01.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Massachusetts.

01:42:01.582 --> 01:42:03.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He says, "The world has
seen many great leaders in

01:42:03.351 --> 01:42:05.119 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the course of
human history.

01:42:05.219 --> 01:42:08.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Can you name two leaders
-- one American and one

01:42:08.556 --> 01:42:11.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
foreign -- who would
influence your foreign

01:42:11.125 --> 01:42:12.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
policy decisions?

01:42:12.426 --> 01:42:14.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And why do you see
them as -- why are they

01:42:14.562 --> 01:42:16.263 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
influential?"

01:42:16.364 --> 01:42:20.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: You know,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt

01:42:22.436 --> 01:42:28.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
took the oath of office
in 1933 at a time when 25

01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:32.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
percent of the American
people were unemployed,

01:42:32.346 --> 01:42:34.148 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
country was in
incredible despair.

01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:36.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he stood before the
American people and he

01:42:36.851 --> 01:42:41.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said, "The only thing
we have to fear is fear

01:42:41.489 --> 01:42:46.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
itself," a profound
statement that gave the

01:42:46.761 --> 01:42:49.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
American people the
courage to believe that,

01:42:50.031 --> 01:42:54.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
yes, we could get out of
that terrible depression.

01:42:55.102 --> 01:42:58.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And then what he did
is redefine the role of

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:00.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

01:43:00.207 --> 01:43:01.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know, you had Herbert
Hoover before that saying,

01:43:01.942 --> 01:43:03.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
no, we got to only
worry about the deficit.

01:43:03.944 --> 01:43:05.913 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
So what if mass
unemployment exists?

01:43:06.013 --> 01:43:07.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So what if children
are going hungry?

01:43:07.848 --> 01:43:09.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's not the role
of the government.

01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:13.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And when FDR said, "Yeah,
it is," that we're going

01:43:13.587 --> 01:43:16.257 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
to use all of the
resources that we have to

01:43:16.357 --> 01:43:20.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
create jobs, to build
homes, to feed people, to

01:43:20.795 --> 01:43:24.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
protect the farmers, we
are a nation which if we

01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:28.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
come together there is
nothing that we could not

01:43:28.736 --> 01:43:29.403 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
accomplish.

01:43:30.137 --> 01:43:32.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And kind of -- that's
what I see our campaign is

01:43:32.973 --> 01:43:34.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about right now.

01:43:34.608 --> 01:43:38.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In this particular moment
of serious crises, saying

01:43:38.212 --> 01:43:40.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the American people
don't give up on the

01:43:40.648 --> 01:43:41.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political process.

01:43:41.949 --> 01:43:44.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't listen to the Trumps
of the world and allowing

01:43:44.385 --> 01:43:45.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them to divide us.

01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:50.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If we reengage and get
involved, yeah, we can

01:43:50.224 --> 01:43:53.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have health care for all
people, we can make public

01:43:53.928 --> 01:43:56.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
colleges and universities
tuition-free.

01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:59.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We do not have to have
massive levels of income

01:43:59.133 --> 01:44:00.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and wealth inequality.

01:44:00.267 --> 01:44:02.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In the same light, as the
foreign leader, Winston

01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:05.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Churchill's politics
were not my politics.

01:44:05.406 --> 01:44:07.441 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
He was kind of a
conservative guy in many

01:44:07.541 --> 01:44:08.542 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
respects.

01:44:08.642 --> 01:44:13.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But nobody can deny that
as a wartime leader, he

01:44:13.214 --> 01:44:16.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rallied the British people
when they stood virtually

01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:20.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
alone against the Nazi
juggernaut and rallied

01:44:20.187 --> 01:44:23.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them and eventually won
an extraordinary victory.

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:25.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Those are two leaders
that I admire very much.

01:44:25.192 --> 01:44:26.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:44:26.293 --> 01:44:30.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: I certainly
agree with FDR for all the

01:44:34.735 --> 01:44:36.070 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
reasons Senator
Sanders said.

01:44:36.170 --> 01:44:40.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I agree about the role
that he played both in war

01:44:40.841 --> 01:44:44.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and in peace on the
economy and defeating

01:44:44.345 --> 01:44:46.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fascism around the world.

01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:48.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I would choose Nelson
Mandela for his generosity

01:44:48.849 --> 01:44:51.152 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
of heart, his
understanding of the need

01:44:51.252 --> 01:44:52.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for reconciliation.

01:44:52.419 --> 01:44:55.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: But I want to
-- I want to follow up on

01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:57.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something having to do
with leadership, because,

01:44:58.058 --> 01:45:00.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you know, today Senator
Sanders said that

01:45:00.694 --> 01:45:03.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama failed the
presidential leadership

01:45:04.031 --> 01:45:04.965 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
test.

01:45:05.065 --> 01:45:06.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this is not the
first time that he has

01:45:06.567 --> 01:45:09.136 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
criticized
President Obama.

01:45:09.236 --> 01:45:10.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In the past he has
called him weak.

01:45:10.604 --> 01:45:12.006 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
He has called him
a disappointment.

01:45:12.106 --> 01:45:17.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He wrote a forward for a
book that basically argued

01:45:17.545 --> 01:45:20.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voters should have buyers'
remorse when it comes to

01:45:20.648 --> 01:45:23.384 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
President Obama's
leadership and legacy.

01:45:23.851 --> 01:45:26.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I just couldn't agree
-- disagree more with

01:45:27.021 --> 01:45:29.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those kinds of comments.

01:45:29.557 --> 01:45:31.659 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
You know, from my
perspective, maybe because

01:45:31.759 --> 01:45:35.729 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I understand what
President Obama inherited,

01:45:35.829 --> 01:45:38.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not only the worst
financial crisis but the

01:45:38.465 --> 01:45:41.669 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
antipathy of the
Republicans in Congress, I

01:45:41.769 --> 01:45:44.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
don't think he gets the
credit he deserves for

01:45:44.371 --> 01:45:45.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
being a president...

01:45:45.873 --> 01:45:46.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:45:46.807 --> 01:45:48.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: ... who got
us out of that...

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:49.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:45:49.944 --> 01:45:52.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: ... put us on
firm ground, and has sent

01:45:52.446 --> 01:45:53.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
us into the future.

01:45:53.781 --> 01:45:57.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it is a -- the kind of
criticism that we've heard

01:45:57.718 --> 01:46:00.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Senator Sanders about
our president I expect

01:46:00.621 --> 01:46:01.589 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Republicans.

01:46:01.689 --> 01:46:03.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I do not expect from
someone running for the

01:46:04.058 --> 01:46:06.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democratic nomination to
succeed President Obama.

01:46:06.727 --> 01:46:09.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SANDERS: That is...

01:46:09.463 --> 01:46:10.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:46:10.564 --> 01:46:15.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Madam Secretary,
that is a low blow.

01:46:15.603 --> 01:46:18.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have worked with
President Obama for the

01:46:18.205 --> 01:46:20.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last seven years.

01:46:20.574 --> 01:46:23.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
When President Obama came
into office we were losing

01:46:23.177 --> 01:46:28.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
800,000 jobs a month,
800,000 jobs a month.

01:46:28.616 --> 01:46:31.051 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We had a $1.4
trillion deficit.

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:33.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the world's financial
system is on the verge of

01:46:33.988 --> 01:46:35.022 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
collapse.

01:46:35.122 --> 01:46:37.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As a result of his efforts
and the efforts of Joe

01:46:37.391 --> 01:46:40.194 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Biden against
unprecedented, I was there

01:46:40.294 --> 01:46:43.364 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
in the Senate,
unprecedented Republican

01:46:43.464 --> 01:46:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
obstructionism, we have
made enormous progress.

01:46:47.001 --> 01:46:47.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:46:47.735 --> 01:46:48.936 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
SANDERS: But
you know what?

01:46:49.036 --> 01:46:50.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Last I heard we lived
in a democratic society.

01:46:50.904 --> 01:46:53.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Last I heard, a United
States senator had the

01:46:53.607 --> 01:46:54.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
right to disagree with
the president, including a

01:46:54.975 --> 01:46:56.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president who has done
such an extraordinary job.

01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.877 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
So I have voiced
criticisms.

01:46:56.977 --> 01:46:57.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're right.

01:46:57.645 --> 01:46:58.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Maybe you haven't.

01:46:58.312 --> 01:46:59.213 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I have.

01:46:59.313 --> 01:47:00.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think to suggest
that I have voiced

01:47:00.447 --> 01:47:01.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
criticism, this blurb that
you talk about, you know

01:47:01.649 --> 01:47:02.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what the blurb said?

01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:03.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The blurb said that the
next president of the

01:47:03.851 --> 01:47:04.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
United States has got to
be aggressive in bringing

01:47:05.019 --> 01:47:06.253 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
people into the
political process.

01:47:06.353 --> 01:47:06.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what I said.

01:47:07.021 --> 01:47:07.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is what I believe.

01:47:07.755 --> 01:47:08.656 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:47:08.756 --> 01:47:09.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: President
Obama and I are friends.

01:47:09.923 --> 01:47:10.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
As you know, he came to
Vermont to campaign for me

01:47:11.091 --> 01:47:11.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when he was a senator.

01:47:11.925 --> 01:47:13.027 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I have worked for
his re-election.

01:47:13.127 --> 01:47:14.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His first election
and his re-election.

01:47:14.461 --> 01:47:15.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think it is really
unfair to suggest that I

01:47:15.796 --> 01:47:20.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have not been supportive
of the president.

01:47:46.927 --> 01:47:50.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have been a strong ally
with him on virtually

01:47:50.364 --> 01:47:51.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every issue.

01:47:51.465 --> 01:47:53.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do senators have the
right to disagree with the

01:47:54.068 --> 01:47:54.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president?

01:47:55.069 --> 01:47:57.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Have you ever disagreed
with a president?

01:47:57.771 --> 01:47:58.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I suspect you may have.

01:47:59.039 --> 01:47:59.873 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:47:59.973 --> 01:48:02.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: You know,
Senator, what I am

01:48:02.576 --> 01:48:05.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
concerned about, is not
disagreement on issues,

01:48:05.479 --> 01:48:08.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying that this is what
I would rather do, I don't

01:48:08.282 --> 01:48:10.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
agree with the president
on that, calling the

01:48:10.217 --> 01:48:13.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president weak, calling
him a disappointment,

01:48:13.253 --> 01:48:16.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
calling several times that
he should have a primary

01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:21.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opponent when he ran for
re-election in 2012, you

01:48:21.729 --> 01:48:24.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
know, I think that goes
further than saying we

01:48:24.231 --> 01:48:25.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have our disagreements.

01:48:25.566 --> 01:48:28.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
As a senator, yes,
I was a senator.

01:48:28.369 --> 01:48:30.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I understand we can
disagree on the path

01:48:31.071 --> 01:48:31.972 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forward.

01:48:32.072 --> 01:48:35.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But those kinds of
personal assessments and

01:48:35.876 --> 01:48:39.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
charges are ones that
I find particularly

01:48:39.713 --> 01:48:40.748 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
troubling.

01:48:40.848 --> 01:48:43.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
IFILL: Senator, if you
would like respond to --

01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:44.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you may respond to that
but it is time for closing

01:48:44.585 --> 01:48:45.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
statements and you can
use your time for closing

01:48:45.919 --> 01:48:46.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
statements to do that.

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:49.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Well, one of us
ran against Barack Obama.

01:48:49.390 --> 01:48:50.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was not that candidate.

01:48:50.557 --> 01:48:51.558 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:48:51.658 --> 01:48:57.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: All right, look,
this has been a great

01:48:57.631 --> 01:48:58.632 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debate.

01:48:58.732 --> 01:49:02.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A lot of interesting
issues have come together.

01:49:02.436 --> 01:49:07.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let me conclude by
just saying this.

01:49:10.711 --> 01:49:13.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is no president,
in my view, not Hillary

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:16.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Clinton, not Bernie
Sanders, who has the

01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:21.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
capability or the power to
take on Wall Street, large

01:49:21.555 --> 01:49:26.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
campaign donors, the
corporate media, the big

01:49:26.293 --> 01:49:28.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
money interests in
this country alone.

01:49:29.630 --> 01:49:32.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This campaign is not
just about electing a

01:49:33.033 --> 01:49:34.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

01:49:34.401 --> 01:49:38.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What this campaign is
about is creating a

01:49:38.605 --> 01:49:42.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
process for a political
revolution in which

01:49:42.643 --> 01:49:46.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
millions of Americans,
working people who have

01:49:46.146 --> 01:49:48.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
given up on the political
process, they don't think

01:49:48.715 --> 01:49:51.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anybody hears their
pains or their concerns.

01:49:51.852 --> 01:49:54.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Young people for whom
getting involved in

01:49:54.455 --> 01:49:57.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
politics is as, you know,
it's like going to the

01:49:58.025 --> 01:49:58.592 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
moon.

01:49:58.692 --> 01:49:59.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It ain't going to happen.

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:02.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Low income people who
are not involved in the

01:50:02.429 --> 01:50:03.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political process.

01:50:03.497 --> 01:50:06.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SANDERS: What this
campaign is not only about

01:50:06.733 --> 01:50:08.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
electing someone who
has the most progressive

01:50:08.936 --> 01:50:12.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
agenda, it is about
bringing tens of millions

01:50:12.439 --> 01:50:15.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of people together to
demand that we have a

01:50:15.676 --> 01:50:20.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government that represents
all of us and not just the

01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:24.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
1 percent, who today
have so much economic and

01:50:24.151 --> 01:50:24.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
political power.

01:50:24.985 --> 01:50:29.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you all very much.

01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:29.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:50:30.023 --> 01:50:32.426 align:left position:37.5%,start line:86.67% size:62.5%
WOODRUFF:
Secretary Clinton?

01:50:32.526 --> 01:50:37.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: You know, we --
we agree that we've got to

01:50:39.833 --> 01:50:41.735 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
get unaccountable
money out of politics.

01:50:41.835 --> 01:50:44.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We agree that Wall Street
should never be allowed to

01:50:45.038 --> 01:50:46.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wreck Main Street again.

01:50:46.907 --> 01:50:50.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But here's the point I
want to make tonight.

01:50:50.177 --> 01:50:52.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I am not a single- issue
candidate, and I do not

01:50:52.913 --> 01:50:56.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believe we live in a
single-issue country.

01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:59.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that a lot of what
we have to overcome to

01:50:59.353 --> 01:51:01.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
break down the barriers
that are holding people

01:51:01.622 --> 01:51:05.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
back, whether it's poison
in the water of the

01:51:05.526 --> 01:51:08.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
children of Flint, or
whether it's the poor

01:51:09.062 --> 01:51:12.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
miners who are being left
out and left behind in

01:51:12.266 --> 01:51:16.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coal country, or whether
it is any other American

01:51:16.436 --> 01:51:21.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
today who feels somehow
put down and oppressed by

01:51:21.608 --> 01:51:25.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
racism, by sexism, by
discrimination against the

01:51:25.178 --> 01:51:30.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LGBT community, against
the kind of efforts that

01:51:30.217 --> 01:51:33.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
need to be made to root
out all of these barriers,

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:35.322 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
that's what I
want to take on.

01:51:35.422 --> 01:51:38.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And here in Wisconsin, I
want to reiterate: We've

01:51:38.959 --> 01:51:42.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
got to stand up for unions
and working people who

01:51:42.563 --> 01:51:46.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have done it before...

01:51:46.133 --> 01:51:46.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:51:47.267 --> 01:51:50.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
... the American middle
class, and who are being

01:51:50.571 --> 01:51:52.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attacked by ideologues,
by demagogues.

01:51:52.773 --> 01:51:55.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yes, does Wall Street and
big financial interests,

01:51:55.475 --> 01:51:58.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
along with drug companies,
insurance companies, big

01:51:58.612 --> 01:52:00.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
oil, all of it, have
too much influence?

01:52:01.048 --> 01:52:01.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're right.

01:52:02.382 --> 01:52:05.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But if we were to stop
that tomorrow, we would

01:52:05.852 --> 01:52:07.721 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
still have the
indifference, the

01:52:07.821 --> 01:52:10.691 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
negligence that
we saw in Flint.

01:52:10.791 --> 01:52:14.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We would still have racism
holding people back.

01:52:14.161 --> 01:52:16.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We would still have sexism
preventing women from

01:52:16.730 --> 01:52:18.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
getting equal pay.

01:52:18.198 --> 01:52:21.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We would still have LGBT
people who get married on

01:52:21.902 --> 01:52:24.237 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Saturday and get
fired on Monday.

01:52:24.338 --> 01:52:26.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we would still have
governors like Scott

01:52:26.473 --> 01:52:29.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Walker and others trying
to rip out the heart of

01:52:29.509 --> 01:52:32.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
