In the day's other news: The
U.S., Japan and South Korea
have agreed to apply -- quote

00:05.233 --> 00:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - "maximum pressure" after
North Korea's intercontinental
ballistic missile test.

00:09.733 --> 00:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a joint statement, they
said they will push for a U.N.
Security Council resolution

00:14.533 --> 00:17.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to apply new sanctions
on Pyongyang.

00:17.633 --> 00:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if the North -- quote
-- "chooses the right path,"
the countries stand ready to

00:22.133 --> 00:24.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
offer a brighter future.

00:24.066 --> 00:27.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Experts believe the
missile launched Tuesday
could reach Alaska.

state TV broadcast a
message aimed at the U.S.

00:34.933 --> 00:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
North Korea makes it clear once
again that its development of

00:40.566 --> 00:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an intercontinental
ballistic rocket is an option
taken to defend itself.

00:44.166 --> 00:48.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The test is a gift
package addressed to
none other than the U.S.

00:48.700 --> 00:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. will receive more gift
packages as it tries harder to
destroy, by means of sanctions

00:55.700 --> 00:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and pressure, the overall
national power and strategic
position of North Korea.

00:58.800 --> 01:03.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
U.S./Japan/South Korea
statement also called
on nations that border

01:03.300 --> 01:05.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
North Korea to help
reduce the threat.

01:05.900 --> 01:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is an unmistakable
reference to Pyongyang's
closest ally, China, whose
leader meets tomorrow

01:11.833 --> 01:14.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with President Trump.

01:14.466 --> 01:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump also met today
with Mexico's President
Enrique Pena Nieto, and
emphasized the importance

01:19.966 --> 01:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of renegotiating the
NAFTA trade agreement.

01:22.466 --> 01:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was the first face-to-face
meeting between the pair since
President Trump took office.

01:27.366 --> 01:32.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He hailed Pena Nieto
as his friend, but said
that he absolutely still
wants Mexico to pay

01:33.833 --> 01:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a proposed border wall
between the two countries.

01:37.833 --> 01:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Egypt, a suicide car bombing
left at least 23 soldiers dead
on the Sinai Peninsula, the

01:44.000 --> 01:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
worst attack there in years.

01:46.400 --> 01:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Islamic State group claimed
responsibility for the incident
at a checkpoint south of

01:51.133 --> 01:53.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Rafah.

01:53.133 --> 01:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Iraq, ISIS
fighters are still clinging to
a shrinking pocket of territory

01:57.766 --> 01:59.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Mosul.

01:59.066 --> 02:01.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Iraqi government forces
laid out the difficulty.

02:01.266 --> 02:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ABDUL WAHAB AL-SAADI,
Iraqi Lieutenant General
(through translator):
We are facing challenges

02:04.200 --> 02:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that slow down our operations.

02:06.433 --> 02:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's because the Islamic
State group is using civilians
as human shields, especially

02:12.166 --> 02:14.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
children and women.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why we advance
very slowly, because we
have to protect their lives.

02:16.266 --> 02:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also today, the
Pentagon said that airstrikes
by the U.S.-led coalition

02:20.333 --> 02:25.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in Iraq and Syria have
killed a total of more
than 600 civilians.

02:26.766 --> 02:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is since the start of the
anti-ISIS campaign in 2014.

02:30.900 --> 02:35.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Back in this country,
hiring surged more
than expected in June.

02:35.266 --> 02:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Labor Department says
U.S. employers added 222,000
jobs, the most in four months.

02:42.333 --> 02:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the unemployment rate ticked
up slightly, from 4.3 percent
to 4.4 percent, as more people

02:49.100 --> 02:51.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
looked for work.

02:51.166 --> 02:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Analysts say the positive report
is likely to lead to another
hike in the Federal Reserve's

02:56.433 --> 02:58.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
key interest rate.

02:58.100 --> 03:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For now, that news drove

the S&amp;P 500 added 15.

03:13.166 --> 03:17.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%

indexes edged up a
fraction of a percent.

03:17.333 --> 03:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. Attorney General Jeff
Sessions visited the military
prison at Guantanamo Bay today.

03:24.233 --> 03:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was joined by Deputy Attorney
General Rod Rosenstein, and
by Dan Coats, the director

03:29.166 --> 03:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of national intelligence.

03:31.166 --> 03:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sessions has called Guantanamo
a -- quote - - "perfectly
acceptable place" for detaining

03:36.400 --> 03:38.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
terror suspects.

03:38.500 --> 03:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Justice Department spokesman
said that the visit was meant to
get an up-to-date understanding

03:42.833 --> 03:44.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of current operations.

03:44.866 --> 03:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And an influential press
freedom group is criticizing a
report by Republican senators

03:50.800 --> 03:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about leaks of
government information.

03:53.466 --> 03:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The document released yesterday
which was sent to the attorney
general says that leaks

03:58.000 --> 04:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are harming national security.

04:00.400 --> 04:04.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Committee to Protect
Journalists said it
seems intended to have
a chilling effect,

04:04.966 --> 04:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and resembles measures seen
-- quote -- "more often in
authoritarian countries."
