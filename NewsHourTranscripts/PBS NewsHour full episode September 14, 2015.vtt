WEBVTT

00:06.106 --> 00:09.643
GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill. Judy Woodruff is
away.

00:09.643 --> 00:14.848
Tonight on the "NewsHour":
Explosive wildfires rage out of
control in California, forcing

00:14.848 --> 00:20.120
thousands to flee, and scorching
entire blocks of homes.

00:20.120 --> 00:24.992
Also ahead: European governments
gather to grapple with the
refugee crisis. As thousands

00:24.992 --> 00:30.163
more continue to flood the
borders, some countries begin to
set new limits.

00:30.163 --> 00:35.202
Plus, Miles O'Brien reports on
the race to find an Ebola
vaccine, this time to save the

00:35.202 --> 00:38.572
lives of gorillas
and chimpanzees.

00:38.572 --> 00:43.110
PETER WALSH, University of
Cambridge: I don't really like
to see chimps in a cage. It kind

00:43.110 --> 00:48.282
of upsets me a little bit. But I
weigh the individual welfare of
those chimpanzees against

00:48.282 --> 00:50.817
the survival of
wild chimpanzees.

00:50.817 --> 00:56.023
GWEN IFILL: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:56.023 --> 01:00.027
(BREAK)

01:00.027 --> 01:11.305
GWEN IFILL: A firestorm roared
across Northern California
today, leaving at least 400
homes

01:11.305 --> 01:17.945
in ruins and one person dead.
The Valley Fire has swept across
95 square miles north of

01:17.945 --> 01:25.185
the Napa Valley region. And
southeast of Sacramento, the
Butte Fire has burned another
135 homes.

01:25.185 --> 01:28.488
Between them, the two fires have
forced 23,000 people out of
their homes, and left crews

01:28.488 --> 01:32.125
struggling to hold the line.

01:32.125 --> 01:38.465
Middletown, California was an
ashy, gray ghost town today. The
Valley Fire that exploded

01:38.465 --> 01:43.003
over the weekend didn't
discriminate. Cars, homes,
parking structures all burned to
a

01:43.003 --> 01:44.838
crisp.

01:44.838 --> 01:50.010
WOMAN: It was a wall of fire
behind us when we left, scariest
thing ever. I -- I am still

01:50.010 --> 01:52.546
in shock.

01:52.546 --> 01:58.552
GWEN IFILL: That wall of fire
moved down from the mountains on
Saturday afternoon and burned

01:58.552 --> 02:07.361
out of control in all
directions. More than 1,400
firefighters faced the worst
possible

02:07.361 --> 02:13.166
conditions: a brutal drought
that's has turned trees and
brush into tinderboxes, combined

02:13.166 --> 02:16.269
with blistering heat
and high winds.

02:16.269 --> 02:20.574
GOV. JERRY BROWN (D),
California: This is damn serious
stuff. Firefighters have to be

02:20.574 --> 02:23.677
careful, but so do people who
live out in their cabins or
their homes. They have to

02:23.677 --> 02:29.616
leave when they get the word.
This is not just this year. This
is the future from now

02:29.616 --> 02:32.619
on. It's going to get worse.

02:32.619 --> 02:38.291
GWEN IFILL: The area is full of
horse farms. And many of the
animals were left behind,

02:38.291 --> 02:41.161
as owners fled with
little warning.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.796
MARK GHILARDUCCI, Director,
Governor's Office of Emergency
Services: In the case of the

02:42.796 --> 02:50.470
Valley Fire, we have roughly
13,000 individuals that have
been displaced. Up on the Butte

02:50.470 --> 02:55.542
Fire, we have at least 10,000
that have been displaced. These
communities still are in

02:55.542 --> 02:58.378
an active firefight.

02:58.378 --> 03:03.950
GWEN IFILL: Not quite 200 miles
away, the Butte Fire flared up
last Wednesday and has

03:03.950 --> 03:12.692
burned across 110 square miles,
and scores more homes. It's 30
percent contained. Firefighters

03:12.692 --> 03:16.863
hope for help from the weather
as a low-pressure system moves
in and possibly brings showers

03:16.863 --> 03:20.267
in the next few days.

03:20.267 --> 03:26.440
In Afghanistan, Taliban fighters
stormed a prison, allowing 355
prisoners to escape.

03:26.440 --> 03:32.479
A suicide car bomber breached
the main gate of the facility in
Ghazni, and Taliban fighters

03:32.479 --> 03:35.949
attacked troops who tried to
rush in to help. At least four
guards and four militants were

03:35.949 --> 03:38.652
killed.

03:38.652 --> 03:43.023
Security forces in Egypt
attacked a convoy of Mexican
tourists today, killing a dozen

03:43.023 --> 03:48.528
people and wounding 10. It
happened near an oasis in
Egypt's Western Desert. The
convoy

03:48.528 --> 03:53.934
was hit by air and ground fire.
Officials said a military and
police force had been

03:53.934 --> 03:58.672
chasing Islamist militants, and
mistook the target -- that
tourists, that is, for their

03:58.672 --> 04:04.211
target. Mexico condemned the
attack and called for a full
investigation.

04:04.211 --> 04:08.548
There's been another political
change down under. Conservative
Prime Minister Tony Abbott

04:08.548 --> 04:13.954
was ousted today by members of
his own party amid falling
support and worries about the

04:13.954 --> 04:18.158
economy. Instead, they chose
Malcolm Turnbull as the new
prime minister, the country's
fourth

04:18.158 --> 04:21.328
leader in just over two years.

04:21.328 --> 04:26.333
MALCOLM TURNBULL, Australian
Prime Minister-Elect: The
Australia of the future has to
be a nation

04:26.333 --> 04:32.739
that is agile, that is
innovative, that is creative. We
cannot be defensive. We cannot

04:32.739 --> 04:40.046
future-proof ourselves. We have
to recognize that the disruption
that we see driven by

04:40.046 --> 04:45.852
technology, the volatility and
change is our friend, is our
friend, if we are agile and

04:45.852 --> 04:49.756
smart enough to take
advantage of it.

04:49.756 --> 04:54.561
GWEN IFILL: Abbott drew
international attention last
year with a drive to repeal
Australia's

04:54.561 --> 04:59.466
carbon tax and instead pay
industry to operate more
cleanly. Turnbull gave no
indication

04:59.466 --> 05:02.802
that he will seek to
change that policy.

05:02.802 --> 05:08.408
Back in this country, a judge in
South Carolina refused bond for
Michael Slager, a former

05:08.408 --> 05:14.047
policeman accused of murdering
an unarmed suspect. Slager faces
a murder charge in the

05:14.047 --> 05:18.952
death of Walter Scott. Video
showed him firing eight times
after Scott ran from a traffic

05:18.952 --> 05:23.957
stop. Slager wanted to be
released from jail pending his
trial.

05:23.957 --> 05:29.196
Kim Davis returned to work as
Rowan County clerk in Kentucky.
She spent five days in

05:29.196 --> 05:35.335
jail for refusing marriage
licenses for same-sex couples,
citing her religious beliefs.
Today,

05:35.335 --> 05:39.639
deputies in her office went
ahead and issued licenses, and
Davis didn't interfere. She

05:39.639 --> 05:43.510
said an impossible choice
had been forced on her.

05:43.510 --> 05:48.682
KIM DAVIS, Rowan County,
Kentucky, Clerk: I don't want to
have this conflict, I don't

05:48.682 --> 05:55.989
want to be in the spotlight, and
I certainly don't want to be a
whipping post. I am no

05:55.989 --> 06:02.095
hero. I am just a person who has
been transformed by the grace of
God and who wants to work

06:02.095 --> 06:07.901
and be with my family. I just
want to serve my neighbors
quietly without violating my

06:07.901 --> 06:09.869
conscience.

06:09.869 --> 06:14.574
GWEN IFILL: Davis and her
lawyers argue the licenses will
not be valid without her
signature.

06:14.574 --> 06:19.980
But Kentucky's governor,
attorney general and the county
attorney say they are.

06:19.980 --> 06:25.151
And on Wall Street today, stocks
weren't able to hold on to early
gains, in the face of

06:25.151 --> 06:31.224
more signs of slowing growth in
China. Instead, the Dow Jones
industrial average lost 62
points

06:31.224 --> 06:38.665
to close at 16370. The Nasdaq
fell 16 points. And the S&P 500
dropped eight.

06:38.665 --> 06:42.669
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
European governments gather to
grapple with the refugee

06:42.669 --> 07:00.053
crisis; a new report on the
lessons learned from Ferguson,
and much more.

07:00.053 --> 07:04.991
Tens of thousands of refugees
and migrants continued their
long journeys today in Europe,

07:04.991 --> 07:09.229
as the continent's leaders met
to chart a path forward and the
two-decade-old free travel

07:09.229 --> 07:13.466
policy among European Union
nations was put on hold.

07:13.466 --> 07:17.337
From Izmir, Turkey, special
correspondent Malcolm Brabant
reports.

07:17.337 --> 07:22.208
MALCOLM BRABANT: Interior
ministers from across Europe
arrived in Brussels with a quota
plan

07:22.208 --> 07:28.348
on the table to spread 160,000
asylum-seekers across the
continent.

07:28.348 --> 07:33.586
The E.U. did agree on relocating
40,000 migrants, but felt short
of consensus on a more
comprehensive

07:33.586 --> 07:35.855
plan.

07:35.855 --> 07:41.995
DIMITRIS AVRAMOPOULOS, European
Union Migration Commissioner:
But for our proposal on 120,000,

07:41.995 --> 07:48.968
we didn't hear the agreement we
wanted. A majority of the member
states are ready to

07:48.968 --> 07:56.042
move forward, but not all. The
commission is determined to take
action. We will need

07:56.042 --> 08:00.647
another council meeting
in the coming days.

08:00.647 --> 08:09.756
This has always been how Europe
works. When we do not succeed
the first time, yes, we

08:09.756 --> 08:17.597
try again. The world is watching
us. It is time for each and
every one to take their

08:17.597 --> 08:19.599
responsibilities.

08:19.599 --> 08:23.403
MALCOLM BRABANT: But others,
especially those in the poorer
states of Eastern Europe, balked

08:23.403 --> 08:26.005
at any talk of quotas.

08:26.005 --> 08:33.012
MAN: We think that quotas is not
the solution. And we have to
help the countries which are

08:33.012 --> 08:38.218
most affected by these
huge flows of migrants.

08:38.218 --> 08:44.090
MALCOLM BRABANT: But, amid the
debate in Brussels, Europe's
system of no borders began to
crumble.

08:44.090 --> 08:49.796
On Sunday, Germany imposed
stricter border controls and
sent in more police to step up

08:49.796 --> 08:53.333
screening. Foreign Minister
Frank-Walter Steinmeier said his
government remains committed to
the

08:53.333 --> 08:56.336
effort, but needs help.

08:56.336 --> 09:01.808
FRANK-WALTER STEINMEIER, German
Foreign Minister (through
translator): We stand by our
responsibility,

09:01.808 --> 09:07.347
and will continue to do so, but
we must also make sure that we
keep our own shop in order.

09:07.347 --> 09:12.252
Germany clearly cannot manage
this burden alone. We must
introduce a real
responsibility-sharing.

09:12.252 --> 09:16.790
If everybody takes on their fair
share, then the burden will be
manageable for everybody.

09:16.790 --> 09:22.095
MALCOLM BRABANT: The German move
caused traffic backups at the
border with Austria, and set

09:22.095 --> 09:26.499
off a chain reaction along the
route the migrants take to get
to Germany. In Austria, the
government

09:26.499 --> 09:31.304
added its own controls along
the border with Hungary.

09:31.304 --> 09:37.777
Some 14,000 refugees entered
Austria on Sunday alone, and at
least 7,000 more came today,

09:37.777 --> 09:42.015
before officials moved to stem
the flow. And Hungary's
conservative government stepped

09:42.015 --> 09:47.554
up its own aggressive efforts.
Crews raced to complete a fence
along the border with

09:47.554 --> 09:52.959
Serbia, and troops deployed to
seal off unfinished portions.
Tomorrow, new laws in Hungary
will

09:52.959 --> 09:56.763
allow police to jail anyone
trying to enter the country
illegally.

09:56.763 --> 10:01.901
Meanwhile, in Turkey, refugees
waiting in Izmir watched the
developments across Europe

10:01.901 --> 10:07.240
with foreboding. The port city
is one of the staging posts
feeding into the human smuggling

10:07.240 --> 10:12.378
racket. It's an expensive and
often perilous journey to the
Greek islands, not far away

10:12.378 --> 10:16.115
for the many here in the
district of Basmane. They are
mainly Syrians, sleeping where
they

10:16.115 --> 10:20.253
can, in squalid,
unsanitary conditions.

10:20.253 --> 10:25.124
These sleeping represent just a
fraction of the tens of
thousands of refugees who have

10:25.124 --> 10:30.063
gathered on Turkey's
Mediterranean coastline hoping
to get to Europe. Some children
were

10:30.063 --> 10:35.802
up early on a day when the winds
and seas were said to be
favorable for the voyage.

10:35.802 --> 10:39.906
In the mosque in the main
square, where many -- the
European Union to open the land
borders

10:39.906 --> 10:43.643
between Turkey, Greece and
Bulgaria to put an end to the
drownings that have claimed

10:43.643 --> 10:45.912
thousands.

10:45.912 --> 10:49.883
MAN (through translator): One
important thing regarding our
Turkish brothers who deal with

10:49.883 --> 10:54.621
Arab countries, migrants and
those who seek asylum to these
European countries, finish

10:54.621 --> 11:00.093
your good deed. See all these
families with your own eyes. For
Turkey, America, and the

11:00.093 --> 11:04.831
E.U., all the countries that
demand human rights, open the
crossing. Why would children

11:04.831 --> 11:09.035
suffer? Families are incurring
debts to come here and cross,
and some drown.

11:09.035 --> 11:14.040
MALCOLM BRABANT: As she sat with
her grandchildren in the shade
in the mosque, Rahme Habul, from

11:14.040 --> 11:20.179
Aleppo in Syria, was unaware
that European countries were
hastily fortifying their
frontiers.

11:20.179 --> 11:23.616
She says three of her sons were
kidnapped and murdered by the
regime of Syrian President

11:23.616 --> 11:25.785
Bashar al-Assad.

11:25.785 --> 11:31.224
RAHME HABUL, Refugee (through
translator): I intend to go from
my country, Syria, to

11:31.224 --> 11:37.797
Germany or any destination you
take us. I don't know. I think
God would oversee this.

11:37.797 --> 11:41.601
God chose to take my kids. They
killed them. They told me they
grinded them in a cement

11:41.601 --> 11:45.738
factory and left them
there. Why? For what?

11:45.738 --> 11:49.475
MALCOLM BRABANT: Some European
politicians have said there's no
need for the Syrians

11:49.475 --> 11:54.414
to leave Turkey, where they are
now safe from war. But living
conditions in the makeshift

11:54.414 --> 11:58.851
camps there are grim. And some
of the refugees are concerned
that if they make it across

11:58.851 --> 12:01.521
the sea to Greece, they will get
stuck on the wrong side of the
fence being erected

12:01.521 --> 12:04.157
by Hungary.

12:04.157 --> 12:08.127
MAN (through translator): We
have heard that Hungary is
closing the borders in the face

12:08.127 --> 12:11.931
of Syrians. Is this news true or
not? We demand that the barbed
wires be removed and facilitate

12:11.931 --> 12:14.100
their transportation.

12:14.100 --> 12:20.340
MALCOLM BRABANT: The European
Union may be talking about how
to accommodate 160,000 refugees

12:20.340 --> 12:23.610
and migrants in an orderly
fashion, but all the indications
are that that is a completely

12:23.610 --> 12:26.412
unrealistic figure.

12:26.412 --> 12:31.317
And later this week in Turkey,
there is going to be an attempt
to test the resolve of Europe

12:31.317 --> 12:36.823
to protect its outer limits;
3,000 people are planning to
march from Istanbul to Edirne,

12:36.823 --> 12:40.460
which is where the Greek and
Bulgarian borders meet. What
they want to do is to open the

12:40.460 --> 12:44.197
gates of Europe and put an
end to the sea crossings.

12:44.197 --> 12:48.468
The refugees here are
desperately hoping that they
succeed. And if they do, it
could divide

12:48.468 --> 12:50.903
a very fractious
Europe still further.

12:50.903 --> 12:56.142
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Malcolm Brabant in Izmir,
Turkey.

12:56.142 --> 13:00.179
GWEN IFILL: So, how much will
today's decisions in Brussels
help ease the migrant crisis and

13:00.179 --> 13:01.748
the rest of Europe?

13:01.748 --> 13:04.550
Jeffrey Brown has that.

13:04.550 --> 13:10.289
JEFFREY BROWN: And with us is
Hungary's ambassador to the
United States, Reka Szemerkenyi,
and

13:10.289 --> 13:14.761
from the Greek island of Lesbos,
former British Foreign Secretary
David Miliband, now president

13:14.761 --> 13:17.330
and CEO of the International
Rescue Committee.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.866
And, Ambassador, let
me start with you.

13:19.866 --> 13:25.905
At the meeting today in
Brussels, an U.N. official spoke
of a heated debate, of the

13:25.905 --> 13:30.109
majority of countries wanting to
move forward, but some
countries, including Hungary, I
gather,

13:30.109 --> 13:32.278
still against a
quota system. Why?

13:32.278 --> 13:34.714
REKA SZEMERKENYI, Hungarian
Ambassador to the United States:
The quota system is one

13:34.714 --> 13:39.018
that really doesn't help
in solving the situation.

13:39.018 --> 13:46.426
What we can see in Hungary is an
unprecedented wave of migration
and that is really a dramatic

13:46.426 --> 13:50.229
shock to the world country, and
I think it's a dramatic shock to
the whole continent.

13:50.229 --> 13:57.270
What we could see is also a
major need of basic humanitarian
needs, and what we could

13:57.270 --> 14:03.476
see from the Hungarian society
-- I just got back from Hungary
a few days ago -- is a massive

14:03.476 --> 14:09.449
wave of response for the
immediate humanitarian needs of
these people coming into the
country.

14:09.449 --> 14:18.524
We have been providing food,
shelter, medication, even
schooling for the children of
the migrant

14:18.524 --> 14:24.931
families entering Hungarian
soil, but, unfortunately,
sympathy is not enough. We have
to move beyond.

14:24.931 --> 14:27.700
JEFFREY BROWN: But the E.U. as
a whole has not moved beyond.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.802
Let me ask David Miliband.

14:29.802 --> 14:34.540
What was your reaction to the
seeming stalemate still today?

14:34.540 --> 14:37.977
DAVID MILIBAND, Former British
Foreign Secretary: I think that
Europe has been very late to

14:37.977 --> 14:42.148
get a grip with this crisis, and
it's vital that big and bold
decisions are taken by the

14:42.148 --> 14:44.250
European Union.

14:44.250 --> 14:51.457
After all, there are 2,000 to
3,000 people arriving every day
in Lesbos, the island off

14:51.457 --> 14:56.496
of Greece that has borne about
half of the refugees entering
Europe. I think it's vital

14:56.496 --> 15:01.567
that we both tackle the symptoms
of this problem, which are the
unprecedented surge that the

15:01.567 --> 15:06.105
ambassador speaks out, with
proper humanitarian help,
coordinated across the European
Union

15:06.105 --> 15:09.942
with competence, as well as
compassion, and that we also
tackle the problem at source,

15:09.942 --> 15:13.880
because organizations like mine
are not just working here in
Europe.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.950
We're also working in Syria,
Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan,
whose societies are creaking
under

15:17.950 --> 15:21.454
the strain of a civil war
that seems to be without end.

15:21.454 --> 15:25.658
JEFFREY BROWN: But, Ambassador,
you speak of the need for more
humanitarian help. At

15:25.658 --> 15:29.996
the same time, your government
has gone even further, though,
in announcing a zero tolerance

15:29.996 --> 15:35.802
policy for further allowing
refugee -- at the border for
refugees or migrants.

15:35.802 --> 15:39.972
Why go even further? What
happens to those people that
come to your border now?

15:39.972 --> 15:45.511
REKA SZEMERKENYI: The Hungarian
border is one that has been
receiving the most impressive

15:45.511 --> 15:51.984
and biggest shock of migration
coming into continental Europe
on vital land.

15:51.984 --> 15:57.490
And what we could see is that
the response to this massive
pressure has been, on one

15:57.490 --> 16:03.362
hand, the expression of empathy
and sympathy towards the
migrants, trying to provide them

16:03.362 --> 16:08.568
whatever is needed, down to baby
strollers for the families and
immediate help for the

16:08.568 --> 16:12.939
women and children
coming into the country.

16:12.939 --> 16:18.311
At the same time, what we also
focused on is the establishment
of the security for the

16:18.311 --> 16:24.483
rest of the continent. We live
up to our promises and we live
up to the commitments that we

16:24.483 --> 16:28.187
made to the rest of the European
Union countries in defending the
territory and in providing

16:28.187 --> 16:30.823
security for all of us.

16:30.823 --> 16:38.064
What we try to do is to make as
clear that we follow all the
Schengen requirements to

16:38.064 --> 16:43.603
provide for the registration of
these refugees and migrants. At
the same time, what we're

16:43.603 --> 16:49.942
trying to do is to go through
the exact procedure that is what
we have undertaken.

16:49.942 --> 16:53.246
JEFFREY BROWN: You're referring
to the agreements over the
borders.

16:53.246 --> 16:59.418
But, at the same time, your
country has been hit by a lot of
criticism for an insensitivity

16:59.418 --> 17:05.558
to the refugee situation. Your
prime minister of course got
criticized after he spoke of

17:05.558 --> 17:08.094
working to keep
Europe Christian.

17:08.094 --> 17:11.864
What is your response to that
criticism that has hit Hungary?

17:11.864 --> 17:19.405
REKA SZEMERKENYI: What I have
seen is a massive outflow of
sympathy and support for the
migrants.

17:19.405 --> 17:26.045
What many Hungarian volunteers
have shown was giving their free
time day and night to

17:26.045 --> 17:33.386
work for the migrants, providing
them the necessary help, both in
food and medication,

17:33.386 --> 17:40.927
as well as includes blankets and
sleeping bags for the stay --
their stay in Hungary.

17:40.927 --> 17:45.865
What we have seen is a very
clear experience of sympathy
towards these people.

17:45.865 --> 17:51.404
JEFFREY BROWN: David Miliband,
you spoke of Europe needing to
take faster and bigger action.

17:51.404 --> 17:55.875
And yet right now, what we're
seeing is more countries taking
action to close their borders.

17:55.875 --> 17:59.111
So what is the way
forward? What do you see?

17:59.111 --> 18:01.914
DAVID MILIBAND: I think that we
have seen extraordinary
leadership from Germany, backed

18:01.914 --> 18:07.353
up in a way by France,
Italy and Belgium.

18:07.353 --> 18:12.692
I think there is progress with
Poland. I don't think anyone
doubts that the Hungarian people

18:12.692 --> 18:17.229
are full of generosity. No one
is saying that the Hungarian
people are as misguided and

18:17.229 --> 18:20.666
shortsighted as the decision of
a government which seems to
believe that building a wall

18:20.666 --> 18:24.370
is an answer to a
refugee crisis.

18:24.370 --> 18:29.809
This is of course especially
ironic, given that, in 1956,
when Soviet tanks rolled into

18:29.809 --> 18:35.348
Budapest, 200,000 Hungarians
went into Austria and were
welcomed as refugees. I think
it's

18:35.348 --> 18:39.585
absolutely vital that Europe is
able to show that it can handle
what, after all, is a small

18:39.585 --> 18:42.621
percentage of the
European population.

18:42.621 --> 18:47.760
If there are 500,000 refugees in
a continent of 500 million
people, your viewers can
immediately

18:47.760 --> 18:54.066
do the math and see that this is
a question of management, not of
a continent being overwhelmed.

18:54.066 --> 18:58.671
Equally, it's absolutely vital
that we don't simply bottle up
the problem, either in
individual

18:58.671 --> 19:02.708
European countries like Greece
or Italy, which have been
buckling under the strain, or in

19:02.708 --> 19:06.078
Serbia, which is the next-door
neighbor of Hungary.

19:06.078 --> 19:08.280
And the decision simply to build
a fence and hope for the best,
I'm afraid, is going to

19:08.280 --> 19:11.417
create a tinderbox in Serbia.

19:11.417 --> 19:14.053
JEFFREY BROWN: Madam Ambassador,
your response to that, the
charge that building a wall is

19:14.053 --> 19:17.189
not the -- not the answer here?

19:17.189 --> 19:23.729
REKA SZEMERKENYI: Our common
European space and open internal
borders are really predicated

19:23.729 --> 19:29.735
on the premise that common
external borders are secure.
This is the commitment that we

19:29.735 --> 19:33.339
undertook and this is the
commitment that we're living up
to.

19:33.339 --> 19:38.577
Obviously, it's all in our --
everybody's interest in the
European Union itself to secure

19:38.577 --> 19:47.586
our borders. The border control
and the border -- registration
at the border stations is

19:47.586 --> 19:53.826
a requirement that helps us to
ensure everybody, all our
friends within the European
Union

19:53.826 --> 19:56.962
in the neighboring countries,
that they can count on us, that
we provide for their security

19:56.962 --> 19:59.899
and we take our responsibility
very seriously.

19:59.899 --> 20:03.302
We have made that commitment and
we live up to that commitment.

20:03.302 --> 20:07.473
JEFFREY BROWN: David Miliband,
finally, you're there in Lesbos.
What are you seeing in terms

20:07.473 --> 20:12.778
of the continuing flow of
refugees and migrants? You
expect the numbers to continue?

20:12.778 --> 20:16.849
DAVID MILIBAND: You can probably
see behind me shadows. These are
people who are sleeping

20:16.849 --> 20:20.086
in the port, waiting
for ferries tomorrow.

20:20.086 --> 20:24.457
My organization, the
International Rescue Committee,
has been trying to provide basic

20:24.457 --> 20:28.494
water and sanitation and
humanitarian help, including
some transport for people who,
when

20:28.494 --> 20:32.832
they land in the north of the
island, are expected to make a
40-kilometer walk.

20:32.832 --> 20:38.471
This is women, children,
families, as well as able-bodied
young men. And I think that

20:38.471 --> 20:43.542
the message to Europeans, but
also frankly to the United
States, is a very simple one.

20:43.542 --> 20:46.712
The Syrian crisis is now a
global refugee crisis with
global responsibilities that
need

20:46.712 --> 20:51.117
to attend to all nations.

20:51.117 --> 20:56.622
That means that, in Europe,
there needs to be some
significant shift in policy, but
also,

20:56.622 --> 21:01.360
frankly, the U.S., which so far
has only taken about 1,500
refugees from Syria over the
course

21:01.360 --> 21:05.164
of four years, need to live up
to its historic standard-setting
role as a leader of refugee

21:05.164 --> 21:06.699
resettlement.

21:06.699 --> 21:11.403
We have got to tackle this at
both ends of the problem, the
immediate symptoms of crisis,

21:11.403 --> 21:15.441
the humanitarian crisis, but
also the deeper political causes
in the Middle East. That's

21:15.441 --> 21:20.513
the only way to build the kind
of security that the ambassador
has rightly spoken of.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.415
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, David
Miliband and Ambassador Reka
Szemerkenyi, thank you both

21:23.415 --> 21:26.752
very much.

21:26.752 --> 21:34.026
REKA SZEMERKENYI: Thank you.

21:34.026 --> 21:41.734
GWEN IFILL: The push and pull of
2016 politics in recent weeks
have devolved into name-calling,

21:41.734 --> 21:44.370
counterpunches and
bitter accusation.

21:44.370 --> 21:48.507
Lost in all of that, some of the
candidates have actually been
talking about policy, from

21:48.507 --> 21:52.411
taxes to foreign policy
to income inequality.

21:52.411 --> 21:55.047
We explore some of that and
preview Wednesday's second big
Republican debate this Politics

21:55.047 --> 21:56.815
Monday.

21:56.815 --> 22:01.854
I'm joined by Susan Page of USA
Today and Amy Walter of The Cook
Political Report.

22:01.854 --> 22:07.493
Ladies, let's start by talking
about Bernie Sanders, who today
was at Liberty University,

22:07.493 --> 22:11.997
conservative Christian school in
South Carolina, and he was
making the case that, in fact,

22:11.997 --> 22:15.801
the income inequality that he
talks about in his speeches is
actually a moral issue.

22:15.801 --> 22:18.170
Let's listen to a
little bit of it.

22:18.170 --> 22:24.977
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate: There is
no justice when, in recent
years,

22:24.977 --> 22:35.588
we have seen a proliferation of
millionaires and billionaires,
while at the same time the

22:35.588 --> 22:43.395
United States of America has the
highest rate of childhood
poverty of any major country

22:43.395 --> 22:45.631
on Earth.

22:45.631 --> 22:49.101
GWEN IFILL: It should be said
there was some pushback at
Liberty, which, by the way, is

22:49.101 --> 22:52.338
Virginia, not South Carolina.
There was some pushback, in
which people said, well, what

22:52.338 --> 22:57.376
about abortion? We consider
caring for children to also be
about children, children's
issues

22:57.376 --> 22:59.612
and equality issues.

22:59.612 --> 23:02.214
So what was Bernie
Sanders up to, Susan?

23:02.214 --> 23:04.083
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today: I think this
is such a smart thing. I think

23:04.083 --> 23:06.986
politicians are so wise to go to
places that are not their
natural audiences and make their

23:06.986 --> 23:08.887
case.

23:08.887 --> 23:13.692
I mean, what could be more
appealing, and what could we
possibly need more in our
politics

23:13.692 --> 23:18.297
than people who are willing to
talk to people who disagree with
them? He was making a -- he

23:18.297 --> 23:22.167
did go there with a point to
make, though. There are probably
not six votes for Bernie

23:22.167 --> 23:27.906
Sanders in the student body at
Liberty University, but he was
making the case that caring for

23:27.906 --> 23:32.211
people, the biblical injunction
to take care of the neediest
among us, is something that

23:32.211 --> 23:34.246
applies to the case he's trying
to make in terms of a liberal
economic policy.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.015
AMY WALTER, The Cook
Political Report: Yes.

23:36.015 --> 23:39.718
And it's not just that he was
willing to go into the lion's
den, so to speak, somewhere

23:39.718 --> 23:44.523
that is not going to be
naturally looking to vote for
somebody like Bernie Sanders,

23:44.523 --> 23:49.995
but it also highlights this
authenticity that Bernie Sanders
is really taking and doing

23:49.995 --> 23:51.797
a lot with.

23:51.797 --> 23:56.568
And I think it's part of the
reason that you have seen him do
so well in the polls, is

23:56.568 --> 24:00.005
that people see him as somebody
that's really -- he's got a
message. He goes anywhere. He

24:00.005 --> 24:01.874
doesn't care where that is
and gives that same message.

24:01.874 --> 24:04.076
GWEN IFILL: He didn't back down.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.845
AMY WALTER: And will not back
down on any of that. And there
is something that is incredibly

24:06.845 --> 24:07.946
appealing about that.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.381
SUSAN PAGE: And he acknowledged
their differences.

24:09.381 --> 24:09.515
AMY WALTER: That's right. He
said, we're not going to agree
on...

24:09.515 --> 24:11.050
(CROSSTALK)

24:11.050 --> 24:14.553
SUSAN PAGE: He acknowledged that
they differed on issues like
same-sex marriage and abortion.

24:14.553 --> 24:18.090
That doesn't mean that they
can't have a conversation about
the issues that face the
country.

24:18.090 --> 24:25.064
GWEN IFILL: And then it ended
with a prayer with his
interviewer on the Rosh
Hashanah,a

24:25.064 --> 24:28.867
Jewish -- he is Jewish -- at a
Christian university, praying
for the future of the world. So,
maybe

24:28.867 --> 24:31.337
that's the way it ought to be.

24:31.337 --> 24:36.775
Let's move on to Hillary
Clinton, who gave a speech today
about sexual assault on campus,

24:36.775 --> 24:42.381
in which she's trying also to
stay on policy. But even as she
focuses on policy, on issues

24:42.381 --> 24:46.552
which draw attention to what she
sees as her strengths, we see a
new poll today. And in

24:46.552 --> 24:51.090
this new poll, it shows, in the
past eight weeks, Hillary
Clinton has dropped from 71

24:51.090 --> 24:54.860
percent approval among
Democratic women down to 42
percent.

24:54.860 --> 24:58.230
That's a big drop. What's going
on with Hillary Clinton?

24:58.230 --> 25:01.166
AMY WALTER: Well, and that's
why, this week, actually the
next two weeks, are dubbed women

25:01.166 --> 25:03.669
for Hillary.

25:03.669 --> 25:08.841
So this event on campus rape
follows -- she had an appearance
with Ellen DeGeneres. She's

25:08.841 --> 25:14.546
talking about her speech she had
in 1994 where she talked about
women's rights being human

25:14.546 --> 25:21.687
rights at the U.N., and really
trying to remind women voters
about the fact that she is a

25:21.687 --> 25:25.691
historic candidate, would be
obviously the first woman to be
president.

25:25.691 --> 25:32.064
Hillary Clinton has enjoyed the
support of women without ever
making the case for why

25:32.064 --> 25:37.803
it would be important to be a
female candidate. But we're
seeing here flashes of 2008 as
well,

25:37.803 --> 25:43.208
which is, one, it's difficult to
make the case purely on a gender
basis for why Hillary

25:43.208 --> 25:46.478
Clinton should be elected. She's
not necessarily comfortable
doing that, doesn't want to be

25:46.478 --> 25:49.715
just seen as a gender candidate.

25:49.715 --> 25:55.854
And the second is that even
female voters are looking for
other -- something else in

25:55.854 --> 25:59.792
the other candidates. This is
where the authenticity, being
different, being different on
some of

25:59.792 --> 26:01.727
the issues in the way
that Bernie Sanders...

26:01.727 --> 26:02.895
(CROSSTALK)

26:02.895 --> 26:05.230
GWEN IFILL: She clearly knows
that she's in some sort of
trouble.

26:05.230 --> 26:09.201
I want to move to the
Republicans, Susan, because we
know that Trump has been the big

26:09.201 --> 26:14.273
shadow over all of this case.
But we have seen Jeb Bush giving
a speech about -- about

26:14.273 --> 26:18.710
income -- I mean, about taxes.
We have seen Scott Walker
talking about labor unions. We

26:18.710 --> 26:22.681
have actually seen these
candidates trying to talk about
these issues.

26:22.681 --> 26:26.685
But one of the ones that seems
to have taken hold, speaking of
women voters, was with Carly

26:26.685 --> 26:31.023
Fiorina, who has been coming up
somewhat in the polls, when
Donald Trump said that -- gave

26:31.023 --> 26:32.491
an interview to "Rolling Stone"
in which he said: Look at that
face. Would you vote for

26:32.491 --> 26:34.760
that face?

26:34.760 --> 26:38.831
She responded with this ad, of
which we will show you a little
bit in part.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.166
CARLY FIORINA (R), Presidential
Candidate: Look at this face and
look at all of your

26:41.166 --> 26:56.548
faces, the face of leadership,
the face of leadership in our
party, the party of women's
suffrage.

26:56.548 --> 26:59.351
GWEN IFILL: And at end, she ends
up saying, and this is what a
61-year-old face looks

26:59.351 --> 27:02.221
like, wrinkles and all.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.223
Is this her attempt to go for
the same folks that Hillary
Clinton is also trying to go

27:04.223 --> 27:06.058
for?

27:06.058 --> 27:11.029
SUSAN PAGE: Well, it's
brilliant. I think it's like the
best ad of the cycle, not that

27:11.029 --> 27:14.766
there have been so many, in that
she took something that was
meant as a slur and that

27:14.766 --> 27:19.037
she could have taken offense at
and called him on for sexism,
and said she turned it

27:19.037 --> 27:22.174
to her advantage and she
made this very effective ad.

27:22.174 --> 27:25.611
I will be very curious to see
what she does in the debate
Wednesday night, when she makes

27:25.611 --> 27:33.485
it on stage of the top tier of
candidates. She has been a very
interesting candidate,

27:33.485 --> 27:38.490
in that she sits in the outsider
mold of the people who are doing
well.

27:38.490 --> 27:44.396
If you look at the top two
Republicans in the
ABC/Washington Post poll, who
got 53 percent

27:44.396 --> 27:47.766
of the support of Republicans
between them, they're both --
neither of them have been

27:47.766 --> 27:52.271
elected anything ever, Trump and
Dr. Carson. Add that -- Fiorina,
that, clearly, this is

27:52.271 --> 27:56.308
a year in which there is a
willingness to consider folks
that we would not traditionally

27:56.308 --> 27:59.745
have considered qualified to
be considered for president.

27:59.745 --> 28:04.316
GWEN IFILL: Is that the secret,
perhaps, to out-Trumping Trump,
my newest favorite phrase,

28:04.316 --> 28:08.186
by the way, which is you find --
you take the things he throws
that you and turn it

28:08.186 --> 28:10.722
to the subject you
want to talk about?

28:10.722 --> 28:13.258
AMY WALTER: Well, we will see, I
think, in this debate at how
successful some candidates

28:13.258 --> 28:14.993
are.

28:14.993 --> 28:20.165
I think you're right, that Carly
Fiorina is really honing that
message to be able to come

28:20.165 --> 28:25.270
back at Donald Trump. And I'm
sure every single other
candidate is trying to find that
one

28:25.270 --> 28:28.674
really good turn of phrase
to get back at him.

28:28.674 --> 28:32.744
The hope is two things among
Republicans, one, that he just
sort of jumps the shark,

28:32.744 --> 28:37.549
to use a TV term, that he just
-- it just becomes something of
a bore, that -- his doing

28:37.549 --> 28:41.954
this over and over again. And
the second is that they are
going to turn it to their
advantage,

28:41.954 --> 28:46.358
one, by saying, I have a cute
quip to come back to you, but
also we're going to talk

28:46.358 --> 28:51.930
about some of the policy issues,
specifically calling Donald
Trump out as not being true

28:51.930 --> 28:55.767
conservative, calling Donald
Trump out for not really having
any depth of policy.

28:55.767 --> 28:56.568
GWEN IFILL: Even though there
are no polls that seem to show
that...

28:56.568 --> 28:57.202
(CROSSTALK)

28:57.202 --> 28:57.603
AMY WALTER: That that
is actually working.

28:57.603 --> 29:00.105
GWEN IFILL: That that
is actually working.

29:00.105 --> 29:03.709
AMY WALTER: One interesting
thing aside, too, about the
Carly ad, just to show the new
era

29:03.709 --> 29:07.779
that we're in, in campaigns,
that's actually a super PAC ad.

29:07.779 --> 29:10.983
And the reason that you see
she's not talking to the camera
is because she can't. They can't

29:10.983 --> 29:13.752
coordinate, with the rules.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.721
SUSAN PAGE: They
can't "coordinate."

29:15.721 --> 29:19.424
GWEN IFILL: "Coordinate."
There's lot of air quotes this
election year.

29:19.424 --> 29:22.628
OK, so, quickly, what are you
guys watching for in this
debate? Who are you watching
most

29:22.628 --> 29:25.397
closely and what would you
like to see come out of it?

29:25.397 --> 29:28.233
SUSAN PAGE: The lead in this
debate is going to have Donald
Trump's name in it. There's

29:28.233 --> 29:32.004
no way it doesn't. What does he
do? What do others do to him?

29:32.004 --> 29:35.707
And this idea that you can call
him out on policy or say he has
not been a consistent

29:35.707 --> 29:38.410
conservative, people don't care
about that. They care that he's
somebody who is going

29:38.410 --> 29:43.148
to break the china, get things
done. They think the system is
corrupt, the government

29:43.148 --> 29:48.720
doesn't work. Why not go with
somebody as unexpected as Trump
to shake things up?

29:48.720 --> 29:52.357
AMY WALTER: Well, and that is
the question, is that, will it
last over time?

29:52.357 --> 29:56.962
I think this is what voters are
looking for today. Is that going
to be the same thing

29:56.962 --> 30:00.666
they're looking for in October,
in November, in December, as we
start to get closer to

30:00.666 --> 30:03.168
voting time?

30:03.168 --> 30:07.606
But I think I'm also looking to
see if Scott Walker and Jeb Bush
can improve their performances.

30:07.606 --> 30:11.443
They're both seen as sort of
lackluster. They didn't really
get a strong message out. It's

30:11.443 --> 30:13.612
not just about pushing back
against Trump. It's showing who
they are, why they want to

30:13.612 --> 30:15.547
be president.

30:15.547 --> 30:17.015
GWEN IFILL: And whether Ben
Carson can take advantage of
this latest surge which he's

30:17.015 --> 30:18.250
also enjoying.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.017
AMY WALTER: Absolutely
true, absolutely.

30:19.017 --> 30:19.985
GWEN IFILL: Amy Walter,
Susan Page, as always.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.019
AMY WALTER: Thank you.

30:21.019 --> 30:29.561
GWEN IFILL: See
you debate night.

30:29.561 --> 30:39.604
When the Ebola epidemic spread
through West Africa last year,
the focus was on the human

30:39.604 --> 30:42.474
toll of the virus.

30:42.474 --> 30:46.745
Science correspondent Miles
O'Brien looks at the
controversial race to develop a
vaccine,

30:46.745 --> 30:53.085
this time with animals in mind.

30:53.085 --> 30:59.024
With Ebola thinning their ranks
in Africa, 10 captive
chimpanzees in Louisiana are
enduring

30:59.024 --> 31:04.296
one last medical experiment
focused not on human health,
but, rather, the survival of

31:04.296 --> 31:09.601
their species. They are
receiving an experimental Ebola
vaccine.

31:09.601 --> 31:15.474
PETER WALSH, University of
Cambridge: I don't really like
to see chimps in a cage. It kind

31:15.474 --> 31:20.846
of upsets me a little bit. But I
weigh the individual welfare of
those chimpanzees against

31:20.846 --> 31:24.082
the survival of
wild chimpanzees.

31:24.082 --> 31:29.387
MILES O'BRIEN: Disease ecologist
Peter Walsh is a leading a
controversial effort to
vaccinate

31:29.387 --> 31:34.159
wild chimps and gorillas against
the deadly Ebola virus.

31:34.159 --> 31:39.531
PETER WALSH: It killed, I would
say, roughly a third of the
gorilla population and a bunch

31:39.531 --> 31:42.801
of chimpanzees. We don't have
good numbers, but we know, from
based on how much area it

31:42.801 --> 31:45.437
affected, we're talking about
a third of the gorillas.

31:45.437 --> 31:46.938
KENNETH CAMERON, Wildlife
Conservation Society: You could
say that Ebola has decimated
portions

31:46.938 --> 31:49.141
of the great ape population.

31:49.141 --> 31:53.812
MILES O'BRIEN: Kenneth Cameron
is a field veterinarian with the
Wildlife Conservation

31:53.812 --> 31:58.450
Society based in the Republic of
Congo. We met at the Bronx Zoo,
which is run by the

31:58.450 --> 32:02.120
WCS.

32:02.120 --> 32:06.658
Over the years, the virus has
wiped out entire local
populations of apes, 10,000 to
15,000

32:06.658 --> 32:09.294
fatalities at a time.

32:09.294 --> 32:13.999
KENNETH CAMERON: I don't think
that anybody really believes
that Ebola virus is going

32:13.999 --> 32:18.470
to result in the extinction of
western lowland gorillas or
central chimpanzees, for that

32:18.470 --> 32:25.277
matter. But what it may do is
reduce the populations to such a
degree that the other threats,
such

32:25.277 --> 32:31.149
as excessive logging, habitat
loss and hunting pressure, may
finally lead to the demise of

32:31.149 --> 32:33.451
the species.

32:33.451 --> 32:39.057
MILES O'BRIEN: With the stakes
that high, Peter Walsh believes
the end justifies the

32:39.057 --> 32:44.462
means in this case. We met him
at the University of Louisiana,
Lafayette, New Iberia Research

32:44.462 --> 32:51.303
Center, the largest primate
testing facility in the U.S.

32:51.303 --> 32:54.906
Captive trials make it easier to
limit the variables and apply
strict scientific controls

32:54.906 --> 32:57.509
to an experiment.

32:57.509 --> 33:01.146
PETER WALSH: There's no free
lunch. And the cost of lunch
here is that we're going to

33:01.146 --> 33:06.051
do vaccine trials on captive
chimpanzees in order to save the
ones in the wild. That's

33:06.051 --> 33:10.522
the trade-off. And that -- it's
a messy world, you know? That's
just the way it is. If I

33:10.522 --> 33:13.658
could do it without doing the
captive trials, I would do it.
But I can't.

33:13.658 --> 33:17.696
MILES O'BRIEN: But there is a
lot of heated debate about
whether it is necessary to use

33:17.696 --> 33:21.132
captive chimpanzees in
this vaccine trial.

33:21.132 --> 33:23.802
Brian Hare strongly objects.

33:23.802 --> 33:27.839
BRIAN HARE, Duke University:
This is a Hail Mary. They are
hoping that this could launch

33:27.839 --> 33:31.810
a new way to do research
with chimpanzees.

33:31.810 --> 33:38.483
MILES O'BRIEN: Hare is a
professor of evolutionary
anthropology at Duke University.
He works,

33:38.483 --> 33:44.990
and plays, with apes in Central
Africa. He says the vaccine
experiments should be conducted

33:44.990 --> 33:50.662
there, in ape sanctuaries, where
the animals live in relative
freedom.

33:50.662 --> 33:56.601
I think they are just taking
advantage of a bad situation in
Africa to continue to get

33:56.601 --> 34:03.408
funds that they desperately need
to pay for infrastructure at
their essentially arcane

34:03.408 --> 34:08.580
laboratories. We can also go and
do all of the types of research
that used to be done

34:08.580 --> 34:13.585
in laboratories in the United
States. We can do it now in
these sanctuaries.

34:13.585 --> 34:17.822
So, I think the question really
is not whether research needs to
be done, but where it needs

34:17.822 --> 34:19.624
to be done.

34:19.624 --> 34:24.095
PETER WALSH: The facilities here
are comparable to a hospital, a
human hospital. That's what

34:24.095 --> 34:27.866
we're dealing with. We go to
Africa, we don't have that. It
endangers the animals.

34:27.866 --> 34:34.039
MILES O'BRIEN: Medical testing
of any kind on chimpanzees has
long been a source of emotional

34:34.039 --> 34:43.381
debate. The vaccinations we
witnessed occurred in the same
facility where this
gut-wrenching

34:43.381 --> 34:48.286
scene was captured, one of many
like it recorded during a
nine-month undercover
investigation

34:48.286 --> 34:53.358
by the Humane Society in 2009.

34:53.358 --> 34:57.495
Andrew Rowan is president and
CEO of Humane Society
International. He spoke with us
in

34:57.495 --> 34:59.230
2012.

34:59.230 --> 35:01.800
ANDREW ROWAN, President and CEO,
Humane Society International:
What we found was that, frankly,

35:01.800 --> 35:09.407
well, a lot of suffering and
conditions that we felt were
inappropriate for chimpanzees.

35:09.407 --> 35:13.411
And so that's why we sort of
came out and said, this is --
this is ridiculous.

35:13.411 --> 35:17.782
MILES O'BRIEN: Jane Fontenot is
the head of research resources
at New Iberia.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.885
JANE FONTENOT, New Iberia
Research Center: There were
things I would have definitely

35:20.885 --> 35:25.757
preferred to have been done
differently. It's research. It's
not always something that
everybody

35:25.757 --> 35:28.193
wants to see.

35:28.193 --> 35:33.498
MILES O'BRIEN: And, in fact,
they wouldn't let us see them
anesthetize the chimps in

35:33.498 --> 35:37.936
this study, instead releasing a
brief clip showing a single
compliant chimpanzee receiving

35:37.936 --> 35:38.903
an injection.

35:38.903 --> 35:42.374
MAN: Good boy.

35:42.374 --> 35:47.612
MILES O'BRIEN: We did get a
brief tour of the sprawling
facility. In addition to the

35:47.612 --> 35:55.353
230 chimpanzees here, there are
more than 6,000 other primates
used in medical research.

35:55.353 --> 36:00.291
Managers here say they have
learned some hard lessons, and
the animals are treated
humanely.

36:00.291 --> 36:03.795
JANE FONTENOT: They will not be
harmed. After the study is done,
they will go back into

36:03.795 --> 36:08.166
their social groups. And it will
have no long-term effect, other
than they will have antibodies

36:08.166 --> 36:10.301
against Ebola.

36:10.301 --> 36:17.342
MILES O'BRIEN: Vaccinating wild
animals is not an easy task. But
it is not unprecedented.

36:17.342 --> 36:22.414
Vaccines protect buffalo at
Yellowstone from brucellosis and
stem the spread of rabies

36:22.414 --> 36:28.353
in wild raccoons and foxes in
the U.S. and Europe. In fact,
the safety and success of

36:28.353 --> 36:33.992
bait laced with the oral rabies
vaccine gave immunologist
Matthias Schnell the inspiration

36:33.992 --> 36:36.861
for his vaccine.

36:36.861 --> 36:42.033
A researcher at Thomas Jefferson
University, he wondered if a
tiny piece of the Ebola virus

36:42.033 --> 36:45.336
could hitchhike on
the rabies vaccine.

36:45.336 --> 36:48.773
MATTHIAS SCHNELL, Thomas
Jefferson University: What we
did is actually putting in one
Ebola

36:48.773 --> 36:53.711
gene which encodes for one
important protein to get an
immune response against the
virus.

36:53.711 --> 36:59.184
MILES O'BRIEN: They are racing
to get all this done before
September 14, when a federal

36:59.184 --> 37:03.288
rule goes into effect that will
eliminate medical research on
captive chimpanzees in

37:03.288 --> 37:06.825
the U.S.

37:06.825 --> 37:14.365
But there is one loophole:
Experiments on chimps can
continue if the goal is the
preservation

37:14.365 --> 37:20.572
of the species itself. New
Iberia must seek and obtain a
special permit from the U.S.

37:20.572 --> 37:24.843
Fish and Wildlife Service in
order to continue this
experiment. They have not made a
decision

37:24.843 --> 37:28.279
whether to apply.

37:28.279 --> 37:34.085
Researchers would like to expand
the trial beyond 10 individuals.
But maintaining 230

37:34.085 --> 37:37.989
chimps just for this one purpose
may not make sense financially.

37:37.989 --> 37:41.493
RAMESH KOLLURU, University of
Louisiana, Lafayette: Certainly,
that is part of the calculation.

37:41.493 --> 37:47.198
But this is one of those rare
opportunities that I believe we
have, as a research university,

37:47.198 --> 37:52.537
as a community of scientist and
researchers, to give something
back.

37:52.537 --> 37:55.273
MILES O'BRIEN: Ramesh Kolluru is
vice president for research at
the University of Louisiana,

37:55.273 --> 37:57.208
Lafayette.

37:57.208 --> 38:02.881
RAMESH KOLLURU: For us, this is
a great way of saying thank you
to chimpanzees for all

38:02.881 --> 38:05.917
that they have done to
help improve human health.

38:05.917 --> 38:09.754
MILES O'BRIEN: If it all ends on
the 14th, what happens to the
research? Is it all for

38:09.754 --> 38:11.523
naught?

38:11.523 --> 38:15.927
MATTHIAS SCHNELL: For now, it's
really off, and we can't do what
we like to do. So, we

38:15.927 --> 38:20.965
can't do any follow-up studies
until it's approved. So,
hopefully, that will change.

38:20.965 --> 38:27.405
MILES O'BRIEN: Dr. Schnell hopes
he can gather enough data and
make his vaccine stable without

38:27.405 --> 38:33.144
refrigeration in time for Peter
Walsh to begin distributing oral
vaccines among a half-dozen

38:33.144 --> 38:38.950
gorilla groups at two sites
in Africa in early 2016.

38:38.950 --> 38:45.657
And they will also assess a
technique to test for the Ebola
antibodies in the chimpanzees'

38:45.657 --> 38:50.995
feces, essential to judge the
success of vaccinations in the
bush. If all goes well, Walsh
will

38:50.995 --> 38:54.832
keep pushing for mass
vaccinations of wild apes.

38:54.832 --> 38:58.803
But is that level of human
intervention appropriate?

38:58.803 --> 39:04.475
PETER WALSH: The problem is,
we're intervening in so many
other ways there in a bad way
that

39:04.475 --> 39:09.247
we really -- it's a moral
imperative that we actually
intervene in a good way
sometime.

39:09.247 --> 39:11.849
And -- and vaccination is a way
that we can intervene in a good
way.

39:11.849 --> 39:14.752
If we don't do this, we're going
to lose our closest relatives.

39:14.752 --> 39:19.958
MILES O'BRIEN: There are still
big questions about how to
vaccinate wild apes and if it's

39:19.958 --> 39:25.863
a good idea. But thousands of
humans have now received
experimental Ebola vaccines,

39:25.863 --> 39:31.869
with good results. So, in this
case, humans may, in some small
way, be the guinea pigs

39:31.869 --> 39:35.073
for the chimps.

39:35.073 --> 39:45.550
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," New Iberia,
Louisiana.

39:45.550 --> 39:57.262
GWEN IFILL: Just over a year
after the city of Ferguson,
Missouri, exploded in unrest

39:57.262 --> 40:01.666
after the killing of Michael
Brown, an unarmed black
teenager, by Darren Wilson, a
white

40:01.666 --> 40:06.938
police officer, a local
commission today released a
blunt new report.

40:06.938 --> 40:13.544
Focusing on race, inequity and
history, the 16-member Ferguson
Commission issued 189 calls

40:13.544 --> 40:17.148
to action, including
improvements in police
practices, education, housing,
and health

40:17.148 --> 40:19.517
care access.

40:19.517 --> 40:24.856
"What we are pointing out," the
commission concluded, "is that
the data suggests, time

40:24.856 --> 40:29.327
and again, that our institutions
and existing systems are not
equal, and that this has racial

40:29.327 --> 40:31.629
repercussions."

40:31.629 --> 40:36.701
Joining me now to discuss the
report and its possible impact
are commission co-chair the

40:36.701 --> 40:40.004
Reverend Starsky Wilson, and
Missouri State Senator Maria
Chappelle-Nadal.

40:40.004 --> 40:42.807
Thank you both for joining us.

40:42.807 --> 40:47.211
So, call to action, Reverend
Wilson. What was the single most
surprising and the single

40:47.211 --> 40:50.381
least surprising thing that
you found in this report?

40:50.381 --> 40:54.752
REV. STARSKY WILSON, Co-Chair,
Ferguson Commission: Well, thank
you for having us on.

40:54.752 --> 40:58.856
First, quite frankly, the most
surprising thing was that so
many people lived in enclaves

40:58.856 --> 41:05.863
of comfort without understanding
that folks just five, 10 miles
away live in Third World

41:05.863 --> 41:10.902
circumstances when you talk
about health outcomes, life
expectancy.

41:10.902 --> 41:16.541
It was surprising to note that
there is a $15 billion cost in
our regional gross domestic

41:16.541 --> 41:22.580
product for these racial
inequities that we see in our
community. It was surprising to

41:22.580 --> 41:29.587
note that we are 42nd among the
top 50 metropolitan areas in the
nation in economic mobility,

41:29.587 --> 41:34.258
the capacity for a child to
do better than their parents.

41:34.258 --> 41:41.799
And so, with those surprises, I
was shocked a little bit as we
went throughout the process

41:41.799 --> 41:47.839
as this -- that there are so
many people of such goodwill to
be able to come around these

41:47.839 --> 41:51.409
issues when they came to know
about the issues, when they
recognized the challenges, to
actually

41:51.409 --> 41:54.245
be a part of the process.

41:54.245 --> 41:59.450
And so we're pleased that the
process, this bold experiment
and inclusive democracy has

41:59.450 --> 42:06.724
produced a result in this
report, in these
recommendations. And now it's
time to aggressively

42:06.724 --> 42:11.496
pursue them through activism,
advocacy and agitation, quite
frankly, of power structures

42:11.496 --> 42:13.731
that can make them happen.

42:13.731 --> 42:18.870
GWEN IFILL: Senator Maria Nadal,
was this -- were the findings
here about the structure

42:18.870 --> 42:23.708
of way the city, the state, the
region is structured, or is it
about something more

42:23.708 --> 42:26.077
profound than that?

42:26.077 --> 42:29.180
MARIA CHAPPELLE-NADAL (D),
Missouri State Senator: It's
absolutely about how this system

42:29.180 --> 42:32.216
is structured.

42:32.216 --> 42:36.988
And let me just tell you, Gwen,
what we're dealing with right
now is the fact that
African-Americans

42:36.988 --> 42:41.459
are at the bottom of the
economic food chain. They're in
the mud. They're right alongside

42:41.459 --> 42:44.629
catfish in the Mississippi.

42:44.629 --> 42:50.802
So we have to do something
that's different. We have to
really look at how our system is

42:50.802 --> 42:56.240
structured. Yes, we have been
looking at racial inequity for a
very long time, if you look

42:56.240 --> 43:02.647
at President Truman's freedom
from fear. We were looking at
racial inequity in 1968, when

43:02.647 --> 43:08.686
you had President Johnson
looking at inequity in the
Kerner Commission.

43:08.686 --> 43:13.758
And 47 years later, we're still
talking about racial inequity,
which means we still have

43:13.758 --> 43:20.131
environmental inequity, social
inequity, economic inequity. And
so because all of these things

43:20.131 --> 43:25.570
still are existent and around
means that there is something
fundamentally wrong and flawed

43:25.570 --> 43:29.006
in the structure in which
we are operating right now.

43:29.006 --> 43:32.977
GWEN IFILL: Reverend Wilson, let
me tell you about two things I
found in the report that

43:32.977 --> 43:38.182
surprised me. One is that there
is a 40 percent difference --
40-year difference in life
expectancy

43:38.182 --> 43:41.719
based on what zip
code you live in.

43:41.719 --> 43:46.324
And the other is that 75 -- that
black motorists are 75 percent
more likely to be pulled over

43:46.324 --> 43:54.031
than motorists of the majority
race. I -- those things surprise
me. So what do you do about

43:54.031 --> 43:58.069
that? What does the commission
report do to address those kinds
of issues?

43:58.069 --> 44:00.004
REV. STARSKY WILSON: Yes. The
commission report calls for
several things, particularly as

44:00.004 --> 44:03.074
it relates to policing.

44:03.074 --> 44:09.614
It calls for us to upgrade to
make more robust our racial
profiling law in our state. It

44:09.614 --> 44:14.352
calls for a database on police
incidents, so that we actually
have the data. That's

44:14.352 --> 44:19.190
the great value of this
conversation, is that we have
accumulated some data to hold
people

44:19.190 --> 44:23.160
accountable. That should be
happening in an ongoing way as
relates to police stops in

44:23.160 --> 44:28.833
our state, so we can see where
inequities lie geographically
and demographically.

44:28.833 --> 44:33.938
The application of a racial
equity lens to the various areas
of the report is one of

44:33.938 --> 44:38.976
the things that we think should
be happening with legislation at
every level. But, ultimately,

44:38.976 --> 44:42.446
this takes us back to what
brought us here. It brings us
back to this issue of police

44:42.446 --> 44:47.084
accountability and
oversight, police training.

44:47.084 --> 44:53.057
And so we have made a call as
far back as April, actually, to
increase the required

44:53.057 --> 44:57.328
training under the Peace Officer
Standards and Training
Commission in the state of
Missouri

44:57.328 --> 45:04.702
for officers in counties of our
size that they should go from 41
required hours to 120

45:04.702 --> 45:09.540
required hours in mandated
training in use of force,
cultural competency and officer

45:09.540 --> 45:11.509
wellness.

45:11.509 --> 45:15.379
We're pleased to know that the
commission -- that the
post-commission is moving
towards

45:15.379 --> 45:19.784
that. And with a December 1
deadline, we look forward to
hearing more about that. But we

45:19.784 --> 45:25.022
need to see more police
accountability and oversight
moving in Saint Louis County, in

45:25.022 --> 45:29.727
other areas throughout our
region, as it has been won in
the city of Saint Louis over the

45:29.727 --> 45:32.663
course of the last 12 months,
after folks have been fighting
for it, quite frankly,

45:32.663 --> 45:35.333
for more than 25 years.

45:35.333 --> 45:39.303
GWEN IFILL: Well, Senator
Chappelle-Nadal, picking up on
that point, you are an elected

45:39.303 --> 45:42.873
official. You know the
difference between
recommendation and
implementation. How tough

45:42.873 --> 45:47.378
will it be to take the next
steps called for in this report?

45:47.378 --> 45:50.948
MARIA CHAPPELLE-NADAL: Well, I
have to tell you, I actually
pre-filed a lot of this
legislation

45:50.948 --> 45:53.884
last December.

45:53.884 --> 45:58.756
When it comes to body cameras, I
filed that. When it comes to
ensuring that police officers

45:58.756 --> 46:04.128
get proper training, I filed
that. Special prosecuting
attorney in these kind of cases,

46:04.128 --> 46:09.867
filed that legislation.
Upholding our constitutional
rights, I filed that
legislation.

46:09.867 --> 46:15.139
So I have been dealing with this
for quite a long time. We were
very, very close to passing

46:15.139 --> 46:22.880
the deadly force law. As you may
know, Missouri is 30 years out
of compliance with the U.S.

46:22.880 --> 46:29.487
Supreme Court decision in not
only 1985, but also 1989, which
is the upgrade on what our

46:29.487 --> 46:33.124
deadly force is supposed to
look like legislatively.

46:33.124 --> 46:37.795
So I'm going to continue
fighting for many of the
suggestions that were
recommended that

46:37.795 --> 46:43.000
came out today. A lot of this, I
have already filed, but there
were some good suggestions

46:43.000 --> 46:48.572
that I didn't file that I want
to follow up on, but I really
want to ensure that we are

46:48.572 --> 46:51.942
looking seriously at this.

46:51.942 --> 46:58.249
Literally, we have been talking
about racial inequity for
decades, and Starsky is
absolutely

46:58.249 --> 47:03.954
right. It's going to take
agitation. And we cannot be --
succumb to different interest

47:03.954 --> 47:09.226
groups that are out there who
are trying to water down this
movement, this change in the

47:09.226 --> 47:13.597
system that is so needed right
now, so that individuals can
have trust.

47:13.597 --> 47:15.733
Well, one of the things I
would follow up on, though...

47:15.733 --> 47:19.236
GWEN IFILL: Go ahead.

47:19.236 --> 47:22.506
MARIA CHAPPELLE-NADAL: One of
the things I would follow up on,
though, has to do with

47:22.506 --> 47:26.811
the environment and housing,
as well as education.

47:26.811 --> 47:33.384
I'm ranking member on the
Education Committee. I also
serve on my local school board
simultaneously.

47:33.384 --> 47:39.023
And I feel as though the focus
just on early education really
was a short step. That's

47:39.023 --> 47:44.328
low-hanging fruit, to invest in
early ed. But we have to focus
on children who are at

47:44.328 --> 47:48.165
risk who are in middle school
and who are in high school who
potentially can end up

47:48.165 --> 47:51.001
in the pipeline to prison.

47:51.001 --> 47:53.437
The report didn't talk about
that. And there are other
environmental issues.

47:53.437 --> 47:55.306
(CROSSTALK)

47:55.306 --> 48:00.277
GWEN IFILL: Well, let me ask
Reverend Wilson about, because
one of -- you call for
agitation.

48:00.277 --> 48:04.315
The senator calls for agitation.
I don't think anybody watching
from around the country would

48:04.315 --> 48:08.119
say there has not been enough
agitation in Ferguson.

48:08.119 --> 48:12.990
What stops this report from
ending up on a high shelf
covered in dust?

48:12.990 --> 48:17.228
REV. STARSKY WILSON: First, I
say to the senator, I wholly
agree with her, investment and
engagement

48:17.228 --> 48:20.164
there in early ed.

48:20.164 --> 48:23.768
What we have taken is a broad
approach to young people,
understanding that academics

48:23.768 --> 48:28.339
are one indicator of their
well-being, but they're not the
only indicator of their
well-being,

48:28.339 --> 48:30.775
and stage-appropriate
development is what we're
calling for in the report.

48:30.775 --> 48:33.077
There's actually a very...

48:33.077 --> 48:35.880
GWEN IFILL: But I really want to
ask you about that, the dusty
shelf idea, before we run

48:35.880 --> 48:37.114
out of time.

48:37.114 --> 48:39.450
REV. STARSKY WILSON:
Yes, absolutely.

48:39.450 --> 48:43.220
So, one of the things that we
have done is made the report
shareable, clickable, digital

48:43.220 --> 48:46.824
first, so that people can engage
around it, so that they can come
in and find a place

48:46.824 --> 48:49.927
for them to work in this.

48:49.927 --> 48:54.231
Over the course of the next
three months, we will be working
to find a successor organization

48:54.231 --> 49:00.337
and intermediary to work toward
this common agenda by setting up
shared measurement systems,

49:00.337 --> 49:05.910
assuring mutually reinforcing
activities from several actors
throughout the area, and working

49:05.910 --> 49:10.447
toward driving continuous
communication, which will
include a policy strategy here.

49:10.447 --> 49:13.984
GWEN IFILL: Reverend Starsky
Wilson, co-chairman of the
Ferguson Commission and CEO of
the

49:13.984 --> 49:18.322
Deaconess Foundation, and state
Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal,
thank you both very much.

49:18.322 --> 49:23.994
REV. STARSKY WILSON:
Thank you for having us.

49:23.994 --> 49:27.698
MARIA CHAPPELLE-NADAL:
Thank you.

49:27.698 --> 49:33.137
GWEN IFILL: Later tonight on
PBS, "American Experience" airs
the first half of a two-part

49:33.137 --> 49:37.341
documentary on the life
and work of Walt Disney.

49:37.341 --> 49:41.478
Here's a bit of it, a look at
the weeks of preparation leading
up to the 1955 grand-opening

49:41.478 --> 49:46.984
of the original Disneyland
in Anaheim, California.

49:46.984 --> 49:53.290
NARRATOR: Walt was down in
Anaheim almost every day. He
would walk every inch of the

49:53.290 --> 50:00.564
construction site, barking
orders. "Move that gazebo. It's
blocking the view of the castle.

50:00.564 --> 50:05.736
Can we make that lake bigger?
Move the train wreck 50 feet.
That tree's too close to the

50:05.736 --> 50:14.178
walkway. How about moving it?"
Never mind it weighed 15 tons.

50:14.178 --> 50:24.388
MAN: Walt was literally down
there every day, watching
everything, but never
distraught,

50:24.388 --> 50:32.029
never negative, just urging
everybody on, exploring all the
ways how to fix stuff.

50:32.029 --> 50:37.501
MAN: Walt is interested in every
blade of grass. He's interested
in every leaf on a

50:37.501 --> 50:41.272
tree. He's interested in where
everything is placed. There is
not an attraction that

50:41.272 --> 50:46.710
Walt Disney isn't
deeply involved in.

50:46.710 --> 50:53.617
NARRATOR: Disney's constant
demands put the entire operation
behind the eight ball, as

50:53.617 --> 51:00.190
did his stubborn insistence to
get Disneyland up and running in
a hurry. Six weeks from

51:00.190 --> 51:05.296
its announced opening date,
panic was starting to set in.

51:05.296 --> 51:13.804
The entrance plaza was not yet
landscaped. Main Street was
unpaved, the castle unfinished.

51:13.804 --> 51:21.111
The Jungle Cruise boats were
moving, but the robotic animals
had yet to be installed. As

51:21.111 --> 51:25.482
opening day approached, less
than half of the planned
attractions were ready to
receive

51:25.482 --> 51:33.490
visitors, and members of the
staff were lobbying to push back
the opening.

51:33.490 --> 51:41.165
Walt was uninterested in the
naysayers. He just kept pushing
harder. The construction

51:41.165 --> 51:49.807
crew tripled in the final weeks
to 2,500 men, many of whom were
working 16 hours a day.

51:49.807 --> 51:54.812
Costs climbed to more than $17
million, more than three times
the estimate made when
construction

51:54.812 --> 51:57.281
began.

51:57.281 --> 52:02.586
MAN: So many things were
finished at the last minute.
There was a plumbers strike in
Orange

52:02.586 --> 52:09.159
County which was settled about a
day before Disneyland opened.
So, Walt had the choice

52:09.159 --> 52:15.833
of finishing the bathrooms or
the drinking fountains. And, of
course, he chose the bathrooms.

52:15.833 --> 52:21.038
"People can buy Pepsi cola,"
Disney explained, "but they
can't pee in the street."

52:21.038 --> 52:27.811
MAN: Well, the interesting thing
about Walt, just before the park
was getting ready to

52:27.811 --> 52:36.220
open, he was so excited, like a
proud father. Look what he's got
now. That was Walt at his

52:36.220 --> 52:40.958
best, his enthusiasm of pursuing
where he wanted to go, and
everybody was just going

52:40.958 --> 52:45.829
to follow him right along.

52:45.829 --> 52:51.869
NARRATOR: The park was a bustle
the day before the opening.

52:51.869 --> 52:57.074
ABC was setting its cameras and
running rehearsals for the next
day's broadcast, which was
planned

52:57.074 --> 53:03.747
as the biggest and most
ambitious live telecast ever.
One work crew was frantically
trying

53:03.747 --> 53:10.454
to dig out the 900-pound
mechanical elephant that was
sinking into the Jungle River.
Another

53:10.454 --> 53:15.392
was adding lead weights to the
front of the train engine to
make sure it didn't tip
backward.

53:15.392 --> 53:22.599
Painters were settling in for an
all-nighter. Walt himself put on
a mask and helped spray-paint

53:22.599 --> 53:30.707
backdrops for the 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea exhibit. He was
still at Disneyland at

53:30.707 --> 53:35.679
3:00 in the morning, walking the
grounds, barking orders. "We
need new murals for the

53:35.679 --> 53:42.619
trains. Get me an artist."

53:42.619 --> 53:48.992
GWEN IFILL: Tune in to watch the
entire "American Experience" on
Walt Disney tonight on most

53:48.992 --> 53:52.596
PBS stations.

53:52.596 --> 53:56.834
On the "NewsHour" online: a look
at Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new
year, from columnist Wendy

53:56.834 --> 54:01.638
Thomas Russell. The holiday
began last night and continues
through tomorrow, followed next

54:01.638 --> 54:05.776
week by the Jewish day of
atonement, Yom Kippur. What
makes this time of year so
important?

54:05.776 --> 54:11.482
We have a primer on our home
page, PBS.org/NewsHour.

54:11.482 --> 54:15.052
And we will be back right here
on Tuesday, when we talk to
Germany's ambassador to the

54:15.052 --> 54:18.489
United States about tackling
the refugee crisis.

54:18.489 --> 54:20.524
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Gwen Ifill.

54:20.524 --> 54:22.593
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you, and good
night.
