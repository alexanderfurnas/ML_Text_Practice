JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.573 --> 00:11.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: We sit down with
the U.K. defense secretary to discuss how

00:11.311 --> 00:15.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a growing coalition could change the fight
against ISIS.

00:15.115 --> 00:18.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON, U.K. Defense Secretary: This
was never going to be a quick campaign. It

00:18.752 --> 00:24.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was your own Secretary Kerry who said he thought
the campaign in Iraq might last at least three

00:24.591 --> 00:28.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years, and we're not halfway through that
yet. But progress is being made.

00:28.762 --> 00:33.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then: how Muslims in America
are faring against a climate of fear.

00:33.700 --> 00:37.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AYA LAOFIR, High School Student: As I'm walking,
and I see people, they duck their heads, or

00:37.604 --> 00:42.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when I smile at them, they don't smile back,
I'm just like, oh, is it because I'm wearing

00:42.042 --> 00:44.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
my scarf? Is it because of what's on the news?

00:44.244 --> 00:49.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday. Mark Shields
and David Brooks join us to analyze the week's

00:49.283 --> 00:50.183 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
news.

00:50.217 --> 00:57.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:57.157 --> 01:00.027 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:00.060 --> 01:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. government will remain
open, for now. Congress today sent President

01:10.604 --> 01:16.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama a short-term spending bill to fund agencies
through next Wednesday. The move buys more

01:16.610 --> 01:23.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time to negotiate a $1.1 trillion long-term
tax and spending bill.

01:23.083 --> 01:28.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House lawmakers on both sides remained optimistic
that a budget deal could be reached by next

01:28.388 --> 01:30.223 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. JARED POLIS (D), Colorado: The Republicans
have previously shown this country their willingness

01:31.992 --> 01:37.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to go into a shutdown. So, I hope that we
take this new five-day period to avoid a shutdown

01:37.898 --> 01:41.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
permanently, rather than just to do another
three or five days again and again and again.

01:41.835 --> 01:47.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. TOM COLE (R), Oklahoma: Writing a $1.1
trillion omnibus bill takes a lot of time.

01:47.607 --> 01:52.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's multiple items to be negotiated.
Now, I think both sides is negotiating in

01:52.579 --> 01:56.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
good faith in this legislative body, and I
think the administration is participating

01:56.550 --> 01:58.151 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in good faith.

01:58.185 --> 02:02.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Negotiators remain divided,
though, over additional unrelated provisions

02:02.856 --> 02:07.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that some lawmakers are trying to attach to
the bill. They include new environmental rules

02:07.794 --> 02:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on carbon emissions and efforts to stem the
flow of Syrian refugees into the United States.

02:13.834 --> 02:19.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Two giants in the chemical industry, DuPont
and Dow Chemical, have officially announced

02:19.406 --> 02:26.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're merging. The fusion of two of America's
oldest companies is valued at $130 billion.

02:26.680 --> 02:32.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The new entity will be split into three separate
companies, focused on agriculture, materials,

02:32.586 --> 02:38.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and specialty products. But the deal still
requires the approval of federal regulators.

02:38.191 --> 02:45.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The price of oil plunged to near seven-year
lows today. It closed at $35.62 a barrel in

02:45.565 --> 02:51.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New York, down more than 3 percent. The drop
has been driven by increased U.S. production,

02:51.972 --> 02:57.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an abundant global supply, and the strength
of the U.S. dollar. And it triggered a sell-off

02:57.444 --> 03:06.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average
plummeted over 309 points to close at 17265.

03:06.253 --> 03:11.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell more than 111 points, and
the S&amp;P 500 lost nearly 40 points.

03:11.691 --> 03:18.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the week, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P were
down roughly 4 percent. The Dow fell more

03:18.398 --> 03:20.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than 3 percent.

03:20.367 --> 03:27.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
High-stakes global climate talks on the outskirts
of Paris are dragging into an extra day. Negotiations

03:27.174 --> 03:32.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were scheduled to wrap today, but disagreements
remain over who should bear the most burden

03:32.879 --> 03:39.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in reducing emissions and whether rich countries
should be responsible for most of the cost.

03:39.219 --> 03:45.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Diplomats from over 190 nations were trying
to reach a deal, and the summit's president,

03:45.325 --> 03:49.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, said
the time is right.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAURENT FABIUS, French Foreign Minister (through
translator): All the conditions are there

03:52.332 --> 03:57.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for us to reach a universal, ambitious agreement,
and observers will recognize that the conditions

03:57.504 --> 04:02.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have probably never been so favorable. Now
it's the ministers' responsibility to make

04:02.476 --> 04:04.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their choice tomorrow.

04:04.111 --> 04:08.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fabius is expected to present
a new version of the draft accord Saturday

04:08.982 --> 04:10.684 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
morning.

04:10.717 --> 04:15.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Heightened security measures remained in place
in Geneva, Switzerland today, amid an ongoing

04:15.188 --> 04:21.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hunt for possible terror suspects linked to
the Islamic State. At Geneva's airport, bomb

04:21.261 --> 04:28.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
squads detonated abandoned luggage as a precaution.
A few miles away, armed guards remained vigilant

04:28.668 --> 04:31.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
outside the United Nations building.

04:31.371 --> 04:35.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Officials warned the enhanced security could
last for the foreseeable future.

04:35.075 --> 04:37.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PIERRE MAUDET, Geneva Minister of Economy
and Security (through translator): For us,

04:37.177 --> 04:40.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this is a pretty sustained effort for police
forces. There are actions in several parts

04:41.014 --> 04:45.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the town: bomb alerts, a need to reinforce
police troops, and we have the capacity to

04:45.418 --> 04:47.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
maintain this level for a certain number of
days.

04:47.888 --> 04:52.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Authorities said they're searching
for at least four suspects believed to be

04:52.559 --> 04:58.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plotting a specific attack in the city. Local
news media reported the two Syrian nationals

04:58.732 --> 05:04.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were arrested today in Geneva after traces
of explosives were found in their car, but

05:04.471 --> 05:07.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's not clear if they were linked to the
manhunt.

05:07.874 --> 05:13.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Back in this country, officials are scouring
for red flags they missed before last week's

05:13.046 --> 05:17.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shooting in San Bernardino. The Associated
Press reported that authorities didn't pick

05:17.884 --> 05:23.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up on extremist messages that were exchanged
online between the two killers, Syed Farook

05:23.723 --> 05:26.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Tashfeen Malik, two years ago.

05:26.893 --> 05:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Meanwhile, an FBI dive team again searched
a small lake some three miles from the attack

05:33.633 --> 05:38.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
site, looking for a computer hard drive that
may have been dumped.

05:39.005 --> 05:44.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there were competing court rulings in
New York today over two daily fantasy sports

05:44.311 --> 05:50.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Web sites. At first, a judge banned the sites
DraftKings and FanDuel from doing business

05:50.584 --> 05:55.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the state. That was after New York's attorney
general argued that the games were illegal

05:55.755 --> 06:01.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gambling. But, later, a state appeals court
judge said the sites could continue to operate

06:01.228 --> 06:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for now, while the issue is fully considered.

06:05.532 --> 06:09.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour": the British
defense secretary on joining the fight against

06:09.903 --> 06:17.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS; a swift backlash against Muslims in
America; the human cost of building the nation's

06:17.344 --> 06:31.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nuclear arsenal; and much more.

06:31.391 --> 06:35.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The United States and its coalition partners
have been fighting the Islamic State group

06:35.662 --> 06:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for 16 months to beat back the group's gains
in both Syria and Iraq.

06:40.934 --> 06:46.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At the same time, Syria's many-sided civil
war continues unabated. Russia has inserted

06:46.973 --> 06:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
itself to support the regime of its ally President
Bashar al-Assad. And last week, the United

06:52.912 --> 06:58.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kingdom said that it would join the U.S. and
France in bombing Islamic State in Syria as

06:58.885 --> 07:02.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the militant group has begun attacks on the
West.

07:02.255 --> 07:07.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All this comes as a major diplomatic push
to end the nearly-five-year-old brutal war

07:07.661 --> 07:12.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is under way, and the American and British
defense secretaries at the Pentagon.

07:12.132 --> 07:16.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense Secretary: We
will defeat ISIL, and we will ensure that

07:16.836 --> 07:18.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they stay defeated.

07:18.605 --> 07:23.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary of Defense Ash Carter
hosted his British counterpart, Michael Fallon,

07:24.010 --> 07:28.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to chart the coalition's progress in the campaign
against the Islamic State group.

07:28.715 --> 07:35.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fallon said British sorties have been aimed
at ISIS fighters and the oil fields the group

07:35.121 --> 07:41.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
uses, in part, to finance itself. After the
Paris attacks, as France began airstrikes

07:41.394 --> 07:49.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Syria, Britain's Parliament approved expanding
the U.K.'s existing Iraq air campaign into

07:49.202 --> 07:51.071 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Syria as well.

07:51.104 --> 07:57.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Meanwhile, today in Moscow, Russian President
Vladimir Putin spoke about his country's war

07:57.610 --> 08:04.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Syria. For the first time, he said that
Russian aircraft are now helping a rebel group,

08:04.651 --> 08:06.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army.

08:06.920 --> 08:10.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian President (through
translator): The activities of our aviation

08:10.190 --> 08:14.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
group assists in uniting the efforts of government
troops and the Free Syrian Army.

08:14.694 --> 08:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in Washington, State Department
spokesman John Kirby said those claims were

08:19.999 --> 08:26.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unverified, but noted that, in the past, Russia
has targeted those groups. Fallon echoed Kirby

08:26.906 --> 08:28.541 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on that point.

08:28.575 --> 08:30.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON, U.K. Defense Secretary: What
they have got to do is stop propping up the

08:30.810 --> 08:36.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Assad regime, stop bombing opposition groups
who are opposed to the Assad regime, stop

08:36.516 --> 08:43.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dropping unguided munitions on innocent villages
and groups who have been fighting Assad, and

08:44.023 --> 08:47.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get behind the political process that is now
under way.

08:47.260 --> 08:52.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Earlier today, I sat down with
Britain's defense secretary to discuss the

08:52.132 --> 08:57.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
war effort at the residence of the British
ambassador here in Washington.

08:57.670 --> 09:00.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Defense Secretary Michael Fallon, thank you
very much for talking with us.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Good morning.

09:01.908 --> 09:05.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, for Americans who weren't
following closely the vote in your Parliament

09:05.512 --> 09:13.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last week to authorize the expansion of airstrikes
against ISIS from Iraq into Syria, what was

09:13.620 --> 09:20.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it that led to the decision to go against
what had seemed to be an anti-interventionist

09:20.627 --> 09:22.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
policy in your country?

09:22.395 --> 09:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, I think a growing recognition
that this border between Iraq and Syria is

09:26.566 --> 09:32.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not recognized by ISIL itself, and it's completely
artificial and rather odd to be carrying out

09:33.006 --> 09:37.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
airstrikes on one side of the border, but
the Royal Air Force having to turn back at

09:37.343 --> 09:40.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the border and not follow through the other
side of the border.

09:40.680 --> 09:46.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was also a response to France and the United
States and other countries that wanted Britain

09:46.352 --> 09:51.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to step up its contribution to the campaign.
And I'm delighted we're now able to do that.

09:51.558 --> 09:56.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have doubled the number of strike aircraft
that we have in theater. And we're upping

09:56.162 --> 09:57.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the tempo of our missions.

09:57.831 --> 10:01.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You started the air campaign
right away, after the vote. It just happened

10:01.501 --> 10:06.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
within hours. What have been the main targets
and how successful has it been so far?

10:06.439 --> 10:11.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: We have focused those strikes
very much on the infrastructure that supports

10:11.444 --> 10:19.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS, the oil wells, for example, the supply
routes, the depots, the arms dumps, the logistics,

10:19.419 --> 10:24.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the command and control, because we need to
degrade the infrastructure and the revenue

10:24.757 --> 10:26.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that supports the supporting organization.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Has it been -- how successful
has it been?

10:29.095 --> 10:31.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: The strikes we have carried
out so far have been successful. They have

10:31.664 --> 10:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been mainly in the oil fields of Eastern Syria.
We have been hitting oil wellheads, and those

10:37.203 --> 10:39.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
strikes, yes, have been successful.

10:39.172 --> 10:46.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The question then arises, there's
been an air campaign in Iraq against ISIS

10:46.412 --> 10:53.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a year or more. There's been some progress,
but it's been limited. What makes you believe

10:53.219 --> 10:58.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that expanding into Syria, that this campaign
is going to be any more successful?

10:58.391 --> 11:02.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, this was never going
to be a quick campaign. It was your own Secretary

11:02.395 --> 11:07.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kerry who said he thought the campaign in
Iraq might last at least three years, and

11:07.867 --> 11:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're not halfway through that yet, but progress
is being made.

11:11.170 --> 11:16.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But can ISIS be defeated with
an air campaign? Are ground forces going to

11:16.843 --> 11:20.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be necessary for this to work in the end?

11:20.446 --> 11:24.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, ground forces are being
deployed in Iraq, where there is the Iraqi

11:24.217 --> 11:30.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
army, there are Kurdish forces who are helping
to liberate these towns, like Tikrit and Baiji,

11:30.523 --> 11:34.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which have already fallen. And ISIL have been
pushed back out of those towns.

11:34.861 --> 11:39.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, we want eventually the same to happen
on the Syrian side of this very artificial

11:39.532 --> 11:46.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
line. But, meantime, there's a lot that airstrikes
can do to help cut off ISIS' source of revenue

11:46.673 --> 11:50.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and to help squeeze the noose around its headquarters
in Raqqa.

11:50.710 --> 11:56.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, when is the right time
for there to be a larger ground force presence

11:56.115 --> 12:00.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Syria, and will Britain be part of that,
will the U.K. be part of that?

12:00.653 --> 12:04.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: We're not going to put our
own troops on the ground there. And, indeed,

12:04.791 --> 12:08.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Iraq, they have made it very clear they
don't want British or even -- with respect,

12:08.127 --> 12:12.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they don't want American troops there, because
they feel that would simply radicalize Sunni

12:12.498 --> 12:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
opinion even more.

12:14.267 --> 12:20.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the end, this has to be done -- this territory
has to be liberated and held by local forces

12:20.306 --> 12:26.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that enjoy the confidence of the local community,
particularly the Sunni areas. And that has

12:26.512 --> 12:31.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be done locally. And the way to do that
is to bring the civil war to an end and to

12:31.217 --> 12:36.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
use moderate Syrian groups to help defeat
ISIS up in the northeast corner.

12:36.823 --> 12:40.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But hasn't that been a goal
for a long time, and it just hasn't been achieved?

12:40.526 --> 12:44.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, just in the last few
months, we have seen real progress there,

12:44.530 --> 12:49.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everybody involved now coming together, a
conference in Saudi Arabia this week, just

12:49.469 --> 12:54.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this week, bringing all the parties involved,
and countries like Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia

12:54.974 --> 13:01.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that all have an interest now beginning to
think their way through to a new Syria that

13:01.447 --> 13:03.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is without Assad.

13:03.049 --> 13:07.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Assad, President Assad,
shows no desire whatsoever to leave. He's

13:07.754 --> 13:14.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been supported completely by Russia and by
Iran. Is there new indication that that support

13:14.994 --> 13:17.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has changed, is falling away?

13:17.363 --> 13:21.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Yes, we're beginning to see
signs that that is weakening. People are beginning

13:21.100 --> 13:26.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to think their way towards a different kind
of Syria and recognize that he can't be part

13:26.939 --> 13:28.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the long-term future.

13:28.675 --> 13:33.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is Russia's involvement militarily
in Syria helping this campaign or hurting

13:33.980 --> 13:35.581 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

13:35.615 --> 13:38.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: It's extremely unhelpful,
because, of course, they came into the civil

13:38.051 --> 13:44.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
war, and they have been bombing moderate opposition
groups that have been standing up to Assad,

13:44.057 --> 13:47.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
instead of attacking ISIS alongside the rest
of us.

13:47.326 --> 13:50.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you about domestic
terrorism.

13:50.596 --> 13:56.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Your country has -- saw the real threat of
domestic terrorism well before the United

13:56.903 --> 14:03.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States did with this most recent attack in
San Bernardino. What lessons has Great Britain,

14:04.010 --> 14:07.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has the United Kingdom learned from your own
experience?

14:07.046 --> 14:11.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, we have seen these -- alongside
your own shooting, we have had these terrible

14:11.384 --> 14:17.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shootings in Paris just two hours away from
us, and earlier in the summer, we had 30 of

14:17.123 --> 14:21.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our own holiday-makers slaughtered on a beach
in Tunisia.

14:21.360 --> 14:28.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So this is very real to us. These attacks
are directed, organized, inspired, financed

14:28.301 --> 14:33.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from ISIS in its headquarters in Syria. And
that's one reason why we have now committed

14:33.539 --> 14:38.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ourselves to this campaign in full across
both Iraq and Syria.

14:38.277 --> 14:43.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about those individuals
who are inspired, who may not be directed

14:43.483 --> 14:50.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by ISIS, but who are inspired by their message,
by their philosophy to commit acts of terror

14:50.156 --> 14:51.758 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in your country?

14:51.791 --> 14:56.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, we have a program of
-- aimed at tackling radicalization. We call

14:56.062 --> 15:02.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it the Prevent program to try and identify
much earlier those who are likely to end up

15:02.168 --> 15:08.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as potential terrorists, to identify them
in the schools, at the colleges, in the madrasas,

15:08.441 --> 15:14.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and working with moderate Muslim communities
to see who these people are and see what we

15:14.413 --> 15:20.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can do to make sure they don't go along that
journey of being mildly, mildly Islamist to

15:20.686 --> 15:22.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being extreme.

15:22.588 --> 15:30.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think it's widely accepted
that there has been a greater effort to integrate

15:30.930 --> 15:38.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Muslims into U.S. society than there has been
in European countries, including the U.K.

15:38.437 --> 15:45.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are there lessons that your country is learning
from the U.S. about integrating Muslims into

15:45.444 --> 15:49.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
society that makes you stronger when it comes
to standing up to this extremist...

15:49.682 --> 15:53.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, that is exactly the
challenge.

15:53.152 --> 15:58.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The United States is a great open society,
and you have found a way of embracing different

15:58.758 --> 16:05.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
faiths and different immigrants from different
countries and making them all Americans. And

16:05.631 --> 16:10.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we need to work harder than that -- about
that in Western Europe, and avoiding the kind

16:10.703 --> 16:17.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of ghettoization of different groups that
can lead to these tensions, and make it more

16:17.076 --> 16:20.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
difficult to challenge extremist behavior
later on.

16:20.413 --> 16:26.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary of Defense Michael
Fallon, we thank you for talking with us.

16:26.419 --> 16:34.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Thank you.

16:34.927 --> 16:43.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we get the perspective
of those Muslims in America, a community under

16:43.302 --> 16:45.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
assault in the wake of recent attacks.

16:46.005 --> 16:50.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just this afternoon, there was a fire at a
mosque in Southern California. The imam said

16:50.676 --> 16:54.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there was a loud boom, and the building had
been firebombed.

16:54.447 --> 16:58.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is the latest in a string of violence directed
at Muslims.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s P.J. Tobia has our story.

17:00.686 --> 17:08.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AYA LAOFIR, High School Student: I pray five
times a day, which I don't get to do at school,

17:08.394 --> 17:13.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but I come home and pray. I do my homework,
read a little bit, and then I go to bed.

17:13.733 --> 17:19.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Fifteen-year-old Aya Laofir, is
just like any other American teenager. At

17:19.038 --> 17:21.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
school, being Muslim just isn't a big deal.

17:21.674 --> 17:26.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AYA LAOFIR: Overall, I think, you know, school
is good when it comes to me and my scarf.

17:26.979 --> 17:30.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: But on the way home, sometimes,
there is trouble.

17:30.716 --> 17:35.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AYA LAOFIR: There is this man who sits on
the sidewalk sometimes, and he starts, you

17:35.554 --> 17:39.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, harassing -- well, not harassing me,
well, calling me names and telling me to go

17:39.892 --> 17:41.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back to my country.

17:41.527 --> 17:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: She lives in Northern Virginia,
one of the most culturally diverse regions

17:44.597 --> 17:46.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the nation, according to the last census.

17:46.265 --> 17:50.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AYA LAOFIR: As I'm walking, and I see people,
they duck their heads, or when I smile at

17:50.369 --> 17:54.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them, they don't smile back, I'm just like,
oh, is it because I'm wearing my scarf? Is

17:54.340 --> 17:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it because of what's on the news?

17:56.008 --> 17:59.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: What's on the news is a series
of terrorist attacks, most recently in Paris,

17:59.645 --> 18:04.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
France, and San Bernardino, California, killings
in the name of the Islamic State.

18:04.617 --> 18:09.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In response, the temperature of America's
political climate is rising. Leading Republican

18:09.288 --> 18:14.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidential candidate Donald Trump has proposed
to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering

18:14.293 --> 18:19.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the country, a policy which one in four Americans
now support, according to an NBC poll.

18:19.665 --> 18:24.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's not just Trump. Other leading GOP
candidates have also made comments that have

18:24.437 --> 18:30.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
upset American Muslims. As a result, many
like Aya, now feel unsafe.

18:30.676 --> 18:34.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Irving, Texas, one group has been holding
regular protests in front of an Islamic center

18:34.914 --> 18:40.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
since late November, brandishing semiautomatic
rifles, some wearing masks. The protesters

18:40.486 --> 18:44.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want to stop what they call the Islamization
of America.

18:44.256 --> 18:48.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Pittsburgh, a Moroccan immigrant taxi driver
was shot after his passenger asked him about

18:48.627 --> 18:52.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Islamic State. And in Northern Virginia,
this outburst happened at a community meeting

18:53.032 --> 18:54.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for a planned Islamic center.

18:54.767 --> 19:01.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Nobody, nobody, nobody wants your evil
cult in this county. And I'll tell you. Let

19:01.574 --> 19:02.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
me tell you what.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.443 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

19:04.477 --> 19:07.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: I will do everything in my power to make
sure that doesn't -- does not happen.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: We don't want it.

19:09.615 --> 19:12.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Because you are terrorists. Every one
of you are terrorists. I don't care what you

19:12.918 --> 19:14.587 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
say.

19:14.620 --> 19:17.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: A recent New York Times/CBS poll
found Americans more worried about a terrorist

19:17.890 --> 19:23.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attack than at any time since 9/11, worries
that are also present in Muslim communities

19:23.362 --> 19:25.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the country.

19:25.064 --> 19:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Aya's family mosque, the Dar Al-Hijrah Center,
has been the target of violence. Last month,

19:29.835 --> 19:34.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
someone threw smoke bombs and a Molotov cocktail
over the fence in the middle of the night.

19:34.473 --> 19:38.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The mosque's leader, Imam Johari Abdul-Malik,
says they have been through this before and

19:38.978 --> 19:40.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
could almost see the violence coming.

19:40.813 --> 19:48.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IMAM JOHARI ABDUL-MALIK, Dar Al-Hijrah Center:
We have this sense of a rising anti-Muslim-specific

19:48.521 --> 19:56.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intolerance after the Paris attacks. This
community immediately went on high alert in

19:56.862 --> 19:58.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
preparation for a backlash.

19:59.031 --> 20:04.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Imam Johari invited us to stay
after evening prayers to speak with congregants.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Theraiah Hussein (ph) is a mother of six.

20:06.705 --> 20:12.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Everything changed, even starting from
my kids' school, because that's what we care

20:12.178 --> 20:16.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about, being called terrorists, being called
ISIS, and being called bad names. And that's

20:16.582 --> 20:18.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what really killed me.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALIK OSMAN, Student: Somebody just called
me a terrorist because they saw me walking.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: An adult person or another kid?

20:24.023 --> 20:30.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALIK OSMAN: A child. I was really scared
from then on. And that's why I don't wear

20:30.763 --> 20:32.398 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a head scarf.

20:32.431 --> 20:37.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: So, you don't wear a head scarf
because someone called you a terrorist? How

20:37.503 --> 20:39.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
does that make you feel?

20:39.472 --> 20:53.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALIK OSMAN: It makes me feel really angry,
like, awkward.

20:53.319 --> 21:02.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Aya's father, Badr, watched with
dread as the news of the San Bernardino attacks

21:02.828 --> 21:04.430 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unfolded.

21:04.463 --> 21:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BADR LAOFIR, Father of Aya: We start praying
-- inside, I'm sure you would be doing the

21:07.700 --> 21:13.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
same thing -- that the shooter is not a Muslim,
but, of course, he's a Muslim. So, another

21:13.072 --> 21:19.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wave is going to start, and people, the media,
and every time, like every time.

21:19.411 --> 21:24.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Badr is vigilant about his family.
He has a strategy for the simplest of tasks,

21:24.216 --> 21:25.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like the neighborhood walk.

21:25.851 --> 21:31.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BADR LAOFIR: I tell my wife and my daughter,
if she walks, she doesn't -- she needs to

21:31.690 --> 21:39.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
walk when a lot of people are around. And
a parking lot here, she's always with one

21:39.598 --> 21:46.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the -- my kids, always cell phone on hand.
Sometimes, people can attack you and follow

21:46.071 --> 21:49.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you and attack you even if -- in the place
where you live in.

21:49.241 --> 21:51.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EDWIN ROESSLER, Fairfax County, Virginia,
Police Chief: Where there is fear and anxiety,

21:51.744 --> 21:56.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the role of law enforcement is to come in,
and to alleviate that and provide a sense

21:56.448 --> 21:58.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of security.

21:58.250 --> 22:01.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Fairfax County Police Chief Edwin
Roessler says after an attack like San Bernardino,

22:01.987 --> 22:03.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
local law enforcement must be proactive.

22:03.722 --> 22:09.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EDWIN ROESSLER: And we contact the mosque
and we say, we're going to increase patrols.

22:09.094 --> 22:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you want us to show up at events? And it's
a two-way partnership.

22:13.532 --> 22:17.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Public officials across the U.S.
have asked the Muslim community to take a

22:17.469 --> 22:22.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lead role in addressing the issue of radicalization,
including President Obama in a prime-time

22:22.608 --> 22:24.310 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
address.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States:
Muslim leaders here and around the globe have

22:26.011 --> 22:31.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to continue working with us to decisively
and unequivocally reject the hateful ideology

22:31.584 --> 22:33.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that groups like ISIL and al-Qaida promote.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Not everyone agrees.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROSA RAD, Washington, D.C., Resident: I find
it to be incredibly offensive.

22:37.223 --> 22:40.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Rosa Rad, 23, lives in a trendy
Washington, D.C., neighborhood.

22:40.759 --> 22:45.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROSA RAD: To have to be, like, vigilant and
have to be super aware of what's going on

22:45.497 --> 22:50.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is bizarre. I don't see any other communities
being given that responsibility. And I think

22:50.569 --> 22:54.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everyone needs to be vigilant and to be aware.
By singling out the Muslim community, you're

22:54.406 --> 23:01.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not doing anything but perpetuating that negative
-- negative view that people already probably

23:01.380 --> 23:02.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
already have towards Muslims.

23:03.015 --> 23:07.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: The vitriol has even been felt
outside of Muslim communities. In Manassas,

23:07.219 --> 23:12.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Virginia, about 30 miles West of Washington,
D.C., the local mosque has been repeatedly

23:12.191 --> 23:16.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vandalized. After the San Bernardino attacks,
a death threat was phoned in.

23:16.128 --> 23:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has made some non-Muslim residents more
than a little uncomfortable. Patty Reed works

23:21.300 --> 23:22.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at a local hardware store.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PATTY REED, Virginia: Gosh, it just makes
us look like a bunch of rednecks. I'm going

23:25.738 --> 23:30.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be honest. And I don't like it. Why we
wouldn't be able to talk to these people,

23:30.643 --> 23:32.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
talk to -- you know, voice our concerns?

23:32.878 --> 23:37.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: But many are scared, saying recent
events have them on edge.

23:37.082 --> 23:40.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: If you're somebody who is doing the
right thing and you're here in the right way,

23:40.919 --> 23:45.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then it truly isn't fair to you. But things
happen. You know, it isn't fair to us what's

23:45.190 --> 23:51.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going on either, but -- or those people that
died, but it's what's going on in the world

23:51.163 --> 23:52.831 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

23:52.865 --> 23:56.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: But inside the vandalized Manassas
Mosque, its leader, Imam Abu Nahidian, says

23:56.835 --> 23:59.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he has used the moment to teach faith and
acceptance.

23:59.471 --> 24:05.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IMAM ABU NAHIDIAN, Manassas Mosque: Remember,
it takes two to tango. Both hand has to make

24:05.277 --> 24:11.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a noise. One hand has -- if one side is a
little bit off the track, go with them, be

24:11.116 --> 24:18.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind to them. These are the orders of the
holy Koran. All of them -- it's loaded with

24:18.891 --> 24:24.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them. Therefore, we have to go ahead and talk
to them that the reason that you're scared

24:24.363 --> 24:30.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of me is you, not me. I didn't do anything
to scare you, so take that away from your

24:30.736 --> 24:32.304 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
heart.

24:32.338 --> 24:35.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: In fact, he says the events of
the recent weeks have revealed some of the

24:35.207 --> 24:40.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
best of this rural community. This bouquet
of flowers, like the threatening phone call,

24:40.612 --> 24:43.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
came from an anonymous sender, but with a
different message.

24:43.782 --> 24:48.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"You don't know me," the card reads. "As a
white Christian, please know that my family

24:48.787 --> 24:50.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will continue to stand with yours."

24:50.522 --> 24:55.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Meanwhile, high school freshman Aya Laofir
has taken to writing poetry in response to

24:55.961 --> 24:57.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the hate.

24:57.629 --> 25:03.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AYA LAOFIR: "So, Donald Trump, come forth
and into the light. Open your eyes and heart.

25:03.635 --> 25:07.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the United States of America. Do not
start tearing it apart."

25:07.439 --> 25:17.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm P.J.
Tobia in Washington.

25:17.683 --> 25:27.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

25:27.493 --> 25:32.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": Paul Ryan's first
major fight as speaker, to prevent a government

25:32.831 --> 25:37.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shutdown; and Mark Shields and David Brooks
analyze this week's news.

25:37.302 --> 25:42.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, first, a new investigation that examines
casualties of the Cold War, and the scope

25:42.908 --> 25:48.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of those injured or killed while working with
or around nuclear material.

25:48.313 --> 25:53.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the focus of a series of reports out
today from McClatchy News. Reporters in 10

25:53.952 --> 25:59.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
states spent a year chronicling and documenting
what happened to workers in the U.S. nuclear

25:59.725 --> 26:04.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
facilities from the 1940s right up until today.

26:04.096 --> 26:08.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story, and he recorded
this conversation a short time ago.

26:08.400 --> 26:12.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: McClatchy's team found the
federal government had never fully reveal

26:12.171 --> 26:16.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the true toll of what happened to men and
women working at nuclear facilities.

26:16.041 --> 26:21.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Back in 2001, the government set up a compensation
fund for some of those workers. The investigation

26:21.580 --> 26:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
found that more than 33,000 of them have died
from related illnesses. That's more than four

26:26.452 --> 26:30.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
times the number of Americans killed in the
Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

26:30.355 --> 26:35.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there were more than 100,000 Americans
diagnosed with cancer and other diseases after

26:35.527 --> 26:39.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helping to build the country's nuclear stockpile
over the decades.

26:39.498 --> 26:43.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lindsay Wise is one of the leading reporters
on the McClatchy team. She joins me now.

26:43.535 --> 26:45.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you.

26:45.204 --> 26:49.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Want to fill in the picture first. What kind
of work and workers were most impacted, most

26:49.741 --> 26:51.376 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exposed?

26:51.410 --> 26:52.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LINDSAY WISE, McClatchy Washington Bureau:
Well, these were workers at plants, more than

26:52.377 --> 26:55.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
300 plants all over the country.

26:55.247 --> 27:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They did everything from pipe fitting and
production work, blue-collar work, to nuclear

27:02.120 --> 27:09.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
physicists and scientists. And we even found
in our database some CEOs who ran the contracting

27:09.995 --> 27:11.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
companies that managed the plant.

27:11.697 --> 27:17.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You refer to this as a hidden
legacy. It's a little known casualty of the

27:17.336 --> 27:19.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Cold War, but how much was known?

27:20.005 --> 27:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LINDSAY WISE: Well, this is what I found so
interesting working on this project, which

27:23.542 --> 27:28.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was that I feel like when we talk about the
Cold War and the history of the Cold War,

27:28.146 --> 27:32.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we often talk about it as though it was a
war without any casualties, without any American

27:32.117 --> 27:33.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
casualties.

27:33.752 --> 27:38.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what we were able to do at McClatchy is
we obtained a database from the Department

27:38.056 --> 27:42.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Labor for the compensation program, and
we were able to crunch the numbers and analyze

27:42.828 --> 27:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the data, and find the number of people who
had applied and then been compensated for

27:48.500 --> 27:50.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
illnesses and died.

27:50.435 --> 27:55.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so that told us that there were people
who gave their lives as part of the Cold War.

27:55.207 --> 27:59.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And within the scientific community,
within the government over the decades, how

27:59.711 --> 28:01.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much awareness, how much study had been going
on?

28:01.880 --> 28:07.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LINDSAY WISE: I think that, when this program
was created in 2001, there had been some awareness

28:07.786 --> 28:15.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Congress leading up to, and it was created
through the efforts of the Clinton administration

28:15.327 --> 28:18.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to compensate workers who had become ill.

28:18.230 --> 28:22.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It started to become apparent that many of
these workers had been exposed to dangerous

28:22.901 --> 28:27.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
subjects, radioactivity and other toxins,
without realizing it or without knowing the

28:27.072 --> 28:30.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
full extent of the health hazards that they
were facing.

28:30.342 --> 28:34.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so once that started to come to light
through some research of some reporters, The

28:34.646 --> 28:39.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Washington Post and other places, there was
pressure in Congress to pass a fund to compensate

28:39.484 --> 28:40.752 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the workers.

28:40.786 --> 28:43.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, you went and talked to
many of those workers.

28:43.355 --> 28:48.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you found a mix of pride in the work they
had done, right, but also bitterness in some

28:49.027 --> 28:51.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cases over what they didn't know.

28:51.330 --> 28:56.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you did -- we have a clip of one of the
workers. He's from the Hanford site. His name

28:56.234 --> 29:01.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is Tom Peterson. And he was exposed to levels
of beryllium. Explain first what beryllium

29:01.673 --> 29:03.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is, and then we will watch that clip.

29:03.108 --> 29:06.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LINDSAY WISE: Beryllium is a hazardous metal
used in weapons production.

29:06.545 --> 29:12.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it -- machined or worked with, it can
produce byproducts of dust that can be inhaled

29:12.250 --> 29:16.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the workers. And there was a long time
where I don't think the full dangers of beryllium

29:16.154 --> 29:21.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were understood. And workers have been exposed
to this dust. And when they breathe it in,

29:21.893 --> 29:24.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there are some people who have an allergic
reaction.

29:24.129 --> 29:29.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this creates scarring in their lungs,
so that they develop a -- many of them develop

29:29.568 --> 29:31.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a serious respiratory disease from that, that
can be fatal.

29:31.670 --> 29:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, let's look at that
clip.

29:33.772 --> 29:41.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOM PETERSON, Former Ironworker: I started
working in Hanford in 1978 as an ironworker.

29:41.780 --> 29:45.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nobody knew they were being exposed to beryllium
or what the consequences are.

29:45.751 --> 29:53.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: So, the beryllium hazards were not well-recognized
early on. The problem is that some people

29:53.258 --> 29:56.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are susceptible to very small amounts of beryllium.

29:56.228 --> 30:00.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOM PETERSON: All of a sudden, I couldn't
finish mowing the lawn. I couldn't breathe.

30:00.132 --> 30:03.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Come to find out beryllium is all over the
Hanford site.

30:03.669 --> 30:09.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This legacy of beryllium contamination that
nobody knew anything about, they kept quiet

30:09.541 --> 30:15.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about. Your future is not real bright, but
it would have been nice to have been told

30:15.113 --> 30:18.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about beryllium before we found out at a meeting.

30:18.750 --> 30:23.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, this compensation fund
has run into various kinds of criticism. Right?

30:23.789 --> 30:28.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not enough, some people think. It's too
bureaucratic, some people think.

30:28.794 --> 30:34.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And on the other hand, there is some cases
where the suggestion is, there is overcompensation,

30:34.132 --> 30:36.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because the direct link hasn't been proven.

30:36.501 --> 30:40.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LINDSAY WISE: I think that in order for Congress
to create this compensation program, they

30:41.006 --> 30:47.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
did have -- the Department of Energy did have
to submit studies to show that workers in

30:47.546 --> 30:52.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the nuclear facilities around the country
were susceptible to higher rates of cancers

30:52.951 --> 30:55.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and non-malignant diseases.

30:55.420 --> 30:59.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of the things we did when we looked at
this data was, we really looked at the government's

30:59.825 --> 31:06.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
threshold for deciding a claim was valid that
it was more likely than not that a worker

31:06.832 --> 31:09.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had gotten sick from something they did on
the job. And we used those numbers to come

31:10.001 --> 31:11.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up with the death statistics.

31:11.703 --> 31:16.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you, finally, you're
looking at past experience, but this is very

31:16.742 --> 31:21.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relevant still, right, because of a major
modernization program under way.

31:21.580 --> 31:27.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What lessons learned either by you or by -- more
importantly, I guess, by the government and

31:27.586 --> 31:29.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by the people doing this kind of work still?

31:29.955 --> 31:34.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LINDSAY WISE: Well, we took a look at not
just the workers from the past who worked

31:34.359 --> 31:38.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the Manhattan Project or the Cold War,
but also right up to the present day.

31:38.663 --> 31:46.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what we found was that there were 186,000
workers in today -- since the program was

31:46.772 --> 31:53.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
created who work in weapons plants and research
facilities today that are -- had been exposed

31:53.712 --> 31:58.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to registerable levels of radiation just day
to day.

31:58.817 --> 32:04.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And some of those people have exceeded the
limit for -- that the Department of Energy

32:04.256 --> 32:09.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had set as safe. Other workers we spoke to
were concerned that they were given -- they

32:09.761 --> 32:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were told that their dosage from certain accidents
or exposures was a certain amount, but they

32:14.666 --> 32:19.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
felt that they were either being lied to or
that documents and records had been falsified.

32:19.604 --> 32:25.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we did find, when we reviewed contractor
misconduct, files that there were some cases

32:25.143 --> 32:30.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where contractors had falsified radiation
records of workers right up until -- I think

32:30.248 --> 32:32.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the most recent case we looked at was 2013.

32:32.050 --> 32:34.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, an ongoing situation.

32:34.686 --> 32:35.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LINDSAY WISE: Mm-hmm.

32:35.921 --> 32:36.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Lindsay Wise of McClatchy News,
thanks so much.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LINDSAY WISE: Thank you.

32:38.223 --> 32:42.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two key federal agencies responded
to the "NewsHour" after Jeff's interview.

32:42.794 --> 32:47.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Department of Energy praised workers for
their sacrifices and said its safety record

32:47.566 --> 32:52.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has improved due to better monitoring and
new protective limits at its sites and those

32:52.671 --> 32:54.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of its contractors.

32:54.372 --> 32:59.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Department of Labor said that its processing
of compensation claims is faster now, with

32:59.411 --> 33:04.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many of the cases resolved within 180 days.
The department also said that it has paid

33:04.749 --> 33:14.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over $12 billion to more than 100,000 people
to -- quote -- "compensate for their suffering."

33:14.793 --> 33:23.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over $12 billion to more than 100,000 people
to -- quote -- "compensate for their suffering."

33:23.501 --> 33:28.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now we turn to newly-elected speaker of the
House of Representatives, Republican Paul

33:28.373 --> 33:30.075 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ryan.

33:30.108 --> 33:34.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He promises to overhaul internal House procedures,
giving rank-and-file members more say. And

33:34.946 --> 33:40.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's laying out an agenda for his party. Ryan
is already facing one of his biggest challenges,

33:40.452 --> 33:42.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
keeping the government running.

33:42.320 --> 33:44.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Our political director, Lisa Desjardins, reports.

33:44.322 --> 33:48.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the House:
What's next?

33:48.326 --> 33:53.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Paul Ryan is on a roll. In
his first four working weeks, the new speaker

33:53.365 --> 33:59.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presided over passage of a $600 billion defense
bill, a plan to tighten screening of Syrian

33:59.971 --> 34:06.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refugees, and a five-year highway bill, the
types of big controversial bills that had

34:06.344 --> 34:09.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been stuck in Capitol gridlock sometimes for
years.

34:09.381 --> 34:13.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN: I became speaker just over
a month ago, and I would like to think we

34:13.518 --> 34:18.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have hit the ground running. We are dealing
with everything from highways, to ISIS, to

34:18.757 --> 34:20.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
funding the government.

34:20.358 --> 34:24.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This wasn't the plan for
the 45-year-old from Wisconsin. He'd just

34:24.262 --> 34:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
started his dream job as chairman of the tax-writing
Ways and Means Committee. But the father of

34:29.234 --> 34:35.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
three young children agreed to become speaker,
thanks to two chaotic weeks when sharply divided

34:35.507 --> 34:38.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Republicans could not agree on anyone else.

34:38.176 --> 34:43.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN: Thursday was a great day.
Thursday was a day where we came together

34:43.515 --> 34:48.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as a conference and unified, and agreed to
proceed together with a vision.

34:48.787 --> 34:54.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And his vision is about ideas.
Ryan is a student of political philosophy,

34:54.426 --> 34:59.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
influenced by his mentor, the late conservative
Jack Kemp, who saw free markets and tax cuts

34:59.197 --> 35:05.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the best antidotes to poverty, and Ayn
Rand, the divisive author who stressed individualism.

35:05.837 --> 35:10.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ryan is an admirer, but has been careful to
say he doesn't fully embrace her philosophy.

35:10.709 --> 35:15.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is a bootstraps conservative, setting out
to retool not just the Republican House, but

35:15.714 --> 35:17.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Republican agenda itself.

35:17.449 --> 35:23.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN: Put together a positive agenda,
and take it to the American people. Give the

35:23.288 --> 35:26.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people of this country the choice that they
have been yearning for.

35:26.524 --> 35:31.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But as Ryan aims to win Americans'
confidence, Democrats say he is dangerous.

35:31.730 --> 35:36.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D), Maryland: He is
more hard-edged ideologically than Speaker

35:36.368 --> 35:41.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Boehner was. Speaker Boehner was a rock-ribbed
-- rock-ribbed conservative. Paul Ryan had

35:41.906 --> 35:43.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sharper ideological edges.

35:43.842 --> 35:49.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Congressman Chris Van Hollen
may be the Democrat who knows Ryan the best,

35:49.114 --> 35:53.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after four years of working as his Democratic
counterpart on the House Budget Committee.

35:53.585 --> 35:58.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Van Hollen says Ryan's agenda is extreme,
including his Medicare plan that would end

35:58.523 --> 36:03.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the senior health care program as it exists
now and replace it with limited-amount vouchers.

36:03.428 --> 36:09.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: It would do great damage
to Medicare. It would end the Medicare guarantee.

36:09.467 --> 36:14.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Ryan argues that, without
such changes, Medicare will go bankrupt. It's

36:14.272 --> 36:19.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a pragmatic, mathematical view. And that wins
him love from conservatives. But those same

36:19.811 --> 36:22.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
conservatives are also his biggest challenge.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), Wisconsin: This is Paul
Ryan's real first big test.

36:24.883 --> 36:28.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Fellow Wisconsin Congressman
Sean Duffy is talking about the government

36:28.653 --> 36:34.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
funding fight, a fight that is electrified
with red-hot conservative issues, including

36:34.059 --> 36:36.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Planned Parenthood funding and how to screen
refugees.

36:36.928 --> 36:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. SEAN DUFFY: These packages, they're never
great. They're big, they're long, they spend

36:41.966 --> 36:45.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot of money. This thing's going to stink
no matter the way you look at it, and Paul

36:45.904 --> 36:51.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ryan is going to have to make it smell as
rosy and lilacy as possible. We will see how

36:52.010 --> 36:53.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
well he does.

36:53.912 --> 36:58.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This kind of battle has paralyzed
the House and its leaders for years. Do Republicans

36:58.416 --> 37:03.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
take a hard stance that they know the president
will block, risking a government shutdown,

37:03.088 --> 37:07.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or do they fund the government, at the expense
of their own values? Do they compromise or

37:07.992 --> 37:09.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do they dig in?

37:09.694 --> 37:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN (R), Florida: That's
why sort of threading that needle in a very

37:15.166 --> 37:21.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
careful way. He's surfing his way through
some very big surf that our GOP Caucus is

37:21.406 --> 37:23.074 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
throwing at him.

37:23.108 --> 37:26.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Republican Congresswoman
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen believes Ryan is succeeding.

37:26.411 --> 37:30.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN: People are trusting
him. Yes, there's going to see how it all

37:30.115 --> 37:38.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
works out, but, as of now, even the most malcontent
and discontented Republican member, of which

37:38.223 --> 37:42.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have a few -- you're never going to make
everybody happy -- has got to see that he's

37:42.760 --> 37:45.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really trying his best to make the process
work.

37:46.030 --> 37:51.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And process is key. House
Speaker John Boehner was ousted, in part,

37:51.069 --> 37:56.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
due to complaints from conservatives who felt
that leadership ignored them. Now Ryan is

37:56.107 --> 37:57.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
changing House process.

37:57.809 --> 38:02.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A few big items, giving members what's called
regular order. That means opportunities for

38:02.647 --> 38:07.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everyone to propose and vote on more amendments,
and for committees, not party leaders, to

38:07.919 --> 38:14.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
drive debates. Also, to engage everyone, he
added one more all-member meeting each week.

38:14.559 --> 38:18.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congressman Dave Brat was one of the unsure
conservatives who didn't vote for Ryan as

38:18.930 --> 38:21.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
speaker, but he says, so far, he is impressed.

38:21.166 --> 38:25.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. DAVE BRAT (R), Virginia: So, next year,
we anticipate regular order. That's a huge

38:25.336 --> 38:29.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gain. I'm on the House Freedom Caucus. We
have been fighting for that and that bottom-up

38:29.741 --> 38:31.376 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
leadership.

38:31.409 --> 38:34.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But in a time of threats
from Islamic State, concerns over immigration,

38:34.546 --> 38:40.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and continued job fears, process only goes
so far. Ryan is challenging his party to come

38:40.985 --> 38:42.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up with a clear agenda.

38:42.587 --> 38:47.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN: If we want a mandate, then
we need to offer ideas. And if we want to

38:47.625 --> 38:49.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
offer ideas, then we need to actually have
ideas.

38:49.794 --> 38:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As he pushes for new ideas,
Ryan is also tackling his party's identity

38:55.400 --> 39:00.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now: pushing back against presidential GOP
front-runner Donald Trump, and Trump's call

39:00.738 --> 39:03.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to block Muslims from entering the United
States.

39:03.341 --> 39:09.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN: Normally, I do not comment
on what's going on in the presidential election.

39:09.047 --> 39:16.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will take an exception today. This is not
conservatism. What was proposed yesterday

39:16.955 --> 39:23.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is not what this party stands for, and, more
importantly, it's not what this country stands

39:23.094 --> 39:24.829 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

39:24.862 --> 39:26.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN: He's going to improve
our Republican brand. I hate to use that word

39:26.864 --> 39:34.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
brand, but that's the way people look at this
nowadays. And it's been tarnished, and we're

39:34.239 --> 39:37.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to earn that Good Housekeeping Seal
of Approval again.

39:37.375 --> 39:42.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Those are big national goals.
But first, of course, the new speaker must

39:42.814 --> 39:47.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
keep government running. The funding deadline
is just days away.

39:47.585 --> 39:51.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa joins us now from
Capitol Hill.

39:51.289 --> 39:55.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Lisa, whatever Speaker Ryan is able to
get done this year, we know -- and you mentioned

39:55.994 --> 40:01.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it -- 2016 is an election year. Typically,
Congress practically grinds to a halt during

40:01.566 --> 40:02.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election years.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

40:03.334 --> 40:05.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are the expectations for
him then?

40:05.103 --> 40:07.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, I think Paul Ryan is
looking at this election year in a very different

40:07.305 --> 40:08.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
way from most speakers of the House, Judy.

40:08.973 --> 40:13.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I spoke to one of his senior aides tonight,
who said that Speaker Ryan thinks the party

40:13.444 --> 40:18.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
may not have a nominee until June or after,
and that that is way too long for the party

40:18.549 --> 40:22.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to wait to really spell out an agenda. So
here comes Speaker Ryan. He's ready to step

40:22.920 --> 40:28.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in and is planning to try and articulate some
policy, some proposals early next year, even

40:28.660 --> 40:30.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as Republicans are fighting for the White
House.

40:30.628 --> 40:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He could be wading into some tricky waters,
but even though Speaker Ryan is not running

40:34.799 --> 40:39.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for president, it seems he could be a major
architect for whoever does become their candidate.

40:39.837 --> 40:44.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just very quickly on this
budget shutdown, what does it look like? Are

40:44.142 --> 40:45.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they going to keep the government open?

40:45.476 --> 40:47.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

40:47.211 --> 40:49.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, the lights are still on here. And they're
going to be on actually a lot this weekend.

40:49.547 --> 40:54.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There will be staffers around the clock this
weekend trying to work out dozens of still

40:54.485 --> 40:58.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hitches, different items that the two parties
need to agree on.

40:58.523 --> 41:02.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Next week, we will know a lot more. So far,
it looks like they could work this out. But,

41:02.527 --> 41:06.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Judy, while the deadline has been moved to
next Wednesday, I will make a little prediction.

41:06.597 --> 41:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It might get moved again. We will see.

41:08.366 --> 41:09.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That would be a shock.

41:09.701 --> 41:10.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:10.335 --> 41:11.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Imagine.

41:11.202 --> 41:12.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins, thank you.

41:12.937 --> 41:14.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.

41:14.639 --> 41:18.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to the analysis of
Shields and Brooks. That's syndicated columnist

41:18.242 --> 41:21.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark Shields and New York Times columnist
David Brooks.

41:21.279 --> 41:22.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

41:22.180 --> 41:25.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, let's talk about Paul Ryan for minute.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mark, how is he doing?

41:27.118 --> 41:32.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He's doing fine, Judy, until
-- this is a test coming up, of course, with

41:32.457 --> 41:34.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the budgeting, keeping the federal government
open.

41:35.026 --> 41:41.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's got a certain honeymoon period. And I
think he's been the beneficiary. First of

41:41.366 --> 41:45.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all, he has to deal with the Freedom Caucus
and the conservatives who were the bane of

41:45.403 --> 41:46.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
John Boehner.

41:46.204 --> 41:47.004 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

41:47.038 --> 41:48.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The bane of John Boehner.

41:48.639 --> 41:56.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And I think he's benefited,
in a strange way, by the chaos created by

41:56.114 --> 41:57.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

41:57.749 --> 42:02.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He looks, in comparison, by -- a grownup.
And I think, at the same time, that, for the

42:02.720 --> 42:06.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first time, there is nervousness and anxiety
among Republicans that they could lose their

42:06.691 --> 42:08.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
congressional majorities next November.

42:08.760 --> 42:16.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, there is less tolerance, perhaps, for
all the hissy fits and tantrums that have

42:16.968 --> 42:18.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been thrown by House members in the past.

42:19.003 --> 42:20.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Contrast with Boehner?

42:20.371 --> 42:22.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: It is.

42:22.039 --> 42:24.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First of all, I have to say there are very
few successful Republican beards. And I think

42:24.409 --> 42:26.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's pulling it off. So, that's very important
to the brand.

42:26.544 --> 42:27.979 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:28.012 --> 42:30.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Not since Lincoln, maybe, have
we had a good Republican beard.

42:30.314 --> 42:33.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he -- the way you believe something is
as important as what you believe. What Chris

42:33.718 --> 42:36.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Van Hollen said in that piece, that he is
more conservative than John Boehner, that

42:36.854 --> 42:43.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is certainly true. But he is more communicative.
He's also just warmer. And he's ostentatiously

42:44.028 --> 42:45.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
respectful to other people.

42:45.830 --> 42:49.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so just that manner has helped him. It's
also helped him, frankly, that Boehner did

42:49.967 --> 42:53.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot of the heavy lifting on the government
shutdown stuff before he left, on raising

42:53.404 --> 42:57.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the spending caps and some of that other stuff,
so it will be a lot easier. And that's a tribute

42:57.041 --> 43:00.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to what Boehner did before he walked out the
door there.

43:00.645 --> 43:05.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then the devolution of power is just big.
You are managing an organization. And you

43:05.550 --> 43:09.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
give some people some control over what they're
doing. I would say, since I came to Washington,

43:09.554 --> 43:14.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in almost every institution, power has grown
more and more centralized, either in the White

43:14.058 --> 43:18.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House or in Congress or in agencies, smaller
zones of trust.

43:18.062 --> 43:21.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so to reverse that is kind of revolutionary
and kind of impressive.

43:21.399 --> 43:27.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if you look at -- as David
just said, you're looking at Paul Ryan as

43:28.005 --> 43:32.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
someone who is more conservative than the
leadership the Republicans had before, so

43:32.810 --> 43:36.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you would think there would be more push and
pull, but it looks like he's trying to get

43:36.814 --> 43:37.882 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
things done.

43:37.915 --> 43:39.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, he is trying to get things
done.

43:39.617 --> 43:45.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it comes down to the continuing resolution.
This is the maximum power that a minority

43:45.857 --> 43:51.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are in opposition or have a particular
case, a cause or point of view, for them to

43:51.896 --> 43:55.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
exercise it and to influence the threat.

43:55.233 --> 44:00.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Republicans could not have a shutdown
of the government right now. They can't. And

44:00.171 --> 44:02.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so he's got to limit...

44:02.206 --> 44:03.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why not? Why not?

44:03.908 --> 44:09.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, because this is a party
that, quite frankly, right now is on the cusp

44:09.413 --> 44:15.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a nervous breakdown, I think it's fair
to say, with the Trump candidacy and what's

44:15.419 --> 44:19.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going on and just the rhetoric in that whole
debate.

44:19.724 --> 44:27.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You heard Ileana Ros-Lehtinen say in her piece
to Lisa the Republican brand, that she looks

44:27.832 --> 44:34.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Paul Ryan to save the Republican brand,
which is damaged. And so he's got to get that

44:34.372 --> 44:42.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
done. So -- and this is the time where you
bring up riders. Riders are the last children,

44:42.780 --> 44:46.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really, of special legislation.

44:46.284 --> 44:47.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's not supposed to be a rider on appropriations.

44:47.885 --> 44:49.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: These are issues that are separate
from...

44:49.287 --> 44:50.922 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:50.955 --> 44:51.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: They're not supposed to be on
appropriation, but everybody wants to bring

44:51.889 --> 44:52.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up his cause right now.

44:52.790 --> 44:53.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

44:53.824 --> 44:55.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And so that's the problem he
faces.

44:55.693 --> 44:59.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's got to get it done. They want to see
him succeed. And they don't want him to fail.

44:59.196 --> 45:05.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He does have one great advantage. And that
is that he didn't plot and scheme to get this

45:05.102 --> 45:10.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
job. It was really thrust upon him. So I think
that's an advantage, that he didn't crawl

45:10.308 --> 45:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all over -- crawl over carcasses and corpses
to get there.

45:13.611 --> 45:17.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When it comes to Trump, David,
I know we have been talking about him, but

45:17.515 --> 45:22.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this week, with the statement about keeping
Muslims out of the country, is this just more

45:22.887 --> 45:26.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the same of what we have been hearing from
Donald Trump, or are we hearing something

45:26.390 --> 45:27.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at a completely new level?

45:27.692 --> 45:29.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think it's a different level.

45:29.927 --> 45:33.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The man is a genius for attention, an addict
of attention, and therefore a genius of getting

45:33.764 --> 45:40.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it. And so this I think is a different level
for a couple of reasons. First, it is bigotry

45:40.705 --> 45:45.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a naked sort. The Mexican stuff was bigotry,
too, but this strikes me as a higher level.

45:45.543 --> 45:50.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Second, an offense against religious liberty.
And, third, because of the way Trump has now

45:50.781 --> 45:54.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
risen to prominence, it has reverberations
around the globe, in the way the stuff even

45:54.952 --> 45:58.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he said earlier about Latin Americans didn't.

45:58.055 --> 46:04.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it's done enormous damage to America's
reputation abroad. And so I do it's something

46:04.261 --> 46:08.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
different. Politically, it's a total winner.
I mean, let's be clear. The polls show it,

46:08.933 --> 46:10.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and for a number of reasons.

46:10.601 --> 46:13.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People, as we heard earlier in the program,
are scared about terrorism. Secondly, there

46:13.604 --> 46:20.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been a pent-up, silent frustration about
political correctness. So anybody who says

46:20.311 --> 46:25.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something politically completely incorrect,
and properly incorrect, for some people, that's

46:25.483 --> 46:28.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like a liberation. It's, finally, somebody's
saying the truth.

46:28.619 --> 46:33.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so he's benefiting from that. And so it's
right now a total winner on the Republican

46:33.457 --> 46:35.059 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
primary.

46:35.092 --> 46:39.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And if it's a winner -- and,
Mark, the polls do show that -- I think I

46:39.363 --> 46:45.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saw 40-some percent of Republicans agree with
his statement.

46:45.403 --> 46:49.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But when you talk about the electorate overall,
it's only about 20-something percent.

46:49.674 --> 46:51.342 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

46:51.375 --> 46:56.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No, it's a real problem for the Republicans,
Judy. It's a problem for the country. I mean,

46:56.514 --> 47:05.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we saw it this week. Karl Rove, George Bush's
amanuensis, his master strategist, said that

47:05.089 --> 47:12.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- wrote that the nomination of Donald Trump
is a gift to the Democrats and would doom

47:12.730 --> 47:14.331 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Republicans.

47:14.365 --> 47:19.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We saw 20 Republican leaders, as reported
by Robert Costa in The Washington Post, had

47:19.570 --> 47:25.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a secret meeting, that they were that concerned,
that anxious to somehow provoke and guarantee

47:25.276 --> 47:31.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that there will be a brokered convention in
Cleveland next summer to do anything, apparently,

47:31.282 --> 47:34.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to deny him the nomination.

47:34.218 --> 47:40.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What he did this week, with -- talked about
as being intemperate, or being outrageous,

47:40.257 --> 47:47.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or ethnic slurs -- this really, to use a term
I'm reluctant to use, was un-American. I mean,

47:47.565 --> 47:52.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
religious tolerance is in the citizenship
papers of this country. It was put there by

47:52.670 --> 48:02.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, specifically
to include Jews and nonbelievers and Muslims.

48:02.680 --> 48:09.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It wasn't -- so that it wasn't simply Christians
or Protestants of a certain sectarian -- and

48:09.587 --> 48:16.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so, I mean, this was just -- this was really
so offensive and so outrageous. I mean, when

48:16.994 --> 48:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- and I thought the timid and rather tepid
reaction of a lot of Republicans -- when Dick

48:21.999 --> 48:28.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cheney becomes the moral templar of your party
to say this is unacceptable, and I think a

48:28.806 --> 48:34.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
word has to be said on behalf of both Cheney
and George W. Bush, that, after 9/11, they

48:34.845 --> 48:40.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deliberately, consciously didn't bring any
-- made sure that this would have a religious

48:40.851 --> 48:44.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
element to it, the war in Iraq, the ill-fated
war in Iraq.

48:44.755 --> 48:49.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What effect -- David, you said,
short-term, it helps him politically, but

48:49.493 --> 48:55.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what effect is it having on this race? How
is it changing the shape of this presidential...

48:55.533 --> 48:57.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

48:57.234 --> 48:59.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, first, on the Republican Party, it doesn't
-- not -- looking at the data, it doesn't

48:59.570 --> 49:04.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seem to be bleeding over into hurting the
Republican brand. If you look at the party

49:04.241 --> 49:07.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
approval, it pretty much where it was. It's
slightly up where it was three or four months

49:07.144 --> 49:08.913 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

49:08.946 --> 49:13.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People may disapprove of Donald Trump, but,
so far, they don't see him as a typical Republican,

49:13.417 --> 49:17.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
maybe because he's running against the party.
I continue to believe -- and I will believe

49:17.488 --> 49:21.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to my dying day -- that he will -- his numbers
will collapse. I have said it here on a weekly

49:21.725 --> 49:25.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
basis, and I don't think any of this matters
until the final months.

49:25.863 --> 49:27.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But events like Paris...

49:27.398 --> 49:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're getting close.

49:29.066 --> 49:32.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: We're getting close. And events
like Paris -- and his genius for attention

49:32.303 --> 49:37.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- what he does is, he takes a concrete issue
or a broad issue which is complicated and

49:37.575 --> 49:42.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he turns it into sometimes brutal and sometimes
horrific simplicity.

49:42.847 --> 49:49.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so there is this broad fear of security
and terrorism. He -- specifically Muslims,

49:49.687 --> 49:53.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that, like, lodges in people's minds as
something simple and bold, and somehow he

49:53.424 --> 49:56.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
seems to some people like a strong leader.

49:56.527 --> 49:59.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you hate women? The question that was asked
to him in one of the debates. No, just Rosie

50:00.030 --> 50:06.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
O'Donnell. How much money are you worth? He
could say 6.8 million -- he says $10 billion.

50:06.136 --> 50:11.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, there's a genius for attention by turning
everything into concrete, very specific things

50:11.542 --> 50:17.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that lodge in the mind. And that is a demagogic
genius, but let's face it, he has it.

50:17.248 --> 50:21.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I still think the electorate will turn, but
he is not to be underestimated for that demagogic

50:21.919 --> 50:23.587 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ability.

50:23.621 --> 50:27.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, you said a minute ago
that Republicans had -- some Republicans hadn't

50:27.892 --> 50:32.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been strong enough in their disagreeing or
denouncing what Trump said about Muslims.

50:32.863 --> 50:38.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's been interesting to watch Ted Cruz,
senator from Texas. He's one who seems to

50:39.003 --> 50:45.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be rising in the public opinion polls. What
is it that he's saying? And his statement

50:45.175 --> 50:49.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about Trump, if I got it correctly, was, I
don't agree with him, but he has a right to

50:49.914 --> 50:51.582 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
say that.

50:51.615 --> 50:55.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then there was, I guess, the story that
came out today or yesterday where, in private,

50:55.219 --> 50:59.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he said he thinks Trump is going to collapse,
but then -- Trump later shot back, and Cruz

50:59.990 --> 51:01.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
said, oh, Trump's terrific.

51:01.859 --> 51:03.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But how do you explain Ted Cruz?

51:03.661 --> 51:06.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, if you want to know what
a candidate really thinks, you tape him in

51:06.897 --> 51:13.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an off-the-record fund-raising meeting. And
that's where Ted Cruz did say that, that he

51:13.137 --> 51:21.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
didn't think Donald Trump had the judgment
to survive and to win the presidency.

51:21.712 --> 51:27.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ted Cruz has just been right up to Donald
Trump's left shoulder. Donald Trump insinuates,

51:27.785 --> 51:34.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as David puts it, that Barack Obama may not
be a total American because he won't say radical

51:34.625 --> 51:40.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Muslim terrorist, or extremist, and he won't
use that term, he won't, in other words, give

51:40.764 --> 51:45.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it the religious component, and he says, there
is something going on there, he says.

51:45.302 --> 51:52.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, Ted Cruz calls him an apologist for
radical Islam instead. Now, it's one thing,

51:52.710 --> 51:57.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Judy, if I disagree with you and say you're
mistaken or you're ill-informed. When I start

51:57.348 --> 52:03.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
demonizing your motives -- and he does that.
He does that in speech. He's sort of Donald

52:03.320 --> 52:11.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump with better academic credentials, a
better haircut and probably 60 I.Q. points.

52:11.261 --> 52:12.663 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:12.696 --> 52:14.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, other than that, what
would you add about Ted Cruz?

52:14.665 --> 52:17.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, Cruz is interesting because
he's universally unpopular.

52:17.601 --> 52:19.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Universally.

52:19.236 --> 52:24.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: In the law firm, at school,
among the Republicans -- when he was working

52:24.241 --> 52:28.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with George W. Bush's campaign, he could not
get a serious job after that, because everyone

52:28.078 --> 52:29.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
said, I will not work with that guy.

52:29.747 --> 52:33.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He comes to the Senate, Republican senators,
if they had a vote between some Democrat to

52:33.784 --> 52:37.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be majority leader and Ted Cruz, they would
vote for the Democrat. He is just unpopular.

52:37.388 --> 52:42.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's used that unpopularity to his benefit
in this campaign. Look, they all hate me.

52:42.192 --> 52:45.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, if you're running an anti-Washington
campaign, the fact that everyone who works

52:45.496 --> 52:47.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with you hates you suddenly becomes a plus.

52:47.731 --> 52:52.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The other interesting is, for a guy who runs
on principle, he's extremely tactical. He's

52:52.136 --> 52:57.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very deft at moving this way and that. And
so the Republican Party faces this problem,

52:57.141 --> 53:01.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they don't want Trump, but the alternative
might be Cruz, and they don't want that either.

53:01.145 --> 53:06.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will leave it on that
note, David Brooks, Mark Shields.

53:06.850 --> 53:10.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have a reminder about some programs
to come from our PBS colleagues.

53:10.487 --> 53:14.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gwen Ifill is preparing for "Washington Week,"
which airs later this tonight. Here's a preview:

53:14.725 --> 53:21.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For better or worse, Donald Trump
has transformed the nature of the 2016 presidential

53:21.432 --> 53:26.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign. Tonight, our roundtable tackles
what that means for politics, for policy,

53:27.004 --> 53:31.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and for the way Americans see themselves,
tonight on "Washington Week" -- Judy.

53:31.708 --> 53:37.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then, on tomorrow's "PBS NewsHour
Weekend": how an investment in wind power

53:37.281 --> 53:41.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has helped put Denmark on the path to energy
independence.

53:41.351 --> 53:42.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for tonight.

53:42.853 --> 53:47.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On Monday, we examine the results of the Paris
climate talks.

53:47.257 --> 53:50.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm Judy Woodruff. Join us online, and again
right here tomorrow evening.

53:50.761 --> 53:54.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From all of us at the "PBS NewsHour," have
a great weekend. Thank you, and good night.
