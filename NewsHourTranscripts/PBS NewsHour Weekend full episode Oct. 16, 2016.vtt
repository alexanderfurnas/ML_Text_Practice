ON THE KIND OF THE MOST EXTREME

04:03.933 --> 04:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARGUMENT THAT THE WHOLE PROCESS

04:05.800 --> 04:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS RIGGED.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT CLINTON IS CONSPIRING WITH

04:09.667 --> 04:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERNATIONAL BANKERS WHICH BY

04:11.233 --> 04:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WAY HAS AN UNPLEASANT ECHO

04:15.200 --> 04:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1930'S TALKING ABOUT

04:17.600 --> 04:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOWEST PEOPLE MEANING JEWISH

04:18.533 --> 04:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE.

04:19.333 --> 04:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER TRUMP KNOWS IT OR KNOW

04:20.700 --> 04:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S WHAT THAT IS.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I SUSPECT HE'S GOING TO GO

IN HER CASE, YOU KNOW, THE

04:36.333 --> 04:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT SHE

04:38.200 --> 04:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE

04:40.200 --> 04:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUFF THAT WIKI LEAKS HAVE SHOWN

HER INTO SOME DOUBT WERE IT NOT

04:46.567 --> 04:48.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE FACT THAT TRUMP HAS

DOMINATED THE STORIES AS YOU

04:49.900 --> 04:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

NOT FOR TRUMP AND DOMINATING IN

A NEGATIVE WAY THE STAGE, SHE

05:10.967 --> 05:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
