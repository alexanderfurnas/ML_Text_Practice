07:43.163 --> 07:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE BATTLE MAY WAX AND WANE OUT

07:48.935 --> 07:52.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WHAT ARE ALL THESE ADDITIONAL

08:03.783 --> 08:04.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TROOPS GOING TO DO ON THE

GROUND?

08:05.118 --> 08:06.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE ADDITIONAL TROOPS

08:06.286 --> 08:08.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN SYRIA ARE THERE TO DO ABOUT

08:08.621 --> 08:10.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREE THINGS: THEY'RE THERE TO

08:10.523 --> 08:12.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE IRAQI SIDE OF THE BORDER.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE THERE TO PROVIDE FIRE

08:15.228 --> 08:16.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORT.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE HOWITZERS AT THIS

08:17.130 --> 08:19.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASE WHICH CAN REACH RAQQA, OR

08:19.799 --> 08:21.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT LEAST THE OUTSKIRTS OF RAQQA.

08:21.468 --> 08:22.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT'S

08:22.369 --> 08:23.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN DONE IN IRAQ, SO THAT'S A

08:23.970 --> 08:25.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVEN MODEL.

08:27.707 --> 08:28.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE THERE, AT LEAST IN SOME

08:28.975 --> 08:31.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PART, TO KEEP OUR ALLIES FROM

08:31.044 --> 08:31.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIGHTING EACH OTHER.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY POSITIONED

08:33.046 --> 08:35.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN THE TURKISH-BACKED ARAB

08:35.582 --> 08:39.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCES AND THE KURDISH FORCES,

08:39.652 --> 08:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOTH OF WHICH WOULD PROBABLY

08:40.987 --> 08:42.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH RATHER FIGHT EACH OTHER

08:42.689 --> 08:43.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN FIGHT ISIS.

>> Sreenivasan: TAKING A CITY

08:45.125 --> 08:46.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE RAQQA IS GOING TO TAKE

08:46.860 --> 08:48.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUITE SOME TIME, AND WHAT WE'RE

08:48.161 --> 08:49.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEING IN MOSUL PLAY OUT, I'D

08:49.863 --> 08:51.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMAGINE IT WOULD BE JUST AS

08:51.164 --> 08:52.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARD, IF NOT HARDER IN RAQQA.

08:52.499 --> 08:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'LL BE HARDER.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAQQA IS A SMALLER CITY THAN

08:55.301 --> 08:57.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOSUL, SO IN THAT SENSE IT'S

08:57.404 --> 08:58.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EASIER.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IN IRAQ WE'RE BLESSED WITH

09:00.707 --> 09:03.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN ABUNDANCE OF REAL, ORGANIZED

09:03.176 --> 09:04.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLIES.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE THE IRAQI ARMY AND ITS

09:05.512 --> 09:06.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSOCIATED FORCES.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE THE KURDISH PESHMERGA

09:08.715 --> 09:11.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE CAN EVEN WORK WITH THE,

09:11.017 --> 09:12.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PRIVATE MILITARY FORCES,

09:12.585 --> 09:14.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE P.M.U.s OR SHIA MILITIAS.

09:14.687 --> 09:16.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE ESSENTIALLY HAVE THREE

09:16.022 --> 09:17.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORGANIZED FORCES IN THAT COUNTRY

09:17.590 --> 09:20.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE CAN USE AS A FIGHTING

09:20.193 --> 09:21.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCE.

09:21.127 --> 09:22.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN SYRIA, WE REALLY DON'T HAVE

09:22.529 --> 09:24.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

09:24.130 --> 09:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE DO HAVE THE Y.P.G. SYRIAN

09:26.466 --> 09:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KURDS, BUT THAT'S A FORCE THAT

09:28.301 --> 09:29.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE ESSENTIALLY ORGANIZED.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT DIDN'T ORGANIZE ITSELF, AS

09:31.604 --> 09:33.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE IRAQI PESHMERGA DID, SO WE

09:33.440 --> 09:34.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN ESSENTIALLY CREATING

09:34.707 --> 09:35.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT FROM SCRATCH OVER THE LAST

09:35.809 --> 09:36.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

AL QAEDA IN SYRIA TODAY?

09:41.047 --> 09:42.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, AL QAEDA HAS CONTINUED

09:42.682 --> 09:43.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GAIN STRENGTH.

09:43.817 --> 09:46.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THE EXTREMIST FACTIONS--

09:46.386 --> 09:48.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISIS, AL QAEDA IN SYRIA, WHICH

09:48.955 --> 09:50.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS GONE THROUGH VARIOUS NAMES.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TODAY IT'S CALLED TAHRIR AL

09:51.658 --> 09:53.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHAM, BUT AL QAEDA IN SYRIA IS

09:53.560 --> 09:54.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL JUST FINE.

09:54.894 --> 09:56.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FOR THAT MATTER, AHRAR AL

09:56.062 --> 09:59.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:59.199 --> 10:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPOSE ISLAM ON US.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE NOT LIKE AL QAEDA OR

10:02.368 --> 10:03.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISIS IN THAT SENSE, BUT THEY'RE

10:03.903 --> 10:05.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESSENTIALLY THE SYRIAN TALIBAN.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WANT A VERY ISLAMIST REGIME

10:07.240 --> 10:08.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE COUNTRY.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THREE OF THESE GROUPS HAVE

10:09.509 --> 10:11.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESSENTIALLY GOBBLED UP THE

10:11.010 --> 10:12.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SMALLER GROUPS.

10:12.645 --> 10:13.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE MORE RESOURCES AND,

10:13.913 --> 10:15.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEREFORE, THE FIGHTERS HAVE

10:15.248 --> 10:17.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVED FROM THE MORE MODERATE

10:17.116 --> 10:18.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

10:31.097 --> 10:32.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON ACTUALLY FIGHTING ISIS AND

10:32.665 --> 10:35.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AL QAEDA, VERSUS SUPPORTING OR

10:35.101 --> 10:36.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

10:36.603 --> 10:38.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ULTIMATELY, GETTING RID OF ISIS

10:40.607 --> 10:42.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS EVERYONE'S GOAL.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S THE-- NOT JUST THE

10:45.211 --> 10:46.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

15:38.171 --> 15:42.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST FEELING SO TERRIBLE FOR

THEIR FRIENDS OR NEIGHBORS WHO

15:45.645 --> 15:48.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DID LOSE CHILDREN.
