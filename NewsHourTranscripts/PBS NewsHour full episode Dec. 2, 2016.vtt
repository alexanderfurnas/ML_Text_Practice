JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.441 --> 00:10.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
President-elect
Trump announces his pick for
secretary of

00:10.444 --> 00:11.912 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
defense.

00:11.945 --> 00:16.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We take a close look at retired
Marine General
James Mattis' background.

00:16.350 --> 00:21.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: As a deadline looms for
protesters,
pressure mounts at the site of
the Dakota

00:21.855 --> 00:25.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pipeline, where clashes with
police have been
ongoing.

00:25.092 --> 00:27.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ARCHAMBAULT II, Chairman,
Standing Rock
Sioux Tribe: The way I look at
it is, as long

00:27.794 --> 00:31.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the pipeline isn't under the
river, there's
still a chance, there's still
hope.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

00:33.867 --> 00:40.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
analyze this
week's Trump transition moves
and the Democrats'

00:40.207 --> 00:41.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
discontent.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:43.377 --> 00:47.981 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:48.015 --> 01:00.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President-elect
Trump filled
up another Cabinet seat, while
some of his

01:00.727 --> 01:05.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
supporters aggressively
challenged recount
efforts in three states.

01:05.165 --> 01:07.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s John Yang has
our report.

01:07.567 --> 01:16.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: We are
going to appoint "Mad Dog"
Mattis as our secretary

01:16.209 --> 01:17.711 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of defense.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:20.047 --> 01:29.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: But we're not
announcing it
until Monday, so don't tell
anybody.

01:29.923 --> 01:35.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President-elect Trump
scooped himself
Thursday night, making his
choice public in

01:35.862 --> 01:39.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cincinnati, the first stop of
his thank you
tour.

01:39.232 --> 01:43.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He met with retired General
James Mattis last
month in New Jersey.

01:43.036 --> 01:45.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He is the real
deal.

01:45.505 --> 01:47.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is the real deal.

01:47.841 --> 01:54.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mattis retired as a
four-star general
three years ago, after four
decades as a Marine.

01:54.614 --> 02:01.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He headed U.S. Central Command
until 2013,
in charge of operations in Iraq
and Afghanistan.

02:01.154 --> 02:06.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He would need a special
congressional waiver,
because federal law says a
defense secretary

02:06.660 --> 02:10.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has be out of uniform for at
least seven years.

02:10.697 --> 02:14.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Cincinnati, Mr. Trump pledged
to ease still
simmering post-election
tensions.

02:14.801 --> 02:19.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to
bring our country
together, all of our country.

02:19.673 --> 02:25.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to find common
ground and we will
get the job done properly.

02:25.278 --> 02:28.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will get it done properly.

02:28.148 --> 02:32.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But at Harvard
University, top
officials of his campaign
clashed with Clinton

02:32.953 --> 02:37.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign managers at a normally
civil post-election
review.

02:37.424 --> 02:39.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton aides said the Trump
campaign fueled
racism.

02:40.027 --> 02:43.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER PALMIERI, Democratic
Strategist:
I would rather lose than win the
way you did.

02:43.130 --> 02:45.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Senior
Adviser: Do
you think I ran a campaign where
white supremacists

02:45.532 --> 02:46.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had a platform?

02:46.700 --> 02:47.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are you going to look me in the
face and tell
me that?

02:47.601 --> 02:48.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JENNIFER PALMIERI: It did.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Kellyanne, it did.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.571 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

02:51.605 --> 02:54.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Do you think
you could have
just had a decent message for
the white working-class

02:54.641 --> 02:56.376 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voters?

02:56.410 --> 02:59.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There were also
sparks when Clinton
aides noted that their candidate
won more

02:59.479 --> 03:01.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
votes than the president-elect.

03:01.214 --> 03:02.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEL BENENSON, Former Hillary
Clinton Campaign
Adviser: You guys won.

03:02.482 --> 03:04.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's clear, you won the
Electoral College.

03:04.618 --> 03:05.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the currency.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

03:06.620 --> 03:07.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOEL BENENSON: But let's also be
honest.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Don't act as if you have some
popular mandate
for your message.

03:09.956 --> 03:13.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact of the matter is, is
that more Americans
voted for Hillary Clinton than
Donald Trump.

03:13.894 --> 03:14.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Hey, guys.

03:14.895 --> 03:15.862 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
We won.

03:15.896 --> 03:16.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You don't have to respond.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, seriously.

03:18.665 --> 03:21.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Today, Trump
supporters moved to
block recounts in Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania

03:22.002 --> 03:23.737 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Michigan.

03:23.770 --> 03:27.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect was in New
York today,
meeting with longtime supporters
Republican

03:27.274 --> 03:32.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator David Perdue of Georgia
and former
U.N. Ambassador John Bolton.

03:32.846 --> 03:38.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His schedule also included an
unusual suspect,
Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North
Dakota, a

03:38.952 --> 03:39.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Democrat.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:42.255 --> 03:47.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will have much
more on the
Mattis pick right after this
news summary.

03:47.127 --> 03:52.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And late today, the transition
team reported
that president-elect Trump spoke
by phone

03:52.299 --> 03:54.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the president of Taiwan.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is a highly unusual move.

03:56.670 --> 04:02.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. cut formal diplomatic
ties with Taiwan
in 1979.

04:02.175 --> 04:06.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
U.S. economy
posted solid job growth for
November, with

04:06.780 --> 04:09.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the unemployment rate hitting a
nine-year
low.

04:09.616 --> 04:15.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Labor Department reported
U.S. employers
added about 178,000 jobs, and
the unemployment

04:15.822 --> 04:22.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rate dropped to 4.6 percent,
largely because
many people stopped looking for
work.

04:22.429 --> 04:27.734 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
Stocks were mostly flat on Wall
Street today,
in spite the
better-than-expected jobs
report,

04:27.767 --> 04:33.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but crude oil prices posted
their biggest
weekly gain since February of
2011.

04:33.406 --> 04:38.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 21 points
to close at 19170.

04:38.211 --> 04:43.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose four points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added less than a point.

04:43.783 --> 04:49.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the week, the Dow gained a
fraction of
a percent, the Nasdaq fell
nearly 3 percent,

04:49.256 --> 04:52.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the S&amp;P 500 slipped 1
percent.

04:52.559 --> 04:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House lawmakers overwhelmingly
backed a nearly
$619 billion bipartisan defense
bill today.

04:59.966 --> 05:04.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will give U.S. troops their
biggest pay
raise since 2010.

05:04.504 --> 05:10.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also prohibits the Pentagon
from closing
military bases and the prison at
Guantanamo

05:10.410 --> 05:12.212 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Bay.

05:12.245 --> 05:16.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While most members of Congress
supported the
bill, some criticized it for
including over

05:16.249 --> 05:25.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$3 billion more in war funding
than last year's
budget.

05:25.158 --> 05:33.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: It stops the troop
reductions in our
armed forces, thereby increasing
readiness

05:33.833 --> 05:37.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
while reducing stress and strain
on our force
and the families.

05:37.737 --> 05:38.738 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARBARA LEE (D), California:
Enough is enough.

05:40.640 --> 05:44.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead of writing blank checks
to the Pentagon,
Congress needs to live up to its
constitutional

05:44.077 --> 05:47.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obligation to debate matters of
war and peace.

05:47.113 --> 05:50.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to rip up the 2001 blank
check for
endless war.

05:51.017 --> 05:55.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to stop funding wars
without end with
no debate on the cost and
consequences to

05:55.589 --> 05:57.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our troops or to the American
people.

05:57.791 --> 06:02.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Senate is
expected to vote
on the bill next week.

06:02.128 --> 06:06.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Officials in Gatlinburg,
Tennessee, today
raised the death toll from days
of fierce

06:06.333 --> 06:09.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wildfires to 13 people.

06:09.769 --> 06:14.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thousands of residents also
returned home
for the first time to survey the
extent of

06:14.274 --> 06:15.942 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the devastation.

06:15.976 --> 06:21.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials said the number of
damaged homes
and buildings is now close to
1,000.

06:21.281 --> 06:27.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Indonesia, 200,000 people
flooded Jakarta
today to protest against the
city's Christian

06:27.621 --> 06:32.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
governor, who is being
prosecuted for allegedly
insulting the Koran.

06:32.058 --> 06:37.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sea of conservative Muslim
demonstrators
gathered peacefully to demand
the governor

06:37.631 --> 06:39.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be jailed for blasphemy.

06:39.799 --> 06:45.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ten people were arrested by
police, who accused
the dissenters of using the
protest to overthrow

06:45.972 --> 06:47.807 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the government.

06:47.841 --> 06:54.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Ford Motor Company is
recalling more than
680,000 vehicles for potentially
faulty seat

06:54.447 --> 06:56.182 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
belts.

06:56.216 --> 07:01.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The recall affects its mid-size
sedans, like
the Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ,
that were

07:01.688 --> 07:03.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mostly sold in the U.S.

07:03.623 --> 07:08.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The automaker says the seat
belts might not
restrain passengers in a crash.

07:08.461 --> 07:14.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
who is "Mad
Dog" Mattis, Trump's choice to
head the Defense

07:14.701 --> 07:21.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department?; Dakota pipeline
protesters facing
a deadline to clear out; Cubans
think back

07:22.008 --> 07:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Fidel Castro's legacy; and
much more.

07:31.685 --> 07:43.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, who is the man
president-elect Trump has
picked to be his secretary of
defense?

07:43.229 --> 07:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's his track record, and how
does he think
the United States should
confront the threats

07:47.033 --> 07:48.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that it faces?

07:48.468 --> 07:52.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For that, we turn to two who
know retired
General James Mattis well.

07:52.305 --> 07:57.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Steve Simon was the senior
director for Middle
Eastern and North African
affairs on the National

07:57.477 --> 08:01.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Security Council staff during
the Obama administration.

08:01.247 --> 08:05.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now a visiting professor of
history at
Amherst College.

08:05.118 --> 08:10.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Michael Gordon, he has
covered General
Mattis as a reporter at The New
York Times.

08:10.490 --> 08:14.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For years, Gordon covered the
Pentagon, and
now the State Department.

08:14.627 --> 08:17.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the "NewsHour."

08:17.564 --> 08:19.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let me start with you, Michael
Gordon.

08:19.733 --> 08:24.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tell us what you know about
James Mattis,
beyond what we reported a moment
ago.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GORDON, Diplomatic
Correspondent,
The New York Times: Well, he's
certainly an

08:26.673 --> 08:32.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unconventional choice for
secretary of defense,
simply because he's only been
out of the military

08:32.912 --> 08:34.714 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for three years.

08:34.748 --> 08:39.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been a Marine in some of
the -- a Marine
commander in the hottest wars
that we have

08:39.285 --> 08:45.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had over the past 10 years,
Iraq, Afghanistan,
and ran the Central Command,
which oversees

08:45.258 --> 08:47.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
both those wars.

08:47.093 --> 08:52.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's a position that also
involved him
with a lot of diplomacy in the
region, I think.

08:52.499 --> 08:57.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's famous also for a lot
of his Mattis-isms,
his kind of sayings.

08:57.704 --> 09:03.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember, when I was in
Barwana, Iraq, there
was a sign on one of the
outposts that said,

09:03.243 --> 09:07.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Be polite, be professional,
have a plan to
kill everyone you meet."

09:07.981 --> 09:12.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, that pretty much
expresses I think
Mattis' approach.

09:12.085 --> 09:17.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was prepared to use violence
to achieve
ends in war, but he also sought
to work with

09:17.157 --> 09:23.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the population and to, you know,
constrain
the violence as much as
possible, which wasn't

09:23.163 --> 09:24.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
always easy in an environment
like Iraq.

09:25.031 --> 09:28.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steve Simon, what
would you
add to that, and where did this
nickname "Mad

09:28.802 --> 09:30.570 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Dog" come from?

09:30.603 --> 09:32.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE SIMON, Former National
Security Council
Official: Well, look, I have
never seen him

09:33.006 --> 09:40.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in combat, so I don't know how
mad a dog he
can be, but certainly in his
capacity as commander

09:40.246 --> 09:44.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and as a senior U.S. official
dealing with
national security issues, I
never saw him

09:44.851 --> 09:49.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as anything less than
self-possessed and having
a cool head.

09:49.489 --> 09:53.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I'm not really sure where
that epithet
comes from.

09:53.326 --> 09:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also known by soldiers who
worked with
him and for him as the warrior
monk because

09:59.866 --> 10:03.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he does have a somewhat monkish
temperament.

10:03.403 --> 10:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, he's in some ways
really into, you
know, self-denial and focusing
on his troops.

10:11.811 --> 10:16.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that has won him a great
deal of loyalty,
which will stand him in good
stead if he's

10:16.082 --> 10:18.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
confirmed by Congress as
secretary of defense.

10:18.585 --> 10:22.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Gordon,
you said a
moment ago he's prepared to use
violence,

10:22.689 --> 10:26.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even as he cares about the
troops.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as a leader, one would
expect that he
would.

10:30.230 --> 10:34.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what is his view of the role
of the military
in carrying out foreign policy?

10:34.934 --> 10:40.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GORDON: Well, as Steve
pointed out,
he's not a one-sided person.

10:40.473 --> 10:44.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every military person has to
execute military
operations, which means you have
to fight.

10:44.577 --> 10:49.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And fight to Baghdad or fighting
in Afghanistan,
all these environments wasn't
easy.

10:49.415 --> 10:53.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's also famous of his
study of military
history, his thousands of books,
the fact

10:53.820 --> 10:56.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he claims not to own a
television.

10:56.689 --> 10:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's where the warrior monk
comes from.

10:58.525 --> 11:02.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he has some views on foreign
policy that
really put him, I think, in the
mainstream.

11:02.695 --> 11:06.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, he doesn't want to
rip up the
Iran agreement.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's criticized the agreement.

11:07.800 --> 11:14.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he wished it would
impose stricter
constraints on Iran's nuclear
program.

11:14.274 --> 11:19.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he said just walking away
from it would
work against American interests,
that the

11:19.846 --> 11:21.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allies would never go along with
that.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's against torture.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And president-elect Trump has
remarked on
that.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has argued against using
that.

11:28.288 --> 11:32.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He argues that it's simply not
effective.

11:32.225 --> 11:39.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's wary of Russia, which,
you know,
president-elect Trump, at times,
has implied

11:39.198 --> 11:44.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he's sympathetic with
Vladimir Putin
or might want to work together
with Vladimir

11:44.337 --> 11:45.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Putin in Syria.

11:45.805 --> 11:49.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think Mattis would be
extremely skeptical
of that kind of approach.

11:49.042 --> 11:53.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, fill in
more of that
picture, Steve Simon.

11:53.513 --> 11:58.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you see Mattis aligning
with what we
know of what Donald Trump
thinks?

11:58.418 --> 12:06.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE SIMON: Well, he's a bit of
an awkward
fit, primarily, I think, because
he does support

12:06.259 --> 12:12.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. compliance with the deal
negotiated with
Iran to contain its nuclear
program and to

12:12.532 --> 12:14.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
block its pathway towards a
bomb.

12:14.701 --> 12:21.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He has referred to it as
providing what he's
called a nuclear pause, but not
a nuclear

12:21.941 --> 12:26.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
halt, and said, in effect, a
pause is better
than nothing.

12:26.312 --> 12:32.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where he does differ, I think,
from the outgoing
administration is his view that,
even as the

12:32.085 --> 12:39.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States maintains its
commitment to
the deal it negotiated, that it
pushes back

12:39.392 --> 12:42.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on Iran's regional maneuvers.

12:42.729 --> 12:48.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, and, by that, Jim
Mattis would
point to do things.

12:48.668 --> 12:53.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One is Syria, where the Iranians
are very,
very deeply involved.

12:53.573 --> 12:58.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other is in Iraq, where
the Iranians
gained a great deal of influence
after the

12:58.978 --> 13:01.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. overthrew the regime of
Saddam Hussein.

13:01.848 --> 13:06.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, as commander of
Central Command,
General Mattis is probably quite
sensitive

13:06.386 --> 13:12.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the fact that many of the
deaths of U.S.
servicemen in Iraq were
attributable to weapons

13:12.291 --> 13:14.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
designed or provided by Iran.

13:14.127 --> 13:19.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about --
Michael Gordon,
people are talking, of course,
about the fact

13:20.033 --> 13:23.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he's going to -- if he's
confirmed, he's
going to have to have this
exemption from

13:23.703 --> 13:30.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the law that says military
people who are
few than seven years out of the
military can't

13:30.276 --> 13:32.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be secretary of defense.

13:32.679 --> 13:36.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you see him running that
department,
coming from the military?

13:36.883 --> 13:42.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GORDON: Well, first of
all, I think
the waiver will go through.

13:42.221 --> 13:47.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator McCain, who chairs the
Armed Services
Committee, has said he supports
it.

13:47.093 --> 13:51.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Gillibrand said she
opposes it, but
I thinks he has sufficient
support.

13:51.364 --> 13:58.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that he has enough
experience running
large organizations, running the
Central Command.

13:58.438 --> 14:01.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He ran the Joint Forces command.

14:01.674 --> 14:06.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That requires a certain amount
of bureaucratic
capability and finesse.

14:06.212 --> 14:10.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think he, in his own mind,
understands
-- I mean, he would be the first
person since

14:10.917 --> 14:17.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
George Marshall to do this --
that there is
a responsibility on him to try
to run the

14:17.990 --> 14:22.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
department as a civilian that
he's only been
for three years and not as a
military man.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steve Simon, how
do you see
that?

14:24.530 --> 14:29.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because there has been this
tradition -- it's
in law -- that someone who's
been in the military

14:29.235 --> 14:31.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recently shouldn't be running
the Pentagon.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you see him fitting into
that?

14:33.272 --> 14:38.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE SIMON: Well, look, he's
going to have
to deal with issues that he
hasn't had to

14:38.377 --> 14:44.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
deal with as a combatant
commander or a unified
commander, R&amp;D, weapons
acquisition, large-scale

14:45.017 --> 14:52.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
budget issues, you know,
personnel issues
of an immense scale.

14:52.725 --> 14:59.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In addition to being a
politician in his dealing
with Congress in particular,
he's going to

14:59.365 --> 15:03.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to learn how to deal
effectively with
a White House staff.

15:03.669 --> 15:08.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That can be a challenge,
especially in an
administration like the one
that's shaping

15:08.341 --> 15:10.476 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up, I think.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's going to have to be a
diplomat as
well.

15:13.546 --> 15:18.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I have seen him work in a
diplomatic
mode, and I think he's gifted in
that domain.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think he's going to have
a problem
there.

15:21.187 --> 15:26.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, all in all, you know, I
would say that
he has good prospects for
success.

15:26.392 --> 15:32.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steve Simon,
Michael Gordon,
as we learn who General James
Mattis is, and

15:32.098 --> 15:36.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he heads for confirmation, thank
you very
much.

15:36.335 --> 15:44.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GORDON: Thank you.

15:44.644 --> 15:52.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even as
temperatures in North
Dakota are plunging into the
single digits,

15:52.752 --> 15:57.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the fight over the Dakota Access
oil pipeline
is only intensifying.

15:57.924 --> 15:59.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham is here with
more.

15:59.826 --> 16:02.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, William, I understand
there's a deadline
coming?

16:02.094 --> 16:04.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's right,
Judy.

16:04.130 --> 16:08.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Starting on Monday, anyone at
that large protest
camp in North Dakota will be
considered trespassers

16:08.868 --> 16:10.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and could be arrested.

16:10.336 --> 16:12.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's according to the U.S.
Army Corps of
Engineers.

16:12.805 --> 16:16.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For months now, thousands of
people calling
themselves water protectors have
gathered

16:16.776 --> 16:18.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to stop the pipeline.

16:18.611 --> 16:22.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say it's destroying lands
that are sacred
to the Standing Rock Sioux, and
that an oil

16:22.415 --> 16:24.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leak could threaten the tribe's
water.

16:24.417 --> 16:28.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite the Army Corps' order,
and a similar
one from the governor,
protesters say they're

16:28.754 --> 16:30.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not going anywhere.

16:30.156 --> 16:33.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dave Archambault II is the
chairman of the
Standing Rock Sioux.

16:33.492 --> 16:37.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke with him earlier today,
and I asked,
with the deadline looming, and
reports of

16:37.697 --> 16:42.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2,000 veterans traveling to
North Dakota to
support the protesters, did he
fear Monday

16:42.735 --> 16:44.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
could get out of hand?

16:44.237 --> 16:45.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID ARCHAMBAULT II, Chairman,
Standing Rock
Sioux Tribe: No, I don't.

16:45.204 --> 16:48.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't believe that anything
will happen.

16:48.107 --> 16:52.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe that the Corps of
Engineers is not
going to come in with force, and
I don't think

16:52.044 --> 16:55.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the state government is going to
come with
force.

16:55.882 --> 17:00.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know that the veterans are
coming to
stand with peace and prayer.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Their presence is symbolic.

17:03.489 --> 17:10.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's representing the men and
women who fought
for this nation's freedom.

17:10.162 --> 17:17.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're coming here to let
the nation
know that it's not right to
treat indigenous

17:17.803 --> 17:21.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
peoples, to treat tribes in this
way.

17:21.107 --> 17:23.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have to start listening to
tribes.

17:23.442 --> 17:29.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's very symbolic for us to
know that our
veterans, the ones who fought
for this nation,

17:29.916 --> 17:31.050 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are coming.

17:31.083 --> 17:35.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not to -- they're not
coming to start
a war.

17:35.221 --> 17:39.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're coming to let the world
know that
they, too, stand with us.

17:39.792 --> 17:45.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And December 5, it's not going
to be a showdown.

17:45.831 --> 17:48.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just going to be another
day.

17:48.701 --> 17:52.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, if
protesters do stay
there, I mean, the governor and
many others

17:52.805 --> 17:58.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have said that it is just not
safe with subzero
temperatures being out there to
sleep out

17:58.244 --> 17:59.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the plains like this.

17:59.979 --> 18:04.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ARCHAMBAULT II: My comment
to that is
that it's not safe for law
enforcement to

18:04.884 --> 18:10.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spray water on water protectors
in subzero,
subfreezing temperatures.

18:10.856 --> 18:11.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's not safe.

18:11.958 --> 18:18.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not safe to fire concussion
grenades
at crowds.

18:18.130 --> 18:23.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not safe to fire rubber
bullets and target
people's heads.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.470 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's not safe.

18:24.503 --> 18:28.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People are there, and they are
ready for this.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They knew that winter was
coming.

18:30.376 --> 18:37.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They have some temporary
shelters that are
very insulated and warm, and
they are taking

18:37.049 --> 18:38.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care of each other.

18:38.851 --> 18:43.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They know how to check on each
other, and
they know what to do in case of
an emergency.

18:43.923 --> 18:49.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it is a safe place for
individuals to
gather and pray.

18:49.462 --> 18:57.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is not safe is the way law
enforcement
has been using aggression and
weapons on unarmed

18:57.837 --> 18:59.572 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

18:59.605 --> 19:02.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We spoke a few
weeks ago
with the CEO of the company that
is building

19:02.241 --> 19:08.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this pipeline, and he argues
that your concerns
over a leak into your water
supply are overblown.

19:08.180 --> 19:12.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, this is going to be
brand-new pipeline,
state-of-the-art, all safety
measures, and

19:12.752 --> 19:15.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you need not worry as much
as you seem
to be.

19:15.054 --> 19:17.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID ARCHAMBAULT II: And I
understand where
he's coming from.

19:17.123 --> 19:20.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if that's the case, then why
not put it
north of Bismarck, North Dakota?

19:20.893 --> 19:22.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

19:22.228 --> 19:23.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's where
it was originally
going to go.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID ARCHAMBAULT II: Right.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the safeguards are all there,
then it can
still go there.

19:28.734 --> 19:37.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will say that it can't go
there because
of the population of the
community, the environmental

19:37.309 --> 19:42.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impacts, the sacred sites that
are there,
the wetlands that it has to
cross.

19:42.281 --> 19:45.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These are all the same concerns
that we have.

19:45.184 --> 19:50.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just that we are a lot --
the numbers
show that we're a lot fewer.

19:50.689 --> 19:56.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so if the pipeline -- and if
there is
no worry, if the safeguards are
there, then

19:56.495 --> 19:58.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
relocate it to that location.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.732 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's OK.

19:59.765 --> 20:02.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But the
company says the
pipeline is not going to be
rerouted.

20:02.768 --> 20:05.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The governor says the pipeline
is not going
to be rerouted.

20:06.005 --> 20:09.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama will soon be out
of office,
and president-elect Trump has
made it very

20:09.308 --> 20:11.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clear that this pipeline is
going to be built.

20:11.310 --> 20:15.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ARCHAMBAULT II: Well, the
way I look
at it is, as long as the
pipeline isn't under

20:15.281 --> 20:18.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the river, there's still a
chance, there's
still hope.

20:18.451 --> 20:27.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's unfortunate that this
nation continues
to treat our tribe and tribal
nations around

20:27.059 --> 20:28.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this country in this manner.

20:28.928 --> 20:32.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have every right to protest
this pipeline.

20:32.898 --> 20:37.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have indigenous lands, we
have ancestral
lands, we have treaty lands.

20:37.269 --> 20:43.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The pipeline is 500 feet from
our reservation
border.

20:43.242 --> 20:52.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And history will show that the
federal government,
the state government has always
built the

20:52.485 --> 20:58.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economy, has secured energy
independence and
has secured national security
off the backs

20:58.691 --> 21:00.126 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of our nations.

21:00.159 --> 21:01.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is another example.

21:01.894 --> 21:06.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so whether the government
says, government
-- governor of North Dakota says
it's not

21:06.565 --> 21:12.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be rerouted, whether
Kelcy Warren,
the CEO of Energy Transfer
Partners, say it

21:12.438 --> 21:18.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won't be rerouted, and whether
the president-elect
says it won't be rerouted, we
still want to

21:18.978 --> 21:26.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
build awareness on the treatment
of our nations,
the first people of this nation,
and how everybody

21:26.085 --> 21:30.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
benefits from the costs that we
paid over
history.

21:30.389 --> 21:33.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
David Archambault,
chairman of the Standing Rock
Sioux, thank

21:33.959 --> 21:35.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you very much for being here.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID ARCHAMBAULT II: Yes.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're welcome.

21:38.531 --> 21:41.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You can find
all the "NewsHour"'s
coverage of the Dakota standoff
on our Web

21:41.567 --> 21:45.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

21:46.005 --> 21:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

21:57.149 --> 22:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields
and David Brooks on Trump's
Cabinet picks;

22:02.588 --> 22:07.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and is it time to end youth
football?

22:07.760 --> 22:13.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: In Cuba, a procession
with Fidel
Castro's ashes is approaching
the city of

22:13.199 --> 22:18.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Santiago, where the dictator who
died last
Friday began his revolutionary
journey nearly

22:18.938 --> 22:20.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
60 years ago.

22:20.739 --> 22:24.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In partnership with the Pulitzer
Center on
Crisis Reporting, special
correspondent Nick

22:24.743 --> 22:31.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Schifrin and producer Zach
Fannin look at
Castro's legacy and the future
of the island,

22:31.083 --> 22:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
starting along the route of his
final journey.

22:33.552 --> 22:39.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The road to Fidel
Castro's
final resting place was lined
with the revolution's

22:39.058 --> 22:44.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
faithful, for whom it's never
too early to
be wrapped in the flag.

22:44.463 --> 22:50.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the military that Castro
created circling
overhead and leading the way,
his ashes drove

22:50.669 --> 22:54.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by into the morning sun.

22:54.273 --> 23:01.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more than 55 years, Castro
was Cuba's
indispensable force, and many
here expressed

23:01.180 --> 23:06.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a sense of loss; 93-year-old
Zoila Andreu
Sain needed help from her
66-year-old daughter,

23:06.785 --> 23:07.753 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ailsa.

23:07.786 --> 23:09.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They live together on the parade
route.

23:09.655 --> 23:16.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were joined by a third
generation, 23-year-old
Giselle Gallego.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This family's revolutionary
faith hasn't faltered.

23:18.731 --> 23:24.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GISELLE GALLEGO, Cuba (through
translator):
My admiration for Fidel comes
above everything.

23:24.436 --> 23:28.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wasn't just a leader for the
Cuban revolution,
but a leader for the world.

23:28.140 --> 23:32.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The two
matriarchs show off
their favorite photos, a younger
son, Eugenio

23:32.911 --> 23:34.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
(ph), at the commander's side.

23:34.914 --> 23:39.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fidel made him the head of a
housing development
program, and provided the family
with opportunities

23:39.151 --> 23:40.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they have never forgotten.

23:40.986 --> 23:45.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AILSA NEREY ANDREU, Cuba
(through translator):
Women stopped being domestic
objects and were

23:45.224 --> 23:48.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given the chance to work, all
thanks to the
revolution and to Fidel.

23:48.694 --> 23:51.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZOILA ANDREU SAIN, Cuba (through
translator):
I love Fidel.

23:51.897 --> 23:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I love him very, very, very
much.

23:54.533 --> 23:56.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He fought for Cuba.

23:56.201 --> 23:59.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: They had marched right
across the
island in a triumphant progress,
joyfully

23:59.438 --> 24:01.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
acclaimed all the way.

24:01.974 --> 24:06.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: January 1959,
Castro and his
men seized Havana and overthrew
the Batista

24:06.178 --> 24:07.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dictatorship.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So began the hero's myth.

24:09.081 --> 24:12.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He'd descended from the
mountains and convinced
people he was Cuba's destined
savior.

24:12.685 --> 24:15.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For his fans, that origin story
still holds.

24:15.587 --> 24:19.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZOILA ANDREU SAIN (through
translator): He
took everything that was bad,
and made it

24:19.625 --> 24:20.959 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
better.

24:20.993 --> 24:24.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will continue to do so from
the cemetery
where he will rest.

24:24.063 --> 24:29.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But 30 miles
outside of Havana,
Fidel Castro's legacy is not as
universally

24:29.401 --> 24:31.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
positive.

24:31.136 --> 24:35.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is Hershey, named after the
American
chocolate baron, today,
population about 3,000.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Castro's 1959 revolution
promised a better
future.

24:38.844 --> 24:44.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here, as in many small towns
across Cuba,
the economic promises of the
revolution have

24:44.116 --> 24:50.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not been fulfilled.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The train used to arrive here
with Cubans
from many towns.

24:52.891 --> 24:59.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, it brings only a few
locals, just enough
to keep 29-year-old Carlos
Gonzalez afloat.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He sells tiny, folded pizzas for
20 cents.

25:02.301 --> 25:06.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARLOS GONZALEZ, Cuba (through
translator):
We struggle every day.

25:06.105 --> 25:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wake up at 3:00 a.m. to be
able to afford
food, afford clothes, and keep
on going.

25:11.343 --> 25:16.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Garcia's oldest
client is the
city's oldest resident;
92-year-old Amparo

25:16.915 --> 25:19.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dejongh was the first person
born here.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.420 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who's this?

25:21.453 --> 25:22.421 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's you?

25:22.454 --> 25:23.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMPARO DEJONGH, Cuba: Yes.

25:23.422 --> 25:24.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Wow.

25:24.423 --> 25:25.391 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Wonderful.

25:25.424 --> 25:27.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what kind of town was
Hershey?

25:27.359 --> 25:32.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMPARO DEJONGH (through
translator): It was
conceived to be perfect, in
housing, in education,

25:32.231 --> 25:33.699 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in social order.

25:33.732 --> 25:37.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Her photos show a
model town
created exactly a century ago.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hershey's sugar mill was one of
the world's
most modern.

25:39.571 --> 25:44.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the revolution, Castro
nationalized
the factory and all other
American property.

25:44.443 --> 25:47.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Eventually, the economy
collapsed.

25:47.513 --> 25:50.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, the factory is a heap of
rust.

25:50.282 --> 25:54.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once prosperous streets are
dotted with homes
long abandoned.

25:54.186 --> 25:56.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dejongh blames ineffective local
government
officials.

25:56.855 --> 26:00.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AMPARO DEJONGH (through
translator): The political
machine is very big.

26:00.526 --> 26:04.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here, they appoint a leader and
he does whatever
he wants.

26:04.496 --> 26:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Residents are
thankful for
the revolution's positive
advances.

26:09.435 --> 26:13.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The racial segregation that
Hershey imposed
on its workers has been replaced
with apparent

26:13.605 --> 26:16.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
racial equality.

26:16.575 --> 26:20.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Residents receive free health
care, and students
get free education.

26:20.546 --> 26:25.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for many, the economic
future remains
bleak.

26:25.083 --> 26:30.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you think about 1959 and
you think about
what this country has been
through since then,

26:30.656 --> 26:33.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do you view the legacy
positively or negatively?

26:33.125 --> 26:35.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't want to answer that
question.

26:35.260 --> 26:39.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His fear, says dissident Carlos
Millares Falcon,
is widespread.

26:39.531 --> 26:43.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What would happen to you if you
criticized
the government publicly?

26:43.202 --> 26:46.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLOS MILLARES FALCON, Cuba
(through translator):
Automatically, they would drive
me to the

26:46.872 --> 26:49.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
headquarters of internal
security very fast.

26:49.341 --> 26:53.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In his living
room, Falcon
keeps American and European
flags.

26:53.846 --> 26:59.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says Cuba lacks Western
freedoms of speech,
participation, and multiple
political parties.

26:59.284 --> 27:04.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That keeps criticism rare and
the opposition
fractured.

27:05.023 --> 27:09.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In March in Havana, President
Obama spoke
alongside current President Raul
Castro.

27:09.394 --> 27:13.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama argued that normalizing
relations would
force the Cuban government to
liberalize.

27:13.232 --> 27:18.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But from January to October this
year, the
government is reported to have
detained 9,125

27:18.437 --> 27:21.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people, more than quadruple the
2010 number.

27:21.406 --> 27:24.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLOS MILLARES FALCON (through
translator):
The pressure on us has
increased.

27:24.910 --> 27:27.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think Fidel's death will
create any
policy change.

27:27.679 --> 27:30.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government will maintain the
same policy
of zero tolerance.

27:30.582 --> 27:36.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But 22-year-old
Alejandro Rodriguez
says zero tolerance doesn't mean
zero evolution.

27:36.488 --> 27:41.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEJANDRO RODRIGUEZ, Cuba
(through translator):
For us young people, we do need
a change.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're tired of the same old,
same old.

27:43.028 --> 27:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In Cuba, the
Internet is rare
and expensive.

27:46.865 --> 27:51.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he collects the entertainment
people can't
get, and copies it onto hard
drives, called

27:51.670 --> 27:53.405 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
packets.

27:53.438 --> 27:56.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're full of local musicians
who pay to
be in the packet, alongside
illegally copied

27:56.375 --> 28:02.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TV shows, and bad shark movies.

28:03.015 --> 28:06.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The packets are delivered by
bike messenger.

28:06.885 --> 28:11.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unless the Internet opens, the
packet will
only get more popular, and
Rodriguez predicts

28:11.156 --> 28:13.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's not coming anytime soon.

28:13.091 --> 28:16.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEJANDRO RODRIGUEZ (through
translator):
The packet will last.

28:16.628 --> 28:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't see an end to it right
now.

28:18.330 --> 28:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In many ways,
Cuba's stuck
in the past.

28:21.366 --> 28:25.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But people seize whatever
openings they can
find; 80 percent of the country
works for

28:25.871 --> 28:31.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government, but, in the last
decade, Jesus
Reyes and half-a-million others
have been

28:31.209 --> 28:33.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
allowed to go private.

28:33.812 --> 28:35.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's trained as a nuclear
physicist.

28:35.581 --> 28:39.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His wife's a biologist, and,
together, their
job was finding a cure for
cancer, but that

28:39.985 --> 28:42.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
only paid each of them $40 a
month.

28:42.120 --> 28:46.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So while she stayed in science,
he's driving
a taxi.

28:46.858 --> 28:50.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESUS REYES, Cuba (through
translator): Unfortunately,
we have an inverted pyramid
here.

28:50.128 --> 28:54.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people who give more to
society make less
money, and those who give less
make more.

28:54.232 --> 28:58.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: He and his 1957
Chevrolet Bel
Air can make four or five times
what he made

28:58.604 --> 29:00.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as a government-paid physicist.

29:00.505 --> 29:02.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He wishes that wasn't the case.

29:02.407 --> 29:06.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He still believes in the
revolution's principles,
but he believes that Cuba needs
to change.

29:06.979 --> 29:12.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JESUS REYES (through
translator): It's one
thing to hold static, like we
are today, without

29:12.351 --> 29:15.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perfecting or improving, and
it's another
thing to slowly improve.

29:15.754 --> 29:19.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what people like me
aspire to, where
our individual values are
acknowledged.

29:19.691 --> 29:25.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Castro always
said that revolution
was a process and that change
was inevitable.

29:25.230 --> 29:30.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But holding onto the
revolution's principles
means that whatever change does
come is likely

29:30.035 --> 29:31.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to come slowly.

29:31.169 --> 29:37.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Nick
Schifrin
in Havana.

29:37.843 --> 29:49.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now back to
politics and a
whole week full of Cabinet
picks.

29:49.921 --> 29:52.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Time to turn to the analysis of
Shields and
Brooks.

29:52.691 --> 29:56.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know you have been paying
very close
attention to every one of these
nominations,

30:01.967 --> 30:03.669 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mark.

30:03.702 --> 30:08.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, David, so it's James Mattis
to Defense
this week, Tom Price, the
congressman, to

30:08.407 --> 30:12.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Health and Human Services, Steve
Mnuchin to
Treasury.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
David, what stands out here?

30:14.079 --> 30:15.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you think of what Mr.
Trump is doing?

30:15.380 --> 30:17.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I have to say,
he's exceeding
expectations.

30:17.783 --> 30:22.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, during the campaign,
he seemed
to be actively trying to
misgovern.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And here he seems to be to have
an effective
administration.

30:25.891 --> 30:27.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not all the people I
would pick.

30:27.859 --> 30:29.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But he won the election.

30:29.461 --> 30:32.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of them are not only good
for Trump,
but genuinely good picks.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
General Mattis, I think, is in
that.

30:33.799 --> 30:39.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a scholarly man, a good
leader, a man
with subtle foreign policy
views.

30:39.271 --> 30:43.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Others are experienced, Elaine
Chao, who has
already been.

30:43.575 --> 30:47.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Other people, Tom Price, are
experienced legislators.

30:47.345 --> 30:50.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they're people who know
their way around
Washington, while I think
representing the

30:50.682 --> 30:52.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump world view.

30:52.484 --> 30:56.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think, in general, for
those of us
who were a little skeptical of
Trump, it's,

30:56.354 --> 30:58.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I would say, exceeding
expectations.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Exceeding
expectations, Mark?

30:59.291 --> 31:00.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: A little
skeptical?

31:00.659 --> 31:01.626 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:01.660 --> 31:02.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Wow.

31:02.928 --> 31:05.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's dialing it back.

31:05.831 --> 31:07.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:07.599 --> 31:13.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, I am
pleased, relieved,
and almost thrilled with the
appointment of

31:13.705 --> 31:16.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
General James Mattis as
secretary of defense.

31:16.441 --> 31:18.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Whoa.

31:18.376 --> 31:23.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: General Joe
Dunford is the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Marine, former

31:23.548 --> 31:25.283 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
commandant.

31:25.317 --> 31:28.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now General Mattis, former
Marine, so
you can be sure that there will
be a lot of

31:28.320 --> 31:32.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sniping from the Army, the Navy,
because the
Marines are the smallest force.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But why am I pleased?

31:34.726 --> 31:37.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everything that David said about
General Mattis
is true.

31:37.295 --> 31:39.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He is a scholar.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's independent.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's thoughtful.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's smart.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's a great leader.

31:44.236 --> 31:50.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Marines have a rule, unlike
any other
military branch I know: Officers
eat last,

31:50.675 --> 31:52.544 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

31:52.577 --> 31:57.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is, no officer eats until
the sergeants,
the corporals, the privates
under his command

31:57.482 --> 31:58.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have first been fed.

31:58.717 --> 32:00.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you speak
from personal
experience.

32:00.352 --> 32:03.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: And nobody
embodied that more
than Jim Mattis.

32:03.722 --> 32:07.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was very much an enlisted
man's general.

32:07.058 --> 32:11.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the one quick anecdote, and
that is, when
General Charles Krulak was
commandant of the

32:11.229 --> 32:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marine Corps, every Christmas --
this was
in the late '90s -- he and his
wife would

32:14.900 --> 32:18.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bake cookies for the last couple
weeks before
Christmas.

32:18.436 --> 32:22.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he would get up at 4:00 in
the morning
with General Krulak and deliver
them in little

32:22.240 --> 32:26.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
packages to the Marines who were
standing
duty that day, because every
Marine base,

32:26.378 --> 32:29.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
every Marine post has be
somebody standing
duty.

32:29.214 --> 32:34.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he showed up at Quantico and
he asked
the Marine lance corporal who
was on duty,

32:34.920 --> 32:38.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where is the officer of the day
and who it
is?

32:38.390 --> 32:40.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said, it's General Mattis,
sir.

32:40.325 --> 32:42.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said, no, no, it's not
General Mattis.

32:42.327 --> 32:43.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, who is the officer of
the day?

32:43.929 --> 32:45.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he said, it's General
Mattis, sir.

32:45.797 --> 32:51.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And up comes Jim Mattis and a
general, brigadier
general, and he is on duty and
he has got

32:51.336 --> 32:52.470 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his sword.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the commandant says, what
are you doing
here?

32:54.306 --> 32:58.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, well, there was a young
lieutenant
who was on duty today, and he
has a wife and

32:58.076 --> 32:59.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two children.

32:59.444 --> 33:01.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I thought it was better that
he have Christmas
with his family.

33:01.546 --> 33:02.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the kind of man he is.

33:02.881 --> 33:04.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the kind of values he's
embodied.

33:04.749 --> 33:05.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's independent.

33:05.750 --> 33:06.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's strong.

33:06.751 --> 33:07.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he will be good for the
country.

33:07.752 --> 33:08.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wow.

33:08.820 --> 33:12.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, we're off to some high
praise here.

33:12.757 --> 33:15.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's talk about something else
that Donald
Trump did this week.

33:15.460 --> 33:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, the first public
speech he made
since the election, he went to
Indianapolis,

33:22.167 --> 33:28.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and announced a deal that he's
cut with the
Carrier Corporation, air
conditioners, furnaces,

33:28.306 --> 33:33.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to save 1,000 jobs, not all the
jobs that
were going to Mexico, but a lot
of them.

33:33.578 --> 33:35.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What kind of precedent does this
set?

33:35.380 --> 33:36.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are we to make of it?

33:36.481 --> 33:38.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I agree with Sarah
Palin on
this one.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:40.619 --> 33:43.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: She wrote an op-ed
today where
she called it crony capitalism
and a source

33:43.255 --> 33:44.656 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of corruption.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I think that's true.

33:46.558 --> 33:50.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The job of government is to be a
level playing
field where companies compete
and make money

33:50.862 --> 33:52.631 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
honestly.

33:52.664 --> 33:56.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And by rewarding one company
over another,
by getting involved in these
sort of petty

33:56.067 --> 34:00.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deals, the first thing you're
doing is encouraging
rent-seeking, for companies to
make money

34:00.672 --> 34:03.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
off government, rather than the
honest way.

34:03.608 --> 34:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the second thing, it's --
and especially
in this administration, it's an
invitation

34:06.678 --> 34:08.446 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to corruption.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're cutting deals with
company after
company, doing this kind of
deal, that kind

34:10.482 --> 34:13.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of deal, inevitably, there is
going to be
a quid pro quo.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is going to be
under-the-table lobbying.

34:15.220 --> 34:18.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's just a terrible
precedent for our
economy and for the
administration.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even with the
1,000 jobs?

34:20.358 --> 34:22.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, first of
all, it's a very
expensive way to save 1,000
jobs.

34:22.928 --> 34:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second of all, Carrier is owned
-- the parent
company is United Technologies,
a defense

34:27.966 --> 34:32.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contractor, totally dependent on
U.S. government
interests for their well-being.

34:32.604 --> 34:36.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we can't lean on these people
and negotiate
a good deal with them, and where
we have to

34:36.408 --> 34:42.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pay $700,000 in tax credits to
save 1,000
jobs, it's a bad deal, even from
that perspective.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's very expensive.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.049 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

34:44.082 --> 34:45.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Excuse me.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are you as worried about it?

34:46.184 --> 34:47.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, I'm not as
worried about
it.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it is bad public policy.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think it's a political
masterstroke.

34:51.489 --> 34:55.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think Donald Trump raised this
issue during
the campaign.

34:55.460 --> 35:01.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When it first appeared, when
Carrier showed
the gross insensitivity, where
it was on YouTube,

35:01.066 --> 35:06.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where they went in and told the
1,000 workers
that their jobs were leaving,
that the company

35:06.805 --> 35:11.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was leaving, and it was just --
it was abjectly
insensitive to the workers.

35:11.843 --> 35:13.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump picked that up.

35:13.812 --> 35:19.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was part of his prairie
populism of the
time, unlike his Cabinet
appointments to Treasury

35:19.551 --> 35:21.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Commerce.

35:21.720 --> 35:26.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, Judy, there is
1,000 people who
are going to have Christmas who
weren't going

35:26.324 --> 35:27.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to have Christmas.

35:28.026 --> 35:29.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And were there deals cut?

35:29.594 --> 35:30.829 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sure.

35:30.862 --> 35:33.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And have there been deals cut on
crony capitalism
in the past?

35:33.598 --> 35:34.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

35:34.599 --> 35:35.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's always gone to the company.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's been a long time.

35:37.402 --> 35:40.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I give Barack Obama great credit
for the rescue
of the United States automobile
industry.

35:40.772 --> 35:43.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It saved hundreds of thousands
of jobs.

35:43.208 --> 35:48.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact is, we have had
deals cut, and
the jobs have ended up going
elsewhere.

35:48.880 --> 35:53.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Donald Trump, this
is a masterstroke
that he said he would do
something, he did

35:53.451 --> 35:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, and it's been a long time
since the president
of the United States has made
that kind of

35:58.323 --> 35:59.290 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an announcement.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What would you
say back?

36:01.092 --> 36:02.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, first of
all, there will
be 1,000 people who will have
Christmas.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's true.

36:04.095 --> 36:05.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there will be a lot of
people who will
be paying for that.

36:05.964 --> 36:09.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second of all, you will have a
less efficient
economy, so there will be less
job creation.

36:09.467 --> 36:14.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Third, when companies ship jobs
overseas,
they don't like just take the
factory and

36:14.139 --> 36:16.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
then move it abroad.

36:16.074 --> 36:18.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They gradually do what is in
their economic
best interests, which is to
scale back production

36:18.610 --> 36:21.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here or flatline it and scale it
up there.

36:21.613 --> 36:26.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the economics is still
favoring a job in
Mexico over a job in Indiana,
Carrier will

36:26.651 --> 36:29.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still be doing it, but they will
be getting
a lot of taxpayer money, and we
will have

36:29.654 --> 36:31.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a sludgier economy.

36:31.489 --> 36:36.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mark, this
isn't just a
drop in the bucket, in the face
of an enormous

36:36.428 --> 36:38.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- enormous economic changes?

36:38.496 --> 36:40.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, of course it
is.

36:40.665 --> 36:46.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But did he do something that
positively affected
people's lives?

36:46.104 --> 36:47.072 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

36:47.105 --> 36:50.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it a coherent national
macro-policy?

36:50.241 --> 36:51.443 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

36:51.476 --> 36:57.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as a micro-act, it's a very
positive act
politically.

36:57.649 --> 37:04.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it reflects better
upon him and
his commitment to these people
and their well-being

37:04.656 --> 37:08.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and their survival than an awful
lot that's
happened in the past.

37:08.326 --> 37:10.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we have
been talking
a lot about Donald Trump.

37:10.528 --> 37:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do want to bring up the
Democrats today,
because this week in the House,
David, they

37:15.366 --> 37:21.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voted again on their leadership,
Nancy Pelosi
reelected to be the minority
leader, but with

37:21.840 --> 37:24.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not as large a vote as the last
time.

37:24.175 --> 37:30.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She won two-thirds against a
challenge from
an Ohio congressman, Tim Ryan.

37:30.215 --> 37:32.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's going on with the
Democrats?

37:32.517 --> 37:36.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're hearing more of them
speak out and
say, we don't like the kind of
campaign that

37:36.421 --> 37:40.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton ran, we have got
to be worried
about things that we weren't
worried about

37:40.492 --> 37:41.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this election.

37:41.626 --> 37:42.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I don't think
they're that far
along.

37:42.994 --> 37:45.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans were preparing for a
big defeat
and then reorganization.

37:45.997 --> 37:47.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats were preparing for
victory.

37:47.665 --> 37:49.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I don't think the Democrats
are that far
along on where the party should
go.

37:49.868 --> 37:52.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you can see the objection to
Pelosi.

37:52.370 --> 37:56.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's -- the top three leaders
in the House
on the Democratic side are all
in their mid-70s.

37:56.875 --> 38:01.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's some San Francisco, not
exactly -- if
you're trying to reach Ohio.

38:01.646 --> 38:05.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And is she a fresh face for the
party in an
era of change?

38:05.116 --> 38:06.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Well, no.

38:06.751 --> 38:09.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, she's a
really good tactician
and a good legislative leader.

38:09.254 --> 38:12.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I can see why she ended up
winning, because
it's a local race.

38:12.490 --> 38:15.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And they probably wanted
somebody who could
master the craft of legislation.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, plus, they all owe her to a
great degree.

38:18.596 --> 38:22.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's a testimony to her
that, even in
an extremely adverse climate,
it's a testament

38:22.934 --> 38:26.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to what people think of her
skills, I would
say, that she ended up winning,
you know,

38:26.704 --> 38:27.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
still by a reasonably
comfortable margin.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you make
of this?

38:29.407 --> 38:33.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think David is
right in his
assessment of Leader Pelosi.

38:33.545 --> 38:38.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that she's from San
Francisco, if
anything, is a help, in the
sense that you

38:38.516 --> 38:44.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want a leader who can take tough
positions
and not jeopardize their own
survival.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's one of the things you
want in a leader.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She has been a very formidable
leader.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She was a great speaker.

38:50.695 --> 38:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think for the people --
and it was a
considerable vote.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A third of her caucus voted
against her.

38:57.602 --> 39:03.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only 12 people came out publicly
and were
willing to stand up with Tim
Ryan, but, in

39:03.708 --> 39:08.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
private, 64 or 63 came out and
voted in the
secret ballot for him.

39:08.713 --> 39:13.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there had been 35 that had
come out, then
maybe there might have been 75
or 80 who had

39:13.051 --> 39:14.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been so emboldened to vote
outside.

39:14.852 --> 39:18.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she did prevail, for the
reason that David
cited.

39:18.389 --> 39:23.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In addition to that, to put the
folks on Nancy
Pelosi is absolutely ludicrous.

39:23.761 --> 39:25.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Democrats have an enormous
problem.

39:26.030 --> 39:31.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, as we sit here, there are
five states
in the United States that have a
Democratic

39:31.035 --> 39:34.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
governor and two houses of the
legislature
controlled by Democrats.

39:34.639 --> 39:36.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's the lowest in the
history.

39:36.507 --> 39:41.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are 12 fewer Democratic
senators than
there were the day that Barack
Obama was sworn

39:41.412 --> 39:42.780 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

39:42.814 --> 39:46.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are 16 fewer Democratic
governors than
there were the day.

39:46.517 --> 39:50.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nobody redistricts state lines
than there
were the day that Barack Obama
was sworn in.

39:50.688 --> 39:52.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There are 63 fewer House
members.

39:52.590 --> 39:57.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are fewer Democratic state
legislators
today in the 50 states than
there have been

39:57.695 --> 40:00.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at any time in history, at any
time in history.

40:00.531 --> 40:03.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Judy -- ever since 1900, I
should say.

40:03.568 --> 40:08.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I look at this and say, the
Democratic
Party is noncompetitive west of
New Jersey,

40:08.172 --> 40:15.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the way to Carson City,
Nevada, with the
exception of the blue island of
Illinois and

40:15.813 --> 40:17.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Latino-strengthened states of
New Mexico and
Colorado.

40:17.282 --> 40:19.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Other than that, it's red.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're not competitive.

40:20.885 --> 40:25.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to just say it's Nancy
Pelosi's fault
and that her replacement would
somehow solve

40:25.456 --> 40:28.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their problems is self-deception
writ large.

40:28.159 --> 40:30.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, are there
solutions out
there, David?

40:30.461 --> 40:31.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It's not her
fault.

40:31.729 --> 40:34.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I wouldn't say she's the
solution, though.

40:34.232 --> 40:36.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so which way does the
Democratic Party
go?

40:36.734 --> 40:39.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's likely that they
will go in the
Elizabeth Warren direction.

40:39.971 --> 40:41.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that may not be stupid.

40:41.339 --> 40:45.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There may be a populist way to
tap into what
Trump popped into.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But so far that has never
happened.

40:47.245 --> 40:51.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far, when they have gone
left, whether
it's Howard Dean or Jesse
Jackson, they have

40:52.016 --> 40:53.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lost the heartland.

40:53.718 --> 40:58.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have lost people who
are angry at
government, but don't seem to be
angry at

40:58.122 --> 40:59.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
business.

40:59.924 --> 41:05.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so going to the center would
violate all
the momentum you feel on the
left, but I do

41:05.463 --> 41:07.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think there is some case to be
made for it.

41:07.332 --> 41:11.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you saying
that's what
happened in this election, I
mean, in the

41:11.169 --> 41:12.103 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2016...

41:12.136 --> 41:13.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, they
culturally lost.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part of the problem is simply
Democrats as
individuals, not as a political
party, are

41:15.707 --> 41:17.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
moving to very few places.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so they're clustering.

41:18.976 --> 41:21.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's just a demographic
problem for
the party.

41:21.346 --> 41:27.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: When Barack Obama
was reelected
in 2012 with the majority of the
vote in the

41:27.185 --> 41:31.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, first president since
Eisenhower
to win a popular majority in
consecutive elections,

41:31.989 --> 41:35.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he failed to carry a majority of
congressional
districts.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That hasn't happened since 1960.

41:36.828 --> 41:41.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, so the Democrats are not
competitive
in large swathes of the country.

41:41.632 --> 41:45.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're a coastal party.

41:45.670 --> 41:50.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they have become -- and
I think Nancy
Pelosi bears some of the burden
on this -- I

41:50.541 --> 41:53.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think they have become too
culturally liberal
a party.

41:53.511 --> 42:01.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that there's been a
willingness to
emphasize LGBTQ issues, rather
than working-class

42:01.419 --> 42:08.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues of people in declining
incomes and
families falling behind and
Carrier jobs leaving.

42:08.059 --> 42:13.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's been -- that the
Democrats
have become a party that, quite
honestly,

42:13.364 --> 42:17.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is more emphasizing the cultural
issues.

42:17.268 --> 42:19.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's been to their
disadvantage
in their national appeal.

42:19.737 --> 42:23.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on that note,
maybe the
Democrats will have an autopsy
like the Republicans

42:23.941 --> 42:24.909 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
had.

42:24.942 --> 42:25.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It certainly
helped them.

42:25.943 --> 42:26.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It certainly did.

42:26.944 --> 42:27.879 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
It did.

42:27.912 --> 42:28.880 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:28.913 --> 42:29.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It was a good
autopsy.

42:29.914 --> 42:33.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

42:33.317 --> 42:43.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
David Brooks,
thank you.

42:43.461 --> 42:50.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will be back
in a moment
with one view on why children
should stop

42:50.735 --> 42:52.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
playing football.

42:52.069 --> 42:55.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, take a moment to
hear from your
local PBS station.

42:55.907 --> 43:01.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which
helps keep programs like ours on
the air.

43:01.312 --> 43:03.214 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

43:03.247 --> 43:13.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally: As the
college football
season comes to an end, Keith
Strudler, director

43:13.357 --> 43:18.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally: As the
college football
season comes to an end, Keith
Strudler, director

43:18.062 --> 43:23.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Marist College's Center for
Sports Communication,
shares his ideas about children
on the field.

43:23.601 --> 43:28.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's another in our regular
Friday series,
IMHO: In My Humble Opinion.

43:28.339 --> 43:33.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH STRUDLER, Director, Marist
College Center
for Sports Communication: I
think it's time

43:33.478 --> 43:35.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we end youth football
altogether.

43:35.446 --> 43:42.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not talking about the NFL or
college football,
or even high school and middle
school.

43:42.220 --> 43:47.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm talking about
5-through-10-year-olds,
grade school kids, the kids
that, when they

43:47.358 --> 43:50.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put on shoulder pads, they're
wider than they
are tall.

43:50.962 --> 43:52.396 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let me be clear.

43:52.430 --> 43:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I like youth sports, and I watch
a lot of
football.

43:56.400 --> 43:59.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I embrace the positive virtues
kids can get
from organized athletics.

43:59.337 --> 44:01.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, why get rid of kids
football?

44:01.172 --> 44:07.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have got three reasons, and
none of them
have anything to do with
concussions, although

44:07.712 --> 44:10.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's a fine reason as well.

44:10.948 --> 44:17.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For starters, young kids playing
football
is about as natural as pigs
playing piano.

44:17.522 --> 44:20.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They can do it, but it's forced.

44:20.391 --> 44:25.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kids that age barely understand
simple concepts,
like how mom is related to
cousin Jacob or

44:25.329 --> 44:27.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why you can't have cotton candy
for dinner.

44:27.765 --> 44:33.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we're trying to teach them
how the left
tackle covers the blind side in
an I-formation.

44:33.170 --> 44:45.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For young kids with developing
minds and bodies,
moving and exploring should come
before memorizing

44:45.650 --> 44:47.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
playbooks.

44:47.351 --> 44:57.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Next, when most kids sign up for
sports, they
want to do two things: touch the
ball and

44:57.395 --> 45:03.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Next, when most kids sign up for
sports, they
want to do two things: touch the
ball and

45:03.968 --> 45:05.803 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
score.

45:05.836 --> 45:15.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In youth football, the first
thing coach tells
most of the team is that you
will never do

45:15.880 --> 45:22.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In youth football, the first
thing coach tells
most of the team is that you
will never do

45:22.286 --> 45:30.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
either of those things, and, if
you try, someone's
going to throw a yellow flag,
which gets the

45:30.895 --> 45:34.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
whole team in trouble.

45:34.265 --> 45:40.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's like making the whole
office work late
because Frank from accounting
faked a sick

45:40.271 --> 45:41.772 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

45:41.806 --> 45:46.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, what kinds of lessons
do young kids
learn from playing football?

45:46.344 --> 45:53.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That boys compete and girls
cheer?

45:53.184 --> 45:55.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That success comes through brute
force?

45:55.853 --> 46:02.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or that life's work is to take
someone's property,
known here as field possession?

46:02.426 --> 46:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope that these are fading
constructs in
a collaborative, idea-based
society.

46:09.066 --> 46:12.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope that these are fading
constructs in
a collaborative, idea-based
society.

46:37.561 --> 46:47.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You could argue these are
problems for older
kids in football as well.

46:47.605 --> 46:56.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You could argue these are
problems for older
kids in football as well.

46:56.580 --> 47:05.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But with age comes cognitive
development and
a more nuanced understanding of
the differences

47:05.823 --> 47:08.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between sports and reality.

47:08.092 --> 47:14.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A 6-year-old may not realize
that football
is not a metaphor for life.

47:14.498 --> 47:18.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A 6-year-old may not realize
that football
is not a metaphor for life.

47:43.160 --> 47:54.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, this doesn't mean I could
never get behind
youth football.

47:54.472 --> 48:07.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Imagine football if everyone
touched the ball,
and most people had a shot at
scoring, where

48:07.585 --> 48:12.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kids move all game, and boys and
girls play
together.

48:12.456 --> 48:18.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a football I could put my
kids in.

48:18.395 --> 48:22.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Funny thing, that football
already exists.

48:22.333 --> 48:24.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Only, in America, we call it
soccer.

48:24.635 --> 48:29.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Online: First
lady Jacqueline
Kennedy was known for guarding
