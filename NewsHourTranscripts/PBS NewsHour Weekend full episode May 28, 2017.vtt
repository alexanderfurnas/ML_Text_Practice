05:44.233 --> 05:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

05:45.866 --> 05:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HOW DID WE GET HERE?

05:47.933 --> 05:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY 17 YEARS OUT ARE WE TALKING

05:50.166 --> 05:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT OUR ADVERSARY CONTROLLING

05:51.900 --> 05:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
40% OF OUR COUNTRY?

05:53.400 --> 05:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE NEVER REALLY DEFINED WHAT

05:54.933 --> 05:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE WERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH.

05:57.033 --> 05:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAD A LONG LIST OF GOALS

05:58.966 --> 06:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH WERE CAPTURING AND KILLING

06:01.266 --> 06:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRORISTS.

06:03.033 --> 06:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE WERE NEVER EXACTLY

06:04.766 --> 06:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLEAR WHERE THE BOUNDARY AROUND

06:07.400 --> 06:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT CATEGORY WAS AND TRYING TO

06:09.066 --> 06:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STABILIZE AFGHANISTAN, THOSE TWO

06:10.866 --> 06:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MISSIONS GOT IN THEIR WAY.

06:13.133 --> 06:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE WERE DISTRACTED BY IRAQ.

06:16.133 --> 06:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE NEVER REALLY HAD AN ADEQUATE

06:17.266 --> 06:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE

06:19.933 --> 06:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEM WAS, AND WE DID NOT PAY

06:21.100 --> 06:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTENTION TO THE REGION AROUND

06:22.666 --> 06:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFGHANISTAN WHICH HAS CHANGED

06:24.933 --> 06:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY RADICALLY IN THE 16 YEARS

06:25.766 --> 06:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR SO THAT WE HAVE BEEN

06:26.800 --> 06:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE.

06:28.066 --> 06:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: IT SEEMS LIKE

06:29.466 --> 06:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE TWO GOALS NOW THAT ARE

06:31.566 --> 06:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTERING EACH OTHER.

06:32.933 --> 06:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CAN EITHER STABILIZE THE

06:34.100 --> 06:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY OR ROAD OUT THE

06:35.533 --> 06:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRORISTS.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU CAN HAVE A PERMANENT U.S.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY PRESENCE THERE TO TRY

06:40.833 --> 06:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO KEEP STRIKING AT TERRORISTS

06:43.866 --> 06:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OTHER ENEMIES AND SO ON IN

06:46.700 --> 06:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REGION OR YOU CAN TRY AND

06:48.166 --> 06:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STABILIZE THE COUNTRY.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THE COUNTRY CANNOT BE

06:51.400 --> 06:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STABILIZED WITH A PERMANENT

06:53.200 --> 06:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESENCE OF U.S. TROOPS BECAUSE

06:54.900 --> 06:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE

06:56.233 --> 06:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGION DON'T WANT US THERE AND

06:57.733 --> 06:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY LET US KNOW THAT BY

06:59.300 --> 07:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORTING THE TALIBAN.

07:00.466 --> 07:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT DID THE

07:01.966 --> 07:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION GET WRONG?

07:03.200 --> 07:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> OF COURSE I WAS THERE.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN MY OPINION, THE BIG MISTAKES

07:10.666 --> 07:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE, ONE, WHEN OBAMA ANNOUNCED

07:15.333 --> 07:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A TROOP SURGE, HE SHOULD NOT

07:16.566 --> 07:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE GIVEN A DATE FOR

07:18.633 --> 07:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHDRAWING IT.

07:20.333 --> 07:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TWO, WHEN HE ANNOUNCED THE

07:21.900 --> 07:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TROOP SURGE THAT IS THE TIME HE

07:24.233 --> 07:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULD HAVE MADE VERY

07:25.733 --> 07:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAR-REACHING OFFERS OF

07:27.866 --> 07:30.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT.

07:30.866 --> 07:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNFORTUNATELY OUR MILITARY AND

07:32.600 --> 07:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY OTHERS IN THE GOVERNMENT

07:34.433 --> 07:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELIEVE YOU SHOULDN'T MAKE ANY

07:35.666 --> 07:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFERS OF NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT

07:36.900 --> 07:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNTIL YOU HAVE ALREADY SUCCEEDED

07:38.200 --> 07:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARILY.

07:39.933 --> 07:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THAT IS TOO LATE.

07:41.400 --> 07:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE TO DO IT WHEN YOUR

07:45.000 --> 07:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAPACITIES ARE INCREASING.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I BELIEVE THEY ARE ABOUT TO MAKE

07:48.633 --> 07:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SAME MISTAKE NOW.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE ABOUT TO ADD MORE

07:52.333 --> 07:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TROOPS AND THEN THEY SAY WHEN

07:54.166 --> 07:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE STRONGER THEY WILL MAKE

07:57.200 --> 07:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OFFER OF NEGOTIATION.

07:58.733 --> 08:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WOULDN'T THE

08:01.266 --> 08:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
5,000 TROOPS MAKE A DIFFERENCE?

08:02.400 --> 08:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> OF COURSE THE 5,000 TROOPS

08:04.633 --> 08:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL MAKE SOME DIFFERENCE BUT

08:06.933 --> 08:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WILL MAKE ONLY A MARGINAL

08:08.666 --> 08:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENCE.

08:10.500 --> 08:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY MIGHT STOP THE EROSION OF

08:11.800 --> 08:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STALEMATE AS IT IS NOW AS IF

08:13.300 --> 08:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU SAY, THESE ESTIMATES ARE ALL

08:16.366 --> 08:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY DUBIOUS BUT LET'S SAY THE

08:18.400 --> 08:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALIBAN CONTROL APPROXIMATELY

08:22.033 --> 08:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
40% OF THE POPULATION.

08:23.633 --> 08:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL, MAYBE WITH 5,000 TROOPS WE

08:24.900 --> 08:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD GET THAT DOWN TO 30% OR

08:27.966 --> 08:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
25%.

08:29.833 --> 08:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WOULD NOT BE DECISIVE IN

08:31.766 --> 08:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY WAY.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN OF COURSE OUR TROOPS

08:34.266 --> 08:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE NOT GOING TO BE THERE

08:34.900 --> 08:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOREVER.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES WE TELL

08:37.000 --> 08:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE THAT WE'RE COMMITTED

08:38.266 --> 08:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
