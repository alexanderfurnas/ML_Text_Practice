>> Sreenivasan: HOW DO YOU HELP

04:16.590 --> 04:17.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A CITY MOVE FORWARD FROM

04:17.691 --> 04:19.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

04:19.226 --> 04:20.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I THINK FIRST OF ALL

04:20.260 --> 04:21.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST.

04:21.828 --> 04:24.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK, IF YOU PUT A MIRROR TO

04:24.097 --> 04:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOURSELF, YOU JUST SAY, "WHERE

04:26.166 --> 04:27.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE WE?"

04:27.801 --> 04:29.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND YOU KNOW, THIS CITY MOVED

04:29.736 --> 04:31.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TREMENDOUSLY AFTER THE KENNEDY

04:31.872 --> 04:34.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSASSINATION IN '63, I MEAN,

04:34.441 --> 04:36.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE GREAT CITIES IN THE

04:36.376 --> 04:39.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORLD WAS CREATED THROUGH THAT,

04:39.913 --> 04:41.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO YOU USE THESE

04:41.148 --> 04:42.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPORTUNITIES TO BE HONEST WITH

04:42.516 --> 04:44.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOURSELF, AND I THINK WE REALIZE

04:44.751 --> 04:46.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT YOU CAN HOLD TWO THOUGHTS

04:46.720 --> 04:48.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN YOUR MIND, YOU CAN HOLD

04:48.722 --> 04:51.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICE OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR

04:51.258 --> 04:54.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A FEW SITUATIONS, AND TOUGH

04:54.961 --> 04:57.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATIONS, BUT AT THE SAME TIME

04:57.397 --> 04:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALIZE IT'S OUR POLICE OFFICERS

04:59.566 --> 05:01.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT KEEP US SAFE.

05:01.835 --> 05:02.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE

05:02.769 --> 05:03.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE

05:03.970 --> 05:05.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SUPPORT THEM, AND I THINK A

05:05.672 --> 05:07.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOOD CITY, A GOOD COMMUNITY

05:07.240 --> 05:08.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD UNDERSTAND HOW TO PUT

05:08.441 --> 05:10.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE TWO THOUGHTS TOGETHER.

05:10.377 --> 05:11.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT DO YOU DO

05:11.344 --> 05:12.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE INTERIM?

05:12.379 --> 05:13.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DO YOU GET TO THAT POINT

05:13.780 --> 05:15.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE A YOUNG PERSON WHO WAS

05:15.048 --> 05:16.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTESTING YESTERDAY SEES THE

05:16.449 --> 05:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VALUE OF THE PERSON WHO WAS

05:17.817 --> 05:19.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTECTING THEM?

05:19.553 --> 05:20.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, I THINK THEY WILL.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH THIS.

05:21.888 --> 05:24.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SADLY PEOPLE DIED, AND THERE ARE

05:24.224 --> 05:26.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO BE THOSE INDIVIDUALS

05:26.359 --> 05:28.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WERE IN THE PROTEST SAYING,

05:28.195 --> 05:30.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"WE LOVE OUR POLICE."

05:30.630 --> 05:32.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT IF

05:32.465 --> 05:36.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE FOLKS HAD NOT DIED.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE

05:38.171 --> 05:40.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
START, BUT THIS IS A BIGGER

05:40.974 --> 05:42.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUE THAN JUST A CITY.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS A COUNTRY ISSUE.

05:44.611 --> 05:47.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A MEDIA ISSUE.

05:47.914 --> 05:49.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS A POLITICAL LEADERSHIP

05:49.082 --> 05:50.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUE.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE GOT TO PUT PEOPLE ON THE

05:51.985 --> 05:53.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAME STAGE THAT HAVE OPPOSING

05:53.853 --> 05:56.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIEWS, AND BE ABLE TO DISAGREE

05:56.990 --> 06:01.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGREEABLY AND NOT EXACERBATE THE

06:01.828 --> 06:05.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTREMISM THAT MANY OF US HAVE

06:05.065 --> 06:06.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATURALLY.

06:06.132 --> 06:07.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE WANT TO BE PASSIONATE ABOUT

06:07.334 --> 06:08.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE WANT TO TELL THE WORLD THAT

06:10.470 --> 06:11.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE RIGHT AND EVERYBODY ELSE

06:11.638 --> 06:13.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS WRONG.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT'S JUST LIKE-- JUST CHILL

06:14.774 --> 06:16.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT A LITTLE BIT, AND LET'S

06:16.109 --> 06:17.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISTEN TO ONE ANOTHER.

06:17.277 --> 06:18.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THE CHILLING OUT

06:18.812 --> 06:19.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE-- THE

06:19.713 --> 06:21.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DE-ESCALATION IS ACTUALLY KEY TO

06:21.982 --> 06:23.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT YOUR POLICE OFFICERS HAVE

06:23.350 --> 06:24.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN TRAINED TO DO.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> VERY MUCH SO.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, VERY MUCH SO, AND

06:27.387 --> 06:29.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE SO PROUD-- I'VE SEEN SOME

06:29.422 --> 06:31.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY,

06:31.925 --> 06:33.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I'VE TALKED TO OUR OFFICERS

06:33.226 --> 06:34.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY SAID "WE WOULD HAVE

06:34.494 --> 06:35.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEVER DONE IT THAT WAY, BECAUSE

06:35.762 --> 06:36.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE KNOW HOW TO DE-ESCALATE

06:36.730 --> 06:38.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATIONS."

06:38.698 --> 06:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO PROUD AND

06:40.100 --> 06:42.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HEARTBROKEN AT THE SAME TIME,

06:42.168 --> 06:43.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE WE HAVE THOSE SKILL SETS

06:43.470 --> 06:45.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT YET, THEY'RE DEAD TODAY.

06:45.705 --> 06:47.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU KNOW, YOU

06:47.874 --> 06:49.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MENTIONED THAT AS TRAGIC AS IT

06:49.943 --> 06:51.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS, THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION

06:51.278 --> 06:52.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS A TURNING POINT FOR THIS

06:52.479 --> 06:52.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY.

06:52.912 --> 06:53.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT WAS.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: FIVE YEARS FROM

06:54.281 --> 06:55.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, TEN YEARS FROM NOW, IS THIS

06:55.649 --> 06:56.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO BE ONE OF THOSE TURNING

06:56.916 --> 06:58.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINTS, AND WHAT DO YOU HOPE THE

06:58.551 --> 07:00.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY TURNS INTO?

07:00.220 --> 07:02.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED

07:02.522 --> 07:04.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CITY TO BE THE CITY OF THE

07:04.391 --> 07:05.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
21st CENTURY.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE A YOUNG CITY.

07:06.559 --> 07:09.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
160 YEARS OLD.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'VE GOT GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE THE PLACE WHERE MORE SMALL

07:12.732 --> 07:14.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESSES COME.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE JOBS BEING CREATED.

07:16.670 --> 07:21.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT HOPEFULLY THIS WILL MAKE US

07:21.074 --> 07:24.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE, UM, PASSIONATE ABOUT

07:24.744 --> 07:26.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEALING WITH THE INCOME

07:26.079 --> 07:27.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISPARITY THAT WE HAVE AS A

07:27.414 --> 07:29.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UM, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IN THAT

07:30.450 --> 07:32.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCOME DISPARITY THAT THESE

07:32.886 --> 07:35.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS START TO KIND OF TAKE

07:35.855 --> 07:39.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEED AND POP UP, AND HOPEFULLY

07:39.459 --> 07:41.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS WE GO FORWARD, WE'LL DEAL

07:41.728 --> 07:42.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH OUR EDUCATION ISSUES

07:42.862 --> 07:43.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETTER.

07:43.863 --> 07:47.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'LL DEAL WITH A JOB CREATION

07:47.934 --> 07:50.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS BETTER,

07:50.637 --> 07:52.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS OPPOSED TO SAYING IT'S

07:52.005 --> 07:53.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM.

07:53.506 --> 07:54.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

07:54.407 --> 07:56.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAGEDY PUT A FINE POINT ON IT?

07:56.376 --> 07:57.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DOES IT GET PEOPLE TO THINK

07:57.444 --> 07:58.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THOSE DEEP UNDERLYING

07:58.912 --> 08:01.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUES THAT ARE SO HUGE?

08:01.448 --> 08:06.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, WHAT I KNOW IS THAT

08:06.319 --> 08:09.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE SAFE.

08:09.255 --> 08:13.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHEN A POLICE OFFICER IS

08:13.893 --> 08:18.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KILLED BY A RANDOM GUNMAN,

08:18.331 --> 08:20.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE REALIZE, "OH, I'M THIS

08:20.734 --> 08:23.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLOSE-- I'M THIS CLOSE... IF IT

08:23.403 --> 08:25.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASN'T FOR THEM, I'D BE THAT

INDIVIDUAL."

08:26.673 --> 08:29.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THERE'S A SOBRIETY

08:29.075 --> 08:31.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT TAKES PLACE AND WE NEED TO

08:31.244 --> 08:33.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RALLY AROUND THAT FOUNDATION WE

08:33.380 --> 08:36.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE OF PUBLIC SAFETY, UM, AND

08:36.216 --> 08:38.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN SAY, ASK THE QUESTION "WHY

08:38.184 --> 08:40.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FIRST OF ALL, PROFESSOR, CAN YOU

09:24.998 --> 09:26.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST TELL ME, WHEN WE'RE TALKING

09:26.499 --> 09:28.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT USE OF FORCE, WHAT ARE WE

09:28.101 --> 09:29.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALKING ABOUT EXACTLY?

09:29.936 --> 09:31.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

09:31.271 --> 09:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION, BECAUSE DIFFERENT

09:32.705 --> 09:34.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPARTMENTS DEFINE IT SOMEWHAT

09:34.374 --> 09:34.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENTLY.

09:34.874 --> 09:36.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

09:36.109 --> 09:37.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT, WAS TO

09:37.811 --> 09:39.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARMONIZE DATA ACROSS DIFFERENT

09:39.946 --> 09:40.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPARTMENTS SO WE CAN

09:40.980 --> 09:42.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEANINGFULLY COMPARE THEM, IN

09:42.549 --> 09:44.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE

09:44.050 --> 09:45.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IDENTIFYING AS USE OF FORCE, BUT

09:45.852 --> 09:46.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERALLY, WHAT WE'RE TALKING

09:46.920 --> 09:49.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT IS WHEN POLICE USE

09:49.088 --> 09:53.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PHYSICAL FORCE TO DETAIN OR MOVE

09:53.193 --> 09:57.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR BRING INTO COMPLIANCE A

09:57.697 --> 09:59.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIVILIAN THEY'RE DEALING WITH,

09:59.432 --> 10:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT COULD RANGE FROM

10:01.067 --> 10:03.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR MERE PRESENCE AS A THREAT

10:03.403 --> 10:07.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF FORCE TO GENTLE HANDS-ON TO,

10:07.307 --> 10:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THE WAY UP TO TASERING AND

10:10.443 --> 10:11.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USE OF LETHAL FORCE LIKE

10:11.711 --> 10:12.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIREARMS.

10:12.679 --> 10:13.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Thompson: THE REPORT ALSO

10:13.713 --> 10:15.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFUTES THE NOTION THIS HAPPENS

10:15.849 --> 10:16.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE OFTEN AMONG AFRICAN-

10:16.983 --> 10:18.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICANS BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE

10:18.351 --> 10:20.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTACT WITH POLICE, RIGHT?

10:20.086 --> 10:21.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THAT?

10:21.521 --> 10:23.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, THAT IS ONE OF THE

10:23.756 --> 10:26.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERAL ARGUMENTS PUT UP TO TRY

10:26.059 --> 10:28.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE RACIAL

10:30.530 --> 10:32.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

10:37.036 --> 10:39.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CONSIDER THE RATES AT WHICH

POLICE.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO, IT IS ABOVE AND BEYOND

10:46.312 --> 10:47.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR HIGHER RATE-- AND THEY DO

10:47.881 --> 10:49.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE HIGHER RATES OF CONTACT

10:49.082 --> 10:50.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE POLICE FOR LOTS OF

10:50.183 --> 10:51.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REASONS-- BUT ABOVE AND BEYOND

TRAINING.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE ARE DEPARTMENTS AROUND

11:13.573 --> 11:15.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE INCLUDED IN THIS DATA SET,

SEEM TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING

11:23.917 --> 11:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RATES OF USE OF FORCE, ONE OF

11:25.451 --> 11:26.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THROUGH MORE REALISTIC

CONDITIONS IN WHICH THEY MIGHT

11:38.665 --> 11:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENCOUNTER AND HAVE TO USE LETHAL

11:40.366 --> 11:42.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCE, SO THAT WHEN THEY DO

11:42.368 --> 11:44.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENCOUNTER THAT, THEY'RE A LITTLE

11:44.137 --> 11:45.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE ACCUSTOMED AND MAYBE A

11:45.338 --> 11:46.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITTLE LESS TERRIFIED IN THE

11:46.573 --> 11:47.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT RESPONSE WHICH I

11:52.211 --> 11:53.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT

13:14.260 --> 13:16.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE CAN'T LET OUR SONS OUT OF OUR

13:16.162 --> 13:18.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRONT DOORS WITHOUT GIVING THEM

13:18.831 --> 13:21.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COME BACK

13:21.167 --> 13:22.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALIVE.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I AM CHRISTI GRIFFIN, I AM A

13:25.238 --> 13:27.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RETIRED ATTORNEY WHO FOUNDED THE

ETHICS PROJECT IN 2007, TO

13:31.177 --> 13:33.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADDRESS THE INJUSTICES OF OUR

13:33.112 --> 13:37.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

13:37.850 --> 13:40.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN I MOVED WITH MY SON INTO AN

13:40.787 --> 13:43.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL-WHITE COMMUNITY, I DID NOT

13:43.690 --> 13:46.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPECT HIM TO EVER BE IN

13:46.025 --> 13:47.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TROUBLE.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING,

13:50.663 --> 13:52.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS THE PROBLEM.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO, WHEN THE POLICE OFFICER

13:54.233 --> 13:55.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PULLED HIM OVER, I JUST HAPPENED

13:55.802 --> 13:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE WITH HIM.

13:57.036 --> 13:58.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I HEARD SOMETHING IN MY SON'S

13:58.971 --> 14:01.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOICE I DID NOT REALIZE EXISTED.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE KNEW HE HAD NOT DONE ANYTHING

14:03.309 --> 14:05.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WRONG.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I HEARD AN ANGER.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WASN'T DISRESPECTFUL, BUT MY

14:11.050 --> 14:12.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SON KEPT ASKING HIM "WHAT DID

14:12.985 --> 14:13.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DO?"

14:13.920 --> 14:16.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT

14:16.322 --> 14:18.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN MY MIND THAT HAD I NOT BEEN

14:18.157 --> 14:20.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE, THAT SITUATION WOULD HAVE

14:20.526 --> 14:23.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESCALATED TO WHERE MY SON WAS

14:23.863 --> 14:25.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTANTLY HARASSED TO THE POINT

14:25.865 --> 14:26.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAVE

14:26.899 --> 14:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENED.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE POLICEMAN NEVER EVEN

14:32.171 --> 14:34.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTEMPTED TO GIVE HIM AN EXCUSE

14:34.173 --> 14:35.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR PULLING HIM OVER.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO TAKE YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE

14:37.210 --> 14:38.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

14:38.644 --> 14:40.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

14:47.186 --> 14:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A POLICE OFFICER BECAUSE HE

14:50.423 --> 14:53.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEARED FOR HIS LIFE, BECAUSE MY

14:53.059 --> 14:56.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

15:10.343 --> 15:11.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> HE HAD ALREADY STARTED

15:11.677 --> 15:13.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DRINKING ALCOHOL.

15:13.179 --> 15:16.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE GETS TO HIS WIFE'S HOUSE.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE WOULDN'T OPEN THE DOOR.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, SHE COULD

SEE HIM.

15:20.486 --> 15:22.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE CALLS THE POLICE.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COPS SHOW UP WITH THEIR GUNS

15:24.457 --> 15:25.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DRAWN.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DIDN'T EVEN INVESTIGATE

15:27.126 --> 15:28.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I'M TALKING LESS THAN FIVE

15:30.163 --> 15:32.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINUTES, ABDUL WAS DEAD.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE HAD THE WRONG TALK.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THEM.

15:37.036 --> 15:38.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S WHAT OUR TALK WAS.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AS A PARENT, I THOUGHT I WAS

15:39.605 --> 15:41.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, I GAVE HIM A FALSE

15:43.476 --> 15:45.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCEPT, ACTUALLY.

15:45.711 --> 15:47.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU ARE JUST AS GOOD AS ANY

15:47.747 --> 15:49.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER-- NO, YOU'RE NOT!

15:49.615 --> 15:50.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO, YOU'RE NOT, SON!

15:50.783 --> 15:52.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

15:52.151 --> 15:53.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I CAME FROM THE GHETTO, THE

15:53.553 --> 15:55.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROJECTS.

15:55.321 --> 15:57.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MY SON NEVER LIVED IN THE

15:57.123 --> 15:58.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROJECTS.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE THOUGHT, BECAUSE WE MADE A

16:00.326 --> 16:03.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY, THAT WE

16:03.596 --> 16:05.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.

16:05.598 --> 16:11.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AND YET, AND STILL, SOCIETY

16:11.204 --> 16:13.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT'S UGLINESS STILL TAPPED

16:13.506 --> 16:15.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON OUR DOOR.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHAT I'M TELLING YOU, WAKE

16:18.411 --> 16:19.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS AFFECTS US ALL.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE ALL LOSE.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHILDREN, THEY ARE MURDERED FOR

16:26.919 --> 16:29.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO OTHER REASON THAN, HE WAS TOO

16:29.655 --> 16:32.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALL, HE WAS TOO BIG.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A WHITE BOY COULD RUN IN A MOVIE

THEATER, OPEN FIRE AND KILL 14

16:38.497 --> 16:41.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE AND STAND TRIAL.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR KIDS CAN WALK DOWN THE

16:43.069 --> 16:44.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STREET AND GET GUNNED DOWN AND

16:44.871 --> 16:46.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PEOPLE WHO KILL THEM,

16:46.138 --> 16:48.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOTHING HAPPENS.

16:48.307 --> 16:50.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE JUST FOUND OUT THAT ONE OF

16:52.345 --> 16:54.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OFFICERS THAT KILLED ABDUL

16:54.647 --> 16:57.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOT PROMOTED.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?

16:59.685 --> 17:01.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS NOT A DAY THAT GOES BY

17:01.487 --> 17:04.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE DON'T THINK ABOUT ABDUL.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN, WHAT CAN WE DO TO SAVE

17:07.426 --> 17:14.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANOTHER PARENT, ANOTHER FAMILY

17:10.329 --> 17:22.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CONSIDERED A BIT OF A SECURITY

20:50.749 --> 20:52.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREAT FOR EUROPE, BECAUSE THEY
