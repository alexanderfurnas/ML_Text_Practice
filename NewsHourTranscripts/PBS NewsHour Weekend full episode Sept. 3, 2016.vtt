08:34.948 --> 08:37.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT YOU HAD TO MAKE ROOM FOR

08:37.317 --> 08:38.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM RELEASING SOME OF THE

08:38.151 --> 08:38.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRIMINALS.

08:38.551 --> 08:39.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND YOU HAD A CRACKDOWN ON THE

08:39.786 --> 08:40.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDIA.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT ALL OF

08:41.354 --> 08:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE PEOPLE ARE GUILTY IF THEY

08:42.989 --> 08:43.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVEN'T HAD TRIALS?

08:43.656 --> 08:46.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO, NOT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE

08:46.326 --> 08:47.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE GUILTY.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION.

08:48.628 --> 08:50.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE STILL

08:50.497 --> 08:51.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING ON.

08:51.331 --> 08:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO ACTUALLY, IT IS A VERY HUGE

08:54.000 --> 08:56.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TURKISH

08:56.469 --> 09:00.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE AND THE GROUP OF GULENIST

09:00.673 --> 09:01.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVEMENT.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY HIDE THEMSELVES DURING

09:02.709 --> 09:05.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LAST 40 YEARS INSIDE THE

09:05.412 --> 09:07.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE HIERARCHY.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT

09:10.784 --> 09:12.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSITION, AND THE CIVIL

09:12.218 --> 09:12.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SERVICES.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE HAVE TO CLEAN UP OUR STATE

09:15.255 --> 09:18.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SERVICES FROM THOSE PEOPLE WHO

09:18.091 --> 09:22.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE CRIMINALS OR THEY HELP THE

09:22.328 --> 09:25.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRIMINAL PEOPLE IN CREATING A

09:25.231 --> 09:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUP D'ETAT ATTEMPT IN 15th

09:26.933 --> 09:29.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF JULY.

09:29.602 --> 09:31.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THOSE FILES ARE UNDER

09:31.004 --> 09:31.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVESTIGATIONS.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE FOUND NONE OF THE PEOPLE

09:33.706 --> 09:34.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUILTY YET.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE COURT CASES ARE STILL

09:35.642 --> 09:37.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING ON, AND, ALSO,

09:37.877 --> 09:39.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC

09:39.813 --> 09:41.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SERVANTS ARE STILL CONTINUING.

09:41.581 --> 09:45.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE WILL WAIT AND SEE THE END

09:45.084 --> 09:48.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE-- THE RESULT OF THE

09:48.154 --> 09:50.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASES, EVERY INDIVIDUAL CASES,

09:50.156 --> 09:54.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER THE EVALUATION BY LEGAL

09:54.594 --> 09:55.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AUTHORITIES.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ONE OF THE

09:56.296 --> 09:57.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT

09:57.230 --> 09:57.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS BEEN INTERESTED IN JUST IN

09:57.997 --> 09:59.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PAST MONTH HAS BEEN TRYING

09:59.098 --> 10:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO REINSTATE THE DEATH PENALTY,

10:00.433 --> 10:01.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THE

10:01.201 --> 10:02.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EUROPEAN UNION SAYS IS A RED

10:02.135 --> 10:03.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LINE.

10:03.670 --> 10:04.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHICH WOULD TURKEY PREFER,

10:04.737 --> 10:05.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEATH PENALTY OR MEMBERSHIP

10:05.472 --> 10:11.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO THE E.U.?

10:11.478 --> 10:12.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, IT IS NOT

10:12.579 --> 10:15.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICIAL CASE.

10:15.815 --> 10:16.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, PEOPLE DEMAND-- IN THE

10:16.549 --> 10:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCH AGAINST THE COUP D'ETAT

10:17.484 --> 10:19.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTEMPT.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE DEMANDING THAT PENALTY,

10:20.987 --> 10:22.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT IS NOT ON THE AGENDA OF

10:22.689 --> 10:24.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EXISTENT DEMOCRATICALLY

10:24.157 --> 10:26.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTED GOVERNMENT.

10:26.826 --> 10:27.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: FINALLY, LET

10:27.494 --> 10:28.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ME ASK YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

10:28.228 --> 10:29.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE KURDS.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T CLAIM TO KNOW ALL ABOUT

10:30.864 --> 10:32.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KURDISH POLITICS, BUT THE TOP

10:32.999 --> 10:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRIORITY FOR THE UNITED STATES

10:33.700 --> 10:34.434 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN SYRIA IS TO FIGHT THE ISLAMIC

10:34.434 --> 10:38.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE.

10:38.471 --> 10:44.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THAT FIGHT, THE U.S. HAS

10:44.577 --> 10:45.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KURDISH FORCES AS ALLIES THAT WE

10:45.812 --> 10:46.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE ARMING IN THAT FIGHT.

10:46.546 --> 10:47.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DAY THAT VICE PRESIDENT

10:47.847 --> 10:49.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIDEN CAME TO TURKEY TO MEET

10:49.015 --> 10:51.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH YOUR PRESIDENT, TURKISH

10:51.818 --> 10:52.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TANKS WENT INTO SYRIA, AND THEY

10:52.986 --> 10:53.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACKED KURDISH TROOPS THAT THE

10:53.753 --> 10:56.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. SUPPORTS.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IF YOU'RE AN ENEMY OF OUR

10:57.257 --> 11:03.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLY, ARE YOU OUR ALLY?

11:03.663 --> 11:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, THIS IS NOT A

11:07.100 --> 11:09.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KURDISH GROUP, WE HAVE TO MAKE

11:09.035 --> 11:11.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CORRECT.

11:11.204 --> 11:11.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS A GROUP OF TERRORIST

11:11.905 --> 11:12.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORGANIZATIONS NAMED P.Y.D., OR

11:12.672 --> 11:14.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Y.P.G.

11:14.474 --> 11:15.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE ARE NOT AGAINST THE KURDS

11:15.241 --> 11:16.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE

11:16.843 --> 11:20.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYRIAN TERRITORY.

11:20.146 --> 11:22.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE KURDS ARE THE NATIVE

11:22.248 --> 11:25.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE OF THOSE-- THIS REGION,

11:25.318 --> 11:26.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ALSO IN THE MEANTIME, THE

11:26.553 --> 11:31.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TURKSMEN ARE THE ORIGINAL PEOPLE

11:31.190 --> 11:32.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE REGION.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR OPPOSITION IS THAT WE ARE

11:34.694 --> 11:38.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST HAVING A ONE-PARTY

11:38.464 --> 11:41.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGION IN THE NORTH INSIDE-- THE

11:41.134 --> 11:42.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORTHERN TERRITORIES OF SYRIA.

11:42.969 --> 11:51.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT'S WHY IF Y.P.G., OR

11:51.678 --> 11:59.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
P.Y.D., MAKES IT MORE THAN 911

11:59.953 --> 12:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KILOMETERS TERRITORY, AS P.Y.D.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRITORY, IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE

12:04.090 --> 12:06.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM TURKEY.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE ARE OKAY FOR THE EXISTENCE

12:07.427 --> 12:10.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE KURDS IN THE REGION.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ALL OTHER PEOPLE, KURDS AND

12:12.532 --> 12:15.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHERS, MUST LEAVE THERE FOR

12:15.535 --> 12:16.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG.

12:16.202 --> 12:16.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE ARE AGAINST THE TERRORIST

12:16.936 --> 12:18.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTIVITIES OF P.Y.D.

12:18.104 --> 12:19.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS YOU KNOW, P.Y.D. ALSO HAS

12:19.038 --> 12:20.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY STRONG CONNECTIONS WITH

12:20.974 --> 12:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
P.K.K., WHICH IS A CLEAR

12:23.910 --> 12:27.714 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, AND ALSO

12:27.714 --> 12:30.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
P.K.K. IS ACCEPTED BY THE

12:30.183 --> 12:31.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WESTERN COUNTRIES AS ONE OF THE

12:31.384 --> 12:32.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAJOR TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS IN

12:32.385 --> 12:34.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REGION.

12:34.487 --> 12:38.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO TURKEY IS FIGHTING WITH

12:38.157 --> 12:39.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
P.K.K..

12:39.859 --> 12:40.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
P.Y.D., AND Y.P.G., ARE

12:40.493 --> 12:41.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVIDING LOGISTICS FOR P.K.K.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSIDE TURKEY.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS WHY IT IS ALSO, AGAIN,

12:45.798 --> 12:50.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNACCEPTABLE FOR TURKEY, THE

12:50.069 --> 12:51.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTIVITIES OF P.Y.D. AND Y.P.G.

12:51.037 --> 12:55.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE REGION.

12:55.041 --> 12:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO AS A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE, AND

12:58.111 --> 13:00.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS PARTNER OF THE UNITED STATES

13:00.046 --> 13:02.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF NATO, WE

13:02.148 --> 13:03.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE FIGHTING AGAINST

13:03.249 --> 13:04.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERNATIONALLY ORGANIZED

13:04.717 --> 13:07.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS,

13:07.186 --> 13:09.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCLUDING DAESH, OR I.S.--

13:09.822 --> 13:11.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHATEVER YOU CALL IT-- AND ALSO

13:11.824 --> 13:14.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
P.Y.D. IS A BRANCH OF P.K.K.,

13:14.594 --> 13:16.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS ONE OF THE MAJOR

13:16.095 --> 13:16.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREATS TO TURKEY AS A TERRORIST

13:16.863 --> 13:19.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORGANIZATION.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
