HARI SREENIVASAN: But first:
The South Side of Chicago has
long been plagued with some

00:04.100 --> 00:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the highest crime rates
in the nation, but one man is
trying to transform this area

00:08.233 --> 00:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by focusing on the everyday
needs and the health of
those who live there.

00:13.066 --> 00:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our story.

00:15.066 --> 00:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Along this
stretch on Chicago's South Side,
Rami Nashashibi is a familiar

00:20.033 --> 00:21.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
face.

00:21.933 --> 00:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the founder of the
nonprofit IMAN, the Inner-City
Muslim Action Network.

00:28.100 --> 00:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for more than 20 years, he's
focused on the root problems
these neighborhoods face.

00:31.266 --> 00:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMI NASHASHIBI, Founder,
Inner-City Muslim
Action Network: So,
violence, poverty, lack

00:34.666 --> 00:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of real meaningful job
opportunities, lots of
young people with very few
meaningful trajectories.

00:42.866 --> 00:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This set of blocks was ravaged
by the foreclosure crisis.

00:46.433 --> 00:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Nashashibi
grew up the son of a
Jordanian diplomat.

00:50.533 --> 00:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He first came to the U.S. for
college, and later got a Ph.D.
in sociology from the University

00:56.166 --> 00:58.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Chicago.

00:58.200 --> 01:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He started IMAN in 1997 to
help bridge divides he saw here
between Muslim immigrants and

01:05.366 --> 01:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
African-Americans.

01:07.366 --> 01:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The organization has grown ever
since, and now has an annual
budget of nearly $4 million,

01:13.000 --> 01:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with funding from a mix of
grants and private donations.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is social activism,
he says, grounded in faith.

01:18.800 --> 01:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMI NASHASHIBI: We have been
unapologetically rooted in the
values and spiritual tradition

01:25.733 --> 01:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that comes from the Muslim
community, while, at the same
time, acknowledging that so much

01:29.166 --> 01:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of that is also very universal.

01:31.700 --> 01:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One major
focus of the organization
now, neighborhood
corner stores, the small

01:37.700 --> 01:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shops that many here rely on,
in the absence of supermarkets
in these neighborhoods, but

01:43.633 --> 01:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
also places that have
historically generated
tensions between the
Arab immigrants who own

01:48.766 --> 01:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them, and their
African-Americans customers.

01:52.133 --> 01:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMAN is trying to change that.

01:54.266 --> 01:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMI NASHASHIBI: That corner
store doesn't have to be what
many corner stores in Chicago

02:00.933 --> 02:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are, often a place of death,
not a spot that you really
want to go into, that we could

02:03.633 --> 02:06.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
radically re-imagine it.

02:06.066 --> 02:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At the
Morgan Mini Mart in
Englewood, store owner Sami
Deffala, who immigrated

02:11.666 --> 02:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Palestine, is one of 60
store owners in the area who
have signed onto IMAN's corner

02:16.066 --> 02:18.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
store campaign.

02:18.133 --> 02:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMI DEFFALA, Business
Owner: We have been in the
neighborhood for 27 years.

02:20.566 --> 02:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The idea is to
bring everyone together around
a common need: fresh and more

02:26.166 --> 02:27.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
healthy food.

02:27.366 --> 02:29.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SAMI DEFFALA: We
have stepped it up.

02:29.366 --> 02:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With their help, we have been
able to acquire fruits and
vegetables that are subsidized,

02:34.933 --> 02:38.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a lot lower price, and,
in turn, we sell them
at a lot lower price.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, that way, it's
a win-win, right?

02:40.366 --> 02:43.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And
it's much needed, says
IMAN's Shamar Hemphill.

02:43.833 --> 02:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHAMAR HEMPHILL, Inner-City
Muslim Action Network: You
know, it's a war on nutrition

02:45.566 --> 02:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's constantly killing
a lot of communities.

02:47.466 --> 02:52.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Black men die at higher
rates, contributed
to their diet, right?

02:52.366 --> 02:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How you going to change
anything in your neighborhood
if you really can't
start with the place that

02:58.566 --> 02:59.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really sustains
the neighborhood?

02:59.400 --> 03:01.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's the food.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sami Deffala
says, in the process,
a new trust has emerged
between him and his

03:04.800 --> 03:05.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
customers.

03:05.800 --> 03:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAMI DEFFALA: People talk.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People in the community talk.

03:08.333 --> 03:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hey, listen, that guy is a
good guy there, you know?

03:11.100 --> 03:15.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You don't want to go
in there and do him
any harm or any wrong.

03:15.233 --> 03:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just a few
blocks away, IMAN also
operates a free health clinic.

03:22.200 --> 03:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here, physician's assistant Muna
Odeh, whose family immigrated
from Palestine, treats many

03:27.633 --> 03:31.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
like 58-year-old Jerome
Reynolds, a diabetic
without insurance.

03:31.300 --> 03:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MUNA ODEH, Physician's
Assistant: People who are
underserved and often forgotten.

03:35.700 --> 03:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of times, they feel
that they are not in control
of their situation, and not

03:42.600 --> 03:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in control of their health,
because of their limited access
to funds and insurance and

03:45.400 --> 03:47.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
things like that.

03:47.400 --> 03:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Here, too,
there's an emphasis on
making better food choices.

03:55.900 --> 04:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's another benefit
to this interaction, Muna Odeh
says, a better understanding of

04:01.633 --> 04:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Muslim Americans.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MUNA ODEH: All they know
is what they see on TV.

04:04.333 --> 04:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, obviously, that's not
ever painted in the best light.

04:07.133 --> 04:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's especially important
for me, being a Muslim female
who's covered, who wears a

04:13.400 --> 04:15.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hijab.

04:15.333 --> 04:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It shows them that we
are the same, that our
struggles are all the same.

04:18.766 --> 04:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Dr. Angela
Odoms-Young, a professor of
nutrition at the University
of Illinois-Chicago,

04:23.400 --> 04:25.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is studying IMAN's work.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She sees positive results.

04:27.066 --> 04:29.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA ODOMS-YOUNG, University
of Illinois-Chicago:
Traditionally, we used
to focus on individuals.

04:30.900 --> 04:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can you make a good decision
when it comes to healthy eating?

04:34.333 --> 04:39.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We now know, from a
research perspective,
that community matters.

04:39.033 --> 04:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really important that
you have access to fruits and
vegetables, not just what you

04:43.200 --> 04:45.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can do as an individual.

04:45.300 --> 04:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Odoms-Young
says that IMAN is helping to
break a long-held myth that

04:49.166 --> 04:53.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
residents of low-income
communities simply don't
want healthier food.

04:53.166 --> 04:55.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA ODOMS-YOUNG: There's
many people in low-income
communities and communities of

04:57.766 --> 05:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
color that they are very
interested in having access
to healthy food options.

05:04.233 --> 05:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But one of the big problems
is the structural barriers.

05:06.400 --> 05:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another
structural barrier being
tackled here, finding
jobs for men like

05:12.800 --> 05:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Khalid Partee, a former
gang member and drug dealer.

05:15.766 --> 05:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KHALID PARTEE, Chicago: I did
14 years in federal prison.

05:19.366 --> 05:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: After his
release, Partee earned a
technical degree in heating
and air conditioning

05:24.066 --> 05:26.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ventilation.

05:26.066 --> 05:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KHALID PARTEE: I graduated
in a year-and-a-half
at the top of my class.

05:28.966 --> 05:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He credits
Nashashibi with helping to turn
around his life and now teaches

05:33.833 --> 05:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
construction skills to men
recently released from prison.

05:37.233 --> 05:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of IMAN's reentry
program designed that
was provide both jobs
and to fix up abandoned

05:43.933 --> 05:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
homes in the neighborhood.

05:45.966 --> 05:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KHALID PARTEE: When these
guys come out of prison, if
we can try to get them a trade

05:49.233 --> 05:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
quickly or get them accustomed
to being in a working condition,
getting up in the morning

05:56.100 --> 05:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and coming to class and getting
up, going to work, you start
making better decisions.

05:59.866 --> 06:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You top taking less chances,
because you have responsibility.

06:03.366 --> 06:06.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have got more people
that rely on you now.

06:06.500 --> 06:10.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: For Rami
Nashashibi, it's all
part of meeting the
needs of residents in

06:10.900 --> 06:13.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these often-neglected
neighborhoods.

06:13.300 --> 06:17.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But even after 20 years,
he admits that far
more work is needed.

06:17.400 --> 06:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMI NASHASHIBI: You know, for
every one person you're able
to employ, there's 50 that are

06:23.133 --> 06:25.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
looking for jobs.

06:25.366 --> 06:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For every block that you
stabilize, there's the sense
that there's 25, 35 blocks that

06:32.200 --> 06:34.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
need that exact
same intervention.

06:34.300 --> 06:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Undaunted,
IMAN is actually expanding.

06:37.800 --> 06:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's opened a new center in
Atlanta, and hopes to work to
other cities around the nation.

06:44.233 --> 06:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown in Chicago.
