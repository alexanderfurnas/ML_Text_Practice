WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:07.040
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good
evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.042
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:09.042 --> 00:14.281
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: tremendous loss of life
on one of the holiest

00:14.281 --> 00:18.819
days of the Muslim calendar, the
latest on the stampede that has
killed hundreds during

00:18.819 --> 00:19.887
an annual pilgrimage.

00:19.887 --> 00:21.788
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead:

00:21.788 --> 00:27.427
MAN: Mr. Speaker. the
pope of the Holy See!

00:27.427 --> 00:33.934
GWEN IFILL: A papal call to
action on immigration and
climate before a joint meeting
of Congress,

00:33.934 --> 00:38.972
as Francis wraps up his trip to
the capital by visiting the
city's poor.

00:38.972 --> 00:44.144
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, Making
Sense of America's uneven
housing recovery. How many are
still

00:44.144 --> 00:47.381
struggling, as
foreclosures continue?

00:47.381 --> 00:52.219
ELYSE CHERRY, Boston Community
Capital: This is the story of a
crisis that won't quit,

00:52.219 --> 00:57.758
and it won't quit because we're
not focused on the difference in
how it impacts our lower-income

00:57.758 --> 01:00.594
neighbors, as opposed to our
middle- and upper-middle-income
neighbors.

01:00.594 --> 01:07.734
GWEN IFILL: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:07.734 --> 01:12.306
(BREAK)

01:12.306 --> 01:22.950
GWEN IFILL: Tragedy struck the
Muslim world today, marring the
end of the annual pilgrimage

01:22.950 --> 01:28.488
to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. At
least 719 people were killed
when worshipers panicked and
stampeded.

01:28.488 --> 01:35.062
More than 860 others were hurt.

01:35.062 --> 01:41.568
It was a scene of horror in a
place of holiness. Cell phone
video captured the gruesome
aftermath,

01:41.568 --> 01:46.807
with bodies littering the
streets. Saudi officials said
the stampede started when two
waves of

01:46.807 --> 01:49.543
pilgrims collided.

01:49.543 --> 01:54.281
KHALID AL-FALIH, Saudi Arabian
Health Minister (through
translator): The accident was
caused

01:54.281 --> 01:58.685
by overcrowding and also by some
of the pilgrims not following
the movement instructions of

01:58.685 --> 02:02.589
the security and the hajj
ministry. However, this is God's
will.

02:02.589 --> 02:09.396
GWEN IFILL: The disaster
unfolded in Mina, a valley about
three miles outside Mecca.

02:09.396 --> 02:15.535
Separate surges of people met at
an intersection with Street 204,
a main road that leads through

02:15.535 --> 02:21.408
thousands of tents to Al
Jamarat. There, the faithful
perform the symbolic stoning of
the

02:21.408 --> 02:25.779
devil, a ritual of throwing
pebbles at columns.

02:25.779 --> 02:32.352
But, on this day, many never got
there. Instead, ambulances and
rescue crews struggled
desperately

02:32.352 --> 02:37.057
to get the injured through
packed streets to nearby
hospitals. Others were taken by

02:37.057 --> 02:39.659
helicopter.

02:39.659 --> 02:43.497
Survivors recall the sheer
terror of being engulfed.

02:43.497 --> 02:49.136
WOMAN (through translator): We
were coming back from the
Jamarat, and on the way back,

02:49.136 --> 02:52.839
I met my husband and he was
going to the Jamarat. The
pilgrims began pushing each
other and

02:52.839 --> 02:56.176
they pushed people to the
ground. I was about to die.

02:56.176 --> 03:01.648
GWEN IFILL: It was the second
major disaster of this year's
hajj season. Less than two

03:01.648 --> 03:07.721
weeks ago, high winds sent a
giant construction crane
crashing into Mecca's Grand
Mosque.

03:07.721 --> 03:13.427
It killed more than 100 people
and injured nearly 400.

03:13.427 --> 03:19.299
The twin tragedies raised new
questions about safety measures
the Saudis have implemented

03:19.299 --> 03:26.506
to prevent a repeat of past
disasters. The deadliest came in
1990, when at least 1,400

03:26.506 --> 03:31.378
pilgrims died during a stampede
in a pedestrian tunnel.

03:31.378 --> 03:38.485
Now Saudi King Salman has
ordered an investigation into
what caused today's stampede.

03:38.485 --> 03:41.555
Aya Batrawy is covering the
story for the Associated Press.
I spoke to her from Saudi

03:41.555 --> 03:45.358
Arabia a few minutes ago.

03:45.358 --> 03:49.629
Aya Batrawy, thank you for
joining us. We know you're there
in Mina, Saudi Arabia, the

03:49.629 --> 03:54.868
site of that horrific tragedy
today. One of the things we
watched, seeing this from a

03:54.868 --> 03:57.971
distance, we wonder is, how
did it get so out of control?

03:57.971 --> 04:02.275
AYA BATRAWY, Associated Press:
And that's what the survivors I
spoke to also are questioning,

04:02.275 --> 04:05.745
how this could happen in 2015,
at a time when the Saudi
government has been hosting the

04:05.745 --> 04:09.683
annual hajj pilgrimage
for decades now?

04:09.683 --> 04:13.553
What the survivors told me was
there was a large crowd heading
toward the facility behind

04:13.553 --> 04:18.258
me to perform one of the final
rites of hajj when another crowd
coming back from the facility

04:18.258 --> 04:20.193
intersected with them. And at
that point, people started
shoving and trying to get past

04:20.193 --> 04:22.329
one another.

04:22.329 --> 04:26.266
And that's when people started
tripping, falling over each
other, falling over wheelchairs.

04:26.266 --> 04:30.904
People were suffocating, bodies
were piling up. And the streets
just turned into complete

04:30.904 --> 04:34.708
chaos and mayhem and, as we see
today, over 700 people dead, and
the death toll is expected

04:34.708 --> 04:37.043
to rise.

04:37.043 --> 04:41.014
I was there at the scene 10
hours after this happened, and
there were still bodies lying

04:41.014 --> 04:45.519
on the ground. There were still
helicopters trying over trying
to ferry the wounded. There

04:45.519 --> 04:50.090
were still bodies being picked
up. I saw emergency lights being
brought in, which means clearly

04:50.090 --> 04:52.425
they're going to be working
through the night to try and
figure out what happened, as
well

04:52.425 --> 04:54.861
as trying to get to people.

04:54.861 --> 04:59.399
GWEN IFILL: As we have reported
before, this is not the first
time there's been this kind

04:59.399 --> 05:05.505
of stampede at the hajj, and is
this -- are there safety
concerns that have been worked

05:05.505 --> 05:09.943
out in advance by authorities
designed to avoid just this
outcome?

05:09.943 --> 05:14.414
AYA BATRAWY: I mean, definitely,
authorities here spend billions
of dollars every year

05:14.414 --> 05:18.218
to prepare for the hajj and to
make the hajj as comfortable and
safe as possible for the

05:18.218 --> 05:23.957
pilgrims. They're spending $60
billion to expand the Grand
Mosque that houses the
cube-shaped

05:23.957 --> 05:28.395
Kaaba, which is a central part
of the hajj, a location where
people go for the hajj
pilgrimage.

05:28.395 --> 05:34.334
They have spent -- there's
100,000 security forces deployed
this year for safety, for

05:34.334 --> 05:39.839
crowd management. There's 5,000
CCTV cameras set up everywhere
to monitor people for the

05:39.839 --> 05:45.912
flow of the crowds. It's a
logistical challenge. And so
that's kind of the question now,
is,

05:45.912 --> 05:51.484
how did this happen? Who allowed
these two -- what agencies --
what happened that these

05:51.484 --> 05:54.588
two crowds were
able to intersect?

05:54.588 --> 05:59.759
Because, normally, what happens
are that there are roads that
are just one-way, so that crowds

05:59.759 --> 06:03.029
don't end up clashing into one
another, so there will be roads
that are one-way going

06:03.029 --> 06:06.967
one way and roads going another
way, and that way pilgrims can
avoid this kind of thing.

06:06.967 --> 06:12.472
GWEN IFILL: You mentioned all of
the renovations and the money
being spent at the Grand Mosque.

06:12.472 --> 06:17.110
And yet there was an accident
there also earlier this week,
where 100 people were killed in

06:17.110 --> 06:20.914
a crane collapse. Do they
know what happened there yet?

06:20.914 --> 06:25.385
AYA BATRAWY: There's still an
investigation into that crane
collapse, but I also spoke

06:25.385 --> 06:31.591
with survivors there. It was a
horrific, horrific scene. It was
very unexpected.

06:31.591 --> 06:37.097
People were praying, looking
toward the Kaaba. It was exactly
almost two weeks ago today

06:37.097 --> 06:44.938
that it happened, when stormy --
a storm happened, a
thunderstorm, and wind came out
unexpectedly.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.073
And one of the largest cranes
around the mosque that's
currently working on the
expansion

06:47.073 --> 06:49.276
collapsed.

06:49.276 --> 06:54.514
So, what authorities are saying
is that wind was the cause, but
they're also saying that

06:54.514 --> 06:59.452
the giant construction company
the Saudi Binladin Group, which
was the operator of the crane,

06:59.452 --> 07:03.623
was also partly faulted for not
following operating procedures
there.

07:03.623 --> 07:07.727
So, obviously, this is something
-- there are two accidents that
have happened in the

07:07.727 --> 07:12.932
last two weeks, extremely
devastating for the pilgrims
here. But also I think for the

07:12.932 --> 07:17.237
king, whose legacy is tied to
the pilgrimage, his title is
custodian of the two holy
mosques,

07:17.237 --> 07:21.541
in reference to two holy sites,
one of them being Mecca.

07:21.541 --> 07:25.812
It's something that everyone is
taking very seriously and
everyone is planning to see

07:25.812 --> 07:28.782
how, you know, this
can be avoided again.

07:28.782 --> 07:32.052
GWEN IFILL: Aya Batrawy of the
Associated Press, thank you for
talking us on the scene

07:32.052 --> 07:32.652
tonight.

07:32.652 --> 07:35.755
AYA BATRAWY: Thank you.

07:35.755 --> 07:40.060
JUDY WOODRUFF: In other news,
European leaders are promising
new efforts to process thousands

07:40.060 --> 07:43.897
of refugees and migrants
reaching Greece and Italy.

07:43.897 --> 07:48.935
The agreement early today also
includes more than a billion
dollars in aid for those still

07:48.935 --> 07:52.472
in refugee camps in
the Middle East.

07:52.472 --> 07:58.645
Meanwhile, the crisis stoked new
tensions along Serbia's border
with Croatia. Long lines

07:58.645 --> 08:04.517
of cargo trucks backed up as the
rival nations cut off imports
and blocked traffic in a war

08:04.517 --> 08:07.854
of words over the
flow of refugees.

08:07.854 --> 08:12.625
ZORAN MILANOVIC, Croatian Prime
Minister (through translator):
All that the Serbian prime
minister

08:12.625 --> 08:18.765
has to do is to stop this flow
of migrants, 9,000 in one day.
We cannot make 50 refugee

08:18.765 --> 08:23.002
camps at the border. What we
have done so far is good, and we
can cope with 4,000, 5,000

08:23.002 --> 08:26.406
a day, but above that, no.

08:26.406 --> 08:30.276
NEBOJSA STEFANOVIC,
MD-BO Serbian Interior Minister
(through translator): Croatia is

08:30.276 --> 08:34.647
behaving irresponsibly. By
imposing this economic
aggression, they are hurting the
economy of

08:34.647 --> 08:39.018
both countries. Serbia is forced
to introduce countermeasures. We
are not happy about it,

08:39.018 --> 08:41.788
but we have to protect our
state and our sovereignty.

08:41.788 --> 08:45.992
JUDY WOODRUFF: More than 40,000
migrants have entered Croatia
from Serbia over the last

08:45.992 --> 08:48.094
nine days.

08:48.094 --> 08:53.400
GWEN IFILL: The president of
China arrived in Washington this
evening for a highly anticipated

08:53.400 --> 08:59.806
state visit. Xi Jinping's plane
touched down at Joint Base
Andrews, after flying
cross-country

08:59.806 --> 09:05.578
from Seattle. He was greeted by
Vice President and Mrs. Biden.
Xi has a private dinner with

09:05.578 --> 09:09.883
President Obama tonight. He will
be formally welcomed tomorrow.

09:09.883 --> 09:15.088
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Obama will
meet with Russian President
Vladimir Putin on Monday in New

09:15.088 --> 09:20.126
York for the first time in
nearly a year. The Kremlin said
today the focus will be Syria

09:20.126 --> 09:25.098
and coordinating the fight there
against Islamic State forces.

09:25.098 --> 09:29.369
But White House spokesman Josh
Earnest charged again that
Russia's military buildup will

09:29.369 --> 09:32.472
do far more harm than good.

09:32.472 --> 09:35.608
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: President Obama will
make it clear once again

09:35.608 --> 09:42.782
that Russia doubling down on
their support for the Assad
regime is a losing bet. The

09:42.782 --> 09:48.021
likely consequence of them doing
so is only to deepen and expand
the ongoing crisis in

09:48.021 --> 09:51.157
that country. That doesn't serve
the interests of either the
Russian people or the American

09:51.157 --> 09:53.293
people.

09:53.293 --> 09:58.598
JUDY WOODRUFF: Earnest said
Russia's involvement in Ukraine
will be President Obama's top
item.

09:58.598 --> 10:02.268
The talks will follow Putin's
address to the U.N. General
Assembly.

10:02.268 --> 10:08.842
GWEN IFILL: In Yemen, an Islamic
State affiliate claimed an
attack that killed 25 Muslims at

10:08.842 --> 10:14.514
prayer today. The suicide
bombing wrecked a mosque in
Sanaa, as worshipers observed

10:14.514 --> 10:18.518
the holiday of Eid al Adha. The
bomber set off a smaller
explosion, then blew himself

10:18.518 --> 10:21.688
up as people ran for the exits.

10:21.688 --> 10:25.992
JUDY WOODRUFF: The government of
Colombia and that country's
largest rebel group now

10:25.992 --> 10:31.798
say their long-running conflict
will end in the next six months.
The two sides announced

10:31.798 --> 10:37.303
the deal last night in Havana,
Cuba, where peace talks took
place. A final agreement

10:37.303 --> 10:42.275
would end more than 50 years of
fighting. The United States
welcomed the deal, but
Colombia's

10:42.275 --> 10:46.045
conservative political
opposition condemned it.

10:46.045 --> 10:51.951
GWEN IFILL: The scandal over
Volkswagen cheating on emissions
tests is expanding again. In

10:51.951 --> 10:56.322
Berlin today, Germany's
transport minister confirmed
that rigged V.W.s expanded
beyond

10:56.322 --> 10:58.758
the U.S.

10:58.758 --> 11:02.929
ALEXANDER DOBRINDT, German
Transport Minister (through
translator): We were informed by

11:02.929 --> 11:08.368
Volkswagen that there are
vehicles with 1.6-liter and
2-liter diesel engines in Europe
affected

11:08.368 --> 11:12.438
by the manipulations. That is
why we will continue to work
intensely together with
Volkswagen

11:12.438 --> 11:16.042
in order to determine what
cars exactly are involved.

11:16.042 --> 11:20.179
GWEN IFILL: Eleven million
Volkswagen cars worldwide were
fitted with the software
responsible

11:20.179 --> 11:23.116
for the emissions cheating.

11:23.116 --> 11:28.922
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, the Senate balked again
at defunding Planned Parenthood

11:28.922 --> 11:34.127
as the price of preventing a
government shutdown. Republican
conservatives have pushed that

11:34.127 --> 11:38.865
plan. But they once again came
up short of the 60 votes needed
to advance a bill, but

11:38.865 --> 11:41.935
only after the two parties
traded broadsides.

11:41.935 --> 11:46.639
SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), Minority
Leader: By inserting into this
debate a meaningless,

11:46.639 --> 11:54.280
losing attack on women as just a
waste of time, but they decided,
the Republicans have

11:54.280 --> 11:59.185
decided once again to place
partisan, ideological agendas
over the well-being of the
nation.

11:59.185 --> 12:01.854
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader: There's no
reason to continue blocking
every

12:01.854 --> 12:08.394
attempt to fund the government
or to protect political allies
that are mired in scandal.

12:08.394 --> 12:14.467
So, I'm calling on colleagues
across the aisle to join us in
standing against a shutdown.

12:14.467 --> 12:18.805
I'm calling on them to join us
in standing up for women's
health instead.

12:18.805 --> 12:24.077
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican Senate
Leader Mitch McConnell, as you
heard, is saying he opposes

12:24.077 --> 12:29.182
shutting the government. He's
now expected to offer a
so-called clean bill to fund
operations

12:29.182 --> 12:34.020
through December 11. It's not
clear whether House Republicans
will go along.

12:34.020 --> 12:39.158
GWEN IFILL: The world's largest
maker of construction equipment,
Caterpillar, will cut as many as

12:39.158 --> 12:46.032
10,000 jobs through 2018. The
announcement today is the latest
sign of a worldwide slowdown

12:46.032 --> 12:51.471
in mining and energy
exploration. And that, in turn,
held Wall Street back. The Dow
Jones

12:51.471 --> 12:57.277
industrial average lost nearly
80 points to close back near
16200. The Nasdaq fell 18

12:57.277 --> 13:02.348
points. And the S&P
500 dropped six.

13:02.348 --> 13:07.220
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Pope Francis before Congress, a
look at the message he's

13:07.220 --> 13:11.691
delivered so far on his visit;
and Making Sense of the uneven
recovery in America's

13:11.691 --> 13:18.031
housing market.

13:18.031 --> 13:32.011
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pope Francis
wrapped up his historic trip to
Washington, D.C., today.

13:32.011 --> 13:35.682
And it started with an address
to Congress, one that was
notable for his call to action

13:35.682 --> 13:39.185
on economic, political
and social issues.

13:39.185 --> 13:41.387
William Brangham
begins our coverage.

13:41.387 --> 13:45.658
MAN: Mr. Speaker, the
pope of the Holy See!

13:45.658 --> 13:48.828
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

13:48.828 --> 13:51.964
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It was the
first time those words have ever
been heard in the United States

13:51.964 --> 13:55.835
Congress.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.371
Pope Francis entered to a
standing ovation from the House
and Senate, and members of

13:58.371 --> 13:58.905
the Cabinet.

13:58.905 --> 14:01.307
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

14:01.307 --> 14:08.881
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church: I am most grateful for
your invitation to address

14:08.881 --> 14:16.989
this joint session of Congress
in the land of the free and the
home of the brave.

14:16.989 --> 14:20.293
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

14:20.293 --> 14:25.331
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Speaking
slowly in English, the pontiff
used the occasion to call for

14:25.331 --> 14:30.069
action on several issues from
poverty to immigration. His
appeal encompassed the thousands
of refugees

14:30.069 --> 14:34.207
arriving in Europe, as well as
Latin Americans coming to this
country.

14:34.207 --> 14:42.482
POPE FRANCIS: We must not be
taken aback by their numbers,
but rather view them as persons,

14:42.482 --> 14:52.191
seeing their faces and listening
to their stories, trying to
respond as best we can

14:52.191 --> 14:53.092
to their situation.

14:53.092 --> 14:55.294
(APPLAUSE)

14:55.294 --> 14:58.765
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The pope also
urged lawmakers to address
climate change, and he called
for

14:58.765 --> 15:02.502
the -- quote -- "global
abolition of the death penalty."

15:02.502 --> 15:10.109
POPE FRANCIS: Every life is
sacred. Every human person is
endowed with an inalienable

15:10.109 --> 15:23.990
dignity, and society can only
benefit from the rehabilitation
of those convicted of crimes.

15:23.990 --> 15:28.060
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Democrats
applauded all of those things,
while Republicans especially

15:28.060 --> 15:32.598
cheered when Francis alluded to
the church's longtime stance
against abortion.

15:32.598 --> 15:42.375
POPE FRANCIS: The golden rule
also reminds us of our
responsibility to protect and
defend

15:42.375 --> 15:46.579
human life at every stage
of its development.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.581
(APPLAUSE)

15:48.581 --> 15:52.919
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The pope
didn't directly address
Congress' current fight over
funding

15:52.919 --> 15:57.557
for Planned Parenthood, but he
did ask Congress to put aside
its partisan divisions.

15:57.557 --> 16:09.001
POPE FRANCIS: The challenges
facing us today call for a
renewal of that spirit of
cooperation,

16:09.001 --> 16:17.910
which has accomplished so much
good throughout the history of
the United States.

16:17.910 --> 16:21.747
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Afterward, as
the pope moved outside, members
of both parties were left

16:21.747 --> 16:23.983
to contemplate his message.

16:23.983 --> 16:27.453
REP. JOYCE BEATTY (D), Ohio: He
said to us that we have to do
more than just possessing

16:27.453 --> 16:33.025
space. Translated to me, you
have to come here and stand up
for the issues. You have

16:33.025 --> 16:37.864
to take a position, and you have
to make sure that you represent
all the people and to keep

16:37.864 --> 16:39.732
that in mind.

16:39.732 --> 16:45.371
SEN. DAN COATS (R), Indiana: I
think people appreciated the
fact that he recognized the

16:45.371 --> 16:49.308
difference of opinion here about
how we should go forward, and he
was just saying we should

16:49.308 --> 16:54.013
go forward, and there are ways
to do it that won't affect
people -- put people out of
work.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.382
And I think we appreciated that.

16:56.382 --> 17:01.220
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As for
Francis, there was more cheering
in store outside the west front

17:01.220 --> 17:06.025
of the Capitol, where thousands
had gathered, hoping for a
glimpse of the pope. There, he

17:06.025 --> 17:08.594
reverted to his native Spanish,
delivering a prayer for the
children in the joyful crowd

17:08.594 --> 17:10.529
below.

17:10.529 --> 17:15.034
MARISA SWANSON, Washington,
D.C.: This person that we read
stories about and who is
inspiring

17:15.034 --> 17:20.673
so many people, Catholics and
non-Catholics, to see him in
person, incredible.

17:20.673 --> 17:21.574
MAN: He radiates happiness. He
radiates happiness. He radiates
peace, which I need -- which I

17:21.574 --> 17:25.945
think is something we
all need right now.

17:25.945 --> 17:30.349
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Later, the
pope traveled to St. Patrick's
Parish Church, where he
delivered

17:30.349 --> 17:35.588
a prayer and met with some of
Washington's homeless. That was
the last event in the nation's

17:35.588 --> 17:38.224
capital. After a short break, he
flew on to New York, the next
stop on his six-day U.S.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.959
tour.

17:39.959 --> 17:44.297
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham in Washington,
D.C.

17:44.297 --> 17:49.035
JUDY WOODRUFF: And our political
director, Lisa Desjardins, was
in the crowd on the west

17:49.035 --> 17:52.538
front of the Capitol for the
pope's speech, and she joins us
now.

17:52.538 --> 17:57.410
So, Lisa, it was a call to
action in what the pope had to
say. And we just heard both

17:57.410 --> 18:01.714
Republicans and Democrats saying
they liked different parts of
what he had to say. You

18:01.714 --> 18:04.216
have been on the Hill talking
to people. What have you heard?

18:04.216 --> 18:09.622
LISA DESJARDINS: You know, what
I expected was to hear
Republicans say, oh, this is a

18:09.622 --> 18:13.459
liberal pope, we agree with him
on some things, not on others,
but what I heard instead
surprised

18:13.459 --> 18:17.863
me today. Both parties heard
a challenge from the pope.

18:17.863 --> 18:22.368
And Republicans in particular,
for whom I think the pope
challenged perhaps on
immigration

18:22.368 --> 18:27.606
and perhaps on climate change --
Democrats think so at least --
Republicans say they

18:27.606 --> 18:32.078
heard some of their conservative
viewpoints on those issues,
Judy. They say, especially

18:32.078 --> 18:37.383
on the environment, that his
tone indicated that he sees the
United States as a leader,

18:37.383 --> 18:41.120
and especially a leader in
technology, like renewable
technology.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.790
And I think that's such a great
example of what happened today
or what might be happening

18:44.790 --> 18:49.895
from this speech. The pope's
words were so important and I
think carefully chosen. He

18:49.895 --> 18:56.202
found perhaps areas where maybe
Republicans and Democrats can
find leadership room
internationally,

18:56.202 --> 18:58.437
like on the environment.

18:58.437 --> 19:04.543
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, does that
mean, whether it's minds
changing or agreement coming --
he

19:04.543 --> 19:08.047
did talk about the polarization
in Congress and in the country.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.115
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

19:09.115 --> 19:12.351
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think that
means it may lead to something?

19:12.351 --> 19:16.055
LISA DESJARDINS: I don't think
positions will change on
immigration. I don't think
they're

19:16.055 --> 19:19.191
going to change on, say, Planned
Parenthood, abortion or the
death penalty.

19:19.191 --> 19:25.931
But I do see a little room from
the pope on the issue of climate
and environment. And

19:25.931 --> 19:30.369
talking to Republicans today,
they say perhaps, even if they
don't change, say, cap and trade

19:30.369 --> 19:33.439
-- they're not suddenly all
going to be for something like
that that they see as a problem

19:33.439 --> 19:38.377
-- but perhaps there will be a
dialogue where there's more
acknowledgment of a problem and

19:38.377 --> 19:43.749
a more careful look from those
who don't see a problem at what
is going on in the environment.

19:43.749 --> 19:48.020
Note the pope didn't use the
phrase climate change.
Republicans like that. They say
that

19:48.020 --> 19:51.524
gives them room for a dialogue
on this subject and some say
they think there could be a
change

19:51.524 --> 19:54.226
in how they approach it.

19:54.226 --> 20:01.667
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, what about
beyond politics, whether we want
to talk atmosphere or whatever

20:01.667 --> 20:07.706
word you want to use? Did you
sense, you know -- listening to
you and listening to what

20:07.706 --> 20:11.744
some of the members said, it
sounds like they felt this was
really something different
happening.

20:11.744 --> 20:15.214
It wasn't -- clearly just
another political speech.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.751
LISA DESJARDINS: This is what's
remarkable. We have been around
these members so often.

20:18.751 --> 20:22.088
They live in a strange world
where they are the powerful, and
they only are accountable

20:22.088 --> 20:24.590
every two or six years.

20:24.590 --> 20:29.628
But I think what happened today,
Judy, and even to a cynical
reporter like me sometimes,

20:29.628 --> 20:34.033
is the pope made them more
human. I heard from Dan Coats.
He said there was a sense

20:34.033 --> 20:39.972
of reverence in the chamber.
Debbie Stabenow said it was a
sense of humility. I think he

20:39.972 --> 20:46.479
made these powerful people
remember that they are human and
that they have a human
responsibility.

20:46.479 --> 20:49.415
That's what I heard again and
again from members who don't
usually talk like that. That's
what

20:49.415 --> 20:54.820
was astounding. And they also
sort of got rid of that layer of
scriptedness that we're

20:54.820 --> 20:58.524
so used to, even if for a few
hours today. We will see how
long it lasts. It was
remarkable.

20:58.524 --> 20:59.458
JUDY WOODRUFF: Maybe
it will last.

20:59.458 --> 20:59.191
LISA DESJARDINS: That's
right. I hope so.

20:59.191 --> 21:00.326
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will see.

21:00.326 --> 21:02.061
Lisa Desjardins, thank you.

21:02.061 --> 21:04.663
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.

21:04.663 --> 21:08.067
GWEN IFILL: And now we turn to
the next leg of the pope's trip,
and the anticipation and

21:08.067 --> 21:12.538
security surrounding his
time in New York City.

21:12.538 --> 21:17.076
He landed late this afternoon at
Kennedy International Airport,
where a crowd greeted him. He
took

21:17.076 --> 21:22.781
a helicopter to Wall Street, and
then headed toward St. Patrick's
Cathedral.

21:22.781 --> 21:27.987
Hari Sreenivasan was one of
those outside when I spoke to
him a short time ago.

21:27.987 --> 21:33.492
Hari, I see you're front and
center there in from the of St.
Patrick's Cathedral. Tell

21:33.492 --> 21:37.196
me, what's the security like in
the city? The city shuts down
when anybody comes to

21:37.196 --> 21:40.299
town, but, with the pope,
it must be something.

21:40.299 --> 21:44.036
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's right.
Imagine a Super Bowl, multiply
that by four, and then

21:44.036 --> 21:47.907
put it in downtown Manhattan for
a period of two-and-a-half days
or so.

21:47.907 --> 21:52.278
I mean, this area up and down
Fifth Avenue -- if anybody has
been to New York, they have

21:52.278 --> 21:54.880
probably been to Rockefeller
Center -- there is no traffic on
here. They have closed it

21:54.880 --> 21:57.983
for several blocks in either
direction from St. Patrick's.
There's a place where he's

21:57.983 --> 22:01.754
going to rest overnight.
That has security around it.

22:01.754 --> 22:04.657
There's obviously Central Park
that is preparing. And then,
tomorrow, he has got four
different

22:04.657 --> 22:09.261
places that he's going to in the
city as soon as he wakes up.
It's kind of a nonstop schedule

22:09.261 --> 22:12.264
for him. And everywhere he goes,
there has to be this level of
security that goes with

22:12.264 --> 22:14.500
him, ahead of him.

22:14.500 --> 22:18.070
GWEN IFILL: We saw a little bit
of this here in Washington, but
it's not like what you

22:18.070 --> 22:20.339
are going to see there. So, give
us a thumbnail sketch of his
schedule, where he's expected

22:20.339 --> 22:21.640
to go and be.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.910
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

22:24.910 --> 22:29.815
For a man his age, it's pretty
impressive. After he does
vespers tonight, which is not

22:29.815 --> 22:35.454
mass, but a church service
tonight with clergy inside here,
then he goes to rest tonight.

22:35.454 --> 22:40.392
Tomorrow morning, as soon as he
wakes up, he goes to -- today,
he was trying to address

22:40.392 --> 22:43.429
the nation of the United States
through its representative.
Tomorrow, he tries to address

22:43.429 --> 22:47.566
the entire world at the U.N. And
after that, he goes to the 9/11
Memorial, where he has

22:47.566 --> 22:50.769
an opportunity to pray and lead
people in a -- kind of a
multifaith service, if you

22:50.769 --> 22:52.371
will.

22:52.371 --> 22:57.876
From there, he goes to a school
in Harlem. And then he conducts
a very small mass at

22:57.876 --> 23:02.848
Madison Square Garden. So, four
areas of the city that have to
prepare for him, and, you

23:02.848 --> 23:05.084
know, they are actually
encouraging people in New York,
if you can telecommute tomorrow,

23:05.084 --> 23:07.653
do so.

23:07.653 --> 23:11.857
GWEN IFILL: They encouraged
people about that here in
Washington as well, but that
didn't

23:11.857 --> 23:15.661
dampen the enthusiasm, except
with one extra detail. I gather
there are people actually

23:15.661 --> 23:18.831
scalping free tickets
to see the pope?

23:18.831 --> 23:23.602
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes. That's
right. I don't think the pope or
the cardinals or anyone

23:23.602 --> 23:27.406
that cares about this is very
happy about this, but, yes,
there were free tickets that

23:27.406 --> 23:30.509
were handed out for the event
that he's going to have in
Central Park.

23:30.509 --> 23:37.583
And, sure enough, on eBay and on
Craigslist, you can start to see
these tickets pop up

23:37.583 --> 23:41.387
for hundreds of dollars. You
can't prevent the sale from
happening, but you can certainly

23:41.387 --> 23:43.756
strongly discourage it.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.558
GWEN IFILL: And, finally, Hari,
that crowd that we're seeing
behind you, how long would

23:46.558 --> 23:49.662
you say they have all been
there waiting for this moment?

23:49.662 --> 23:54.733
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, the press
was corralled together in these
-- sort of higher-security

23:54.733 --> 23:58.370
area for several hours. And the
people on either side of me in
front of the church have

23:58.370 --> 24:00.906
been here several hours as well.

24:00.906 --> 24:05.244
But what you can't see is the
people that are up and down
Fifth Avenue, on both sides,

24:05.244 --> 24:10.482
just waiting for a glimpse of
the Popemobile. Perhaps he's
going to wave. Perhaps he goes

24:10.482 --> 24:12.584
out and takes a selfie with
them. I don't know. But the
people here are just as excited

24:12.584 --> 24:14.887
as they were in D.C.

24:14.887 --> 24:17.623
GWEN IFILL: Well, it's amazing
to watch, from city to city to
city, this thing unfold.

24:17.623 --> 24:20.025
Hari Sreenivasan, thanks a lot.

24:20.025 --> 24:23.595
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Thank you, Gwen.

24:23.595 --> 24:27.399
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some more
reaction to the pope's speech
and some of the issues he staked
out

24:27.399 --> 24:31.904
from three important catholic
figures who attended today.

24:31.904 --> 24:37.443
Jim Nicholson sat with House
Speaker Boehner. Jim was the
U.S. ambassador to the Holy See

24:37.443 --> 24:43.682
from 2001 to 2005 and he was the
former chairman -- is the former
chairman of the Republican

24:43.682 --> 24:49.688
National Committee. Sister
Simone Campbell led four
cross-country trips of Nuns on
the

24:49.688 --> 24:54.693
Bus, which focused on economic
justice and immigration, among
other things. She's the

24:54.693 --> 25:00.366
executive director of a Catholic
lobbying group, NETWORK. And
John Carr, who's been

25:00.366 --> 25:04.837
working with the Catholic
Bishops Conference of
Washington, D.C., he's the
director of

25:04.837 --> 25:09.174
the Initiative on Catholic
Social Thought and Public Life
at Georgetown University.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.210
And we welcome all three
of you to the program.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.711
SISTER SIMONE CAMPBELL,
Executive Director, Network:
Thank you.

25:12.711 --> 25:17.182
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John Carr,
well, to all of you, I thought
it was a remarkable speech.

25:17.182 --> 25:20.486
John Carr, you pay close
attention to everything this
pope says. What stood out
particularly

25:20.486 --> 25:22.388
to you today?

25:22.388 --> 25:22.688
JOHN CARR, Director, Initiative
on Catholic Social Thought and
Public Life, Georgetown

25:22.688 --> 25:26.091
University: Well, it was such a
different day on Capitol Hill.

25:26.091 --> 25:31.930
He talked about people. He
talked about their stories. He
talked about faces. I watched

25:31.930 --> 25:38.237
Vice President Biden and Speaker
Boehner, two Catholic kids from
Ohio and Pennsylvania.

25:38.237 --> 25:43.809
They're old enough to remember
when John Kennedy was told he
shouldn't be elected president

25:43.809 --> 25:47.880
because he might take advice
from the pope. And now the lead
parties, the only thing it

25:47.880 --> 25:51.683
seems they agree on is they
need advice from the pope.

25:51.683 --> 25:59.158
So, I was struck by how hard the
Holy Father was trying to reach
them. And English is not

25:59.158 --> 26:04.029
his first language, and there
was more gestures, more energy,
and how hard they were
listening.

26:04.029 --> 26:07.132
It was an extraordinary
day on Capitol Hill.

26:07.132 --> 26:11.270
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ambassador
Nicholson, you're somebody who
has watched this city, watched

26:11.270 --> 26:16.175
the politics of the city play
out for a long time. What did
you see today that was
different?

26:16.175 --> 26:17.943
MDNM JIM NICHOLSON, Former U.S.
Ambassador to the Holy See:
Well, it was a different

26:17.943 --> 26:21.613
kind of speech from the pope.

26:21.613 --> 26:29.988
And I was very encouraged
because it was a real elevated
speech, and he started out by

26:29.988 --> 26:36.695
affirming American values, you
know, the land of the free and
the home of the brave. And

26:36.695 --> 26:43.235
he talked about the emphasis
that we have on freedom and
self-government and what that's

26:43.235 --> 26:50.142
been able to do to enable people
in our country and to give them
hope and opportunity.

26:50.142 --> 26:55.481
And he also said to us, he said,
you have a great system in
place. There are big problems.

26:55.481 --> 26:59.351
Now apply that system and
help solve those problems.

26:59.351 --> 27:05.123
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it really
was, Sister Simone, a call to
action in many ways. He was --
he

27:05.123 --> 27:10.295
referred to four -- he called
them great Americans who spoke
to the future, in Abraham
Lincoln,

27:10.295 --> 27:14.066
Dorothy Day and others.

27:14.066 --> 27:18.170
But what did that call
of action mean to you?

27:18.170 --> 27:22.841
SISTER SIMONE CAMPBELL: Well, I
think what his call is, is that
we all need to work together,

27:22.841 --> 27:28.180
instead of pull apart. He lifted
up the best of our nation with
Abraham Lincoln and the

27:28.180 --> 27:34.386
quest for unity and freedom in
the face of the Civil War, Dr.
King and his quest that

27:34.386 --> 27:38.924
all could vote and be engaged,
Dorothy Day to work with the
poor and to not make judgments

27:38.924 --> 27:41.693
that leave people out.

27:41.693 --> 27:46.565
And, finally, Thomas Merton,
which touched me the most, was
to say that all of this has

27:46.565 --> 27:52.037
to be rooted in a reflective
space and in dialogue, that we
need to talk together to

27:52.037 --> 27:55.974
make change, which is something
that has not been happening on
Capitol Hill.

27:55.974 --> 27:59.478
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Carr, do you
think the pope came thinking, I
can really make something

27:59.478 --> 28:04.082
happen in the United States,
in this political city?

28:04.082 --> 28:07.786
JOHN CARR: Lots of people
thought he didn't know much
about the United States. He's
never

28:07.786 --> 28:13.425
been here. And it was a very
respectful speech, as Jim said,
very respectful of our values,

28:13.425 --> 28:18.063
our traditions and four
great American leaders.

28:18.063 --> 28:24.436
I think he was calling us to our
best, but he is an outsider. He
looks at the world differently.

28:24.436 --> 28:29.741
He looks at the world from the
bottom up and from the outside
in. And that is not Washington's

28:29.741 --> 28:36.214
way. So, this was a different
message from a different
messenger. And we can only hope

28:36.214 --> 28:44.356
that his call for dialogue,
true, but to watch for the least
of these, will ring a bell here

28:44.356 --> 28:49.461
in Washington, because those --
those priorities have not been
here.

28:49.461 --> 28:54.933
We're a city of polarization,
where the rich and powerful
often have their way. The most

28:54.933 --> 29:01.206
powerful thing he did today was
not a paragraph from that
speech. He left Capitol Hill,
talking

29:01.206 --> 29:04.843
to the most powerful legislature
on earth, and went to have lunch
with homeless people

29:04.843 --> 29:08.046
who have no power at all.

29:08.046 --> 29:13.218
So, he showed us by his actions
what we need to do. I hope they
listen. I hope they learn.

29:13.218 --> 29:16.188
Frankly, I hope they
follow his example.

29:16.188 --> 29:20.258
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jim Nicholson,
there was some -- yes, he did
have something to say that

29:20.258 --> 29:25.530
both ends of the political
spectrum could respond to, but
there's been interpretation

29:25.530 --> 29:29.668
today that suggested it was more
-- it was a message that
resonated more with the
political

29:29.668 --> 29:30.902
left.

29:30.902 --> 29:31.870
Is that how you heard it?

29:31.870 --> 29:34.406
JIM NICHOLSON: I didn't.

29:34.406 --> 29:39.811
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean, on the
environment, on abolishing the
death penalty and so forth.

29:39.811 --> 29:43.081
JIM NICHOLSON: Well, you can --
you know, there are things in
there that you can interpret

29:43.081 --> 29:48.286
probably any way you want to,
but I think the transcendent
part of that talk was that

29:48.286 --> 29:53.492
he was speaking to
our higher angels.

29:53.492 --> 30:01.433
He was exhorting America through
its legislature to do more. I
mean, it was really -- it was

30:01.433 --> 30:08.440
a Gospel message, and coming
from man like that, it has such
great credibility, if not

30:08.440 --> 30:13.011
inspiration. My wife said
something interesting to me as
we were sitting there on the --
in

30:13.011 --> 30:16.782
the gallery watching him come
in. And all of those people of
all stripes in those two

30:16.782 --> 30:20.318
bodies jumped to their feet.

30:20.318 --> 30:23.522
And she said, "Why do you think
they're clapping so much?" which
I think is an interesting

30:23.522 --> 30:25.590
question.

30:25.590 --> 30:32.397
And I think -- I think it's
because everybody is kind of
yearning for some spiritual
leadership,

30:32.397 --> 30:41.039
some spiritual clarity. And this
iconic figure comes to
Washington, they close our city
down

30:41.039 --> 30:44.876
because this one man comes here.
I mean, K Street, you could have
thrown a grenade down

30:44.876 --> 30:47.612
there yesterday and
not hit anybody.

30:47.612 --> 30:52.017
And why is that? And I think
it's just that he is trying to
appeal to our higher nature

30:52.017 --> 30:54.786
and has done that.

30:54.786 --> 30:56.621
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sister Simone, is
that how you heard it, more that
than as a political...

30:56.621 --> 30:58.290
(CROSSTALK)

30:58.290 --> 31:01.126
SISTER SIMONE CAMPBELL: He
definitely had a political
message. He was very clear on

31:01.126 --> 31:04.429
the issue of immigration.

31:04.429 --> 31:09.534
He said specifically that we are
a nation of immigrants and
that's why he feels at home.

31:09.534 --> 31:16.241
His country is the same. And
then he said, we cannot be
afraid of the stranger. We must

31:16.241 --> 31:21.146
welcome them in. We shouldn't be
afraid of the numbers. We must
see their faces.

31:21.146 --> 31:25.550
That was a very direct
challenge, and I think, also on
the economy, speaking of the
needs

31:25.550 --> 31:29.488
of those who are left out
in our very broken system.

31:29.488 --> 31:33.992
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, when it
comes to immigration, Jim
Nicholson, as somebody who has
led the

31:33.992 --> 31:39.297
Republican National Committee,
are words from the pope
something that you think could
make

31:39.297 --> 31:42.501
change happen, bring the
two parties together?

31:42.501 --> 31:46.404
This is something -- most of the
Republican Party has been
opposed to immigration reform.

31:46.404 --> 31:51.176
JIM NICHOLSON: Well, no, they --
there's been a lot of good
discussion in our party, and

31:51.176 --> 31:55.347
good leadership, and attempts at
immigration reform. We know we
have a major...

31:55.347 --> 31:58.483
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, had a
different vision of immigration
reform, I should say.

31:58.483 --> 32:05.023
JIM NICHOLSON: Well, it's a
conundrum, because we're also
nation of law, the rule of law.

32:05.023 --> 32:09.094
And we have a lot of people here
who have violated the law to be
here. But they're human

32:09.094 --> 32:14.866
beings. And now they have
offspring and they provide a lot
of useful function here.

32:14.866 --> 32:20.338
So, what do you do about that?
And that's not an easy question.
And there are a lot

32:20.338 --> 32:24.910
of real good people that are
concerned about that. And I
think the pope, you know, thank

32:24.910 --> 32:29.181
God he might provide some help
in the mediation of that.

32:29.181 --> 32:34.019
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Carr, is
there follow-up from this? Is
this something where the pope,

32:34.019 --> 32:37.322
the Catholic Church stays
engaged on the points the pope
made today?

32:37.322 --> 32:41.059
JOHN CARR: Well, I hope so. And,
actually, the church has been
engaged.

32:41.059 --> 32:44.696
I was struck on the position of
the immigration. He didn't call
for HR-2012.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.299
JIM NICHOLSON: No.

32:47.299 --> 32:54.606
JOHN CARR: He called for us to
see the stories, see the faces.
The little girl who broke
through

32:54.606 --> 32:58.343
the line yesterday, 5 years old,
talking about her parents --
immigrants are being demonized

32:58.343 --> 33:01.079
in our politics right now.

33:01.079 --> 33:06.117
The pope said, step back from
that. Look at the human stories.
Look at the faces. Remember

33:06.117 --> 33:11.723
your own history. Truthfully, if
there was a secret vote on the
floor of the House, immigration

33:11.723 --> 33:18.697
reform would pass. So, maybe,
just maybe we could take a step
back, think about the values

33:18.697 --> 33:23.635
that are at stake, the
traditions the Holy Father
outlined, and actually come
together.

33:23.635 --> 33:28.206
I think criminal justice might
be an area. I think lifting
people out of poverty. If

33:28.206 --> 33:32.077
he gets Democrats and
Republicans to work together,
that might be his first miracle.

33:32.077 --> 33:33.211
(LAUGHTER)

33:33.211 --> 33:35.447
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do
you see follow-up?

33:35.447 --> 33:36.715
JIM NICHOLSON: That
would make him a saint.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.416
(CROSSTALK)

33:38.416 --> 33:42.020
SISTER SIMONE CAMPBELL: ...
probably make him a saint, I
really think we have hard work

33:42.020 --> 33:46.725
ahead to -- because we have a
nanosecond memory in this town.

33:46.725 --> 33:52.364
And so what we're doing is, next
Tuesday, 35 sisters are flying
in from around the country,

33:52.364 --> 33:57.335
and we're going to do a lobby
day on the Hill. It's going to
be the midst of the high-tension

33:57.335 --> 34:00.906
appropriations battles are
coming down the line. And we're
going to say, remember what

34:00.906 --> 34:05.043
the pope said. We have to find a
way forward. Remember the least
of these.

34:05.043 --> 34:09.614
Remember the best of our nation,
where we do create opportunity,
but we cannot leave

34:09.614 --> 34:14.052
people out. And we must create a
budget that does those things.

34:14.052 --> 34:17.989
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jim Nicholson, do
you see a lasting effect from
this?

34:17.989 --> 34:23.328
JIM NICHOLSON: I'm not sure
of that, but I hope there is.

34:23.328 --> 34:29.200
So, I mean, it's so memorable,
so unique when you think about
what went on here with this

34:29.200 --> 34:35.106
one, you know, priest from
Argentina who came here to
America, and the effect that
it's

34:35.106 --> 34:39.010
had on our system, and just
everything came to a standstill.
Every television set is on

34:39.010 --> 34:42.247
and his movements, and
that's unprecedented.

34:42.247 --> 34:47.519
And so maybe it may have some
unprecedented positive effect.

34:47.519 --> 34:50.322
JUDY WOODRUFF: Though, I mean,
when he's -- for example, when
he says something, condemns

34:50.322 --> 34:54.659
the arms trade and talk about
what it leads to, does that lead
to somebody moving on that

34:54.659 --> 34:55.293
issue?

34:55.293 --> 34:57.696
JIM NICHOLSON: Well, it could.

34:57.696 --> 35:04.836
It gives people some authority,
because he has so much
credibility and has that, what

35:04.836 --> 35:11.676
I call his powerful moral
megaphone. And when he speaks,
he's listened to. And it gives

35:11.676 --> 35:17.515
people -- wherever they are in
these positions, you know, they
can sort of try to align
themselves

35:17.515 --> 35:22.587
with the pope, and that does
help. I have that from
diplomatic experience and being

35:22.587 --> 35:25.991
in Rome in -- with the Iraq War.
And it can make a difference.

35:25.991 --> 35:26.925
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.626
(CROSSTALK)

35:28.626 --> 35:33.365
JOHN CARR: Well, because he
speaks for those who rarely have
a voice in Congress. And the

35:33.365 --> 35:37.869
fact that they heard a different
voice with a different message
calling us to our best

35:37.869 --> 35:39.938
selves, I hope it
makes a difference.

35:39.938 --> 35:40.839
JIM NICHOLSON: Amen.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.640
(LAUGHTER)

35:42.640 --> 35:47.445
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, on that
note, John Carr, Sister Simone
Campbell, and Ambassador Jim

35:47.445 --> 35:49.047
Nicholson, we thank
you, all three.

35:49.047 --> 35:51.349
JIM NICHOLSON: Thank you.

35:51.349 --> 35:58.223
SISTER SIMONE
CAMPBELL: Thank you.

35:58.223 --> 36:04.162
JOHN CARR: Thank you.

36:04.162 --> 36:09.200
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

36:09.200 --> 36:14.906
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
look at the state of Catholic
education in America.

36:14.906 --> 36:21.279
But, first, years into the
economic recovery, some
homeowners are still struggling
to hang

36:21.279 --> 36:27.052
on to their homes. The headlines
tell of strong home sales in
many major metropolitan areas,

36:27.052 --> 36:31.623
even in cities where sales
prices have been shooting
skyward.

36:31.623 --> 36:34.959
But there's another part of the
housing story, the places and
homeowners who have yet to

36:34.959 --> 36:39.264
recover, even as prices
have remained low.

36:39.264 --> 36:44.436
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman has that report, part of
our weekly series Making Sense,

36:44.436 --> 36:46.471
which airs every Thursday
on the "NewsHour."

36:46.471 --> 36:52.243
MAN: Go, go, go,
go. You all right?

36:52.243 --> 36:56.681
PAUL SOLMAN: Cheryl and Donte
(ph) Ortiz are living proof that
the housing crisis is still

36:56.681 --> 37:03.054
with us. When they bought their
Southbridge, Massachusetts, home
in 2004 for their large

37:03.054 --> 37:06.858
family, half of the kids
adopted, they thought they'd
found their slice of the
American pie.

37:06.858 --> 37:09.828
GIRL: I got you. I
got you. Come on.

37:09.828 --> 37:14.799
PAUL SOLMAN: But six years
later, it looked like they would
lose it. Donte ruptured a

37:14.799 --> 37:21.272
disk in his back at work and
became disabled. Cheryl's grad
school student loans came due.

37:21.272 --> 37:25.944
They fell behind on the house
payments. But since the value of
their house had plummeted,

37:25.944 --> 37:30.648
and in their neighborhood had
never recovered, even
refinancing wasn't an option.

37:30.648 --> 37:33.952
CHERYL ORTIZ, Homeowner: The
mortgage company had no
compassion. They wanted to do
nothing

37:33.952 --> 37:39.824
to help us, nothing. And I
finally said to them, I don't
know what you want me to do.

37:39.824 --> 37:44.028
I'm explaining to you my
situation. You don't -- it's
like you don't care. And they
said,

37:44.028 --> 37:47.432
well, it's your problem.
Put the house up for sale.

37:47.432 --> 37:50.668
PAUL SOLMAN: Which they did, in
what's known as a short sale,
where the seller's asking

37:50.668 --> 37:53.404
price doesn't cover
what's owed to the bank.

37:53.404 --> 37:55.406
Now, what had you paid
for it initially?

37:55.406 --> 37:56.808
CHERYL ORTIZ:
Initially, $250,000.

37:56.808 --> 37:59.811
PAUL SOLMAN: And what were
you short-selling it at?

37:59.811 --> 38:04.616
CHERYL ORTIZ: They brought it
down to as low as $149,000. And
not one person came to look

38:04.616 --> 38:07.285
at it, no offers, nothing.

38:07.285 --> 38:10.955
PAUL SOLMAN: After six months,
they pulled the house off the
market.

38:10.955 --> 38:13.124
So, you mean there's been no
housing rebound at all around
here?

38:13.124 --> 38:15.160
CHERYL ORTIZ: No, no, not here.

38:15.160 --> 38:24.169
PAUL SOLMAN: But the news is
that, nationally, housing prices
are on the way back up.

38:24.169 --> 38:25.937
CHERYL ORTIZ: Well, maybe
somebody should show me where
that is, because it hasn't
happened

38:25.937 --> 38:27.739
here.

38:27.739 --> 38:32.710
PAUL SOLMAN: Elyse Cherry, who
runs Boston Community Capital, a
nonprofit lender that

38:32.710 --> 38:37.549
specializes in helping
underwater homeowners, says this
story is still a common place.

38:37.549 --> 38:41.052
ELYSE CHERRY, Boston Community
Capital: This is the story of a
crisis that won't quit,

38:41.052 --> 38:47.358
and it won't quit because we're
not focused on the difference in
how it impacts our lower-income

38:47.358 --> 38:51.229
neighbors, as opposed to our
middle- and upper-middle-income
neighbors. In low-income areas,
the foreclosure

38:51.229 --> 38:52.897
crisis continues unabated.

38:52.897 --> 38:54.032
PAUL SOLMAN: Really? Unabated?

38:54.032 --> 38:56.000
ELYSE CHERRY: Unabated.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.305
PAUL SOLMAN: According to the
research real estate firm
Zillow, more than seven million

39:00.305 --> 39:08.046
borrowers remained underwater in
June of 2015, over half of them
by more than 20 percent,

39:08.046 --> 39:13.017
with homes in low-end
neighborhoods more than three
times as likely to be
underwater.

39:13.017 --> 39:18.856
And this tale of two markets is
playing out across the greater
Boston area. David Greenidge,

39:18.856 --> 39:25.797
a research data management
specialist, paid $250,000 in
2006 for his house in the
modest,

39:25.797 --> 39:31.703
but well-tended town of
Fitchburg, Massachusetts, then
found it had soon lost about
$100,000

39:31.703 --> 39:38.409
in value. After being between
jobs for several months, he too
fell behind, tried to refinance,

39:38.409 --> 39:41.579
and got the run-around we have
been reporting for years now.

39:41.579 --> 39:44.882
DAVID GREENIDGE, Homeowner: They
initially said, you know, let's
try to do a modification.

39:44.882 --> 39:52.257
OK, fine. I sent them the
paperwork, like 60 some-odd
pages, all our information. A

39:52.257 --> 39:57.262
month -- about a month later,
can you send us all the
information to do the
modification?

39:57.262 --> 40:02.667
OK. I sent it to them again and
said, I just sent you this a
month ago.

40:02.667 --> 40:08.873
PAUL SOLMAN: OK, maybe the banks
were overwhelmed by the volume
of business, but like Greenidge,

40:08.873 --> 40:11.709
Cheryl Ortiz wondered, why
wouldn't the banks make a deal
with homeowners at something
like

40:11.709 --> 40:13.945
market rates?

40:13.945 --> 40:19.050
CHERYL ORTIZ: What do you think
is going to happen to my house
if you take it? What is

40:19.050 --> 40:24.889
that going to help you as the
bank? You're going to lose more.
But, no, I'm out, you

40:24.889 --> 40:26.991
know, got to go, you're out of
the house, and we're going to
give it to somebody else

40:26.991 --> 40:29.093
much cheaper.

40:29.093 --> 40:32.630
PAUL SOLMAN: Nic Retsinas, who
teaches real estate at Harvard
Business School, says the

40:32.630 --> 40:35.967
banks don't necessarily
want to work things out.

40:35.967 --> 40:37.869
NIC RETSINAS, Harvard Business
School: Because the banks
necessarily aren't holding these

40:37.869 --> 40:41.973
mortgages. They're often
bundle-izing them and
securitizing them and selling
them to

40:41.973 --> 40:46.611
investors. Investors are very
nervous about losing any of
their principal. They feel
that's

40:46.611 --> 40:49.914
inviolate. As a result, they
haven't done a principal
reduction. As a result, you have

40:49.914 --> 40:53.418
these low values, particularly
among low-end homes, continue to
stilt the marketplace.

40:53.418 --> 40:57.989
PAUL SOLMAN: So the bank is
simply afraid of setting a
precedent?

40:57.989 --> 41:00.491
NIC RETSINAS: Yes, the banks
think this will be contagious,
and then they will lose their

41:00.491 --> 41:04.529
investor base, who is very
concerned about ever losing
their principal.

41:04.529 --> 41:11.002
PAUL SOLMAN: So, are you
sympathetic to the lenders for
not giving the homeowner the
same

41:11.002 --> 41:14.505
deal that is actually a
price on the open market?

41:14.505 --> 41:17.775
NIC RETSINAS: No, I think the
lenders have been short-sighted.
And because they have

41:17.775 --> 41:22.213
been short-sighted, for the most
part, this housing crisis has
dragged on and on, and

41:22.213 --> 41:25.616
it explains why the recovery
is so slow and so laborious.

41:25.616 --> 41:30.955
PAUL SOLMAN: This is where Elyse
Cherry and Boston Community
Capital come in. For the

41:30.955 --> 41:36.427
past six years, the
organization's Stabilizing Urban
Neighborhoods program has
refinanced

41:36.427 --> 41:41.599
some $85 million in home loans
for people in default and
foreclosure.

41:41.599 --> 41:45.970
PAUL SOLMAN: What you do is, you
buy the home at the current
market price, which is lower

41:45.970 --> 41:48.039
than the original one, and then
sell it back to the owner.

41:48.039 --> 41:49.040
ELYSE CHERRY: That's correct.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.609
PAUL SOLMAN: And that works?

41:51.609 --> 41:55.880
ELYSE CHERRY: Yes. We provide a
new 30-year fixed year mortgage.
We have some bells and

41:55.880 --> 41:59.117
whistles attached to this to be
sure that we really get good
homeowners.

41:59.117 --> 42:03.521
PAUL SOLMAN: Boston Community
Capital charges those homeowners
a interest rate than the

42:03.521 --> 42:09.293
banks and shares in any
appreciation of the home for as
long as the loan stays in force.

42:09.293 --> 42:11.462
As a result, says Cherry:

42:11.462 --> 42:16.234
ELYSE CHERRY: We encourage
people to clean up their credit
as quickly as possible, so

42:16.234 --> 42:20.338
that they can, in fact, go out
and get perhaps a cheaper
mortgage, take our mortgage out,

42:20.338 --> 42:23.608
and cut off any shared
appreciation as early as they
can.

42:23.608 --> 42:27.445
PAUL SOLMAN: Something the
Ortizes are already making plans
to do.

42:27.445 --> 42:33.351
CHERYL ORTIZ: Now I'm in a
position to say, OK, now I can
start looking for -- to
refinance.

42:33.351 --> 42:36.921
And I'm not going to have
somebody say, oh, you can't do
that because you're so far
underwater,

42:36.921 --> 42:39.123
you will -- nobody is
going to touch you.

42:39.123 --> 42:43.161
PAUL SOLMAN: One of the bells
and whistles that comes with the
Community Capital mortgage

42:43.161 --> 42:49.066
is a biweekly payment regiment,
requiring borrowers to make 26
half-payments a year,

42:49.066 --> 42:51.936
two more than needed to cover
their annual obligation.

42:51.936 --> 42:54.472
The extra two goes
into a fund...

42:54.472 --> 42:54.972
DAVID GREENIDGE: Exactly.

42:54.972 --> 42:55.873
PAUL SOLMAN: ... as a cushion.

42:55.873 --> 42:56.808
DAVID GREENIDGE: Exactly.

42:56.808 --> 42:59.343
PAUL SOLMAN: Have you had
the use the cushion?

42:59.343 --> 43:07.251
DAVID GREENIDGE: No, but we may
need to because our furnace is
very old. When the repairman

43:07.251 --> 43:12.723
came, he noticed that we have
some pipe issues. The plumber
said, don't touch it, so your

43:12.723 --> 43:16.194
finger might literally go
through. I'm going to submit the
estimate to fix that with Boston

43:16.194 --> 43:18.095
Community Capital.

43:18.095 --> 43:22.867
PAUL SOLMAN: So, is a program
like this the answer for a large
part of the housing market

43:22.867 --> 43:29.006
that's still reeling? Elyse
Cherry herself says no. For one
thing, not everyone qualifies.

43:29.006 --> 43:32.477
ELYSE CHERRY: You really have to
have enough current income to
support even a current-priced

43:32.477 --> 43:33.578
mortgage.

43:33.578 --> 43:37.248
PAUL SOLMAN: And Nic Retsinas
sees another limitation.

43:37.248 --> 43:41.152
NIC RETSINAS: They don't really
have the capacity to do this in
large numbers sort of over time.

43:41.152 --> 43:44.856
They're doing it in selected
markets. They're still running
into hurdles. They still need

43:44.856 --> 43:48.526
the cooperation of banks. So,
yes, it's a great idea. It makes
a lot of sense. Whether

43:48.526 --> 43:51.195
it can get to a scale to make a
difference, I'm not so sure.

43:51.195 --> 43:56.234
PAUL SOLMAN: But, for Cheryl
Ortiz, at least, it's given her
family room to breathe.

43:56.234 --> 44:00.071
CHERYL ORTIZ: We have a good
place to live. My kids have
their friends. And, you know,

44:00.071 --> 44:05.843
we hope that, little by little,
things turn around, but at least
I can say I'm not afraid

44:05.843 --> 44:08.479
for tomorrow, because, you know,
we can make -- right now, we're
making it. We're doing

44:08.479 --> 44:10.281
well.

44:10.281 --> 44:15.019
PAUL SOLMAN: For the moment. And
in the tale of two markets,
that's more than millions

44:15.019 --> 44:19.223
of still-underwater
homeowners can say.

44:19.223 --> 44:23.094
From parts of the Boston area
that still haven't recovered
from the housing crisis, this is

44:23.094 --> 44:32.069
economics correspondent Paul
Solman reporting for the "PBS
NewsHour."

44:32.069 --> 44:43.080
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tomorrow, Pope
Francis continues his American
tour with a stop at a Catholic

44:43.080 --> 44:46.183
school in New York City.

44:46.183 --> 44:51.188
Since the 1960s, enrollment at
Catholic schools in the United
States has fallen by more than

44:51.188 --> 44:55.626
50 percent. But the one Pope
Francis will visit and some
others like it have found ways

44:55.626 --> 44:57.795
to keep their doors open.

44:57.795 --> 45:02.466
The "NewsHour"'s April Brown has
our American Graduate report.

45:02.466 --> 45:09.874
APRIL BROWN: She may only be in
fourth grade, but Ngueubou Kamwa
is becoming very media-savvy.

45:09.874 --> 45:14.278
Over the past few weeks, she's
been interviewed by dozens of
news organizations at Our Lady

45:14.278 --> 45:18.115
Queen of Angels Catholic school
in New York's East Harlem
neighborhood to talk about the

45:18.115 --> 45:23.854
impending visit of the leader
of the Catholic Church.

45:23.854 --> 45:29.427
Ngueubou will actually get to
meet Pope Francis when he stops
by the school, and she knows

45:29.427 --> 45:31.963
quite a bit about him.

45:31.963 --> 45:38.302
NGUEUBOU KAMWA, Student: And his
real name is actually Jorge
Mario Bergoglio. I know

45:38.302 --> 45:45.076
that he's from Argentina. And
that he lives in Vatican City.

45:45.076 --> 45:49.480
APRIL BROWN: Seventh-grader Jade
Fuentes has also been studying
the life of the pontiff.

45:49.480 --> 45:55.186
JADE FUENTES, Student: He had
loved animals, and he still
does. Because he relates to
Saint

45:55.186 --> 45:59.390
Francis, that's where
he had chosen his name.

45:59.390 --> 46:03.094
APRIL BROWN: Jade's mother,
Nicole Fuentes, went to a
Catholic school a few blocks
away.

46:03.094 --> 46:05.596
NICOLE FUENTES, Mother: This
is eighth grade gradation.

46:05.596 --> 46:09.467
APRIL BROWN: Fuentes says the
area has changed a lot since
then.

46:09.467 --> 46:14.705
NICOLE FUENTES: This
neighborhood was diverse. You
had Italian immigrants, Puerto
Rican,

46:14.705 --> 46:17.241
African-American, Polish.

46:17.241 --> 46:22.246
APRIL BROWN: Now it's largely
African-American and Hispanic,
with fewer Catholics and many

46:22.246 --> 46:25.683
families that hit hard times
during the recession.

46:25.683 --> 46:31.455
NICOLE FUENTES: Things just
happened economically to this
neighborhood, and we lost out on
a

46:31.455 --> 46:35.059
lot of schools. And my school
was one of them. The church
still stands, but the school is

46:35.059 --> 46:37.361
no longer here.

46:37.361 --> 46:42.800
APRIL BROWN: St. Cecilia's is
just one of about 6,500 Catholic
schools that have closed

46:42.800 --> 46:47.805
in the U.S. over the past few
decades. In the 1960s, there
were nearly 13,000 across

46:47.805 --> 46:54.979
the country, educating more
than five million students.

46:54.979 --> 47:02.853
Today, only about two million
students attend Catholic school,
and that's due to a variety

47:02.853 --> 47:07.091
of reasons, including falling
birth rates among Catholics, the
rise of charter schools

47:07.091 --> 47:11.896
in urban areas, and more
Catholics moving to the suburbs.
The cost of running these

47:11.896 --> 47:16.167
schools has skyrocketed too,
leaving many struggling to stay
open.

47:16.167 --> 47:19.470
CHARLES ZECH, Villanova
University: The parochial school
system as we have known it over
the

47:19.470 --> 47:24.775
years is a dinosaur. They can't
possibly survive, given the
economics of the situation.

47:24.775 --> 47:29.580
APRIL BROWN: Charles Zech is an
economics professor at Villanova
University who studies

47:29.580 --> 47:35.186
how churches manage their
finances. Zech says one major
change in their work force has
hurt

47:35.186 --> 47:39.623
Catholic schools, which are
historically known for both
academic rigor and strict
discipline.

47:39.623 --> 47:44.128
CHARLES ZECH: Back in the day,
when parochial schools were
administered and most teachers

47:44.128 --> 47:48.432
were nuns, the labor costs were
extremely low. You would be
hard-pressed to find any

47:48.432 --> 47:51.802
nun teaching in parochial
schools today.

47:51.802 --> 47:56.040
APRIL BROWN: Lay teachers now
fill most of those posts, and
get paid more than nuns,

47:56.040 --> 48:00.010
who take a vow of poverty. Zech
says it can be very difficult to
manage these institutions

48:00.010 --> 48:03.180
with fewer resources.

48:03.180 --> 48:07.485
Historically, church leaders,
the educators, they don't have
financial backgrounds to be

48:07.485 --> 48:10.287
able to manage this kind
of problem, do they?

48:10.287 --> 48:13.991
CHARLES ZECH: Parochial schools
are under the purview of the
pastor of the parish. And,

48:13.991 --> 48:18.395
for one thing, no priest I know
became a pastor because he
wanted to run a small business,

48:18.395 --> 48:22.233
which is what a parish and a
school are. In addition,
seminaries do just a terrible
job

48:22.233 --> 48:26.137
of training their guys
on management skills.

48:26.137 --> 48:32.109
APRIL BROWN: One Catholic school
network that emerged in the
mid-1990s has found an
innovative

48:32.109 --> 48:36.814
way to deal with the financial
challenges of parochial
education. There are now 30
Cristo

48:36.814 --> 48:40.618
Rey schools across the country,
including Don Bosco in Maryland.

48:40.618 --> 48:44.855
MAN: For you alone are the holy
one. You alone are the lord.

48:44.855 --> 48:47.758
APRIL BROWN: Catholic
traditions, including mass, are
an important part of the day at

48:47.758 --> 48:52.897
Don Bosco, which found a home in
a closed Catholic elementary
school.

48:52.897 --> 48:57.168
One of the features that sets
these schools apart is that they
not only offer a college

48:57.168 --> 49:03.407
preparatory education, but a
work-study program as well. Each
student is paired with an
employer

49:03.407 --> 49:07.611
and works one day a week for all
four years, helping to offset
part of the $13,000-a-year

49:07.611 --> 49:11.115
tuition.

49:11.115 --> 49:16.187
Senior Carlos Lopez has spent
three years at the Washington,
D.C., area power company,

49:16.187 --> 49:20.457
Pepco. He says he's become more
confident, invested in his own
education, and now has

49:20.457 --> 49:23.727
skills that will be
useful in any workplace.

49:23.727 --> 49:27.531
CARLOS LOPEZ, Student: I got to
practice how to introduce
myself, how to set a good
impression.

49:27.531 --> 49:32.269
I learned that those are really
important out in the real world.

49:32.269 --> 49:36.106
APRIL BROWN: The president of
Don Bosco Cristo Rey, Father
Michael Conway, says the purpose

49:36.106 --> 49:39.510
of Catholic schools is much the
same as it has always been.

49:39.510 --> 49:41.579
FATHER MICHAEL CONWAY,
President, Don Bosco Cristo Rey:
Here in this country Catholic

49:41.579 --> 49:47.151
education came about as a result
of the huge immigration process
that took place in the

49:47.151 --> 49:53.390
1800s and the cry of Catholic
families to have their own
schools. Many of them were

49:53.390 --> 49:57.528
struggling within the public
school system to fit in. Many of
them were ostracized.

49:57.528 --> 50:00.164
APRIL BROWN: Only now, he says,
many Catholic schools are just
serving different groups

50:00.164 --> 50:02.900
of young people.

50:02.900 --> 50:06.203
FATHER MICHAEL CONWAY: That's
why this is a unique school,
because its mission is
specifically

50:06.203 --> 50:12.576
for those who are at the
poverty level or below.

50:12.576 --> 50:18.015
APRIL BROWN: Our Lady Queen of
Angels in Harlem has a similar
mission, making sure a Catholic

50:18.015 --> 50:23.520
education is within reach for
some of the city's most
disadvantaged students. But it's

50:23.520 --> 50:27.224
found a different way to keep
the doors open by turning to a
strategy charter schools have

50:27.224 --> 50:32.930
used for years, hiring a
management organization to run
things.

50:32.930 --> 50:37.301
The Archdiocese of New York
inked an agreement with the
nonprofit Partnership for
Inner-City

50:37.301 --> 50:42.239
Education to oversee the
educational and financial needs
of Our Lady Queen of Angels and
five

50:42.239 --> 50:46.243
other Catholic schools
in Harlem and the Bronx.

50:46.243 --> 50:49.880
Kathleen Porter-Magee is the
superintendent of the six
partnership schools.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.582
KATHLEEN PORTER-MAGEE,
Superintendent, Partnership for
Inner-City Education: Over the
past several

50:51.582 --> 50:56.020
years, I think the conversation
about urban Catholic education
has been one of pessimism,

50:56.020 --> 50:59.556
of sadness that schools have
been closing. But I think we're
actually at a moment where

50:59.556 --> 51:03.627
the conversation is and should
be about a renaissance and a
real revitalization.

51:03.627 --> 51:08.365
APRIL BROWN: The partnership has
been working to improve
efficiency and share best
practices

51:08.365 --> 51:14.204
among its six schools and
stabilize revenue streams
through a network of donors. The
schools

51:14.204 --> 51:17.741
can't depend on tuition, because
more than two-thirds of the
students need and receive

51:17.741 --> 51:19.343
scholarships.

51:19.343 --> 51:24.348
KATHLEEN PORTER-MAGEE: One of
the things that Pope Francis has
really focused is bringing

51:24.348 --> 51:29.219
the Catholic Church back to is
mission of service to
disadvantaged communities. And

51:29.219 --> 51:32.790
I know that that is something
that has been part of what urban
Catholic schools have done

51:32.790 --> 51:37.227
for generations and is certainly
something that they do here at
Our Lady Queen of Angels.

51:37.227 --> 51:41.432
APRIL BROWN: And many believe
that's why the pope has chosen
to visit this school, which

51:41.432 --> 51:49.106
has taught children since 1892,
many of them from immigrant
families like Ngueubou's.

51:49.106 --> 51:53.143
Her father, Jean-Pierre Kamwa,
is originally from Cameroon.

51:53.143 --> 51:58.382
JEAN-PIERRE KAMWA, Father: Our
neighborhood is predominantly
immigrant, low-income, and

51:58.382 --> 52:03.053
having people who are out of
work, like myself. So, if the
pope comes to our neighborhood,

52:03.053 --> 52:06.657
that means that he's going to
try to reach where they are.

52:06.657 --> 52:09.526
APRIL BROWN: Ngueubou,
meanwhile, has been focusing on
what's she's expected to do when

52:09.526 --> 52:11.829
she meets the pope.

52:11.829 --> 52:15.733
NGUEUBOU KAMWA: When he comes in
the room, we're going to sing
the prayer of St. Francis

52:15.733 --> 52:20.704
to him, and we might, like, talk
with him and pray with him.

52:20.704 --> 52:24.274
APRIL BROWN: And as many in this
community hope Pope Francis'
visit to the U.S. will

52:24.274 --> 52:28.379
bring Catholics back into the
fold, there is also belief that
his stop at Our Lady Queen

52:28.379 --> 52:33.150
of Angels could spark a renewed
interest in Catholic education
as well.

52:33.150 --> 52:40.391
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
April Brown in New York City.

52:40.391 --> 52:52.970
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online: Images of Syrian
refugees making their way across

52:52.970 --> 52:57.908
Europe have dominated front
pages for several weeks. Less
visible, images coming from
inside

52:57.908 --> 53:00.911
the war-torn country.

53:00.911 --> 53:05.816
Illustrator Molly Crabapple has
been working with a writer,
Marwan Hisham, who sends her

53:05.816 --> 53:11.989
cell phone images from Syria and
Iraq. The pair have published a
series of stunning scenes

53:11.989 --> 53:16.994
from the region. You can find a
gallery of that work on our home
page.

53:16.994 --> 53:22.633
And a new report shows that
children are getting adopted
more quickly today than a decade
ago.

53:22.633 --> 53:27.805
Adoption advocates say that's
benefiting families. We lay out
the data from the latest study.

53:27.805 --> 53:31.208
All that and more is on our
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour

53:31.208 --> 53:35.579
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's
the "NewsHour" for tonight.

53:35.579 --> 53:38.382
On Friday, we will look at
what's on the table for the
president of China's visit to
the

53:38.382 --> 53:39.450
White house.

53:39.450 --> 53:40.551
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:40.551 --> 53:43.187
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:43.187 --> 53:47.658
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening with Mark
Shields and David Brooks.

53:47.658 --> 53:49.560
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you, and good
night.
