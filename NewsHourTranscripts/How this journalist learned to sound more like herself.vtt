JUDY WOODRUFF: Next, our Brief
But Spectacular series, where
we ask interesting people to

00:02.866 --> 00:04.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
describe their passions.

00:04.933 --> 00:06.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, journalist Ann
Friedman, co-host of
the podcast "Call Your
Girlfriend," explores

00:06.166 --> 00:08.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
why it's important to
find your own voice.

00:08.166 --> 00:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANN FRIEDMAN, Journalist: Women
are frequently asked to couch
their opinions in a lot of

00:10.733 --> 00:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
filler words, which is why
I find it so interesting
that we are simultaneously
seen as unserious

00:12.833 --> 00:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when we use phrases like um,
you know, or like, because,
frankly, if you say things

00:14.833 --> 00:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
directly, without a lot of "oh,
you know what I think" sort
of padding around them, it's

00:21.100 --> 00:23.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
difficult for both
men and women to hear.

00:23.133 --> 00:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think it's just men
that have a hard time hearing
direct especially criticism when

00:28.633 --> 00:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's coming from a woman.

00:30.666 --> 00:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Knowing it doesn't really
change the fact that, like,
in the real world, women have

00:33.966 --> 00:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do a lot more emotional
labor to convey their opinions
and decisions and ideas.

00:44.433 --> 00:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am one of those boring people
who has only wanted to do
one thing for my entire life,

00:49.366 --> 00:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which is be a journalist.

00:51.333 --> 00:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's pretty impossible to equip
someone for a 10-plus-year
career in media right now.

00:55.066 --> 00:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're going to get fired
or laid off at some point.

00:57.166 --> 00:58.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It will happen.

00:58.900 --> 01:01.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And you probably are
going to have to learn
a bunch of new skills.

01:01.466 --> 01:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You probably are going to have
to come to terms with the fact
that you're not only going

01:04.566 --> 01:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to write long-form
magazine articles in the
style of 1960s "Esquire."

01:08.833 --> 01:13.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I didn't wake up one day
and say, you know what,
I should have a podcast.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have a good friend
here called Gina Delvac.

01:15.900 --> 01:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She had said for a long time
to me and to my friend Aminatou
Sow, hey, you guys have

01:22.333 --> 01:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a great chemistry, you would
be great podcast co-hosts.

01:24.133 --> 01:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it was somewhere around
where we came up with the name.

01:28.066 --> 01:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I guess we just create a fun,
safe place for ourselves and
discuss the things that we are

01:39.566 --> 01:41.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interested in.

01:41.566 --> 01:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it turns out that a lot
of other women are interested
in those things, too.

01:47.833 --> 01:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Voice is one of those things
that when you talk about it
in a classroom or with a group

01:50.066 --> 01:52.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of writers, it can feel
very big and abstract.

01:52.233 --> 01:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, when I was earlier in
my career, I had more doubts
about my validity as a writer

01:58.000 --> 02:00.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and a journalist.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I made my more effort to
copy the tone of the places
that I was writing for, inasmuch

02:02.966 --> 02:05.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as they had an
institutional tone.

02:05.100 --> 02:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the longer that I had been
working and the more confident
in my opinions or my reporting

02:09.633 --> 02:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or, frankly, like, my career
and my place in the world,
it gets easier to write the

02:14.166 --> 02:16.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
way that I speak.

02:16.366 --> 02:19.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If someone can't hear
the substance of what
I'm saying because of
the tone I say it with

02:19.033 --> 02:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or because of the little filler
words that I use -- which,
P.S., men use, too, we all

02:23.533 --> 02:25.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
use -- then that's
their problem.

02:25.633 --> 02:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My name is Ann Friedman, and
this is my Brief But Spectacular
take on finding your voice

02:30.200 --> 02:31.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in journalism.

02:31.666 --> 02:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, just
say it, that's the message.

02:34.266 --> 02:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
