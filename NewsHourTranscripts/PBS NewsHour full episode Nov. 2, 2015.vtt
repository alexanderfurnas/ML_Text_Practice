GWEN IFILL: Good
evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.573 --> 00:08.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.909 --> 00:12.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight, a deepening mystery:
What brought down a Russian
plane

00:12.746 --> 00:16.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Egypt, killing
hundreds on board?

00:16.383 --> 00:22.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Monday: racial profiling in the
courtroom, how one case taken

00:22.256 --> 00:27.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the Supreme Court could
change the process of jury
selection nationwide.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN BRIGHT, President and
Senior Counsel, Southern Center
for Human Rights: In the
prosecutor's

00:28.695 --> 00:34.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
files, they had race-coded and
color-coded all the black people
in the list of the jurors.

00:34.601 --> 00:37.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They had compared the black
jurors against each other.

00:37.337 --> 00:41.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Elvis Costello
talks about the moments that
influenced his music and

00:41.909 --> 00:44.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his new autobiography.

00:44.378 --> 00:50.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELVIS COSTELLO, Musician: I am a
fairly decent,
dark-dispositioned person, have
been, but

00:50.384 --> 00:53.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can -- it can start to like
it, rather than sort of try to
think, well, yes, I'm

00:53.654 --> 00:56.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- I was fine being a skeptic,
but then when you start to
settle for that, then it's not

00:56.123 --> 00:57.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very good.

00:57.624 --> 01:04.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:04.164 --> 01:08.602 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:08.602 --> 01:19.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: New numbers today
put the enormity of Europe's
migrant surge in stark relief.

01:19.112 --> 01:25.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United Nations Refugee
Agency said more than 218,000
people reached the continent

01:25.085 --> 01:31.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by sea last month. That's
roughly equal to the total for
all of 2014.

01:31.892 --> 01:36.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Streams of adults and children
kept trekking across Southern
European borders today, and

01:36.897 --> 01:40.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
U.N. officials warned
there's no letup in sight.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADRIAN EDWARDS, Spokesman,
United Nations High Commissioner
for Human Rights: We have

01:41.735 --> 01:46.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to expect this level of arrival
to continue, and that's because
the factors that are causing

01:46.707 --> 01:50.610 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
people to move
aren't going away.

01:50.610 --> 01:56.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are in a period of record
numbers of forced displacement
globally, almost 60 million
people

01:56.717 --> 02:01.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fleeing conflict, fleeing areas
of instability. It is the new
reality that we all have to

02:01.421 --> 02:05.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deal with, that this is a
phenomenon that isn't going away
quickly.

02:05.392 --> 02:12.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.N.
anticipates some 744,000
migrants will arrive in Europe
for all of

02:12.165 --> 02:17.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this year. More than half are
from Syria. At least another
3,400 people have died or

02:17.437 --> 02:20.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
disappeared trying
to make the journey.

02:20.774 --> 02:26.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Communities in
Colorado and North Carolina are
looking for answers, after
weekend

02:26.279 --> 02:31.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shootings that left five people
dead. In Colorado Springs, on
Saturday, a gunman killed three

02:31.818 --> 02:36.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people in a neighborhood street,
before police killed him. A
local newspaper reports he'd

02:36.390 --> 02:40.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
complained online
of mind control.

02:40.594 --> 02:44.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And early yesterday at
Winston-Salem State University,
one student was shot dead and

02:44.931 --> 02:49.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
another was wounded. The
suspect is a former student.

02:49.503 --> 02:55.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A two-year
bipartisan federal budget deal
has officially become law.
President

02:55.575 --> 03:00.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama signed it today in a brief
ceremony in the Oval Office.
That prevented the government

03:00.647 --> 03:06.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from defaulting on its debts
tomorrow. The package also
includes $80 billion in new
spending

03:06.286 --> 03:09.156 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
for defense and
domestic programs.

03:09.156 --> 03:14.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The president also
stepped up his push for criminal
justice reforms today,

03:14.027 --> 03:18.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
highlighting efforts to help
former inmates reenter society.

03:18.331 --> 03:23.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Newark, New Jersey, he
announced he's ordering federal
agencies to ban the box on
criminal

03:23.437 --> 03:27.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
history that appears
on employment forms.

03:27.140 --> 03:30.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: On many job
applications, there is a box
that

03:30.577 --> 03:37.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asks if you have criminal
record. If you answer yes, then
a lot of times you're not
getting

03:37.417 --> 03:43.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a call back. We're going to do
our part in changing this. The
federal government, I believe,

03:43.824 --> 03:48.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shouldn't use criminal history
to screen out applicants, before
we even look at their
qualifications.

03:48.428 --> 03:52.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The president said
roughly 70 million Americans
have some kind of criminal

03:52.999 --> 03:54.734 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
record.

03:54.734 --> 03:59.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two people who
served on a papal reform
commission have been arrested

03:59.806 --> 04:05.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on suspicion they leaked
confidential documents. Vatican
authorities say a Spanish priest
and

04:05.178 --> 04:10.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Italian laywoman allegedly
passed the information to
journalists.

04:10.183 --> 04:15.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Pope Francis formed the
now-defunct commission in 2013
in an effort to address the
Vatican's

04:15.522 --> 04:19.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
secretive and complex
financial holdings.

04:19.192 --> 04:23.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG BURKE, Vatican Senior
Adviser: Once again, people are
trying to profit from stolen
documents,

04:23.296 --> 04:27.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and people with the trust of
Pope Francis have betrayed it,
people that the pope trusted

04:27.234 --> 04:30.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in. That's hardly the way
to help his mission.

04:30.303 --> 04:35.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Francis'
predecessor, Pope Benedict,
faced a similar document leak in

04:35.075 --> 04:40.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2012 that led to the arrest of
his butler and a Vatican
computer technician.

04:40.280 --> 04:45.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For the first time,
an African-American cleric will
lead the U.S. Episcopal Church.

04:45.919 --> 04:51.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Presiding Bishop Michael Curry
was installed Sunday. In the
face of dwindling membership,

04:51.791 --> 04:56.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he urged the nation's two
million Episcopalians to reach
out to those of different racial

04:56.396 --> 05:00.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and economic backgrounds. Curry
succeeds Katharine Jefferts
Schori, the first woman to serve

05:00.267 --> 05:02.569 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the position.

05:02.569 --> 05:07.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street got
the week off to a strong start,
thanks to a rally in health

05:07.707 --> 05:16.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care and energy stocks. The Dow
Jones industrial average gained
165 points to close near 17830,

05:16.316 --> 05:20.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
putting it back in positive
territory for the year. The
Nasdaq rose more than 70 points,

05:20.654 --> 05:24.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the S&amp;P 500 added 24.

05:24.491 --> 05:30.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Kansas City is
celebrating today, after the
Royals won their first World

05:30.163 --> 05:36.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Series championship in 30 years.
The Royals rallied last night to
beat the New York Mets,

05:36.403 --> 05:40.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
7-to-2, in 12 innings. And that
gave them the title four games
to one.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot of
celebrating in Kansas City.

05:42.375 --> 05:44.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

05:44.477 --> 05:49.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour": questions abound
in the crash of a Russian

05:49.082 --> 05:54.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
airliner; jury selection and
racial discrimination before the
Supreme Court; Jeb Bush tries to

05:54.955 --> 06:03.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
jump-start his campaign,
and much more.

06:03.363 --> 06:15.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Officials from at
least five countries are
investigating why a Russian
jetliner broke

06:15.008 --> 06:19.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
up in midair and crashed
in Egypt this weekend.

06:19.412 --> 06:24.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There are many questions
tonight, but little agreement so
far that may have explained what

06:24.484 --> 06:31.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happened. Wreckage lay strewn
across miles of desert after
Saturday's crash, leaving

06:31.157 --> 06:37.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a giant mangled puzzle for
Russian and Egyptian
investigators. They're looking
for any clues

06:37.097 --> 06:43.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to what downed the airliner and
killed 224 people, everyone on
board.

06:43.837 --> 06:49.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as a top Russian official at
the scene said yesterday, that
remains far from clear.

06:49.175 --> 06:52.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIKTOR SOROCHENKO, Investigator
(through translator): Initial
examination showed that, at the
moment,

06:52.445 --> 06:56.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we can't exclude any version of
the crash. We will be looking
into all possibilities.

06:56.549 --> 07:01.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What is known is the
flight took off from the resort
town of Sharm el-Sheikh

07:01.421 --> 07:08.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bound for Saint Petersburg. It
had reached 31,000 feet,
cruising altitude, when it broke

07:08.828 --> 07:15.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up over the Sinai Peninsula,
just 23 minutes after takeoff.
Little else has been confirmed,

07:15.068 --> 07:19.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and conflicting reports
have fed confusion.

07:19.639 --> 07:23.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Moscow today, a senior
official with the Russian
airline Metrojet pointed to some
unnamed

07:23.710 --> 07:27.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
external factor.

07:27.080 --> 07:31.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDER SMIRNOV, Metrojet
(through translator): There are
no such faults, like engine
failure,

07:31.618 --> 07:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
system failure. There is no such
combination of systems failure
that could lead to a plane

07:35.922 --> 07:40.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
breaking up in the air. The only
possible explanation for a
breakup of the aircraft

07:40.560 --> 07:44.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the air could be a certain
impact, some mechanical or
physical impact.

07:44.998 --> 07:51.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Asked if it was a
terror attack, the official said
only, "Anything is possible."

07:51.004 --> 07:56.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the Russian government's
chief aviation regulator said
all such talk is premature.

07:56.976 --> 08:01.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Russians also dismissed a
claim that an Islamic State
affiliate brought down the
plane,

08:01.581 --> 08:04.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying the group doesn't
have that ability.

08:04.784 --> 08:10.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Reuters reported that
initial data from the black box
recorders shows no sign

08:10.423 --> 08:17.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the plane was hit by a missile.
They didn't rule out sabotage or
even a bomb on board.

08:17.063 --> 08:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That left Russian President
Vladimir Putin to promise Moscow
will get to the bottom of

08:20.500 --> 08:22.469 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the mystery.

08:22.469 --> 08:25.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
Without any doubt, everything

08:25.538 --> 08:28.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has to be done to make sure we
have an objective description of
what happened. We have to know

08:28.975 --> 08:32.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what happened and to react
in the appropriate way.

08:32.812 --> 08:37.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But getting an
objective description from
Russian or Egyptian officials
has proved

08:37.884 --> 08:44.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
difficult in previous crashes.
In 1999, an Egypt Air flight
went down off Massachusetts.

08:44.424 --> 08:49.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A U.S. investigation found the
co-pilot deliberately flew the
plane into the ocean. But
Egypt's

08:49.195 --> 08:52.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government refused to
accept that finding.

08:52.665 --> 08:59.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, last year, Malaysia
Airlines Flight 17 crashed in
Eastern Ukraine. An
international

08:59.239 --> 09:03.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
committee has since determined
that Russian-backed rebels shot
down the plane, a finding that

09:03.343 --> 09:06.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Moscow rejected.

09:06.679 --> 09:11.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, bodies from this
latest crash have begun arriving
in Saint Petersburg. The city

09:11.785 --> 09:14.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is officially in mourning
through tomorrow.

09:14.454 --> 09:17.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, what do we know so far?

09:17.190 --> 09:21.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more, I'm joined by Alan
Diehl, a former investigator for
the National Transportation

09:21.161 --> 09:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Safety Board, and the author of
"Air Safety Investigators: Using
Science to Save Lives."

09:26.800 --> 09:31.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alan Diehl, I want to walk you
through some of the theories we
have heard so far today

09:31.304 --> 09:38.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and which we heard just now in
that tape. Let's talk first
about the complete midair

09:38.411 --> 09:42.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
collision or failure. What
is the possibility of that?

09:42.782 --> 09:46.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN DIEHL, Former National
Transportation Safety Board
Investigator: Well, the wreckage

09:46.052 --> 09:52.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- the wreckage location pattern
suggests that there was some
kind of inside breakup,

09:52.625 --> 09:57.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but I don't think this happened
at 31,000 feet, even though it
spread over several miles.

09:57.263 --> 10:01.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a fairly tight pattern,
and there's been report that the
data was streaming as

10:01.901 --> 10:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
low as -- down to as low as
5,000 feet. So the problem may
have began at 31,000 feet,

10:08.141 --> 10:12.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but I believe the aircraft was
relatively intact down to lower
altitudes, perhaps as

10:12.912 --> 10:15.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
low as 5,000 feet.

10:15.882 --> 10:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, we do know the tail is
three miles from the main
wreckage and there is other
debris

10:21.087 --> 10:26.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and bodies scattered in the
area, but I don't think this
aircraft came apart, like, for

10:26.826 --> 10:32.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
example, the Malaysia 17 flight
did when it was hit by a large
missile over Ukraine.

10:32.131 --> 10:35.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: So it's not
consistent with a midair
explosion, at least not at that
height?

10:35.735 --> 10:39.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALAN DIEHL: I would
say not, Gwen.

10:39.672 --> 10:45.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, of course, having done this
40 years, everything is very
preliminary and I can only

10:45.278 --> 10:52.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speculate. I think the Egyptians
will do a very thorough job. We
know that, oftentimes,

10:52.585 --> 10:56.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people say this is like putting
a jigsaw puzzle together. Only,
many times, you don't have

10:56.289 --> 10:58.858 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all the pieces.

10:58.858 --> 11:05.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we have got all the
pieces right now. The recorders
were in good shape. The
Egyptians

11:05.632 --> 11:10.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had analyzed those. I think that
was why they discounted the
missile strike theory. And,

11:10.737 --> 11:16.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of course, the wreckage is in a
desert area. This is not like
the Ukrainian crash, where

11:16.409 --> 11:20.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was scattered over a very
wide area. People were pilfering
things, we think, and maybe

11:20.647 --> 11:23.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
even the rebels were
removing things.

11:23.182 --> 11:27.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think we have got all the
parts of this jigsaw puzzle, but
it's going to take a little

11:27.921 --> 11:33.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time for all the players to come
together. It's not just the
Russians that are doing

11:33.927 --> 11:36.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the investigation. We're using
the Egyptians. We know there are
five countries.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN DIEHL: And particularly
with the French involved, I
think we're going to get to the

11:40.466 --> 11:43.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bottom of this, and
fairly expeditiously.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You mentioned the
fact that the plane's tail was
some distance away from a

11:46.506 --> 11:49.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lot of the other wreckage.

11:49.175 --> 11:52.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's also -- there were also
reports today that there had
been damage to the plane's

11:52.979 --> 11:59.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tail some years ago that had
been repaired. What's the
potential for some sort of
weakness

11:59.218 --> 12:04.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or metal stress and failure
which would have created
something this catastrophic?

12:04.791 --> 12:11.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN DIEHL: Well, we have seen
this before. In a 747 over
Japan, the worst single aircraft

12:11.965 --> 12:16.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accident in the history, killed
520 people, the tail came off,
because a -- they're called

12:16.903 --> 12:21.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tail strikes. The aircraft tail
bumps the ground on takeoff or
landing.

12:21.941 --> 12:26.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So this is a real possibility.
But, again, Gwen, they have the
physical evidence, and

12:26.846 --> 12:30.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Egyptians seem to be doing a
very good job of protecting
that. I have noticed they

12:30.683 --> 12:34.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have even put fences around the
primary wreckage location.

12:34.887 --> 12:40.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the metallurgists will haul
that tail back into the lab and,
with electron microscopes

12:40.460 --> 12:45.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and other techniques, establish
whether this repair was done
correctly or whether there

12:45.665 --> 12:51.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was some sort of metal fatigue
involved or even a catastrophic
failure for some other

12:51.804 --> 12:55.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reason. I think we will get to
the bottom of this when we have
the evidence.

12:55.274 --> 12:58.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, the black box,
is that essential for us to find
out whether maybe pilot error

12:58.578 --> 12:59.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
could have been involved?

12:59.545 --> 13:02.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN DIEHL: Absolutely.

13:02.281 --> 13:08.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, as many people
have said, everything is still
on the table. Another

13:08.254 --> 13:12.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing that was very curious
about this, and, again, these
are initial reports confirmed

13:12.492 --> 13:18.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I guess by the Egyptians, that
the radar data suggested that
the plane didn't just suddenly

13:18.331 --> 13:24.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dive out of the sky from 31,000
feet, that it actually entered a
series of undulations

13:24.937 --> 13:30.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where it climbed and dived --
dove a couple thousand feet
before it made its final plunge

13:30.009 --> 13:33.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
toward the desert.

13:33.046 --> 13:37.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that could -- we have seen
this in the past with these
highly automated aircraft,

13:37.283 --> 13:43.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where pilots have been confused
and perhaps shut down the wrong
system. The automation

13:43.756 --> 13:49.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is fed by other sensors. And
sometimes these sensors, like in
the Air France accident in

13:49.962 --> 13:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the South Atlantic, they -- in
essence, they're feeding
erroneous data to the computers
and

13:54.200 --> 13:59.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the computers do things that
cause the pilots to be confused
and contribute to this.

13:59.238 --> 14:03.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, you can argue that's pilot
error or design error. Take your
pick. The lawyers will sort

14:03.409 --> 14:06.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all that out in future
years, I guess.

14:06.212 --> 14:09.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Alan Diehl, aviation
security consultant, thank you
for helping us.

14:09.148 --> 14:18.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALAN DIEHL: Thank you, Gwen.

14:18.191 --> 14:28.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we turn
to the Supreme Court, where
justices heard arguments in a

14:28.801 --> 14:32.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
death penalty case out of
Georgia that deals with race
discrimination in the selection

14:32.004 --> 14:34.173 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of jurors.

14:34.173 --> 14:38.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We begin our coverage of that
case with a version of a report
that originally aired

14:38.144 --> 14:41.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the PBS program "Religion
&amp; Ethics Newsweekly."

14:41.614 --> 14:44.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Correspondent Tim
O'Brien has the story.

14:44.751 --> 14:50.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM O'BRIEN: It was in 1986 in
Rome, Georgia.
Seventy-nine-year-old Queen
White had just

14:50.757 --> 14:57.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
returned home from choir
practice to confront a burglar
who would take her life.

14:57.296 --> 15:03.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Prosecutors said it was this man
-- Timothy Foster -- 18 years
old at the time.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Down at the Floyd County
Courthouse, over the vehement
objections of defense lawyers,

15:05.271 --> 15:10.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
prosecutors excused all
African-Americans from the jury
pool. Foster would be tried,

15:10.643 --> 15:16.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
convicted, and sentenced to
die by an all-white jury.

15:16.182 --> 15:20.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. Supreme Court had ruled
only four months before this
crime was committed that

15:20.753 --> 15:26.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
while lawyers have wide latitude
in selecting juries and may even
excuse some prospective

15:26.025 --> 15:31.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jurors without having to explain
why, race can never be a factor.
Should it appear that

15:31.397 --> 15:36.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
race is the motive, the attorney
must be able to provide
race-neutral reasons.

15:36.669 --> 15:37.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN BRIGHT, President and
Senior Counsel, Southern Center
for Human Rights: The reasons

15:37.737 --> 15:42.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given here -- some were false.
They just simply weren't true.
Some were contradictory. In

15:42.975 --> 15:48.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact, on their lists of people
who they were definitely going
to strike, the five
African-Americans

15:48.047 --> 15:51.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were the first five listed. And
there was only one other person
on the list, and it

15:51.050 --> 15:53.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was a white woman.

15:53.352 --> 15:57.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM O'BRIEN: Stephen Bright runs
the Southern Center for Human
Rights in Atlanta and will

15:57.523 --> 16:03.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
argue Foster's case before the
Supreme Court. Proving jurors
were removed because of their

16:03.362 --> 16:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race can be difficult, but
lawyers at the Center say they
have come up with some
persuasive

16:07.600 --> 16:09.936 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new evidence.

16:09.936 --> 16:12.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN BRIGHT: In the
prosecutor's files, they had
listed -- they race-coded and
color-coded

16:12.638 --> 16:17.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all the black people in
the lists of the jurors.

16:17.076 --> 16:22.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They had compared the black
jurors against each other in the
notes, saying, "If we have

16:22.281 --> 16:26.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to accept a black, maybe this
one would be OK," which suggests
the goal was to get rid

16:26.052 --> 16:32.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of all the blacks. And so it all
points pretty much in one
direction, which is race.

16:32.058 --> 16:38.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM O'BRIEN: A 10-year study of
332 criminal cases in Louisiana
found that when there were

16:38.631 --> 16:43.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least three blacks on the
jury, 12 percent of the
defendants were acquitted; the
acquittal

16:43.569 --> 16:50.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rate rose to 19 percent with
five or more black jurors, and
no one was acquitted in

16:50.109 --> 16:54.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the study when there were two or
fewer black jurors. In all three
groups, the defendants

16:54.213 --> 16:58.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were overwhelmingly black.

16:58.184 --> 17:03.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kent Scheidegger is legal
director of the Criminal Justice
Legal Foundation, victims'

17:03.189 --> 17:08.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rights group that supports
capital punishment, and
Scheidegger says the fact that
prosecutors

17:08.294 --> 17:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kept notes on the race of the
jurors doesn't prove racial
discrimination, but rather may

17:12.932 --> 17:15.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
help to refute it.

17:15.334 --> 17:17.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KENT SCHEIDEGGER, Legal
Director, Criminal Justice Legal
Foundation: The fact that you

17:17.536 --> 17:23.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
keep track of the race of the
jurors as you go through the
process is not at all
suspicious.

17:23.576 --> 17:28.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In order to defend yourself
against the charges of
discrimination, you have to keep
track.

17:28.314 --> 17:32.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why every time we apply
for a loan, or a job, or school
admission, we're asked

17:32.418 --> 17:35.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to specify our race, and that's
all they were doing in this
case.

17:35.721 --> 17:41.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN BRIGHT: If all you
wanted was to know information
about the black jurors, you
wouldn't

17:41.961 --> 17:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
write things like, "If we have
to accept a black, maybe this
one will be OK."

17:47.300 --> 17:48.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIM O'BRIEN: You want his
conviction set aside.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KENT SCHEIDEGGER: Right.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM O'BRIEN: But what more than
that? What do you want the court
to say?

17:53.239 --> 17:57.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN BRIGHT: One of the
things that I hope at the very
least will come out of this case

17:57.109 --> 18:02.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that the court will require
the reasons given be scrutinized
much more carefully than

18:02.715 --> 18:05.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they were in this case.

18:05.785 --> 18:11.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM O'BRIEN: Significantly, last
June, two justices formally
urged the court to reconsider

18:11.624 --> 18:15.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether the United States is
even capable of administering
capital punishment in a
constitutional

18:15.594 --> 18:18.164 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
manner.

18:18.164 --> 18:23.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The justices, Stephen Breyer,
joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
noted that the risk of executing

18:23.569 --> 18:29.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an innocent person remains
great, that factors such as
race, gender, and geography make
the

18:29.442 --> 18:35.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
death penalty arbitrary, that
the decades-long delays between
sentence and execution defeat

18:35.681 --> 18:41.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the goals of deterrence and
retribution, and that both death
sentences and actual executions

18:41.620 --> 18:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are becoming increasingly
unusual -- down almost 70
percent in the last 15 years.

18:47.660 --> 18:51.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN BREYER, Associate
Justice, U.S. Supreme Court: I
recognize that we are a court,
not

18:51.597 --> 18:57.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a legislature, but the matters
that I have discussed are
judicial matters. They concern

18:57.269 --> 19:06.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the infliction of an unfair,
cruel, and unusual punishment
upon individuals at odds with a

19:06.579 --> 19:13.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specific constraint that the
Constitution imposes on the
democratic process."

19:13.552 --> 19:20.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM O'BRIEN: The country appears
to be slowly, but inexorably,
moving away from capital
punishment.

19:20.126 --> 19:24.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If so, the U.S. Supreme Court
may not be too far behind.

19:24.997 --> 19:30.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The justices also
heard a case looking at the
issue of online privacy.

19:30.436 --> 19:33.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on both cases, we turn
to Marcia Coyle of "The National
Law Journal," who was

19:33.639 --> 19:35.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at the Supreme Court today.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, welcome back, Marcia.

19:37.977 --> 19:38.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National
Law Journal": Thank you.

19:38.811 --> 19:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's talk first
about the all-white jury case.
How important is it that

19:43.783 --> 19:49.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the lawyers of this accused man,
Timothy Foster, were able to get
ahold of those original notes

19:49.555 --> 19:53.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
made by the prosecutor
back in 1987?

19:53.192 --> 19:57.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, Judy, I
think how the justices view the
notes is really crucial

19:57.730 --> 20:02.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to Mr. Foster's chance
of getting a new trial.

20:02.701 --> 20:09.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If the justices see race
discrimination in those notes,
that is a violation of the 14th

20:09.075 --> 20:11.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Amendment, and he
will get a new trial.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So tell us about
the arguments before the court
today.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Sure.

20:15.714 --> 20:20.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the arguments, Mr.
Foster's attorney, Steve Bright,
argued that the notes
represented

20:20.719 --> 20:27.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an arsenal of smoking guns that
were designed clearly to
separate the African-American
prospective

20:27.860 --> 20:31.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
jurors and to treat
them differently.

20:31.864 --> 20:38.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Justice Kagan asked Georgia's
attorney why this wasn't as
clear violation of the court's

20:38.771 --> 20:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1986 decision as the court was
ever likely to see. And
Georgia's attorney said, well,

20:45.845 --> 20:51.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really, the notes can be viewed
in two ways. They could be
viewed as the prosecutors'
preparation

20:51.617 --> 20:56.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to defend against the claim
of racial discrimination.

20:56.422 --> 21:02.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Justice Breyer said that was
hard to believe because that
reason, he said, was never given

21:02.128 --> 21:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the prosecutor until the case
actually came to the Supreme
Court. So it appeared

21:07.500 --> 21:12.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that there were a number of
justices sympathetic to Mr.
Foster's claim.

21:12.304 --> 21:15.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the justices
would push back when the lawyers
for the state of Georgia

21:15.307 --> 21:16.342 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
made that argument?

21:16.342 --> 21:18.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's right.

21:18.777 --> 21:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I should mention, Judy, that
there is a possibility that the
court will not reach the merits
here.

21:24.416 --> 21:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a procedural problem
with the case that came up very
late, and the case may have

21:29.088 --> 21:32.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go back to the Georgia
Supreme Court for some
clarification.

21:32.658 --> 21:36.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what we said
earlier in the program about
there being wider implications

21:36.729 --> 21:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for this case, that really does
on what the -- how the justices
choose to look at this.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: It does
absolutely. It could be narrow,
focused solely on Mr. Foster's

21:42.468 --> 21:44.837 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
case.

21:44.837 --> 21:49.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But even if he wins, and it is
narrow, it sends a message, I
think, to other courts

21:49.975 --> 21:57.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to look at these kinds of claims
very carefully. In 1986, Justice
Thurgood Marshall wrote
separately

21:57.583 --> 22:04.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the case to say that the
Batson rule here that was
announced by the court in '86
wasn't

22:04.890 --> 22:09.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
likely to end race
discrimination in jury
selection. The only way to end
it was to eliminate

22:09.628 --> 22:11.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
discretionary jury strikes.

22:11.797 --> 22:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There doesn't seem to be
much sympathy for that.

22:14.833 --> 22:18.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
now about this other case the
justices heard today.

22:18.437 --> 22:24.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This had to do with incorrect
information on a search engine
about somebody on the Internet

22:24.343 --> 22:27.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and whether this constituted
real harm done to this person.
Tell us about the core of

22:27.580 --> 22:28.380 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this case.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: OK.

22:30.816 --> 22:36.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, Spokeo is a -- calls
itself a people search engine.
It collects information on

22:36.589 --> 22:42.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
individuals, and that
information is used in credit
reports and for other purposes.

22:42.394 --> 22:48.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tom Robins, he searched for his
name on Spokeo, and, frankly,
the information there was a

22:48.434 --> 22:52.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mess. They got wrong his age,
his marital status, his
education, his employment,
whether

22:52.004 --> 22:52.972 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he had children.

22:52.972 --> 22:53.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just
about everything.

22:53.672 --> 22:55.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Just
about everything.

22:55.841 --> 23:02.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the Fair Credit Reporting
Act imposes a series of
regulatory requirements on
credit

23:02.648 --> 23:08.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reporting agencies. Congress
passed it to ensure maximum
accuracy in the reporting of

23:08.554 --> 23:13.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this information. And it
provides limited damages if the
act is violated, either
negligently

23:13.626 --> 23:16.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or willfully.

23:16.495 --> 23:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Robins went to court. He
wanted to prove violation. He
wanted to form a class action

23:21.567 --> 23:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of other people who had suffered
similarly. He didn't get very
far because the trial court,

23:27.840 --> 23:32.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at least, dismissed his case
saying you have to show, under
the Constitution's Article

23:32.344 --> 23:38.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
3, actual harm, actual injury,
concrete injury, and you didn't.

23:38.584 --> 23:43.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals reversed, said that just
the violation of the statute

23:43.889 --> 23:48.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alone is enough for you to have
standing, the right to go into
federal court. That's

23:48.761 --> 23:52.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the issue before the court. Is
it enough to just find a
violation of the statute, or do

23:52.264 --> 23:54.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you have to show something more?

23:54.767 --> 23:56.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, just quickly,
what were the justices saying
today? What could you

23:56.602 --> 23:57.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tell from their conversation?

23:57.703 --> 24:00.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: It appears
they are divided.

24:00.472 --> 24:07.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had justices like Justices
Kagan and Sotomayor saying,
look, if somebody disseminates
false

24:07.046 --> 24:11.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
information about me, I would
feel harmed, and if you took a
survey of people, they would

24:11.350 --> 24:16.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
probably feel harmed as well.
That should be enough, isn't it?

24:16.789 --> 24:23.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Well, Spokeo's attorney
counters, no, you do -- Congress
has to clearly state that it's

24:23.696 --> 24:29.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supplanting the Constitution's
rule of a concrete injury. Chief
Justice Roberts seemed to agree

24:29.635 --> 24:34.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with that, saying, we have
legions of cases that require a
concrete injury, not just a

24:34.506 --> 24:36.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
violation of the statute.

24:36.975 --> 24:42.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they appeared divided, Judy.
It's a very important case. It's
being closely watched

24:42.147 --> 24:45.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the business community, the
tech companies, Internet
service, right.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.919 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:46.919 --> 24:50.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: And on the other
side, it's being closely watched
by privacy organizations,

24:50.856 --> 24:54.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
civil rights groups,
consumer groups.

24:54.760 --> 25:00.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It may affect not only this
statute, the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, but similar laws
that

25:00.599 --> 25:06.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have an outright violation of a
statute allowing an action for
damages.

25:06.805 --> 25:09.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marcia Coyle,
spending much of this day with
the Supreme Court.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: And more to come.

25:11.443 --> 25:12.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And much more
to come. Thank you, Marcia.

25:12.845 --> 25:19.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure, Judy.

25:19.752 --> 25:29.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

25:29.862 --> 25:35.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
President Erdogan's quest for
more power in Turkey; how
doomsday

25:35.134 --> 25:42.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prophecies boost ISIS recruits;
and British musician Elvis
Costello's life and legend.

25:42.007 --> 25:48.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, Republican campaigns
are making debate demands. Jeb
Bush goes for a reboot.

25:48.046 --> 25:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Bernie Sanders joins the
ad wars. It's Politics Monday.

25:52.017 --> 25:57.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As always, I'm joined by Tamara
Keith of NPR and Amy Walter of
The Cook Political Report.

25:57.089 --> 26:00.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's start with the debate over
debates. Why talk about the
issues when you can talk

26:00.759 --> 26:04.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about the debates?

26:04.997 --> 26:08.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The latest thing that has
happened is the candidates'
representatives met and they
tried

26:08.434 --> 26:12.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to come up with a common deal
that they were going to present
to the networks and say,

26:12.204 --> 26:16.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is the way these debates
ought to go, no lightning
rounds, no show of hands, that

26:16.942 --> 26:21.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of thing, except that
Donald Trump threw a little
spanner in the works, Amy.

26:21.580 --> 26:21.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes, what a surprise.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.816 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Donald Trump, I
don't know if you knew he wrote
this book called "The Art

26:26.752 --> 26:28.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Deal," says, I'm going to
negotiate my own deal. I'm not
going to sign on a letter

26:28.954 --> 26:31.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with 15 other candidates.

26:31.824 --> 26:37.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this gets to the heart of
it, right, which is, debates,
doesn't matter, this year, last

26:37.763 --> 26:43.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year, last cycle, 100 years ago,
debates are very different for
very different candidates.

26:43.969 --> 26:47.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're a front-running
candidate, as Donald Trump is,
as Ben Carson is, you don't like

26:47.873 --> 26:50.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debates, because it puts the
target right on you, it puts the
focus on you, there is

26:50.876 --> 26:53.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot of pressure on you.

26:53.879 --> 26:58.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you are a candidate who is
struggling to get name I.D., if
you're trying to break through,

26:58.917 --> 27:03.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you love debates, because it may
be the only opportunity you get
in front of the public.

27:03.188 --> 27:08.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is why John Kasich's
campaign says, we're not signing
onto this. Carly Fiorina
campaigns

27:08.260 --> 27:10.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, we're not signing onto
this. Chris Christie's campaign
said, we're fine with the way
debates

27:10.262 --> 27:11.330 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.899 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, there we go.

27:13.899 --> 27:18.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, what we had in
this week was a debate over not
-- the debates, but also

27:18.003 --> 27:24.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the moderators, which is
not -- also not a brand-new
thing. This has been -- putting

27:24.877 --> 27:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aside for a moment whether CNBC
did the job they could have
done, the moderators are often

27:28.180 --> 27:29.915 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the targets.

27:29.915 --> 27:34.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: There is a history of
going after the liberal media

27:34.052 --> 27:37.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elites or going after the
moderator or complaining about
the questions or how much time
you're

27:37.523 --> 27:42.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting right in the middle of
the debate and after the debate.

27:42.327 --> 27:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what we should talk
about though is that this letter
that that maybe is falling

27:48.233 --> 27:52.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
apart, this effort for campaigns
to negotiate directly with the
networks is actually trying

27:52.271 --> 27:57.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take it back to the way it
was in 2012 and 2008, when the
networks would go to the

27:57.943 --> 28:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidates and say, we would
like to have a debate, let's
talk.

28:02.281 --> 28:07.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What happened this time is, the
Republican Party, the RNC was
trying to protect the candidates

28:07.986 --> 28:14.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the mess that was the
debates in 2012. They were
trying to create a system that
would

28:14.126 --> 28:18.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protect the candidates. And now
the candidates are saying, this
protection you offered, we

28:18.797 --> 28:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
don't know if we like it either.

28:21.633 --> 28:25.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It should be said
that a lot of the things in this
letter look a lot like

28:25.237 --> 28:29.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the kind of guarantees that you
get in the general election
debates, whether there are

28:29.074 --> 28:31.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reverse shots, whether -- this
is not all brand-new. This
question is whether these

28:31.777 --> 28:33.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
guys can all agree.

28:33.912 --> 28:35.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the general election debates,
there are just two camps that
have to agree.

28:35.447 --> 28:35.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

28:35.747 --> 28:37.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

28:37.382 --> 28:42.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I want to ask a
little bit about Jeb Bush. It's
generally agreed, even he says

28:42.487 --> 28:45.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he didn't do as well as he
could have in this debate.

28:45.357 --> 28:49.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's listen to what he had to
say today on his new reboot. He
went to Tampa, Florida.

28:49.761 --> 28:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: Take off the suit
coat, ditch the glasses, get

28:54.666 --> 28:56.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rid of the purple striped tie.

28:56.201 --> 28:56.668 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:56.668 --> 28:58.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

28:58.704 --> 29:08.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEB BUSH: I like the tie. I like
this tie. It only costs 20
bucks.

29:08.614 --> 29:10.549 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:10.549 --> 29:15.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEB BUSH: Some advice is more
strategic. Nail that zinger, be
angrier, hide your inner wonk.

29:15.921 --> 29:16.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:16.989 --> 29:19.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEB BUSH: I can't be
something I'm not.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

29:21.893 --> 29:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEB BUSH: The campaign trail is
littered with candidates
disguised as television critics,

29:28.166 --> 29:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
politicians echoing poll-tested
pabulum, but leadership is
something far different.

29:33.305 --> 29:36.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I especially liked
the lady with the Jeb sticker on
her forehead.

29:36.241 --> 29:38.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: That would
be hard to get off.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, there was a
lot of -- well, that was
enthusiastic and there was a lot

29:40.946 --> 29:44.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of enthusiasm in that room. And
that is what he was going for, I
take it.

29:44.182 --> 29:48.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, and he
had enthusiasm in the room.

29:48.687 --> 29:53.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Enthusiasm on the Internet, not
so much. You saw there this Jeb
can fix it. It became a

29:53.258 --> 29:56.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hashtag. They wanted it to be a
hashtag. I don't know that what
the campaign wanted is

29:56.928 --> 30:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what they got, which is people
on the Internet sort of making
fun of Jeb Bush all day. This

30:01.600 --> 30:05.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is his relaunch and people are
there on Twitter saying,
#JebBushcanfixit with all kinds
of

30:05.971 --> 30:08.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
goofy Photoshops.

30:08.306 --> 30:12.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Jeb Bush told our
buddy Chuck Todd at NBC over the
weekend that he's a grinder,

30:12.544 --> 30:14.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is not quite the same
thing as being a joyful
candidate.

30:14.379 --> 30:17.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Well,
that is very true.

30:17.049 --> 30:21.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the problem for Jeb Bush is
not his glasses or his tie or
his suit jacket. It's his last

30:21.787 --> 30:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
name, which he can't do anything
about, and it's his message,
which just isn't with the

30:24.690 --> 30:28.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time that we're in.

30:28.026 --> 30:32.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, this has been a problem
from the very beginning. Voters
have said we don't like

30:32.230 --> 30:36.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- Republican voters -- we don't
like the idea of a Bush name.
They don't like the legacy

30:36.702 --> 30:41.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing. They think he's part of
this dynasty. So, he's already
working on that.

30:41.106 --> 30:46.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then his message -- he says that
his message is, I'm a fixer, I'm
a doer, I have experience.

30:46.411 --> 30:52.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you look at the most recent
poll that came out from Pew
Research, they asked Republican

30:52.084 --> 30:54.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
primary voters, do you want
somebody who's been experienced
or do you want somebody who

30:54.286 --> 30:57.656 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
is new and fresh
and has new ideas?

30:57.656 --> 31:03.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The experienced, proven
candidate, only 29 percent of
Republicans wanted that; 65
percent

31:03.128 --> 31:06.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Republicans said they wanted
somebody new and different. So
he's selling something that

31:06.064 --> 31:09.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
right now voters aren't
saying that they want.

31:09.568 --> 31:12.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's turn to the
Democrats for a moment, because
we have seen Bernie Sanders

31:12.237 --> 31:13.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hired a pollster.

31:13.071 --> 31:15.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

31:15.407 --> 31:21.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This is their
outsider. Hired a pollster and
has also put out his first

31:21.446 --> 31:25.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
biographical ad in which he
tells you a little about his
background. And he uses the
"TIME"

31:25.650 --> 31:30.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
magazine cover in which he says,
socialists -- call himself a
socialist.

31:30.489 --> 31:33.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he's trying to tell
people what, Tamara?

31:33.258 --> 31:36.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: First, he is
trying to tell people that he's
something of an unconventional

31:36.495 --> 31:38.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidate.

31:38.063 --> 31:44.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what I get from this ad.
The tone is very different from
sort of gauzy bio ads

31:44.436 --> 31:47.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where you get to know the
candidate. There is sort of at
hyper-speed. This is all you

31:47.639 --> 31:51.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
need to know about 40
years of Bernie Sanders.

31:51.076 --> 31:55.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You notice the long, lingering
shot on Martin Luther King. He's
definitely sending a signal

31:55.847 --> 32:00.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there. He was all in with the
civil rights movement. He wants
people to know that. And

32:00.819 --> 32:05.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then at the end of the ad, there
are these sweeping images of him
surrounded by these

32:05.123 --> 32:12.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
massive crowds and there's the
energy that he's been generating
all over the country,

32:12.030 --> 32:16.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and also a tag line that says
something like an honest leader,
which, although he isn't

32:16.935 --> 32:20.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
explicitly making a contrast,
certainly, Hillary Clinton has
had some issues in the polls
with

32:20.038 --> 32:22.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
honesty and trustworthy issues.

32:22.874 --> 32:27.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is he making an
appeal for Hillary Clinton's
voters, or is he trying to do
what

32:27.045 --> 32:30.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they always say they are going
to do, which is energize a
brand-new class of voter?

32:30.682 --> 32:34.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: No, he needs to
introduce himself to people that
don't know him very well. This

32:34.019 --> 32:39.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was definitely about going for
those voters that are very
unaware of who Bernie Sanders

32:39.024 --> 32:43.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, and specifically voters who
are African-American, voters who
are Latino.

32:43.361 --> 32:48.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you noticed, the
introduction, he remarks on the
fact that his parent, his father
was

32:48.300 --> 32:53.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an immigrant to this country,
the fact that they're trying to
make him a three-dimensional

32:53.004 --> 32:59.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
character. He is a granddad,
he's a father, he's more than
just the caricature we saw

32:59.945 --> 33:04.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on "Saturday Night Live" who
likes to pound on the podium.
There's much more there.

33:04.216 --> 33:08.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He knows he needs to broaden his
appear beyond just a white
liberal base. This was trying

33:08.620 --> 33:11.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to get beyond that in
the Democratic primary.

33:11.122 --> 33:13.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's almost like he
takes Hillary Clinton's one
grandchild and multiplies it

33:13.158 --> 33:13.892 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by...

33:13.892 --> 33:16.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: By seven.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: By seven, and makes
the point that if you like that
about her, you will

33:18.196 --> 33:20.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like all of this about me, too.

33:20.365 --> 33:23.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is she reacting in any way that
we know or is she just staying
low?

33:23.535 --> 33:26.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: She's
staying low, I think.

33:26.171 --> 33:30.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, there's a new Web ad
where -- or not Web ad, but Web
video on Facebook where

33:30.475 --> 33:34.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
she's talking about her
granddaughter, Charlotte, who
learned how to say grandma.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I get the feeling
we're going to be hearing a lot
about Charlotte as the

33:36.181 --> 33:37.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
campaign goes on.

33:37.482 --> 33:38.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: It won't
be the last time.

33:38.617 --> 33:39.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: It won't
be the last time.

33:39.951 --> 33:42.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tamara Keith, Amy Walter,
thank you both very much.

33:42.921 --> 33:47.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Thanks.

33:47.893 --> 33:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

33:55.567 --> 34:03.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn now to
Turkey, a nation at the
forefront of the refugee crisis
and

34:03.141 --> 34:07.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a critical and often problematic
partner to the U.S. in the
American-led coalition against

34:07.245 --> 34:10.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Islamic State.

34:10.248 --> 34:15.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The country has been in
political limbo since June's
election there failed to produce
a

34:15.353 --> 34:21.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clear-cut winner. That all
changed last night, when
President Recep Erdogan's party
emerged

34:21.226 --> 34:26.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
victorious in Sunday's snap
election. Supporters say the win
is a return to stability.

34:26.731 --> 34:31.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant reports, others
fear the results are a giant

34:31.369 --> 34:36.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
step towards autocratic rule.

34:36.408 --> 34:45.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The call to
prayer rang out around Central
Istanbul today, reinforcing

34:45.116 --> 34:50.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the message that after five
months of political instability,
Turkey is now back on a familiar

34:50.555 --> 34:55.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
track, under the firm control of
the Islamic A.K., or A.K. Party,
founded by president

34:55.293 --> 34:58.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

34:58.930 --> 35:03.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Political analysts here believe
most Turks rejected the
opposition parties because they

35:03.468 --> 35:07.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
needed a sense of security
during a dangerous time. But not
everyone in Taksim Square was

35:07.839 --> 35:09.741 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happy.

35:09.741 --> 35:17.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Like I said, personally,
I'm upset about what is going
on. You don't have to be asking

35:17.382 --> 35:24.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
normal citizens. I think
everybody knows about how
democracy goes on here in
Turkey, so many

35:24.723 --> 35:30.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prisoners. You can't say what
you're thinking, exactly. I
don't feel free. I'm also a bit

35:30.862 --> 35:33.365 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
scared.

35:33.365 --> 35:37.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): I
think our people selected
stability once again. And I
think

35:37.168 --> 35:40.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they decided well with a
single-party government again.

35:40.905 --> 35:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: As the A.K.
Party celebrated last night, the
prime minister urged his
parliamentarians

35:46.678 --> 35:51.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to employ humility, instead of
triumphalism. President Erdogan
wasn't giving much away

35:51.182 --> 35:53.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about his intentions today.

35:53.918 --> 35:59.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through translator):
The national will manifested

35:59.391 --> 36:05.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
itself on November 1 in favor of
stability. After the short-term
developments, the national

36:05.196 --> 36:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will decided that there is no
way out other than choosing
stability. They decided in favor

36:10.335 --> 36:14.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of stability. I hope this
outcome will be good for our
people and our country.

36:14.939 --> 36:19.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But
international observers
complained about election
irregularities.

36:19.744 --> 36:23.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Representing European election
monitors, Andreas Gross urged
President Erdogan to end
Turkey's

36:23.882 --> 36:26.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
divisions and to be
less authoritarian.

36:26.518 --> 36:31.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREAS GROSS, European Election
Monitor: Fear is the enemy of
democracy, enemy of free

36:31.723 --> 36:39.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
choice. And in this sense, we
are disappointed of the quality
of the process. And in light

36:39.731 --> 36:45.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this, it is even more vital
that this is an appeal that the
president works in the

36:45.003 --> 36:49.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
future for a more inclusive
political process.

36:49.541 --> 36:53.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Leading Turkish
political analyst Cengiz Aktar
believes President Erdogan

36:53.978 --> 36:58.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is now on course to get a
referendum aimed at boosting his
executive powers.

36:58.383 --> 37:04.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CENGIZ AKTAR, Political Analyst:
If this man has a role model in
the world, it's probably

37:04.122 --> 37:11.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vladimir Putin. So I think he
will run by decree. He will just
use the Parliament when

37:11.663 --> 37:21.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he needs to use the Parliament,
and he will put in practice his
ideas and ideology that

37:21.706 --> 37:25.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he thinks is the right thing for
this country and for the people
of this country, without

37:25.710 --> 37:29.714 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
asking anything to anyone.

37:29.714 --> 37:34.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But Etyen
Mahcupyan, a senior adviser to
the prime minister, predicts
that

37:34.719 --> 37:39.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Turkish Muslims will not
tolerate President Erdogan
emulating his Russian
counterpart,

37:39.757 --> 37:44.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and believes their relationship
with the A.K. Party is key to
Turkey's future success.

37:44.496 --> 37:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ETYEN MAHCUPYAN, Senior Adviser:
If democracy is right for this
country, it will arrive

37:48.466 --> 37:55.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through the hands of the Islamic
community, the conservative
community. And as long as

37:55.006 --> 38:01.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this party alone can talk to
them, can carry their voices and
so on and so forth, it will

38:01.613 --> 38:04.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be through our party.

38:04.949 --> 38:09.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Political
analysts expect to see a new
self-confidence from the Turkish

38:09.921 --> 38:14.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government. They don't expect
any change in the policy
regarding refugees. The A.K.
Party

38:14.559 --> 38:18.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will continue to press ahead
with efforts to join the
European Union.

38:18.730 --> 38:23.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As far as the United States is
concerned, they say that the
most important thing is

38:23.067 --> 38:27.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Turkey will insist on
having a big say in what happens
in Syria.

38:27.172 --> 38:34.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant in Istanbul.

38:34.312 --> 38:46.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now another addition
to the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

38:46.858 --> 38:52.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the U.S. steps up military
efforts against the Islamic
State in Syria, a question
persists:

38:52.530 --> 38:58.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did this extremely brutal
group emerge so rapidly? A new
book offers one answer,

38:58.636 --> 39:04.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"The ISIS Apocalypse: The
History, Strategy, and Doomsday
Vision of the Islamic State."

39:04.175 --> 39:08.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its author is early Islam
historian William McCants,
senior fellow and project
director

39:08.246 --> 39:10.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at the Brookings Institution.

39:10.815 --> 39:13.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spoke recently with chief
foreign affairs correspondent
Margaret Warner.

39:13.918 --> 39:17.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Will
McCants, welcome.

39:17.956 --> 39:21.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You suggest right at the
beginning of the book that it
was triggered in a way by a
question

39:21.626 --> 39:25.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your father asked, which is, why
do they do that? Is that what
this book is, an answer

39:25.230 --> 39:26.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for that?

39:26.864 --> 39:26.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS, Author, "The
ISIS Apocalypse: The History,
Strategy, and Doomsday Vision

39:26.397 --> 39:27.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the Islamic State":
That's right.

39:27.765 --> 39:33.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My dad is 85 years old. And like
most Americans, he watches the
news and he can't understand

39:33.738 --> 39:38.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why a group like the Islamic
State is so brutal to people and
why they would be so extreme

39:38.042 --> 39:41.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their actions. So, it's for
him that I -- and people like
him that I wrote this book.

39:41.879 --> 39:46.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: So, you, as
your title says, chalk that up
to its apocalyptic vision. What

39:46.451 --> 39:47.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is that vision?

39:47.719 --> 39:49.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: That's right.

39:49.621 --> 39:53.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Islamic State believes that
the end of the world is
approaching and it believes that

39:53.825 --> 39:58.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it has also reestablished God's
kingdom on Earth. And that
kingdom is going to wage an

39:58.062 --> 40:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
epic battle against the infidels
before it all comes tumbling
down.

40:02.166 --> 40:06.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And that drives
them, what, with a special sense
of urgency?

40:06.437 --> 40:09.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: Gives them a
special sense of urgency, but
also has been terrific for

40:09.974 --> 40:12.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recruiting.

40:12.910 --> 40:17.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been able to attract a
lot of foreigners to their cause
and many of the foreigners,

40:17.682 --> 40:21.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
based on interviews with
journalists, say that the main
reason they're there is because

40:21.886 --> 40:25.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they believe that the world is
coming to an end and the Islamic
State is a fulfillment

40:25.356 --> 40:28.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of prophecy. So, they're
traveling there to do their bit.

40:28.993 --> 40:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Now, many of
these recruits, at least --
especially the Westerners, those

40:32.897 --> 40:36.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have reported on, they aren't
religious at all. And they
certainly aren't scholars

40:36.801 --> 40:41.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of Islam. Why would this
prophecy of the end of days be
appealing to them?

40:41.906 --> 40:46.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: No, many of
them don't know much about
Islamic scripture. And they are

40:46.210 --> 40:50.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not particularly religious, many
of them, but they are
intoxicated by the idea of
fighting

40:50.815 --> 40:54.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an end-times battle and
absolving their own sins.

40:54.719 --> 41:00.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first crusaders that set out
to take over Jerusalem were also
fired by the same sort

41:00.091 --> 41:02.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of visions, even though many of
them weren't very religious.

41:02.960 --> 41:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Now, how does
the really horrific brutality
and way they publicize

41:08.933 --> 41:13.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it in these videos, how does
that play a part, or why is that
part of it?

41:13.604 --> 41:17.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: For many
apocalyptic groups throughout
history, not just Muslim ones,

41:17.809 --> 41:22.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the apocalypse can be excuse for
very extreme violence, because
the normal rules don't apply.

41:22.714 --> 41:27.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in a number of these videos
of members committing horrible
acts, they will make reference

41:27.719 --> 41:31.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the fact that they are
fulfilling prophecy.

41:31.022 --> 41:35.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: They even talk
about a small town in Syria near
the Turkish border named

41:35.059 --> 41:35.693 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Dabiq?

41:35.693 --> 41:36.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: That's right.

41:36.694 --> 41:38.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: What is that?

41:38.496 --> 41:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: Yes. There's a
tiny town just north of Aleppo
that one Muslim prophecy

41:42.266 --> 41:47.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says will be the site of a
massive battle with the
infidels.

41:47.271 --> 41:50.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the Islamic State last
year made sure to take over the
town in preparation for that

41:50.508 --> 41:52.577 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
battle.

41:52.577 --> 41:57.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: You also say
that the turmoil in the Middle
East over the last 15 years

41:57.181 --> 42:01.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has given evidence at, least to
the leaders of the Islamic
State, that the end of the

42:01.552 --> 42:02.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
days is near.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: That's right.

42:05.957 --> 42:11.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Extreme violence, political
upheaval invites this kind of
apocalyptic framework, where

42:11.195 --> 42:16.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more stable times wouldn't. It
also provides the opportunity
for groups like the Islamic

42:16.367 --> 42:21.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State to take advantage of the
chaos in order to try and
fulfill prophecy.

42:21.205 --> 42:25.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And so both
invasions by the United States
would count as part of that,

42:25.309 --> 42:29.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
civil and sectarian conflicts,
like we're seeing in Syria,
Iraq?

42:29.547 --> 42:33.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: That's right.
That's right. And particularly
Sunni Muslims, apocalyptic

42:33.451 --> 42:37.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thinking became much more
popular after 2003, when the
U.S. invaded Iraq.

42:37.789 --> 42:41.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Now, you have
translated a lot of original
documents both from the

42:41.526 --> 42:45.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Koran and from the Prophet
Mohammed's prophecies.

42:45.630 --> 42:50.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
To what degree is this
apocalyptic vision really
supported by those?

42:50.001 --> 42:53.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: There are some
prophecies mentioned in the
Koran, but mainly these come

42:53.805 --> 42:58.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from statements that are
attributed to Mohammed, which
many conservative Muslims regard
as

42:58.042 --> 43:01.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a scripture second
only to the Koran.

43:01.379 --> 43:04.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, early Islamic scripture is
filled with these kind of
prophecies.

43:04.582 --> 43:07.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And they
really are at the heart of it?

43:07.251 --> 43:11.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: They are. And
for many Muslims, they are very
important, particularly when

43:11.656 --> 43:16.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is political upheaval in
the countries in which they
live.

43:16.227 --> 43:21.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And then what
about the leader of this Islamic
State, the caliph, he's
proclaimed

43:21.632 --> 43:25.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
himself, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?
Did you get a sense of whether
he really believes this

43:25.803 --> 43:28.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or is it just a ticket to power?

43:28.806 --> 43:34.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: He is a
religious scholar by training.
From his early days, his
nickname

43:34.846 --> 43:42.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was the believer, because he had
a very strict type of piety. And
there has been nothing

43:42.220 --> 43:46.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's come to light so far to
suggest that he's using these
prophecies cynically.

43:46.724 --> 43:49.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: This represents
really a sea change. I think you
called it a changing

43:49.427 --> 43:51.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the guards in the
jihadist movement.

43:51.062 --> 43:53.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: That's right.

43:53.331 --> 43:57.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Al-Qaida used to downplay these
kind of prophecies. And they
would put off state -- the kind
of

43:57.835 --> 44:03.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state-building that the Islamic
State is engaged in. The Islamic
State plays up these prophecies

44:03.040 --> 44:08.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and uses them to motivate
fighters for the exact task of
state building. And given the

44:08.012 --> 44:11.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political instability in the
Arab world, I think we are going
to see much more of it.

44:11.415 --> 44:14.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: So
there's no going back?

44:14.085 --> 44:16.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: No, there's no
going back. It's an idea whose
time has come for the jihadist

44:16.554 --> 44:17.922 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
movement.

44:17.922 --> 44:22.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Then what
recourse is there for the U.S.
and its allies?

44:22.026 --> 44:26.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: They have to
contain the problem. It's not
going to be possible to

44:26.197 --> 44:29.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
put this genie back
in the bottle.

44:29.400 --> 44:35.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And what would
it take to resolve these
sectarian conflicts?

44:35.039 --> 44:40.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: Well,
fundamentally, it's going to
require some tough political
deals.

44:40.044 --> 44:45.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The disenfranchisement of the
Sunnis is what the Islamic State
thrives on. And until those

44:45.616 --> 44:49.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sunnis are brought back into the
political process, groups like
the Islamic State will

44:49.453 --> 44:51.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
continue to thrive.

44:51.589 --> 44:54.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And the U.S.
will play very little role in
that?

44:54.292 --> 44:57.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: That's right,
because most of the Americans'
partners in the regions

44:57.428 --> 45:00.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have higher priorities than the
destruction of the Islamic
State.

45:00.531 --> 45:03.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Will
McCants, thank you.

45:03.701 --> 45:12.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM MCCANTS: Thank you.

45:12.777 --> 45:19.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
a most unusual autobiography
about a life in rock 'n' roll

45:19.617 --> 45:22.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and beyond.

45:22.787 --> 45:27.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Elvis Costello talks about his
new memoir, "Unfaithful Music
and Disappearing Ink."

45:27.892 --> 45:31.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has the
story from New York.

45:31.829 --> 45:38.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Early in his new
memoir, Elvis Costello writes
about his father, Ross McManus,

45:38.135 --> 45:42.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to make it in Liverpool
as a bebop jazz musician.

45:42.139 --> 45:46.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELVIS COSTELLO, Musician: I have
a clipping that I reproduce in
the book where it says,

45:46.344 --> 45:50.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Ross McManus Quintet direct
from their engagements in Paris
and London. And at that

45:50.781 --> 45:51.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time, I don't think they had
actually played across the...

45:51.916 --> 45:52.483 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

45:52.483 --> 45:54.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Never
happened, right?

45:54.418 --> 45:55.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELVIS COSTELLO: No, they had
never been out of the
neighborhood.

45:55.686 --> 45:57.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, he was
sort of making it up.

45:57.989 --> 46:01.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELVIS COSTELLO: Well, that was
good. That was the dream of it,
to do that.

46:01.192 --> 46:08.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The father would
go on to a successful singing
career with one of Britain's

46:08.332 --> 46:16.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leading dance bands, doing cover
songs of popular music, even
folk songs like "If I

46:16.741 --> 46:22.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Had a Hammer."

46:22.013 --> 46:35.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The son, born Declan MacManus,
would become one of the leading
rockers of his time, emerging

46:35.092 --> 46:38.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the late 1970s as a kind of
nerdy-looking, language-loving,
angry young songwriter and

46:38.262 --> 46:45.403 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
singer.

46:45.403 --> 46:49.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was pegged back then as part
of the folk scene. But when we
talked recently at New

46:49.807 --> 46:54.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
York's famous Village Vanguard,
a nod to his jazz-loving dad,
recently, Costello said he

46:54.178 --> 46:57.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
never saw himself that way.

46:57.448 --> 47:03.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELVIS COSTELLO: I think, early
on, I had worked out that if I
adopted a sort of less
cooperative

47:03.788 --> 47:06.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
personality when speaking to
people, they would leave me
alone. And I would just be

47:06.123 --> 47:06.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
able to get...

47:06.424 --> 47:06.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

47:06.991 --> 47:08.959 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
JEFFREY BROWN:
Simple as that, huh?

47:08.959 --> 47:12.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELVIS COSTELLO: I just created
this character accidentally. And
then I realized, hey, that

47:12.530 --> 47:12.963 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
works.

47:12.963 --> 47:14.965 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

47:14.965 --> 47:18.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELVIS COSTELLO: It gets kind of
tedious to kind of keep it up,
because then you can never

47:18.469 --> 47:21.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drop it down. You can never drop
it down and just laugh, you
know?

47:21.806 --> 47:23.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, that's what
I'm wondering. But you think of
it as a character?

47:23.874 --> 47:25.710 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

47:25.710 --> 47:28.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ELVIS COSTELLO: Not in a
calculated way. It just happened
spontaneously. And then you

47:28.913 --> 47:31.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see the effect and then you
play into the effect. But...

47:31.382 --> 47:36.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The book sort of
tells the story of you becoming
more yourself or allowing

47:36.320 --> 47:41.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yourself to be less of that
character and more who you
actually are?

47:41.125 --> 47:48.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELVIS COSTELLO: I think it's a
process of, you know, adventure,
misadventure, you know,

47:48.265 --> 47:54.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
failure personally, and then
realizing that you can't keep
doing -- you know, it's not

47:54.004 --> 48:01.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like I'm denying the nature of
the songs, but just carrying on
like that was just tiring.

48:01.011 --> 48:07.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just like you run out of
drinks to drink, you know, that
kind of thing? And then there

48:07.251 --> 48:10.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were just other songs to sing
and other lives to live.

48:10.788 --> 48:15.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Over the years,
other songs came, many of them,
as Costello took on a

48:15.693 --> 48:44.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wide range of other styles of
music, an album with Burt
Bacharach, one with a string
quartet,

48:44.688 --> 48:48.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and much more to this day.

48:48.092 --> 48:54.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it began, he writes, at home
as a child, when his father was
passing on records that

48:54.632 --> 48:59.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was listening to for his own
work and both parents had
eclectic tastes.

48:59.837 --> 49:04.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELVIS COSTELLO: I didn't study
any French, so I didn't know the
word genre. You know,

49:04.108 --> 49:09.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so I didn't have sort of a sense
of there being different kinds
of music.

49:09.980 --> 49:15.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my dad would get passions
for Bach and we would listen all
to the Bach passion, and

49:15.419 --> 49:22.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then the Clancy Brothers and
Irish music. And my mother loved
singers like Sinatra and

49:22.927 --> 49:28.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ella Fitzgerald. So I heard all
those songs, as well as all the
1960s pop music that came

49:28.065 --> 49:33.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out, whether it would be from
England like the Beatles or from
America like Motown.

49:33.003 --> 49:37.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was all just flowing
through. And it didn't seem like
you had to choose.

49:37.441 --> 49:42.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What about when
it came to performing and
putting yourself forward?
There's

49:42.313 --> 49:46.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the -- and even taking a new
name, right, and not only just a
new name, but a very big

49:46.250 --> 49:47.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
name, Elvis.

49:47.117 --> 49:49.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELVIS COSTELLO: Yes.

49:49.386 --> 49:55.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I just felt, well, my
family name, McManus, is hard to
say on the telephone. It didn't

49:55.259 --> 50:00.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look very attractive written
down. It sort of suggested a guy
in a cable-knit sweater

50:00.331 --> 50:05.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
singing waling songs. And so I
wanted something a little
groovier.

50:05.169 --> 50:10.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I had adopted that part. And
in addition, my father had made
records in the '60s under

50:10.574 --> 50:14.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assumed names, because he had
made money on the side from his
contracted gig as a dance

50:14.545 --> 50:15.112 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
band singer.

50:15.112 --> 50:16.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

50:16.747 --> 50:18.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELVIS COSTELLO: He had made
records under the names Frank
Bacon and the Baconeers and

50:18.983 --> 50:19.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hal Prince and the Layabouts.

50:19.783 --> 50:21.118 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

50:21.118 --> 50:23.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, you're used
to taking on any names, but...

50:23.520 --> 50:25.022 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

50:25.022 --> 50:26.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELVIS COSTELLO: Seemed like, in
the noble showbiz, tradition, if
you're going to, you

50:26.457 --> 50:28.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
know -- I mean, you know.

50:28.659 --> 50:32.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The memoir moves
back and forth through time,
connecting, as Costello told

50:32.630 --> 50:37.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me, moments, experiences,
revelations.

50:37.201 --> 50:42.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's all there, the way up
working with many of today's
great musicians and the many

50:42.306 --> 50:46.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
downs, broken marriages, too
much drinking, a loss of control
over what he wanted to be

50:46.443 --> 50:48.212 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doing.

50:48.212 --> 50:53.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELVIS COSTELLO: You can be
addicted to misery the same way
as you can be addicted to drugs.

50:53.183 --> 50:54.385 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

50:54.385 --> 50:57.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you felt
yourself addicted to misery in a
sense?

50:57.788 --> 51:03.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELVIS COSTELLO: I am a fairly
decent, dark-dispositioned
person, have been, but you can
-- it can start

51:03.127 --> 51:07.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to like it, rather than sort of
try to think, well, yes, I'm --
I was fine being a skeptic,

51:07.231 --> 51:10.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but then when you start to
settle for that, then it's not
very good.

51:10.234 --> 51:14.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But he also sings
of happier times, including his
marriage to the jazz

51:14.438 --> 51:32.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
singer Diana Krall. The two have
twin 8-year-old sons. And he
brings the story full circle

51:32.890 --> 51:36.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the death of his
father four years ago.

51:36.093 --> 51:41.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELVIS COSTELLO: His passing was
poignant, in the way that I
related it, because he had

51:41.332 --> 51:46.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been a very vivid personality,
and the nature of his demise was
through Parkinson's and

51:46.403 --> 51:51.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the dementia that came with
that, erasing his senses little
by little, of which music

51:51.108 --> 51:55.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was about the last companion,
which was very, very moving for
me.

51:55.546 --> 51:58.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Was that
part of the impetus, though, for
you to write this book?

51:58.816 --> 52:02.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELVIS COSTELLO: Well, I think
the impetus to get it finished
in a form that you now

52:02.786 --> 52:03.520 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
see it.

52:03.520 --> 52:05.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

52:05.489 --> 52:07.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELVIS COSTELLO: Certainly,
because I was able to talk with
him with clarity in the -- as

52:07.958 --> 52:10.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I saw him shutting down.

52:10.260 --> 52:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, at the end, I felt
like I had the responsibility
while it was still clear in

52:16.600 --> 52:21.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my mind to get it on the page
for anybody that -- anybody that
in -- and anybody interested

52:21.605 --> 52:25.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in how I came to do what I did.
But for that -- even if I had
never published it, I would

52:25.943 --> 52:30.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have written it for my sons, you
know, because I am the last,
best witness.

52:30.514 --> 52:32.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
"Unfaithful Music and
Disappearing Ink."

52:32.983 --> 52:33.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Elvis Costello, thank you.
