JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:06.073 --> 00:07.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.841 --> 00:11.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: a
dangerous search
for answers among the blackened
ruins of a

00:11.178 --> 00:17.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warehouse fire in Oakland,
California, where
at least 36 people died, and
digging for more

00:18.018 --> 00:20.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
remains goes on.

00:20.120 --> 00:26.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: President-elect Donald
Trump's team
expands, as Dr. Ben Carson is
tapped for housing

00:26.693 --> 00:28.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
secretary.

00:28.495 --> 00:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our Politics Monday team on the
latest in
the transition, plus questions
about the Trump

00:32.966 --> 00:35.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
approach to China.

00:35.369 --> 00:40.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we sit down with former
British Prime
Minister Tony Blair to ask why
he's pushing

00:40.374 --> 00:42.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a movement in the political
center.

00:42.142 --> 00:47.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY BLAIR, Former British Prime
Minister:
It's really about linking up
people who look

00:47.180 --> 00:51.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at what is happening in the
world, know that
the world needs change, and not
the status

00:51.451 --> 00:56.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quo, don't want the center to be
a place where
we're just managing the status
quo, but instead

00:56.256 --> 00:58.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where we're really articulating
change.

00:58.158 --> 00:59.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And:

01:00.027 --> 01:03.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED BIDWELL, Art Collector:
This is more
art than the human mind could
possibly perceive.

01:03.830 --> 01:09.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As Art Basel
wraps up in Miami,
Jeffrey Brown offers a look
inside the nation's

01:09.836 --> 01:12.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
largest art fair.

01:12.205 --> 01:19.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:19.046 --> 01:21.815 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:21.848 --> 01:31.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The death toll
keeps rising
in that warehouse fire in
Oakland, California,

01:31.959 --> 01:33.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to at least 36.

01:33.794 --> 01:38.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The building erupted into flames
Friday night
during a dance party.

01:38.065 --> 01:43.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Search efforts resumed today
amid charred
debris, after workers were given
time to shore

01:43.337 --> 01:45.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up one of the weakened walls.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHNNA WATSON, Oakland Police
Spokeswoman:
The search resumed approximately
9:00 a.m.

01:48.976 --> 01:49.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this morning, yes.

01:49.977 --> 01:52.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So work does continue inside the
building.

01:52.946 --> 01:57.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They continue to be very
careful, very tedious,
very mindful.

01:57.884 --> 02:05.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This scene is being managed with
a lot of
care and a lot of thought.

02:05.492 --> 02:10.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Oakland fire
is now the
deadliest building fire in the
U.S. in more

02:10.197 --> 02:12.065 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than 10 years.

02:12.099 --> 02:15.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will take a closer look at
how the community
is coping with the disaster
right after the

02:15.869 --> 02:17.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
news summary.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Team Trump has added another
Cabinet nominee.

02:20.407 --> 02:25.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Ben Carson has been selected
as the choice
to oversee the Department of
Housing and Urban

02:25.512 --> 02:26.813 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Development.

02:26.847 --> 02:30.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins begins our
coverage of today's
transition news.

02:30.484 --> 02:36.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Early in the
GOP primaries,
Ben Carson was Donald Trump's
closest competition.

02:36.656 --> 02:40.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now he's the pick as housing
chief.

02:40.360 --> 02:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two became allies after
Carson left the
race, and, in September, with
Carson showed

02:46.466 --> 02:50.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the nominee the Detroit home
where he was
raised by a single mom.

02:50.871 --> 02:55.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last month, Carson said that
background would
inform his work, should he
become housing

02:55.776 --> 02:56.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and urban development secretary:

02:56.843 --> 02:58.612 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARSON, Housing and Urban
Development
Secretary Nominee: Well, I know
that I grew

03:00.480 --> 03:05.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up in the inner city and have
spent a lot
of time there, and have dealt
with a lot of

03:05.786 --> 03:12.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
patients from that area, and
recognize that
we cannot have a strong nation
if we have

03:13.026 --> 03:14.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
weak inner cities.

03:14.494 --> 03:17.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Carson, of
course, is known
as a former neurosurgeon.

03:17.831 --> 03:24.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has no government experience,
but has commented
on housing policy before,
including criticism

03:24.337 --> 03:30.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of an Obama era requirement that
cities report
racial bias in public housing.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And he's slammed public
assistance programs
in general.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.515 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BEN CARSON: I'm really
interested in getting
rid of dependency, and I want us
to find a

03:38.685 --> 03:43.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way to allow people to excel in
our society.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.625 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

03:45.659 --> 03:48.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today,
president-elect Trump
called Carson "a brilliant mind
passionate

03:48.061 --> 03:50.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about strengthening
communities."

03:50.197 --> 03:55.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Democratic minority
leader in the
House, Nancy Pelosi, called him
a "disconcerting

03:55.969 --> 03:59.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and disturbingly unqualified
choice."

03:59.739 --> 04:05.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also today, a surprise face at
Trump Tower,
former Vice President Al Gore.

04:05.045 --> 04:10.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was scheduled to discuss
climate change
with Ivanka Trump, but her newly
elected father

04:10.484 --> 04:12.419 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
joined in.

04:12.452 --> 04:13.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AL GORE, Former Vice President
of the United
States: The bulk of the time was
with president-elect

04:13.820 --> 04:15.522 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

04:15.555 --> 04:21.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I found it an extremely
interesting conversation,
and to be continued.

04:21.661 --> 04:25.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Contrast that
with tomorrow,
when the president-elect Trump
is scheduled

04:25.065 --> 04:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to meet with Rex Tillerson.

04:26.867 --> 04:31.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The CEO of ExxonMobil has been a
target of
climate change activists.

04:31.238 --> 04:36.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now being mentioned as
possible contender
for secretary of state.

04:36.343 --> 04:39.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the meantime, some changes
for the president-elect's
family.

and her husband,
Jared Kushner, both part of the
transition

04:44.885 --> 04:48.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
team, are planning to move from
New York to
D.C.

04:48.722 --> 04:53.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also in New York today, the
Green Party's
Jill Stein, speaking in favor of
recounts

04:53.727 --> 04:58.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in key states like Michigan,
where a judge
overnight ordered a recount to
start today.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

05:01.668 --> 05:05.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There was also
more fallout
from the president-elect's phone
call with

05:05.672 --> 05:07.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the president of Taiwan.

The White House today reaffirmed
U.S. support
for the one-China policy that
says Taiwan

05:13.380 --> 05:15.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is part of China.

05:15.582 --> 05:20.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: A South
Carolina
judge declared a mistrial in a

Scott: We
are not going to tear up this
city.

05:39.973 --> 05:44.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are going to -- we are going
to keep it
just the way it is.

05:44.110 --> 05:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are going to believe in
peaceful protest,
because it didn't turn out the
way we feel,

05:50.517 --> 05:53.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but we feel like our voices need
to be heard.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Prosecutors said

Renzi handed
in his resignation today, the
latest victim

06:05.432 --> 06:08.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a populist wave across
Europe.

06:08.068 --> 06:13.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Renzi met with the country's
president a day
after voters soundly rejected
constitutional

06:13.440 --> 06:14.407 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reforms.

06:14.441 --> 06:16.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Earlier, he said has no regrets.

06:16.710 --> 06:20.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTEO RENZI, Italian Prime
Minister (through
translator): We are convincing.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I am sorry.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we are leaving without
remorse.

06:23.450 --> 06:28.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I said clearly from the
beginning, if no
wins, my experience of
government ends here.

06:28.955 --> 06:35.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sunday's outcome
boosted anti-establishment
and anti-immigrant parties in
Italy.

06:35.195 --> 06:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, moderate leaders
across Europe
welcomed the outcome of
Austria's presidential

06:40.367 --> 06:42.068 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vote.

06:42.102 --> 06:46.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A left-leaning candidate,
Alexander van der
Bellen, won Sunday's election
there.

06:46.273 --> 06:50.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had campaigned heavily to
maintain stronger
ties with Europe.

06:50.110 --> 06:55.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His far-right opponent talked of
leaving the
European Union and barring
migrants.

06:55.282 --> 07:01.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia and China today vetoed a
U.N. Security
Council resolution calling for a
seven-day

07:01.388 --> 07:04.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
truce in the Syrian city of
Aleppo.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Eleven nations supported the
measure.

07:06.993 --> 07:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. deputy ambassador to
U.N. spoke after
the vote.

MICHELE SISON, U.S. Deputy
Ambassador to the
United Nations: We had a chance
not to end,

07:14.134 --> 07:20.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but to briefly stop the ongoing
butchery in
Eastern Aleppo.

07:20.573 --> 07:25.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have failed because of a
cynical act.

07:25.078 --> 07:32.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With a wave of their hands,
Russia, China
and Venezuela showed that they
don't want

07:32.185 --> 07:34.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the suffering of Eastern Aleppo
to end.

07:34.788 --> 07:39.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, fierce
fighting
continues in Aleppo, with
government forces

07:39.092 --> 07:42.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
closing in on rebel sections.

07:42.062 --> 07:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The war in Syria is driving a

more than $22
billion for 2017.

07:51.738 --> 07:57.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Roughly a third of that would go
to help displaced
people inside Syria and those
who've fled

07:57.944 --> 07:59.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to other lands.

07:59.913 --> 08:05.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

reelection bid, after a month of
counting
absentee and provisional
ballots.

Democratic State Attorney
General Roy Cooper

08:17.864 --> 08:19.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cast.

08:19.799 --> 08:24.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street today, the
Dow Jones industrial
average gained nearly 46 points
to close at

08:24.037 --> 08:25.939 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
19216.

08:25.972 --> 08:30.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 53 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added 12.

08:30.710 --> 08:36.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
voices from
Oakland on the warehouse fire;
Tony Blair's

08:36.683 --> 08:42.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
efforts to encourage centrist
politics around
the world; global implications
as the Trump

08:42.622 --> 08:56.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
team breaks from tradition; and
much more.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Back to the Oakland warehouse
fire.

08:58.872 --> 09:04.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prosecutors moments ago said
murder charges
are possible in the case, but
didn't indicate

09:04.577 --> 09:06.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who could be charged.

09:06.413 --> 09:11.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As rescue workers continue the
painstaking
task of recovering bodies and
investigating

09:11.885 --> 09:18.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
past concerns about the
warehouse that was
consumed by fire, members of the
city's artistic

09:18.091 --> 09:22.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community are grieving and
searching for a
way forward.

09:22.228 --> 09:25.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Joanne
Jennings reports
from California.

09:25.498 --> 09:30.637 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
JOANNE JENNINGS:
Twenty-four-year-old Seung
Lee had never been to an art
warehouse party

09:30.670 --> 09:32.439 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

09:32.472 --> 09:36.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when the freelance writer
arrived at Ghost
Ship around 11:00 p.m. on Friday
night, he

09:36.543 --> 09:39.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was immediately drawn into the
scene.

09:39.145 --> 09:42.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEUNG LEE, Freelance Journalist:
It was all
antique furnitures and lumber.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it was almost like being in
the forest.

09:44.184 --> 09:49.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were corridors on the
first floor where
you could kind of sneak into
little hideaways

09:49.088 --> 09:50.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where people could lounge in
chairs.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought this would be a good
place to hang
out on a Friday night.

09:53.760 --> 09:57.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNE JENNINGS: Since there was
no bar at
the venue, Lee and his friends
decided to

09:57.630 --> 09:59.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make a run to a nearby liquor
store.

09:59.399 --> 10:07.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEUNG LEE: It could not have
taken more than
seven minutes to go down and
come back.

10:07.140 --> 10:13.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And through the front window, I
just saw thick
black smoke just coming out, and
on the side,

10:13.613 --> 10:17.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I saw a huge flame on the back
of the second
floor.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that was the fire.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOANNE JENNINGS: Lee and his six
friends all
survived.

10:21.287 --> 10:27.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEUNG LEE: I just think, what
did I do to
deserve this side of the coin
and not the

10:27.894 --> 10:30.697 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
other?

10:30.730 --> 10:32.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the hardest part.

10:32.599 --> 10:36.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I stayed three minutes
longer, if I checked
out the scene a little longer,
if I didn't

10:36.336 --> 10:41.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want liquor at the time, if I
didn't go, all
those, like, what-ifs are there.

10:41.741 --> 10:46.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK MILLER, The East Bay
Express: I have
been in buildings like that.

10:47.013 --> 10:48.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have been at parties like
that.

10:48.681 --> 10:53.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it just crushes you to think
about all
these young people that were in
there.

10:53.219 --> 10:57.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNE JENNINGS: Nick Miller is
editor of
The East Bay Express, Oakland's
alternative

10:57.690 --> 10:59.659 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weekly.

10:59.692 --> 11:05.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK MILLER: We have discovered
that, on November
13, the Code Enforcement
Department had documented

11:05.365 --> 11:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
numerous complaints, at least
10.

11:07.267 --> 11:12.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Apparently, the venue had been
operating for
two to three years as an illegal
underground

11:12.872 --> 11:18.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
venue, which means it wasn't
permitted to
do live music, it wasn't
permitted have residential

11:18.044 --> 11:19.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or anything like that.

11:19.913 --> 11:23.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNE JENNINGS: While safety
violations at
Ghost Ship were unusually
egregious, Miller

11:23.917 --> 11:27.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
estimates there are dozens of
underground
art warehouses in Oakland.

11:27.554 --> 11:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK MILLER: More than hundreds,
potentially.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no proper plumbing.

11:33.059 --> 11:36.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no smoke alarm or
sprinkler system.

11:36.629 --> 11:41.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNE JENNINGS: As the death
toll continues
to mount, the loss is felt
throughout Oakland's

11:41.801 --> 11:43.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vast, yet tight-knit artistic
community.

11:43.937 --> 11:48.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARA EDGE, Industrial Art
Entrepreneur: As
soon as the fire happened, it
was obviously

11:48.207 --> 11:53.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a dialogue about who was there
and which members
of our community are accounted
for and not

11:53.646 --> 12:00.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accounted for, and immediately
thinking about
what can be done for the victims
and the victims'

12:00.954 --> 12:02.722 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
families.

12:02.755 --> 12:06.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNE JENNINGS: Lara Edge, an
industrial
art entrepreneur, works out of
American Steel

12:06.492 --> 12:08.294 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Studios.

12:08.328 --> 12:12.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sprawling six-acre property
provides work
space for artists working on
anything from

12:12.565 --> 12:15.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
large scale Burning Man-style
industrial art
to architecture.

12:15.735 --> 12:21.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Edge is concerned about a
possible backlash
against the city's many
warehouse collectives.

12:21.374 --> 12:26.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARA EDGE: What's really needed
right now
is not blame, but a way to work
with city

12:26.079 --> 12:34.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials and not risk losing
tenancy or being
evicted by wanting to come
forward and talk

12:35.021 --> 12:37.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about safety upgrades that need
to be made.

12:37.357 --> 12:46.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not living in spaces that
are dangerous
because we're negligent people.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It costs a lot of money to do
these upgrades.

12:49.569 --> 12:53.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And also raising the red flag
means a potential
for being booted.

12:53.506 --> 12:58.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNE JENNINGS: Oakland's rapid
gentrification
has hit artists particularly
hard.

12:58.311 --> 13:03.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARA EDGE: During the first
cycle of the tech
boom years ago, artists got
pushed out of

13:03.516 --> 13:04.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
San Francisco into Oakland.

13:04.817 --> 13:07.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now Oakland is increasingly
unaffordable.

13:07.120 --> 13:11.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNE JENNINGS: The 200 people
who work out
of American Steel Studios were
faced with

13:11.658 --> 13:17.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the very real possibility of
eviction when
the property was put on the
market in 2014.

13:17.630 --> 13:22.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Last month, a new owner
purchased the compound,
and promised to preserve it for
artists, but

13:22.769 --> 13:23.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with one condition:

13:23.770 --> 13:27.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LARA EDGE: Safety upgrades had
to be made.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're primarily related to
fire.

13:29.742 --> 13:33.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this building has a steel
ceiling.

13:33.379 --> 13:39.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were gates that didn't
have manned doors
or easy egresses.

13:39.052 --> 13:44.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so all these changes had to
be made before
the new owners would buy the
building.

13:44.624 --> 13:51.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Given everything that happened
with the fire,
I'm thankful that we did that
and we do have

13:51.064 --> 13:52.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
proper exits now.

13:52.598 --> 13:56.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOANNE JENNINGS: Thankful that
this kind of
fire is unlikely to happen here.

13:56.102 --> 14:06.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Joanne Jennings
in Oakland, California.

14:06.212 --> 14:12.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Joanne Jennings
in Oakland, California.

14:12.719 --> 14:17.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This year has marked a rise in
partisan divides
the world over.

14:17.123 --> 14:22.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But former British Prime
Minister Tony Blair
is on a mission to spur citizens
across the

14:22.829 --> 14:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
globe to move toward the middle.

14:24.797 --> 14:29.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke with him earlier this
evening, and
began by asking about building
an agenda for

14:29.302 --> 14:31.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what he calls the center ground.

14:31.237 --> 14:35.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY BLAIR, Former British Prime
Minister:
What it means is, as you can see
from here

14:35.942 --> 14:43.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and from Europe at the moment,
from Britain,
there's a huge wave of
anti-establishment

14:43.282 --> 14:44.250 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
feeling.

14:44.283 --> 14:48.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's an enormous amount of
anger.

14:48.554 --> 14:57.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's collapsing governments
and political
movements across the world right
now.

14:57.597 --> 15:04.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my view is that we're
entering into a
situation of enormous
instability, insecurity,

15:04.737 --> 15:06.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fragility.

15:06.572 --> 15:12.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because I happen to believe
that the best
policy solutions lie in the
center ground,

15:12.779 --> 15:17.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then I want to see, how does the
center revitalize
itself?

15:17.083 --> 15:20.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does it develop the policy
agenda for
the future?

15:20.419 --> 15:26.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And how do we link up people who
have the
same basic ideas and attachments
to the same

15:26.359 --> 15:28.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
basic values across the world?

15:28.127 --> 15:32.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, are you
talking about creating
new political parties in the
middle?

15:32.131 --> 15:33.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TONY BLAIR: No.

15:33.933 --> 15:38.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really about linking up
people who look
at what is happening in the
world, know that

15:38.204 --> 15:42.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world needs change, and not
the status
quo, don't want the center to be
a place where

15:42.942 --> 15:47.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're just managing the status
quo, but instead
where we're really articulating
change and

15:47.814 --> 15:52.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
developing a policy agenda
that's going to
allow us to address the concerns
of people

15:52.351 --> 15:58.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
left behind by globalization
and, you know,
communities that are fragmented,
and allows

15:58.925 --> 16:04.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us also to address it in a way
which provides
answers, and not just anger.

16:04.630 --> 16:08.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, I mean, what
we see in
the United States is both
political parties

16:08.668 --> 16:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pretty fiercely jealously guard
their own
territory.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.806 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TONY BLAIR: Yes.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Republicans
don't want
to give up any ground.

16:16.042 --> 16:18.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Democrats don't want to give
up any ground.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there really room left for
something in
the middle?

16:20.346 --> 16:24.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY BLAIR: Well, there's a
necessity, I think,
because the trouble with today's
politics

16:24.884 --> 16:30.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and it's exactly the same on
the other
side of the Atlantic -- is that
people -- and

16:30.456 --> 16:35.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is partly as a result, I
think, of social
media interacting with
conventional media.

16:35.261 --> 16:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people divide into groups
where they talk
to each other, but don't talk
across the divide.

16:40.700 --> 16:45.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet most of the challenges
we face in
the world today are challenges
that are to

16:45.571 --> 16:51.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do with trade, with technology,
with how you
make sure that people are
properly educated,

16:51.110 --> 16:52.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reform your health care system.

16:52.945 --> 16:56.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are challenges that we all
share in
common.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they require practical
solutions.

16:58.951 --> 17:03.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, they may be radical,
indeed, in many
circumstances, should be, but
they need to

17:04.023 --> 17:12.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be practical, evidence-based,
and capable
of not just exploiting people's
anger or riding

17:12.164 --> 17:15.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their anger, but saying, this is
something
that's going to improve your
life.

17:15.568 --> 17:21.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, we have taken a
situation in the U.K.
because of concerns, for
example, over immigration

17:21.474 --> 17:25.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and other things, so Britain now
is on a path
out of Europe.

17:25.144 --> 17:26.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

17:26.612 --> 17:29.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TONY BLAIR: I still hope we will
ultimately
change our mind about that.

17:29.982 --> 17:30.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

17:30.983 --> 17:32.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You hope it will
be reversed?

17:32.818 --> 17:37.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY BLAIR: I think, as people
see what it
really means, and when we see
the alternative

17:37.056 --> 17:40.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
offer on the table, then I think
people may
think again.

17:40.426 --> 17:42.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I can't tell that at the
moment.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The likelihood at the moment is
we just proceed
with Brexit.

17:44.830 --> 17:49.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a huge decision that we
have taken
that's going to isolate us as a
country at

17:49.969 --> 17:52.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the very point in time when the
world is moving
closer together.

17:52.972 --> 18:00.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's a -- this for me is a
-- I have always
been in that center ground -- in
my case,

18:00.980 --> 18:02.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the center-left in politics.

18:02.682 --> 18:07.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think, right now, there is
an urgency
about it.

18:07.286 --> 18:10.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you look, for example, at
what has just
happened in Italy.

18:10.122 --> 18:11.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

18:11.991 --> 18:15.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY BLAIR: You see, in Austria,
OK, people
say, well, it's great because
the more moderate

18:15.461 --> 18:17.263 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
person won.

18:17.296 --> 18:24.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, someone with a --
frankly, a virtually
neo-Nazi battleground got almost
46 percent

18:24.170 --> 18:25.137 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the vote.

18:25.171 --> 18:26.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

18:26.172 --> 18:28.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TONY BLAIR: So, this is serious.

18:28.140 --> 18:33.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what we're
looking at in
Europe is a move away from what
was the traditional

18:33.779 --> 18:37.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
center of politics to the right.

18:37.516 --> 18:42.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why isn't that -- why isn't the
right ascendant
right now, or why don't you
believe the right

18:42.221 --> 18:44.156 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is ascendant?

18:44.190 --> 18:47.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY BLAIR: Well, it may be
ascendant in political
terms, but the question is
whether they have

18:47.493 --> 18:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
got answers to the problems
people face.

18:50.129 --> 18:54.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, if you're living in a
community that's
become fragmented and left
behind, there's

18:54.967 --> 19:02.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not proper investment in it and
so on, in
the end, the answer is to make
sure that we

19:02.742 --> 19:06.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
go and we help those
communities, we educate
the people properly, we build
the necessary

19:06.912 --> 19:09.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
infrastructure of support for
people.

19:09.081 --> 19:14.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not, in the end, stopping a
process of
globalization that isn't
ultimately a policy

19:14.920 --> 19:16.589 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of governments.

19:16.622 --> 19:19.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's driven by people, by
technology, by migration,
by the way the world's changed.

19:19.592 --> 19:24.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the risk we have is that we
close down
in the face of this.

19:24.363 --> 19:29.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, of course, as all the
history demonstrates,
you end up becoming
protectionist, isolationist.

19:29.368 --> 19:31.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You end up with even bigger
problems.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and I want
so ask you
about that, because, of course,
we have just

19:33.839 --> 19:38.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elected in the United States
Donald Trump,
who would argue, I think, that
he's somewhere

19:38.110 --> 19:39.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the center.

19:39.111 --> 19:40.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's not far right.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's certainly not far left.

19:42.381 --> 19:45.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I want to specifically ask
you, Tony Blair,
about his foreign policy moves.

19:45.985 --> 19:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had a phone call the other
day with the
president of Taiwan, which is
raising all

19:49.955 --> 19:52.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kinds of questions about the
U.S. relationship
with China.

19:52.691 --> 19:57.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has had phone calls with the
prime minister
of Pakistan, friendly phone
calls.

19:57.630 --> 20:04.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you have any observations to
make about
his early moves and what he said
about foreign

20:04.070 --> 20:05.037 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
policy?

20:05.071 --> 20:06.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TONY BLAIR: No.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.807 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

20:07.840 --> 20:09.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY BLAIR: And, I mean, the
reason for that
is, I think what -- in this
period of time,

20:09.875 --> 20:12.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would virtually discount
everything.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's wait and see what actually
happens.

20:14.413 --> 20:15.381 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And I...

20:15.414 --> 20:17.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you have
concerns, though?

20:17.349 --> 20:21.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, he talked in the
campaign about whether
NATO is necessary anymore.

20:21.954 --> 20:26.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY BLAIR: Well, I think it's
really important
that we -- that NATO's got a
vital role to

20:26.659 --> 20:27.626 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
play.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's very important that we
protect NATO.

20:29.495 --> 20:34.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm one of these people
that, once you
have had your election and you
have elected

20:34.500 --> 20:37.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
your candidate, let's see what
actually happens.

20:37.837 --> 20:41.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no point, and there's
certainly not
for me as an outsider giving a
running commentary

20:41.140 --> 20:42.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the president-elect.

20:42.942 --> 20:50.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as somebody
who's been
in the center, at the center of
policy-making

20:50.816 --> 20:57.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the West, to have a president
coming in
who's already stirring this kind
of comment

20:57.189 --> 20:58.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and controversy...

20:58.190 --> 20:59.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TONY BLAIR: Stirring is OK.

20:59.191 --> 21:01.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It just depends what happens in
the end.

21:01.193 --> 21:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, look, ultimately, this
will be decided
by what policies are adopted by
the new administration.

21:07.366 --> 21:10.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president-elect, I don't --
has not chosen
yet his secretary of state.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

21:12.037 --> 21:16.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TONY BLAIR: Actually, the choice
on defense
is...

21:16.575 --> 21:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: General Mattis.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TONY BLAIR: Yes, most people
would have a
high regard for.

21:20.446 --> 21:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I'm -- for me, let's wait
and see what
actually happens.

21:25.484 --> 21:33.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in a sense, what is more
motivating to
me is not a result in a
particular case.

21:33.692 --> 21:39.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's, what are these practical
solutions that
are going to allow us to develop
our countries

21:39.798 --> 21:45.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the way that protects the
basic liberal
democratic values and are values
that are

21:45.204 --> 21:49.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dear to me and are the essence
of the success
of our countries, in my view?

21:49.642 --> 21:54.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tony Blair,
joining us to talk
about the center ground, and
waiting and seeing

21:54.980 --> 21:56.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the president-elect, thank
you very much.

21:56.448 --> 22:01.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TONY BLAIR: Thank you.

22:01.287 --> 22:11.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:11.163 --> 22:17.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
Egypt's foreign
minister views the future Trump
administration;

22:17.136 --> 22:23.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what the halting of the Dakota
Access pipeline
means long-term; and a look
inside the nation's

22:23.209 --> 22:25.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
largest art fair.

22:25.044 --> 22:30.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, for more on the
president-elect's
call with the Taiwanese
president and the

22:30.449 --> 22:33.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
latest from the transition, it's
time for
Politics Monday.

22:33.986 --> 22:39.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining us are Amy Walter of The
Cook Political
Report, Karen Tumulty of The
Washington Post,

22:39.291 --> 22:40.492 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Geoff Dyer.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's diplomatic correspondent
for The Financial
Times.

22:42.962 --> 22:47.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has served as the paper's
Beijing bureau
chief, and he broke the story of
Mr. Trump's

22:47.166 --> 22:49.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
call with the Taiwanese leader.

22:49.435 --> 22:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all of you to the
program.

22:51.570 --> 22:54.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, a little bit of news before
we talk about
this.

22:54.506 --> 22:59.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have just seen on the wire
services that
Henry Kissinger, former
secretary of state,

23:00.012 --> 23:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Beijing to meet with the
leadership there,
is saying that he's impressed by
the -- quote

23:05.084 --> 23:11.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "calm reaction" of the
Chinese leaders
to the Trump phone call with the
president

23:11.090 --> 23:12.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Taiwan.

23:12.458 --> 23:15.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Amy Walter, why is this
causing such
a stir at this point?

23:15.327 --> 23:19.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: It's
causing such a stir because, as
we seem to

23:19.431 --> 23:24.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say every single Monday, Judy,
this is an
unconventional president doing
unconventional

23:24.637 --> 23:26.405 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

23:26.438 --> 23:30.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is not something that
the traditional
establishment would see as a
good idea to

23:31.010 --> 23:34.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do, especially when there's not
necessarily
a policy behind it.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that Tony Blair
raised this issue,
too.

23:37.349 --> 23:40.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't really know what this
actually means.

23:40.252 --> 23:46.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The call in and of itself, as
Henry Kissinger
said, hasn't created some
tremendous trouble

23:46.392 --> 23:48.127 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in China.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we don't know is
whether this is
just posturing or whether this
is a policy

23:50.963 --> 23:52.131 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

23:52.164 --> 23:55.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have heard from the Trump
transition
both sides.

23:55.301 --> 23:56.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One side says, no, this is not.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The vice president, for example,
went on television.

23:59.505 --> 24:04.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kellyanne Conway, who was his
campaign manager,
went on television, and they
said, this was

24:04.076 --> 24:05.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just a courtesy call.

24:05.210 --> 24:07.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no change in policy.

24:07.079 --> 24:11.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're reading other accounts
today that suggest
that this is about a change in
policy, the

24:11.617 --> 24:15.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president-elect had been very
tough on China
during the campaign, we're going
to see a

24:15.321 --> 24:20.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
more aggressive Trump
administration in dealing
with China.

24:20.659 --> 24:22.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we don't have an answer for
that yet.

24:22.294 --> 24:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why I think there is
all the consternation
going around.

24:25.097 --> 24:31.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Geoff Dyer, how
much of this
was planned, and how much of it
is just happenstance

24:31.403 --> 24:33.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the part of Mr. Trump?

24:33.172 --> 24:35.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEOFF DYER, The Financial Times:
As was just
said, it's very hard to tell,
actually.

24:35.307 --> 24:38.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Pence came out and said
this was a courtesy
call, which would seem that it
was just a

24:38.711 --> 24:40.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
small gesture that they're
planning to do.

24:40.579 --> 24:44.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then Donald Trump a few
hours later went
on Twitter, as is his wont, and
essentially

24:44.817 --> 24:49.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
linked the call to Taiwan with a
whole series
of things he doesn't like about
Chinese economic

24:49.254 --> 24:54.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and foreign policies and implied
that the
U.S. views of the status of
Taiwan are now

24:54.126 --> 24:58.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up for negotiation, that he
wants them to
be part of a broader negotiation
with China

24:58.364 --> 25:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about a whole series of economic
and foreign
policy issues.

25:01.066 --> 25:04.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we just don't really know
what exactly
they're planing to do with this.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Was it just about Taiwan?

25:05.337 --> 25:07.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it just because they want to
push back
a bit on Taiwan?

25:07.740 --> 25:11.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or do we see this as a way of
somehow to get
leverage for a whole series of
other issues

25:11.543 --> 25:14.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the currency, on tariffs, on
the South
China Sea?

25:14.680 --> 25:15.647 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's unclear.

25:15.681 --> 25:16.648 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

25:16.682 --> 25:17.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Excuse me.

25:17.883 --> 25:18.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Karen Tumulty, read the tea
leaves a little
bit more.

25:18.884 --> 25:20.619 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do you see?

25:20.652 --> 25:22.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY, The Washington
Post: Well,
I think that Donald Trump, how
many times

25:22.488 --> 25:26.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during the campaign did he tell
us that his
plan for dealing with foreign
policy was to

25:26.358 --> 25:27.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be unpredictable?

25:27.393 --> 25:29.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Well, there we have it.

25:29.628 --> 25:36.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, increasingly, the
evidence does
look like this wasn't just a
casual -- world

25:36.301 --> 25:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaders don't just pick up the
phone and call
each other.

25:40.472 --> 25:45.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It does appear that this was a
deliberate
move, a deliberately provocative
move.

25:46.011 --> 25:50.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it seems very much in line
with his rhetoric
during the campaign that he
intended to be

25:50.949 --> 25:52.918 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tough on China.

25:52.951 --> 25:57.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And don't forget, we have seen a
lot of presidential
candidates, memorably, Bill
Clinton, who used

25:57.322 --> 26:02.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to criticize George Herbert
Walker Bush for
coddling dictators and then take
the much

26:02.327 --> 26:07.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
softer line with China once he's
in office.

26:07.232 --> 26:11.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think Donald Trump is
signaling that that's
not going to be his way of doing
business.

26:11.804 --> 26:15.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Amy Walter,
it plays into
the other phone calls that were
reported from

26:15.574 --> 26:21.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overseas, calls, for example,
with the prime
minister of Pakistan, where he
was apparently

26:21.046 --> 26:27.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overly complimentary, in the
words of one
observer who seemed to know
about it, and

26:27.052 --> 26:31.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the broadening search apparently
now for secretary
of state.

26:31.290 --> 26:35.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this all -- how are we to
understand what's
happening right now?

26:35.194 --> 26:38.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, the other
thing that the
vice president-elect said over
the weekend

26:39.031 --> 26:44.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, look, you're going to know
about our policy
once we are in office, that
what's happening

26:44.703 --> 26:48.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right now in the transition
shouldn't be read
too deeply in to.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a lot of these calls
that we're
taking.

26:50.709 --> 26:52.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's reaching out to a lot of
folks.

26:52.578 --> 26:58.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, if you watch the Trump cam
that is positioned
in the Trump Tower, watching
people go up

26:58.050 --> 27:00.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and down the escalator, you saw
one of those
in there today was Al Gore.

27:00.519 --> 27:01.487 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

27:01.520 --> 27:02.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.389 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

27:04.423 --> 27:06.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Lots of people
coming in and out,
not necessarily indicative of
what his policy

27:06.692 --> 27:08.427 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is going to be.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To have Al Gore one day, and the
next day
the head of ExxonMobil, what
does that -- what

27:11.196 --> 27:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are you supposed to read into
that about his
stance on climate change?

27:14.833 --> 27:19.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, again, it's going
to be that
the actions that he takes are
significant.

27:19.671 --> 27:21.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know we're going to get to
this in a
second.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the people that he's putting
around him
on the Cabinet suggest that he's
putting together

27:24.643 --> 27:31.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very conservative, almost
traditionally
conservative Republican group
around him.

27:31.049 --> 27:35.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Geoff Dyer,
before we leave
foreign policy, how are the
folks in foreign

27:35.954 --> 27:40.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
capitals reading all this, when
they see with
the call with the president of
Taiwan, when

27:40.259 --> 27:44.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they read about these other
conversations
and this ongoing secretary of
state search?

27:44.730 --> 27:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEOFF DYER: Well, we had this
whole discussion
during the campaign and after
the election

27:47.666 --> 27:50.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about whether to take Trump
literally or seriously.

27:50.469 --> 27:54.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, in foreign countries, when
they see
what he's saying on Twitter
since the election

27:54.640 --> 27:57.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and seeing what he's saying in
these calls
with foreign leaders, they take
everything

27:57.476 --> 28:00.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very seriously and they take
everything very
literally.

28:00.045 --> 28:03.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, foreign governments are
going to be poring
through all these tweets looking
for -- to

28:03.849 --> 28:05.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
try and discern what it means
for foreign
policy.

28:05.984 --> 28:10.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if he thinks that just by
being unpredictable
that somehow he can have an
impact, but not

28:10.589 --> 28:13.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
necessarily commit himself to
certain things,
that's not the way it is going
to be read

28:13.525 --> 28:14.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in foreign capitals.

28:14.993 --> 28:17.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are going to take these
things very literally
and very directly.

28:17.396 --> 28:20.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, one of --
and Amy just
mentioned this, Karen, but a
meeting today

28:20.732 --> 28:25.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Al Gore, of all people, the
former vice
president, ran for president
unsuccessfully.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are -- again, what are we
to think about
all of this?

28:28.774 --> 28:32.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY: Well, other than
they may or
may not have discussed the
relative merits

28:32.311 --> 28:39.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Electoral College vs. the
popular vote,
what I am told by sources close
to Gore is

28:39.184 --> 28:43.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this was at the instigation
of Ivanka
Trump, that she reached out to
the former

28:43.689 --> 28:48.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vice president recently to
discuss climate
change, and that he was really
impressed with

28:48.760 --> 28:52.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the way she was thinking about
the issue,
framing the issue.

28:52.164 --> 28:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He had to be in New York anyway.

28:54.566 --> 29:00.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he went -- the original
idea was that
this meeting was to be between
Al Gore and

29:00.973 --> 29:01.940 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ivanka Trump.

29:01.974 --> 29:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it turns out it is with the
president-elect.

29:04.977 --> 29:09.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was interesting, too,
that Al Gore
on his way out said, it was a
very thoughtful

29:09.982 --> 29:12.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
discussion and that it will be
continued.

29:12.718 --> 29:16.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Donald Trump,
Amy, is meeting
with Democrats, as well as
Republicans.

29:16.521 --> 29:18.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

29:18.457 --> 29:23.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He's picked a
very clear Republican
in Ben Carson to run the Housing
Department.

29:23.362 --> 29:25.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you alluded to this a moment
ago.

29:25.697 --> 29:33.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are, frankly, kept on guard
right now -- caught
off-guard, I guess you could
say, by the variety

29:33.639 --> 29:34.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of people he's...

29:34.806 --> 29:36.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The variety of
people he's bringing
in.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you look at the people
that he's
actually put around him on his
Cabinet, this

29:39.678 --> 29:43.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a pretty -- I would argue a
very conservative
Cabinet.

29:43.048 --> 29:49.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whether it's on issues of
immigration,
his pick for the attorney
general, very conservative

29:49.655 --> 29:51.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on that issue.

29:51.289 --> 29:55.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On education, this is Betsy
DeVos, somebody
who has supported school
vouchers.

29:55.460 --> 30:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even on Ben Carson, he's not
exactly steeped
in housing policy, but his
statements on the

30:01.533 --> 30:03.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issue have also been very
conservative.

30:03.268 --> 30:09.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And looking back on something he
wrote even
in 2015 talking about some
programs within

30:09.675 --> 30:16.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HUD, mandated social engineering
schemes,
very critical of some of the
issues that HUD

30:16.982 --> 30:22.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would try to put forward, he's
been critical
of other programs, government
programs.

30:22.487 --> 30:28.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this is a Cabinet right
now, especially
when you look at domestic social
policy or

30:28.460 --> 30:33.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
domestic policy in general, this
is a very
conservative group of people
that he's put

30:33.632 --> 30:37.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around him, despite the fact
that he's bringing
all kinds of people into Trump
Tower.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

30:39.404 --> 30:44.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just again on the -- I posed
the question
to you a minute ago, Geoff Dyer,
about the

30:44.476 --> 30:51.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
array of people he's talking to
about secretary
of state, from Rudy Giuliani, to
today -- or,

30:51.616 --> 30:56.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yesterday, we learned about Rex
Tillerson,
who is the head of a big oil
company, ExxonMobil.

30:56.088 --> 31:04.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, if you're a foreign
government, are
you seeing this as a typical
process for choosing

31:04.896 --> 31:06.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
somebody in that position?

31:06.598 --> 31:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEOFF DYER: It's not so typical,
but it's
been done so publicly, and they
have to turn

31:08.433 --> 31:10.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up for these auditions at Trump
Tower.

31:10.502 --> 31:14.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's perfectly respectful
thing for him
to cast a wide net, to talk to a
lot of people.

31:14.606 --> 31:18.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And most of the people he's
thinking about
are very serious individuals.

31:18.643 --> 31:20.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're perfectly credible
candidates.

31:20.445 --> 31:24.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The thing that strikes me, from
looking at
the names so far in the Cabinet
on the foreign

31:24.116 --> 31:28.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy side, is the one thing
that unites
them -- and that's General
Mattis at the Pentagon,

31:28.386 --> 31:32.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Pompeo at the CIA, even
Mitt Romney to
become secretary of state --
they're all very,

31:32.457 --> 31:34.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very hawkish on Iran.

31:34.392 --> 31:37.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the one thing that you
can say about
the new Cabinet Donald Trump is
putting together.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That seems to be one of the
coherent themes.

31:39.297 --> 31:40.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're very, very skeptical
about Iran.

31:40.966 --> 31:42.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And quick,
finally, to Karen.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
More names coming up for
secretary of state,
we think?

31:45.036 --> 31:50.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY: Well, we have
heard today,
what, Jon Huntsman, the former
-- Barack Obama's

31:50.408 --> 31:56.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
former ambassador to China, a
far more moderate
figure than -- at least
politically than we

31:56.181 --> 32:01.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have seen, although, again,
very, very much
in agreement with a lot of what
Donald Trump

32:01.052 --> 32:04.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has to say on China.

32:04.189 --> 32:09.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing is that Trump
doesn't seem
to feel in a great hurry to make
this decision.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No, he doesn't.

32:10.829 --> 32:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY: He seems to both
be enjoying
the drama, enjoying the
suspense, but also

32:15.534 --> 32:17.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
willing to let this kind of play
out.

32:17.669 --> 32:32.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karen Tumulty,
Amy Walter,
Geoff Dyer, thank you all.

32:32.117 --> 32:37.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first foreign leader to call
president-elect
Trump after his victory was
Egypt's president,

32:37.422 --> 32:39.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Abdel Fattah El-Sisi.

32:39.191 --> 32:44.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Arab world's most populous
nation has
had turbulent relations with the
Obama White

32:44.296 --> 32:51.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House since the 2011 revolution,
and the subsequent
2013 coup that first brought
El-Sisi to power.

32:51.570 --> 32:56.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Egypt's foreign minister, Sameh
Shoukry, has
been in Washington meeting with
Secretary

32:56.341 --> 33:01.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of State Kerry and with key
leaders on Capitol
Hill, and last week with vice
president-elect

33:01.746 --> 33:03.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mike Pence.

33:03.548 --> 33:06.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning, he sat down with
our chief foreign
affairs correspondent, Margaret
Warner.

33:06.785 --> 33:10.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Minister
Shoukry, thank you
so much for having us.

33:10.889 --> 33:15.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Trump and your
President Sisi
have had some very glowing words
to say about

33:15.594 --> 33:17.295 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
one another.

33:17.329 --> 33:20.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your own embassy just put out a
statement
that, in fact, you are looking
forward to

33:20.165 --> 33:22.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
better ties with the new
administration.

33:22.133 --> 33:26.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, are you looking forward to
turning the
page on this U.S.-Egypt
relationship, which

33:26.905 --> 33:28.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has had its ups and downs over
the last few
years?

33:28.874 --> 33:32.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMEH SHOUKRY, Egyptian Foreign
Minister:
We're certainly looking forward
for consolidating

33:32.577 --> 33:34.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and strengthening the
U.S.-Egyptian relationship.

33:34.613 --> 33:39.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is always our objective to
have close ties
with the United States.

33:39.117 --> 33:45.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're at a transitional period
of our history
and we're on a road to reform.

33:45.123 --> 33:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: How do you
expect the Trump
administration to be different
than the Obama

33:48.960 --> 33:50.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration when it comes to
dealing with
Egypt?

33:50.929 --> 33:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMEH SHOUKRY: Well, we look
forward, from
what we heard from
president-elect Trump,

33:55.166 --> 34:00.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a clear vision related to the
conditions and
the challenges in the Middle
East.

34:00.572 --> 34:05.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a great deal of
parallelity in
that vision related to how we
can eradicate

34:05.777 --> 34:08.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorism, how we can regain
stability in
the region.

34:08.046 --> 34:13.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: So, are you
expecting more
cooperation on fighting
terrorism or making

34:13.418 --> 34:17.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the priority, and less
attention, for
example, to the issue of human
rights in Egypt?

34:17.789 --> 34:20.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMEH SHOUKRY: That's not the
issue that concerns
us.

34:20.558 --> 34:27.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the issue that concerns
us is certainly
regaining stability, but issues
of human rights

34:27.232 --> 34:31.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are an integral part of our
reform policies,
of our new constitution.

34:31.970 --> 34:37.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Did either Mr.
Trump or Mr.
Pence, when you met with vice
president-elect

34:37.108 --> 34:40.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pence, on their own raise the
issue of human
rights with you?

34:40.578 --> 34:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMEH SHOUKRY: On the occasion
of my meeting,
it was to convey a message from
President

34:45.717 --> 34:47.485 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sisi.

34:47.519 --> 34:53.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there was a general
discussion related
to conditions in the region and
the importance

34:53.692 --> 34:57.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the strategic relationship
that binds the
United States and Egypt.

34:57.896 --> 34:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But what about
human rights?

34:59.097 --> 35:00.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAMEH SHOUKRY: It wasn't raised
specifically.

35:00.966 --> 35:02.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It wasn't
raised specifically?

35:02.567 --> 35:04.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAMEH SHOUKRY: No.

35:04.069 --> 35:07.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: There is one
case that is
getting some attention here.

35:07.205 --> 35:14.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's of a young woman
named Aya Hijazi,
who came to work with her
husband in a sort

35:15.013 --> 35:16.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of center for street kids.

35:16.748 --> 35:21.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then she's been arrested and
held for
months and months on what
everyone here says

35:21.519 --> 35:24.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is bogus charges that they were
abusing the
children.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is the status of that case?

35:26.224 --> 35:30.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMEH SHOUKRY: Well, I think
it's a very serious
accusation that's been made.

35:30.495 --> 35:36.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think anyone would be
interested to
get to the bottom of accusations
related to

35:36.267 --> 35:38.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
minors and related to abuse.

35:38.536 --> 35:43.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I would challenge the issue
of bogus accusations.

35:43.675 --> 35:49.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's important to
recognize the
impartiality of the Egyptian
judicial system.

35:49.414 --> 35:52.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: So, let me ask
you a couple
of other things about human
rights.

35:52.951 --> 35:58.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your Parliament last week just
passed another
law, further restrictions on the
rights or

35:58.189 --> 36:00.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the activities of NGOs.

36:00.925 --> 36:03.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Will President Sisi sign that?

36:03.128 --> 36:10.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMEH SHOUKRY: The elected
officials decided
that they had their own vision
of what they

36:10.869 --> 36:13.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
considered in the best interests
of the public.

36:13.038 --> 36:19.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this was just before I left,
so I don't
have any information related to
what the president's

36:19.110 --> 36:20.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
position on it is.

36:20.945 --> 36:24.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: As you know,
human rights
are a deep concern here in the
United States

36:24.883 --> 36:26.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in terms of what's going on in
Egypt.

36:26.651 --> 36:31.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is hard for people to
understand why
so many dissidents, journalists,
activists,

36:31.623 --> 36:38.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nonviolent people, NGOs, have
been rounded
up, are being detained, are
having their rights

36:38.863 --> 36:44.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
restricted, why, for people who
speak out,
for people who want to
demonstrate.

36:44.869 --> 36:45.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAMEH SHOUKRY: My -- exactly.

36:45.870 --> 36:48.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not a matter of people
speaking out.

36:48.039 --> 36:55.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's nobody who's been
accused of anything
related to freedom of expression
or undertaking

36:55.547 --> 36:57.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
activities of civic
responsibility.

36:57.949 --> 37:05.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
All those who have been
subjected to a judicial
inquiry and trials have been
accused of criminal

37:05.523 --> 37:11.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activity, criminal activity,
whether it's
in demonstrating without
necessary permits,

37:11.796 --> 37:20.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in violent activity during
demonstrations,
and such issues that are
penalized in the

37:20.505 --> 37:21.473 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
criminal code.

37:21.506 --> 37:23.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Let me turn now
to Syria.

37:23.808 --> 37:25.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Initially -- and, of course, it
was a different
government.

37:25.777 --> 37:29.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government of Egypt opposed
President
Bashar al-Assad.

37:29.180 --> 37:35.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are signs now that, in
fact, the
Egyptian government is growing
closer to him,

37:35.086 --> 37:36.888 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more supportive.

37:36.921 --> 37:41.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Sisi said he thought
the Assad army
was perhaps best equipped to
fight terrorism.

37:41.860 --> 37:48.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have been also voting with
Russia in the
Security Council on resolutions
related to

37:48.433 --> 37:50.268 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

37:50.301 --> 37:55.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the Syrian government asked
Egypt to also
send forces of any kinds, and
there have been

37:55.907 --> 37:59.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rumors to this effect, would
Egypt send some
to help him?

37:59.644 --> 38:01.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAMEH SHOUKRY: Categorically
not.

38:01.479 --> 38:06.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Let me clarify that the
president, when he
made his statements, wasn't
referring to Syria

38:06.351 --> 38:08.153 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in particular.

38:08.186 --> 38:11.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was referring to the fact
that we consider
that it is the national armies
of the nation

38:11.656 --> 38:14.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state which are responsible to
fight terrorism.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is their primary
responsibility.

38:16.895 --> 38:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have the better ability,
rather than
relying on any form of foreign
intervention

38:21.799 --> 38:23.601 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this regard.

38:23.635 --> 38:29.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we believe that a political
solution should
be under way, and that which is
necessarily

38:29.674 --> 38:32.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inclusive of all political
factions in Syria.

38:32.844 --> 38:38.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there is no commitment
towards any specific
political entity in Syria.

38:38.183 --> 38:42.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There hasn't been any reference
to the current
Syrian government.

38:42.120 --> 38:47.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: So, would you
say your position
is closer to that of the United
States or

38:47.158 --> 38:48.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- right now -- or to Russia?

38:48.993 --> 38:52.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMEH SHOUKRY: We have been
cooperating with
both the United States and
Russia, have been

38:52.096 --> 38:57.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actively supporting a greater
understanding
between them because of their
ability to impact

38:57.702 --> 38:59.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the situation.

38:59.537 --> 39:04.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We believe that it is
intolerable that the
current level of violence and --
that we continue

39:04.042 --> 39:09.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
after five years of a
half-a-million loss
of life, that we -- that this
situation should

39:09.814 --> 39:11.449 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
continue.

39:11.482 --> 39:14.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Let me end with
asking you
about a couple of campaign
promises.

39:14.385 --> 39:19.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Trump said he
was going to
push to renegotiate this entire
Iran nuclear

39:19.891 --> 39:20.858 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deal.

39:20.892 --> 39:21.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you think that's a good idea?

39:21.859 --> 39:24.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAMEH SHOUKRY: The issue is very
important.

39:24.429 --> 39:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we must guarantee that the
region remains
free of nuclear weapons.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And so do you
think the Iran
nuclear deal furthers that aim?

39:33.271 --> 39:39.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMEH SHOUKRY: We believe that
the deal can
-- has room for improvement,
definitely, in

39:39.410 --> 39:45.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terms of the time and in terms
of the guarantees
to prevent any proliferation of
nuclear weapons.

39:45.316 --> 39:49.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And then,
finally, he promised
to move the U.S. Embassy -- this
is an old

39:49.687 --> 39:51.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issue -- from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Would that be high on your list?

39:53.992 --> 39:55.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAMEH SHOUKRY: No.

39:55.793 --> 40:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have always opposed any
movement in that
direction as contravening
international law

40:01.299 --> 40:02.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and legitimacy.

40:02.300 --> 40:06.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Thank you very
much, sir.

40:06.738 --> 40:13.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAMEH SHOUKRY: Thank you.

40:13.411 --> 40:20.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Protesters won a
big 11th-hour
victory from the Obama
administration yesterday

40:20.885 --> 40:25.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that prevents the completion of
the Dakota
Access pipeline.

40:25.189 --> 40:29.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But is it just a temporary delay
until president-elect
Trump takes office?

40:29.861 --> 40:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The nearly 1,200-mile pipeline
was almost
complete before this weekend's
announcement.

40:35.266 --> 40:40.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the last stretches is a
single-mile
segment that goes under the
Missouri River.

40:40.538 --> 40:43.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The battle has been raging for
seven months
now.

40:43.574 --> 40:45.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And to Hari Sreenivasan for our
update.

40:45.410 --> 40:48.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: The Corps of Engineers is
going to deny
the easement.

40:48.046 --> 40:49.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

40:49.981 --> 40:55.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thousands of
protesters
celebrated the announcement late
yesterday.

40:55.820 --> 41:00.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Sunday, the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers
said it wouldn't grant the final
easement

41:00.958 --> 41:03.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to allow the pipeline to be
drilled.

41:03.461 --> 41:07.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, the Corps said it would
begin exploring
alternative routes.

41:07.632 --> 41:12.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Standing Rock Sioux tribe
and others say
the pipeline will destroy sacred
lands and

41:12.270 --> 41:16.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are worried an oil leak could
threaten the
tribe's water supply.

41:16.307 --> 41:20.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Dakota's governor, the
company and members
of the state's congressional
delegation all

41:20.945 --> 41:22.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
denounced the decision.

41:22.747 --> 41:25.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William Brangham has been
covering the story
for months, and is with us again
tonight.

41:25.850 --> 41:28.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William, this doesn't seem to be
over.

41:28.286 --> 41:30.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't see the protesters
breaking camp.

41:30.755 --> 41:32.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't see anybody jumping for
joy.

41:32.557 --> 41:34.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: No.

41:34.392 --> 41:38.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was some joy certainly
yesterday, and
I think, obviously, some
spillover into today,

41:38.830 --> 41:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because, for many people, this
was considered
an enormous victory.

41:42.100 --> 41:46.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is what the Standing Rock
tribe and all
of its thousands of supporters
have wanted

41:46.104 --> 41:50.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for months, which was to stop
the pipeline
going under the Missouri River
right next

41:50.575 --> 41:51.676 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the tribe.

41:51.709 --> 41:54.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, whether this is over or not
is still
an issue.

41:54.479 --> 41:56.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Army Corps didn't cancel the
pipeline.

41:56.547 --> 41:59.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They didn't say it's definitely
not going
here.

41:59.083 --> 42:03.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said, let's take a longer
review, let's
talk to the tribes some more,
and let's consider

42:03.988 --> 42:05.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some alternate routes.

42:05.523 --> 42:08.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's still not clear if this
is, in fact,
the done deal.

42:08.926 --> 42:12.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the
alternate route
idea doesn't sit well with the
local authorities

42:12.997 --> 42:13.965 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and the company.

42:13.998 --> 42:15.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: No.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company has, from the very
beginning,
been steadfast that they will
not move this

42:18.903 --> 42:20.438 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pipeline.

42:20.471 --> 42:23.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The governor of North Dakota has
said the
pipeline is not going to be
moved.

42:23.908 --> 42:28.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the Army Corps of Engineers
could and
has in the past looked at other
routes.

42:28.780 --> 42:31.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's multiple ways to cross
the Missouri
River here.

42:31.315 --> 42:35.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But right now, the Army Corps of
Engineers
says all options are open and
they're going

42:35.386 --> 42:37.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back to the drawing board, in
essence.

42:37.255 --> 42:41.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what
happens to the
protesters in the coldest part
of winter heading

42:41.793 --> 42:43.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into this area now?

42:43.194 --> 42:45.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, that's
still an open
question.

42:45.263 --> 42:47.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't know yet.

42:47.265 --> 42:52.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The head of the Standing Rock
Sioux, the chairman,
David Archambault Ii, he, in
essence, declared

42:52.303 --> 42:56.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this as a victory, and he said,
people, you
can go home now, things are
safe.

42:56.674 --> 43:01.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, in the back of their
minds, they
know that, just as the Obama
administration

43:01.045 --> 43:04.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made this happen, a Trump
administration might
try to reverse course.

43:04.348 --> 43:07.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, I think everyone is
recognizing subzero
temperatures.

43:07.885 --> 43:12.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a very, very hard place
to live out
in the open on the prairies of
North Dakota.

43:12.657 --> 43:14.125 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's freezing.

43:14.158 --> 43:16.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, everyone, go home, rest,
that's what the
chairman seems to be saying.

43:16.794 --> 43:19.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if we need to call on you
again, we will
do so.

43:19.697 --> 43:23.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there any
indication
that the policy change after the
inauguration

43:23.534 --> 43:24.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Donald Trump?

43:24.535 --> 43:26.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well,
certainly.

43:26.270 --> 43:29.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's -- this was, in essence,
driven in
large part by pressure brought
to bear on

43:29.941 --> 43:34.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Obama administration and
them asking the
Army Corps to take a second look
at this.

43:35.012 --> 43:39.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, what the Obama
administration has done,
the Trump administration could
undo.

43:39.984 --> 43:43.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Trump has been very clear
from the get-go
he wants this pipeline to be
built.

43:44.021 --> 43:48.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And that tribe
has had a,
well, complicated relationship
with the Army

43:48.292 --> 43:51.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Corps, this particular decision
that they
support, but, in the past,
there's a lot of

43:51.462 --> 43:52.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
decisions that they have not.

43:52.530 --> 43:54.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's
correct.

43:54.298 --> 43:57.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, there have been a lot of
instances
where the tribe has said, we
have not been

43:57.668 --> 43:59.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
consulted on these types of
events in the
past.

43:59.837 --> 44:04.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, one of the biggest
critics of this
is a Congressman Kevin Cramer
from North Dakota.

44:04.775 --> 44:09.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He points out, good luck on
trying to do any
infrastructure projects in the
U.S. going

44:09.580 --> 44:11.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forward, if you can simply
overturn it like
this.

44:11.549 --> 44:17.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he says, on this very same
land, natural
gas pipelines have been put
through, electric

44:17.288 --> 44:19.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high-tension power lines have
gone through.

44:19.790 --> 44:23.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the tribe wasn't happy about
that, but
they said that they had no power
to do anything

44:23.361 --> 44:25.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about it, whereas, with this
pipeline, they
did.

44:25.730 --> 44:31.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Just recently,
there was
audio of the conversations that
took place

44:31.035 --> 44:35.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and where the tribe was
considering this,
because one of the contentions
that the tribe

44:35.306 --> 44:37.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had is that: We were not part of
this process.

44:37.675 --> 44:38.643 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

44:38.676 --> 44:40.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's right.

44:40.545 --> 44:42.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The audio that you're referring
to is an instance
of several years ago, where the
tribe made

44:42.880 --> 44:47.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very clear that they didn't want
this pipeline
coming anywhere near them.

44:47.618 --> 44:52.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem with that is that,
in subsequent
meetings, the Army Corps has
been saying:

44:52.890 --> 44:56.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have asked for the tribe to
continue to
offer further input.

44:56.894 --> 45:01.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they argue that they simply
didn't respond
and that they didn't come to
subsequent meetings.

45:01.866 --> 45:05.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think it's been quite
clear the tribe
has been against this from the
get-go.

45:05.236 --> 45:09.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
William Brangham,
thanks so much.

45:09.240 --> 45:16.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thanks, Hari.

45:16.948 --> 45:24.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
It's North
America's biggest art fair, with
big money

45:24.822 --> 45:29.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at stake, but who is it for and
how does it
work?

45:29.226 --> 45:34.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown visited Miami
Beach to find
out what Art Basel is all about,
which just

45:34.332 --> 45:36.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wrapped up this weekend.

45:36.334 --> 45:42.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A family reunion
for the international
art tribe, a trade show, but one
that includes

45:42.807 --> 45:49.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some up-to-the-moment political
commentary,
Art Basel Miami Beach is all of
that and more,

45:49.447 --> 45:55.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
art of all shapes and sizes and
colors and
kinds, and all for sale.

45:55.186 --> 46:00.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It can be head-spinning, or, if
you're a prominent
gallery owner like Jack
Shainman, nightmare-inducing:

46:00.491 --> 46:07.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK SHAINMAN, Jack Shainman
Gallery: A lot
happens the first days or the
first few hours.

46:07.198 --> 46:13.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, one of my anxiety
dreams that I have
when I travel is that all these
collectors

46:13.170 --> 46:17.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show up at my booth at the same
time at an
art fair, and I can't talk to
all of them

46:17.642 --> 46:19.543 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at once.

46:19.577 --> 46:24.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Here at the Miami
Beach Convention
Center, 269 high-end galleries
from 29 countries

46:24.582 --> 46:31.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the world take part in
the main art
fair, last year attracting
95,000 viewers

46:31.122 --> 46:33.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and collectors over six days.

46:33.724 --> 46:35.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Fred Bidwell was back this year.

46:35.359 --> 46:37.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED BIDWELL, Art Collector:
This is crazy.

46:37.695 --> 46:41.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is more art than the human
mind could
possibly perceive.

46:41.232 --> 46:47.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: With billions of
dollars on
the line, including new money
from abroad,

46:47.238 --> 46:50.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New York gallery owners James
and Jane Cohan
have a lot at stake.

46:50.908 --> 46:55.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE COHAN, James Cohan Gallery:
We really
know the kinds of things our
clients are looking

46:55.079 --> 46:56.947 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

46:56.981 --> 46:59.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when we have something
that's spectacular,
they have been interested in a
certain artist,

46:59.450 --> 47:02.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have a spectacular work,
we're going to
let them know that we're
bringing it to the

47:02.153 --> 47:04.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fair, and then they can come and
see it.

47:04.221 --> 47:06.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, a little bit
of this is
sort of precooked?

47:06.757 --> 47:08.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JANE COHAN: Absolutely.

47:08.592 --> 47:12.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I still really believe that
you have to
see a work of art in person to
fall in love.

47:12.730 --> 47:17.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Collectors come
in all forms,
trophy hunters, speculators, and
actual lovers

47:17.835 --> 47:19.737 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of art.

47:19.770 --> 47:24.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This fair, an offshoot of one in
Basel, Switzerland,
is known for attracting Latin
American art

47:24.909 --> 47:30.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and collectors, including Tiqui
Atencio, who's
just written a book about
collecting art.

47:30.448 --> 47:33.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIQUI ATENCIO, Art Collector: I
walked into
a gallery that I love, which is
the Brazilian

47:34.018 --> 47:36.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gallery from Sao Paulo, Fontes
de Deloya (ph).

47:36.821 --> 47:43.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I started looking around,
and I saw these
two wonderful Latin American
artists from

47:43.227 --> 47:45.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Brazil in their 20s.

47:45.296 --> 47:46.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I thought, oh, my God, these
are fantastic
artists.

47:46.297 --> 47:47.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And did you buy?

47:47.732 --> 47:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIQUI ATENCIO: I'm thinking of
it.

47:50.034 --> 47:51.736 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:51.769 --> 47:55.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Fifteen years in,
Art Basel
Miami has spawned more than 20
additional

47:55.639 --> 48:01.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
local fairs, catering to
different styles
and wallets, including one
titled Untitled.

48:01.378 --> 48:03.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: There's a lot to see,
yes.

48:03.814 --> 48:09.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: With so much to
see, art advisers
have become big players here and
elsewhere

48:09.220 --> 48:18.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the art world, counseling
individual, corporate
and institutional clients.

48:18.229 --> 48:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kerri Hurtado is an adviser with
San Francisco's
Artsouce.

48:22.500 --> 48:30.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At Untitled, she showed works to
Jaya Kader,
a Miami-based architect who
designs homes

48:30.107 --> 48:32.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with contemporary art in mind.

48:32.176 --> 48:35.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAYA KADER, Architect: You get
exposed to
so much.

48:35.045 --> 48:41.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no way that -- it would
take you a
whole year to get to see as much
as you get

48:41.419 --> 48:45.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to see in a few days in Miami.

48:45.489 --> 48:50.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I like to work with Artsouce
because the
art world is so vast.

48:50.728 --> 48:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Art everywhere,
but also other
kinds of excess.

48:55.399 --> 48:57.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Art journalist Janelle Zara.

48:57.201 --> 49:01.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANELLE ZARA, Journalist:
Because we're in
Miami, things sometimes get a
little out of

49:01.272 --> 49:02.239 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hand.

49:02.273 --> 49:03.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a lot of showiness, you
know?

49:03.741 --> 49:05.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everyone in the world is here.

49:05.576 --> 49:10.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that involves a lot of
fancy cars,
a lot of dressing up, you know,
a lot of hopping

49:10.147 --> 49:11.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from party to party.

49:11.949 --> 49:15.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, increasingly, people who
are not in the
art world want to participate.

49:15.286 --> 49:21.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But even in what
Zara described
as a subdued year, possibly
owing to the Zika

49:22.026 --> 49:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scare, the spectacle went on, a
psychedelic
electronic dance party in
Collins Park, complete

49:28.699 --> 49:36.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a robot bouncer, droning
guitars played
by women standing on amplifiers,
and burgers

49:36.207 --> 49:39.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
grilled under the hood of a
limousine.

49:39.376 --> 49:43.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were the behind-the-scenes
dinners and
parties galore.

49:43.514 --> 49:49.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also on display, the rise of
homegrown museums
and collectors like the Rubell
family, who

49:49.553 --> 49:55.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during the Art Basel fair, held
an opening
in their own enormous private
collection space.

49:55.893 --> 49:58.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're market makers in a sense,
right?

49:58.229 --> 50:01.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you choose an artist, you
have the power
to make people.

50:01.365 --> 50:06.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MERA RUBELL, Rubell Family
Collection: I know
people say that all the time,
that we make

50:06.770 --> 50:12.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
markets and stuff like -- but I
can tell you
that that's not the way we live
our life.

50:12.343 --> 50:14.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't wake up in the morning
and say, oh,
we make markets.

50:14.612 --> 50:16.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is really like the outside
world.

50:16.046 --> 50:17.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The inside world is very, very
basic.

50:17.214 --> 50:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a family that is constantly
talking about
the art.

50:21.285 --> 50:24.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have the privilege to curate
it and hang
it.

50:24.588 --> 50:26.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The market is not so interesting
to us.

50:26.323 --> 50:31.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The growth of art
fairs has
given more buyers access to the
art world,

50:31.195 --> 50:33.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
less power to auction houses.

50:33.497 --> 50:39.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's a strict hierarchy
here, several
tiers of VIPs who get in first,
ahead of the

50:39.470 --> 50:41.305 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
general public.

50:41.338 --> 50:45.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Most of the work here is
actually sold before
the fair even opens to the
public.

50:45.943 --> 50:49.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clare McAndrew is a cultural
economist who
studies the art market.

50:49.146 --> 50:53.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CLARE MCANDREW, Cultural
Economist: The high
end has done extremely well.

50:53.317 --> 50:59.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I looked at auction
sales, for example,
and the segment over a million
has grown about

50:59.623 --> 51:01.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
400 percent over the last 10
years.

51:01.258 --> 51:04.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you look at the segment over
$10 million,
it's grown at over 1000 percent.

51:04.728 --> 51:07.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you look at the lower-end
segments,
they have grown very slowly.

51:07.865 --> 51:11.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In terms of sales growth, it's a
very top-heavy
marketplace.

51:11.769 --> 51:16.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But that sort of
fits with
the whole inequality discussion
we have politically.

51:16.440 --> 51:21.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLARE MCANDREW: It's exactly
paralleling what's
happening in the wider economy
and in wealth

51:21.679 --> 51:23.480 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
distribution.

51:23.514 --> 51:27.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, as with
other markets,
those with the best information
gain advantage.

51:27.151 --> 51:31.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Josh Baer is an art adviser who
writes the
industry newsletter "Baer Faxt."

51:31.288 --> 51:35.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BAER, "Baer Faxt": Having
more information
about who's doing the show at
the Tate or

51:35.259 --> 51:39.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who's going to be in the Whitney
Biennial
or whose work is sold out and
who's buying

51:39.496 --> 51:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it or what's going on gives you
momentum information.

51:42.967 --> 51:46.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Momentum, which
you can take
to clients or others and say...

51:46.904 --> 51:51.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BAER: Time to buy now
because next year
it's going to be twice as much
and there's

51:51.041 --> 51:53.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be something else going
on.

51:53.310 --> 51:54.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Art fairs are like auctions.

51:54.678 --> 51:56.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're about forced urgency.

51:56.613 --> 52:02.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're about the illusion of
you better decide
in the next 20 seconds, because
some billionaire

52:02.486 --> 52:06.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from China is coming in two
minutes and he
may take what you want.

52:06.090 --> 52:11.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Amid all the
buying and selling,
what's an up-and-coming artist
to do, especially

52:11.662 --> 52:17.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one like Hank Willis Thomas, who
works in
many different media, often
tackling difficult

52:17.301 --> 52:19.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
political issues of the moment?

52:19.703 --> 52:24.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says artists need to imagine
a better future
for society, even if part of the
present deal

52:24.808 --> 52:26.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here is lucrative.

52:26.310 --> 52:28.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HANK WILLIS THOMAS, Artist: So,
there's no
way to get out of this system.

52:28.846 --> 52:33.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I'm really most interested
in is how
we can use the system to improve
it.

52:33.851 --> 52:35.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's always a positive
improvement.

52:35.686 --> 52:38.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't want to alienate myself
from anyone.

52:38.222 --> 52:42.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A bit more
politics and smaller
crowds this year.

52:42.593 --> 52:47.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But sales, the true bottom line,
were said
to be holding steady.

52:47.297 --> 52:50.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Miami Beach, I'm Jeffrey
Brown for the
"PBS NewsHour."

52:50.401 --> 52:55.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: My favorite was
the hamburgers
grilled under the hood of the
car.

52:55.205 --> 53:00.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can read about another
artist, Mozart,
online, where medical historian
Howard Markel

53:00.778 --> 53:08.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
examines the possible causes of
the great
composer's death 225 years ago
today.

53:08.519 --> 53:12.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:12.890 --> 53:14.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:14.324 --> 53:15.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:15.492 --> 53:17.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening.

53:17.828 --> 53:27.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
