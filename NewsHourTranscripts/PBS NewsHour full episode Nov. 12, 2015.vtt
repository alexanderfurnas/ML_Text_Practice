GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill. Judy Woodruff is
away.

00:09.676 --> 00:15.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Deadly blasts rock Beirut, as
the Islamic State claims
responsibility

00:15.249 --> 00:19.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for two suicide bombs
in Lebanon's capital.

00:19.453 --> 00:23.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus, Kurdish forces take over a
major ISIS route in Iraq in an
effort to reclaim the

00:23.957 --> 00:27.394 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
town of Sinjar.

00:27.394 --> 00:31.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also ahead: One public school in
Harlem is making educators
wonder, can students learn

00:31.832 --> 00:36.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
best with more time on computers
and less help from teachers?

00:36.436 --> 00:40.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUGATA MITRA, Education Reform
Advocate: Could it be that we
don't need to go to school at

00:40.274 --> 00:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all? Could it be that at the
point in time when you need to
know something, you can find

00:44.177 --> 00:49.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out in two minutes? Could it be
that we're heading towards or
may be in a future where

00:49.449 --> 00:52.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
knowing is obsolete?

00:52.653 --> 00:57.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Oscar-winning
actress Juliette Binoche talks
about some unusual turns in

00:57.324 --> 01:00.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
her career and taking
on Greek tragedy.

01:00.894 --> 01:05.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

(BREAK)

01:10.003 --> 01:21.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A new front opened
today in the war with no
apparent end in sight. Kurdish

01:21.815 --> 01:26.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forces in Iraq, with U.S.
support, launched an assault on
a key city that links Islamic

01:26.119 --> 01:31.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
State holdings in two countries.

01:31.758 --> 01:39.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American airstrikes hammered
Sinjar on Iraq's far
northwestern border with Syria,
as the

01:39.032 --> 01:44.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Kurdish Peshmerga ground
force began its offensive.

01:44.037 --> 01:50.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It
started just now. The situation
so far is good. There are

01:50.844 --> 01:54.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continuous airstrikes on them.
We are also hitting them with
artillery.

01:54.448 --> 01:59.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The objective, to
capture not only the city, but a
key supply route, Highway

01:59.920 --> 02:05.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
47. It connects the Islamic
State's makeshift capital in
Raqqa, Syria, to outposts in
Iraq,

02:05.759 --> 02:08.428 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
including Mosul.

02:08.428 --> 02:12.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We reached Rukmini Callimachi of
The New York Times late today,
just after she returned

02:12.199 --> 02:14.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from the front lines at Sinjar.

02:14.768 --> 02:18.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUKMINI CALLIMACHI, The New York
Times: Within the first couple
of hours of the offensive

02:18.205 --> 02:23.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this morning, the Peshmerga were
able to get down onto that
highway from the east and from

02:23.744 --> 02:26.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the west and essentially
cut it off.

02:26.646 --> 02:31.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were surprised at the lack
of resistance. And we don't know
if there's a surprise in

02:31.785 --> 02:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
store. One Peshmerga commander
was telling me that, through his
binoculars, he could

02:35.922 --> 02:40.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
look out and see ISIS
fighters fleeing on foot.

02:40.227 --> 02:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My impression of ISIS is that
they're incredibly strong
against local forces; they're
incredibly

02:46.733 --> 02:53.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strong against the Iraqi army.
They're not so strong against
U.S. airstrikes and a Kurdish

02:53.573 --> 02:56.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
force that is being flanked
by U.S. special forces.

02:56.877 --> 03:01.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Washington,
Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook
confirmed American troops are at

03:01.615 --> 03:06.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sinjar in support of the Kurdish
offensive, but are not taking
part in direct combat.

03:06.620 --> 03:10.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER COOK, Pentagon Press
Secretary: They are advising
directly the Iraqi Kurdish
forces

03:10.490 --> 03:17.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are there on site who are
engaging this operation, leading
this operation. And the

03:17.931 --> 03:22.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. advisers there are working
directly with the Peshmerga
forces to determine the most

03:22.569 --> 03:26.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
effective locations
for those airstrikes.

03:26.473 --> 03:31.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Islamic State
fighters conquered Sinjar and
surrounding areas in the summer

03:31.445 --> 03:37.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 2014. Hundreds of thousands
of its inhabitants from the
Yazidi religious sect fled, but
many

03:37.884 --> 03:43.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thousands were killed, raped and
systematically enslaved. The
attack and atrocities moved

03:43.924 --> 03:49.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama to begin a
bombing campaign in Iraq that
quickly extended into Syria.

03:49.529 --> 03:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: Whatever questions one
might have about the content

03:52.666 --> 03:57.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about our policy, there should
be no doubt about the effort
made to consider every single

03:57.404 --> 04:00.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
option for ending this crisis.

04:00.674 --> 04:05.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Today, Secretary of
State Kerry defended the Syria
strategy. He spoke at the

04:05.579 --> 04:11.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. Institute of Peace, ahead
of renewed multinational talks
this Saturday in Vienna.

04:11.651 --> 04:16.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those will include Syrian
President Bashar Assad's
principal allies, Russia and
Iran.

04:16.523 --> 04:19.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His fate is a major
point of division.

04:19.793 --> 04:25.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN KERRY: Asking the
opposition to trust Assad or to
accept Assad's leadership is
simply

04:25.365 --> 04:31.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not a reasonable request. And it
is literally, therefore, a
nonstarter. I cannot say this

04:31.438 --> 04:35.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
afternoon that we are on the
threshold of a comprehensive
agreement, no. There remains

04:35.509 --> 04:38.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot of work to be done.

04:38.478 --> 04:42.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Kerry said each
party now has a responsibility
-- quote -- "not to dig in

04:42.749 --> 04:46.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
our heels, but to make
the bleeding stop."

04:46.119 --> 04:53.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two suicide bombers killed at
least 43 people and wounded
nearly 200 more in Lebanon
today.

04:53.894 --> 04:58.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The blasts occurred just outside
the capital, Beirut, in a suburb
considered a stronghold

04:58.999 --> 05:04.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of Hezbollah. The Shiite
militant group has close ties to
Iran and Syria.

05:04.337 --> 05:09.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the scene, people pulled
victims from under wreckage and
shattered glass strewn across

05:09.342 --> 05:13.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the streets. The Islamic State
group quickly claimed
responsibility for the attack.

05:13.813 --> 05:20.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Protests spread across
Afghanistan today, amid demands
for greater security, galvanized

05:20.287 --> 05:25.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by a brutal crime. Demonstrators
from multiple ethnic and
sectarian groups turned out in

05:25.959 --> 05:31.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three provinces to condemn the
beheadings of seven Shiite
Hazaras. It came a day after

05:31.598 --> 05:35.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
10,000 people protested
the killings in Kabul.

05:35.635 --> 05:42.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Greece, nearly
35,000 striking public workers
marched against new tax hikes

05:42.475 --> 05:48.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and spending cuts mandated by
the country's latest bailout.
Tensions boiled over in Athens,

05:48.315 --> 05:53.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where some in the crowd hurled
Molotov cocktails at police.
Officers fired back with tear
gas

05:53.653 --> 05:59.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and stun grenades, but the
protesters insisted they're not
going away.

05:59.459 --> 06:04.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It
might sound a little weird, but
the international lenders

06:04.097 --> 06:08.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are asking for blood. They're
not asking to be reimbursed.
They're seeking to destroy

06:08.702 --> 06:12.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us, to make us disappear. Why?
We didn't bother anyone. I
believe we're sending a message

06:12.839 --> 06:16.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right now that we support the
entire workers movement.

06:16.309 --> 06:19.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The general strike
is the first since Prime
Minister Alexis Tsipras and his

06:19.913 --> 06:24.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
left-wing government came
to power in January.

06:24.050 --> 06:29.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
European leaders pledged nearly
$2 billion to African nations
today to stem the flow

06:29.856 --> 06:35.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of migrants and take back those
who don't qualify for asylum.
The two sides wound up

06:35.495 --> 06:41.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a meeting in Malta, and agreed
on emergency aid to address
violence and food shortages.

06:41.234 --> 06:45.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the president of Niger
argued it's just scratching the
surface.

06:45.138 --> 06:48.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MUHAMMADU BUHARI, Nigerian
President (through translator):
It's not enough. It's far from

06:48.942 --> 06:53.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being enough. The needs are
enormous. That's why we're
calling on other partners to
participate

06:53.146 --> 06:58.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the setting up of trust
funds. And beyond that, what we
hope for, it's not only in the

06:58.218 --> 07:02.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
form of public development aid.
We hope for reform in worldwide
governance.

07:02.722 --> 07:07.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Talk of the aid plan
came amid new moves by several
nations to begin tightening

07:07.927 --> 07:11.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their borders. We will focus on
the situation in one of those
countries, Sweden, later in

07:11.498 --> 07:14.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the program.

07:14.567 --> 07:18.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development is calling for a ban

07:18.905 --> 07:25.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on smoking in all public
housing. A rule proposed today
would affect more than 940,000
units.

07:25.979 --> 07:32.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HUD estimates it will protect
the health of 760,000 children
and save more than $150 million

07:32.085 --> 07:37.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a year in medical costs,
repairs and preventable fires.

07:37.891 --> 07:42.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Students at more than a hundred
U.S. colleges and universities
rallied today against mounting

07:42.796 --> 07:48.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debt. There were demonstrations
from Philadelphia to Hawaii.
Protesters called for free
tuition

07:48.201 --> 07:52.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at public universities, and
cancellation of student loan
debt. It was part of an event

07:52.038 --> 07:56.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
dubbed the Million
Student March.

07:56.009 --> 08:01.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, a new slump
in prices for oil and other
commodities pushed stocks

08:01.781 --> 08:09.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sharply lower. The Dow Jones
industrial average lost more
than 250 points to close below
17450.

08:09.089 --> 08:14.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell nearly 62
points, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped
29.

08:14.861 --> 08:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
offensive speech vs. free
speech, the debate now consuming

08:20.467 --> 08:26.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some college campuses; a culture
clash for refugees in Sweden;
students learn without

08:26.172 --> 08:40.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
teachers, and much more.

08:40.854 --> 08:46.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marches and demonstrations at
Missouri and other universities
define a season of unrest

08:46.559 --> 08:50.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on many college campuses. And
the response to those protests
has stirred fresh questions

08:50.830 --> 08:57.404 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
about how much
speech is too much.

08:57.404 --> 09:02.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Protests against racial
incidents drew the spotlight
this week at the University of
Missouri,

09:02.709 --> 09:09.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the system president
resigned under fire.
Celebrations erupted and
university

09:09.816 --> 09:14.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police called for reporting
hateful or hurtful speech,
including descriptions and even
pictures

09:14.454 --> 09:17.524 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the speakers.

09:17.524 --> 09:22.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But conservatives and civil
libertarians objected, and the
system's new interim head, who
recalled

09:22.729 --> 09:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his own days as a student
protester, addressed the issue
today.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE MIDDLETON, Interim
President, University of
Missouri System: If you're
asking in the

09:29.202 --> 09:38.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
context of the First Amendment
and free speech issues, that's a
very delicate balance. Both

09:38.711 --> 09:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are essential to our way of life
in this country. And the trick
is to find that balance, that

09:49.355 --> 09:57.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
point at which you are
accommodating both interests as
much as you can.

09:57.163 --> 10:03.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Similar concerns
were on display at Yale,
especially after a professor
condemned

10:03.236 --> 10:08.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a dean's warning against
offensive Halloween costumes.
She complained that colleges are

10:08.041 --> 10:09.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
becoming -- quote --
"places of censure."

10:09.642 --> 10:12.212 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Be quiet!

10:12.212 --> 10:15.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That led to a
shouting match last week between
a student and the professor's

10:15.648 --> 10:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
husband, a Yale administrator.

10:18.117 --> 10:17.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: It is not about creating
an intellectual space. It is
not! Do you understand that?

10:17.083 --> 10:21.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's about creating a home here.

10:21.988 --> 10:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A similar uproar
broke out at California's
Claremont McKenna College over

10:30.096 --> 10:35.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
racially insensitive Halloween
apparel. And there were calls at
Vanderbilt in Nashville

10:35.001 --> 10:41.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to suspend a professor who wrote
an op-ed deemed intolerant.

10:41.574 --> 10:46.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Balanced against the speech
concerns are growing protests,
like this one yesterday at
Ithaca

10:46.279 --> 10:51.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
College in Upstate New York over
the use of the word savage to
describe a black speaker

10:51.918 --> 10:56.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at a campus event. And students
nationwide are now taking to
social media, sharing their

10:56.322 --> 11:03.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stories with the hashtag
#blackoncampus.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We explore what's the proper
role of free speech, what goes
too far, and how to strike

11:06.232 --> 11:08.735 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that balance.

11:08.735 --> 11:13.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Greg Lukianoff is the CEO of the
Foundation for Individual Rights
in Education. He is

11:13.806 --> 11:18.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also the co-author of the recent
"Atlantic" magazine cover story
titled "The Coddling

11:18.912 --> 11:24.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the American Mind." And
Jelani Cobb is an associate
professor of history at the
University

11:24.150 --> 11:27.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Connecticut, and a staff
writer for "The New Yorker"
magazine. His most recent
article

11:27.253 --> 11:31.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is "Race and the Free
Speech Diversion."

11:31.024 --> 11:35.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jelani Cobb, Professor Cobb, I
want to start by asking you,
what do you think is the fine

11:35.495 --> 11:39.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
line, or is it a fine line at
all, between free speech and
hate speech?

11:39.999 --> 11:44.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JELANI COBB, University of
Connecticut: Well, it's
interesting. My article wasn't
even really

11:44.070 --> 11:49.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dealing with the question of
hate speech. It was really
dealing with free speech as

11:49.042 --> 11:54.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a virtue, as an ideal, but a way
in which it was being cynically
deployed on campuses

11:54.981 --> 11:57.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to actually avoid talking
about racial issues.

11:57.817 --> 12:04.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we have seen Missouri and
Yale, and the students who have
been reacting to racial

12:04.157 --> 12:08.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crises on their campuses. And
instead of kind of talking about
what's happened to them,

12:08.995 --> 12:12.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the conversation devolved
immediately into a conversation
about the First Amendment.

12:12.899 --> 12:17.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that was what I was
responding to. And, of course,
there is such a thing as hate

12:17.036 --> 12:21.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speech and I think that there's
such a thing as free speech. And
I think there are probably

12:21.174 --> 12:25.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a thousand different ways in
which people differentiate that,
but I don't think that

12:25.378 --> 12:30.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we should go to the kind of
absurdist argument, where --
that anything that someone says
that

12:30.917 --> 12:38.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is remotely, possibly offensive
can be deployed against actual,
like, legitimately, objectively

12:38.491 --> 12:40.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things that are happening
on college campuses.

12:40.693 --> 12:43.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Greg, do you
agree that this is a question of
deflection?

12:43.997 --> 12:46.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG LUKIANOFF, CEO, Foundation
for Individual Rights in
Education: I don't -- I think
it's

12:46.232 --> 12:49.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
unfair to call this is a
diversion, because if you look
at the Yale case -- and I was

12:49.369 --> 12:54.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually on Yale's campus this
time last week -- the two
professors -- one lecturer, one

12:54.073 --> 12:58.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
professor who were involved in
this, Erika Christakis and
Nicholas Christakis, Erika

12:58.511 --> 13:04.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had sent an e-mail to her
students, in my opinion, very
thoughtfully criticizing the

13:04.717 --> 13:08.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
idea that the university should
be telling students how they
dress for Halloween.

13:08.154 --> 13:13.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the context for that is
universities have been telling
students for years not to

13:13.993 --> 13:17.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wear offensive costumes, even
Syracuse University creepily
warning students that they will
be

13:17.130 --> 13:19.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brought up on judicial charges
and essentially forced to strip
if they are found wearing

13:19.465 --> 13:21.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
offensive clothes.

13:21.968 --> 13:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I thought this was a very
thoughtful e-mail. And then what
ended up happening, and I know

13:27.840 --> 13:31.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that this ended up being the
focal point for a lot of other
tensions that were going on,

13:31.611 --> 13:35.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on campus, but I was there for
the confrontation with students.
And there were dozens of
students

13:35.882 --> 13:39.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
surrounding Nicholas Christakis
in the courtyard of the
dormitory.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: We just
saw that event, yes.

13:41.754 --> 13:46.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GREG LUKIANOFF: And it
definitely something where it
was very much directed at Erika.

13:46.059 --> 13:52.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, at the same time people
are saying this is a diversion,
I am perfectly happy

13:52.098 --> 13:56.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to move on to this case as long
as I know that Erika Christakis
and Nicholas Christakis'

13:56.469 --> 14:00.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
job are safe. But when they made
a statement about -- when Yale
made a statement about

14:00.973 --> 14:03.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
freedom of speech at Yale, they
mentioned nothing about the
Christakises.

14:03.142 --> 14:05.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let me ask.

14:05.578 --> 14:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You are in Connecticut, not at
Yale, but the University of
Connecticut. And you have been

14:09.315 --> 14:11.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
following also the University of
Missouri case and talking to
people on both campuses,

14:11.751 --> 14:14.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jelani Cobb.

14:14.053 --> 14:21.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think about that?
How much of this was speaking to
larger ongoing problems,

14:21.127 --> 14:23.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and this question of free speech
was just an example, an excuse
to get to them?

14:23.930 --> 14:26.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JELANI COBB: Sure.

14:26.432 --> 14:30.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I have talked to people, I
have talked to people at
Missouri. I have talked to
students

14:30.069 --> 14:35.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at Yale. I have talked to some
people who are employed as Yale
University as well. And

14:35.508 --> 14:38.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the things that they --
the commonalities there is that
all these people said that these

14:38.644 --> 14:43.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were simply kind of
last straws, events.

14:43.182 --> 14:48.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the Christakis event,
outside of the context in which
people are actually dealing

14:48.821 --> 14:55.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with hostile racial incidents
there, it makes it seen as if
it's kind of an absurdist
reaction

14:55.628 --> 14:58.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by students who are
hypersensitive.

14:58.431 --> 15:04.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, if I could actually make
one other point about Mr.
Lukianoff's article, "The
Coddling

15:04.904 --> 15:09.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the American Mind," they
devote -- and this is about a
5,000-word article, but it

15:09.275 --> 15:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- they devote a great deal of
attention to the ways that
students kind of catastrophize,

15:14.447 --> 15:23.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think is the term they use,
routine slights, so they engage
in emotional reasoning, and

15:23.356 --> 15:28.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all these things which are
really tantamount to a sort of
psychological study of the
offended.

15:28.327 --> 15:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But nowhere in there do they
actually talk about racism, that
people actually experience

15:33.566 --> 15:38.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
racial incidents in which a
rational response would be to be
offended or to believe that

15:38.838 --> 15:41.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this institution is perhaps not
the place for you or to believe
that you are perhaps

15:41.674 --> 15:42.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a hostile environment.

15:42.909 --> 15:46.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Let me allow
Mr. Lukianoff to respond.

15:46.179 --> 15:50.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG LUKIANOFF: Well, actually,
the catastrophizing we talked
about -- and it was closer to a

15:50.516 --> 15:53.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
9,000-word article -- was
administrators catastrophizing.

15:53.452 --> 16:00.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my point in the article was
talking about how, in K-12 and
in college, we have been

16:00.026 --> 16:06.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
teaching a generation of
students that smart people
overreact to relatively small
slights.

16:06.666 --> 16:11.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I talk about examples of a
professor who was suspended
because he posted a picture

16:11.804 --> 16:13.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of his daughter wearing a
"Game of Thrones" T-shirt.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Let me give
you both another example.

16:16.175 --> 16:18.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's an online forum called
Yik Yak where lots of
conversation happens.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GREG LUKIANOFF: Yes.

16:20.046 --> 16:25.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I saw online
today a young woman who was
wearing a copy of a posting

16:25.151 --> 16:30.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which read this way. This is at
USC: "I am confused by black
students without USC athletics

16:30.256 --> 16:33.059 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
backpacks."

16:33.059 --> 16:35.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that something that, in your
definition of this, she should
be -- she is overreacting

16:35.428 --> 16:37.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to, to be offended by?

16:37.630 --> 16:40.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG LUKIANOFF: I think that's
absolutely obnoxious. And I
think if someone were to

16:40.499 --> 16:43.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protest that, we would have
their backs on protesting it.

16:43.135 --> 16:46.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But if the president
of that college then didn't
respond in the way she wanted,

16:46.806 --> 16:48.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jelani Cobb, what then?

16:48.207 --> 16:50.243 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:50.243 --> 16:55.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JELANI COBB: I think what then
happens is what we have seen on
multiple campuses since

16:55.615 --> 16:57.083 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
then.

16:57.083 --> 17:01.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think one of the other
dynamics that was also common in
these places was that they

17:01.120 --> 17:06.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
felt that the administration did
not hear them, that the protests
were kind of a last-ditch

17:06.626 --> 17:10.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
effort, the culmination of lots
of attempts to get the attention
of people who had official

17:10.463 --> 17:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
authority that had fallen short.

17:14.400 --> 17:19.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one other thing that I want
to make clear about this is that
we can kind of take absurdist

17:19.505 --> 17:25.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
examples -- there are plenty of
them -- for anything that we
want to talk about. And what

17:25.411 --> 17:30.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we do is an injustice. We skew
the perception of this actual
legitimate issue by simply

17:30.483 --> 17:35.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going, let's take the example of
someone who is fired the "Game
of Thrones" T-shirt.

17:35.187 --> 17:40.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's not take the example of
Yik Yak being a forum for people
to make horrible, harassing

17:40.026 --> 17:44.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and racial death threats and so
on. And those are actually part
of the same spectrum. So,

17:44.430 --> 17:48.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if we're going to have this
conversation, we need to talk
about the entire spectrum

17:48.801 --> 17:52.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a sense of language and
behavior that is being -- that
is occurring on college
campuses.

17:52.972 --> 17:56.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG LUKIANOFF: Well, let's do
that then and let's talk about a
case where people might

17:56.175 --> 17:59.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disagree -- but just came down
in the last couple of hours.

17:59.812 --> 18:06.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Steven Salaita was a -- a
pro-Palestinian professor who
got a job at University of
Illinois,

18:06.719 --> 18:10.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Urbana-Champaign, where he --
and he was offered a job and
everything was a go. He moved
his

18:10.690 --> 18:13.359 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
family there.

18:13.359 --> 18:17.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was fired for sending out
offensive -- what were
considered to be offensive
tweets

18:17.663 --> 18:23.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about -- that were pro -- that
were anti-Israeli. And he just
settled his case for close to

18:23.102 --> 18:26.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a million dollars just in
the past couple of hours.

18:26.238 --> 18:30.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to me, free speech, First
Amendment -- I'm a First
Amendment lawyer. I deal with
cases,

18:30.609 --> 18:35.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sometimes tough, sometimes --
and an awful lot of ridiculous
cases, not a small number,

18:35.982 --> 18:39.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but also ones that are very
dreadfully serious, like the
Salaita case, where someone was
essentially

18:39.385 --> 18:41.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fired for his unpopular opinion.

18:41.787 --> 18:45.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Was the University
of Missouri case not dreadfully
serious?

18:45.992 --> 18:49.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG LUKIANOFF: Well, the
University of Missouri case, the
angle that I was the most
concerned

18:49.762 --> 18:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about in that one was the
stopping of the student press,
and particularly for a
journalism

18:53.866 --> 18:56.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
professor herself to be one of
the people pushing, trying to
prevent someone was reporting

18:56.836 --> 18:58.404 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the case.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's distressing to those of
us who care about freedom of the

we could go on this.
Unfortunately, this is all that

19:03.275 --> 19:05.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we have the time for.

much.

GWEN IFILL: The conversation
continues tomorrow night, with
the latest in our Race Matters

19:18.324 --> 19:22.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
solutions series. Charlayne
Hunter-Gault sits down with a
professor who focuses on a form

19:22.628 --> 19:38.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of everyday racism called
micro-aggressions.

19:38.677 --> 19:44.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After declaring that its welfare
system was collapsing under the
strain of up to 200,000

19:44.717 --> 19:50.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugees, Sweden today became
the latest European country to
impose border controls. The
nation

19:50.456 --> 19:55.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has accepted more refugees per
capita than any other country on
the continent. But its

19:55.528 --> 20:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appeals to other European
nations to share the burden have
been largely ignored.

20:00.466 --> 20:03.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant reports.

20:03.069 --> 20:07.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Lunchtime today
at Hyllie, the first station in
Sweden across the bridge

20:07.873 --> 20:12.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Denmark, and police begin
border controls over concerns
that the huge refugee influx

20:12.912 --> 20:16.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is endangering law and order and
the country's internal security.

20:16.649 --> 20:22.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: You don't have any I.D.?

20:22.822 --> 20:26.725 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAN: No.

20:26.725 --> 20:31.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Sweden's
increased security has put
another nail in the coffin of
the

20:31.764 --> 20:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Schengen system, which is
supposed to guarantee complete
freedom of movement within most
of

20:36.469 --> 20:40.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the E.U., although police
spokeswoman Ewa Westford played
down the significance.

20:40.906 --> 20:45.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EWA-GUN WESTFORD, Police
Spokeswoman: We are rather a
little bit nervous and a little
bit

20:45.244 --> 20:50.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how should we do it, is it all
right? And we think, yes,
because Sweden would like to

20:50.883 --> 20:55.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a human police, so we are
not going into the trains and
blah, blah, blah.

20:55.888 --> 21:01.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are going into the trains and
say hello and be very polite. We
are looking for people

21:01.327 --> 21:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who will come to Sweden and look
for asylum. We are looking for
people who have I.D. cards.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so they should be
allowed to come here.

21:10.603 --> 21:14.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Who wants to
seek asylum, freedom?

21:14.607 --> 21:19.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: These people
escorted off the train were
being helped seek asylum, even

21:19.645 --> 21:24.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
though many of them didn't seem
to understand the word. This is
only supposed to be a temporary

21:24.817 --> 21:28.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
measure lasting no more than 10
days, but the government does
have the ability to be

21:28.254 --> 21:31.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
able to extend it if it wants.

21:31.490 --> 21:35.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's bound to cause panic
amongst refugees along on the
trail stretching back to Turkey.

21:35.661 --> 21:40.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the question they will be
asking is, is this the start of
the domino effect? Are other

21:40.399 --> 21:45.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries along the line now
also going to institute border
controls?

21:45.571 --> 21:50.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In Malmo, Sweden's most
ethnically diverse city, the new
controls has been welcomed by

21:50.242 --> 21:54.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
retired police chief Torsten
Elopsson, formerly in charge of
criminal intelligence.

21:54.580 --> 21:58.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TORSTEN ELOPSSON, Retired Police
Chief: We don't have the
capacity to take in that many

21:58.851 --> 22:03.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people that we are at the
moment. The public services are
overloaded. You have the social

22:03.989 --> 22:10.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
workers that are down on their
knees. You have the education
system that is challenged.

22:10.029 --> 22:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have job opportunities that
are very low. Right now, we
don't know actually who is
coming

22:15.000 --> 22:23.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the country. They just
vanish, disappear. We don't have
any control over the situation

22:23.342 --> 22:29.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in that sense. What will happen
to those people that are living
here illegally? They have

22:29.582 --> 22:34.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to support themselves one way or
the other. The fear is that you
will have more criminality,

22:34.787 --> 22:37.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more social disorder.

22:37.856 --> 22:42.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Refugees
expecting to start their new
lives in the bustling Swedish
metropolis

22:42.895 --> 22:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
face disappointment. For
thousands, their first homes
will be tents like these deep

22:47.766 --> 22:52.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the countryside of one of the
coldest countries on earth, and
the Swedes have delayed erecting

22:52.504 --> 22:57.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heated and insulated tents
because of planning commission
concerns.

22:57.643 --> 23:02.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the past year, anti-immigrant
extremists have set fire to more
than 20 places across

23:02.848 --> 23:08.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sweden that either housed
refugees or were intended as
temporary shelters. The
country's

23:08.454 --> 23:12.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
migration board is now refusing
to say where it will accommodate
newcomers because of the

23:12.391 --> 23:16.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fear of arson.

23:16.462 --> 23:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Despite ministers saying that
Sweden is on the verge of
collapse, Hillevi Larsson, who

23:20.266 --> 23:26.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
represents Malmo in Parliament,
remains upbeat about her
nation's generosity toward
refugees.

23:26.171 --> 23:30.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLEVI LARSSON, Social Democrat
M.P.: Absolutely convinced that
we can do it, because we have

23:30.643 --> 23:36.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the experiences from the '90s,
when we took many refugees in a
short time, so we have

23:36.348 --> 23:43.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
learned from that, and now we
have many old people. Somebody
has to support them, and

23:43.022 --> 23:47.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now we have many refugees coming
who are young, well-educated
people. So I think they could

23:47.559 --> 23:50.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really benefit the
Swedish economy.

23:50.663 --> 23:56.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Don't you think
Sweden and Germany have really
made a huge mistake in

23:56.268 --> 24:00.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opening the doors wide open?
Because you have sent a signal
to every person who is
disenfranchised

24:00.472 --> 24:05.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the world that Europe is
wide open, and it's showing that
it can't cope.

24:05.311 --> 24:11.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLEVI LARSSON: No, I think
it's is the opposite. I think
that will send a message to
other

24:11.183 --> 24:14.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
countries that they also
have to take responsibility.

24:14.653 --> 24:20.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Another
station, another country, more
refugees and migrants. This

24:20.559 --> 24:24.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the Rostock in Northern
Germany, the end of the line on
the Baltic Sea coast, a port

24:24.229 --> 24:28.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
city with ferry links to Sweden.

24:28.834 --> 24:31.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Actor Tobias Hamann is one of
dozens of volunteers helping to
speed the passengers on their
way

24:31.937 --> 24:33.772 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
north.

24:33.772 --> 24:37.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOBIAS HAMANN, Actor: Many of
them want to hurry. They are
afraid that they will close

24:37.943 --> 24:42.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the doors totally to Sweden.
They all want to be very quick.
And they -- sometimes they

24:42.915 --> 24:45.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are a little bit afraid that
they won't make it in time
because there are not too many

24:45.584 --> 24:48.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
places on the ferries.

24:48.354 --> 24:53.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Fighting
between the Taliban and the
national army in the Afghan city
of

24:53.058 --> 24:57.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kunduz has driven this family of
seven to seek refuge in
Scandinavia. The family
spokesman

24:57.496 --> 25:00.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is 17-year-old Qais Ahmadiar.

25:00.132 --> 25:08.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QAIS AHMADIAR, Refugee: We want
to go to Sweden because I feel
they're -- I feel good here,

25:08.741 --> 25:13.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and also our brother and
family is also here.

25:13.479 --> 25:16.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This was one of
the last ferries to leave
Rostock before the Swedish

25:16.115 --> 25:19.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government tightened
its borders.

25:19.051 --> 25:24.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Swedes have told refugees
that they should consider
staying in Germany or elsewhere,

25:24.523 --> 25:29.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because they can't be guaranteed
accommodation. But the message
has not filtered downer the

25:29.027 --> 25:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
line. Keeping a keen watch on
Sweden's crisis is Marcus Knuth,
the integration spokesman

25:34.333 --> 25:38.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the center-right Danish
government, which has slashed
welfare benefits and tightened

25:38.837 --> 25:42.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rules governing family
reunification in order to make
the country less attractive

25:42.441 --> 25:45.911 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to refugees.

25:45.911 --> 25:50.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sweden is going to be asking
other nations to take its
migrants. Will you take them?

25:50.048 --> 25:53.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCUS KNUTH, Danish Government
Official: No, because we think
Sweden has basically

25:53.218 --> 25:57.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put itself in the situation that
they're in. I think it's a bit
ironic that first they

25:57.756 --> 26:04.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say to the world's refugees come
here, and then when they receive
close to 200,000, their

26:04.163 --> 26:06.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
system collapses and then they
say, well, we don't want them
anyway, now other European

26:06.999 --> 26:09.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
countries need to take them.

26:09.168 --> 26:13.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have taken our fair share of
the burden and we will continue
to do so, but Sweden

26:13.872 --> 26:17.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has put itself in the
situation that they're in.

26:17.309 --> 26:21.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Politicians
from the Danish People's Party
like Soren Espersen determine

26:21.613 --> 26:27.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether the minority government
in Copenhagen survives or falls.
Espersen and his party

26:27.119 --> 26:30.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are angry that the Danish prime
minister has so far ruled out
introducing border controls

26:30.656 --> 26:32.825 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

26:32.825 --> 26:38.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOREN ESPERSEN, Danish People's
Party: I believe that Europe is
in total chaos. Germany, Sweden,

26:38.163 --> 26:43.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the two countries that's mainly
caused this problem, and now
Sweden, of course, introducing

26:43.368 --> 26:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
border control, it will mean
that we have to do the same,
but, unfortunately, our prime

26:48.507 --> 26:52.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
minister behaves like an
ostrich, like so many other
political leaders in Europe do

26:52.411 --> 26:54.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the moment.

26:54.246 --> 26:58.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Back in
Rostock, there is acute
awareness that Swede's new
measures

26:58.217 --> 27:02.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could lead to more refugees
requiring shelter on the city's
dime.

27:02.688 --> 27:07.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Mayor Roland Methling is a
staunch advocate of Germany's
open door policy to migrants.

27:07.292 --> 27:10.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROLAND METHLING, Mayor of
Rostock, Germany: Yes, it would
be a German problem. That would

27:10.195 --> 27:18.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be a European problem if Sweden
were to close their own borders.
I'm sure we can solve this

27:18.270 --> 27:23.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
problem, not only in Rostock,
but you have to solve it in
Germany.

27:23.742 --> 27:30.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But at least we can solve this
problem only if we could find a
common way in Europe and

27:30.315 --> 27:34.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least we have to find a
common way, and not only in
Europe. We have to find the
common

27:34.853 --> 27:41.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way with the United States, with
Russia, with China. And only in
this combination we could

27:41.193 --> 27:46.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
build up a future to every
people or this world. Everybody
has a right to live in a

27:46.732 --> 27:49.535 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
human world.

27:49.535 --> 27:55.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This new video
from the anti-immigrant Sweden
Democrats opposition party shows
their

27:55.107 --> 28:00.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members on the refugees trail
urging would-be asylum seekers
to stay away. But these images

28:00.546 --> 28:04.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from Hyllie station send
a more powerful message.

28:04.149 --> 28:10.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant in Sweden.

28:10.789 --> 28:21.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

28:21.767 --> 28:26.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
actress Juliette Binoche takes
on Greek tragedy; and honors

28:26.939 --> 28:32.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a soldier who tackled a
suicide bomber and saved his
platoon.

28:32.077 --> 28:38.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, first, how a simple
experiment in India has turned
into a radical idea, whether
students

28:38.684 --> 28:43.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should teach themselves by
giving them a computer and
stepping back.

Economics correspondent Paul
Solman reports, part of our
Making Sense series, which airs

28:47.292 --> 28:49.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
every Thursday on
the "NewsHour."

28:49.795 --> 28:53.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT: Why do dogs chase cats?

28:53.265 --> 28:57.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: I have
absolutely no idea.

28:57.402 --> 29:03.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A public elementary school in
Harlem, New York, is adopting a
radical idea that threatens

29:03.141 --> 29:08.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the education industry as we
know it, SOLEs, Self-Organized
Learning Environments.

29:08.213 --> 29:12.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUDENT: How do you
make a computer?

29:12.918 --> 29:18.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STUDENT: How come father
seahorses have babies, but the
females don't?

29:18.023 --> 29:20.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The students come
up with the questions, and then
choose one to answer.

29:20.592 --> 29:25.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The man behind the idea, Sugata
Mitra, visiting from England.

29:25.797 --> 29:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUGATA MITRA, Education Reform
Advocate: OK, so now here's
what's going to happen. Listen

29:28.333 --> 29:33.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
carefully. You're going to work
with these six computers; the
question is, why do dogs

29:33.772 --> 29:38.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chase cats? And, of course, you
can talk as much as you like,
you can walk around, you

29:38.877 --> 29:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can move, you can look at other
people's work. You can do
whatever you like.

29:43.448 --> 29:49.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: A crowd of
onlookers in a nearby room,
waiting to know if, given six
computers

29:49.755 --> 29:53.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and just 20 minutes, these kids
can really self- organize and
learn the answer on their

29:53.592 --> 29:55.460 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
own.

29:55.460 --> 29:58.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUGATA MITRA: Do you have any
idea? I have never actually
thought about it. Of course,

29:58.797 --> 30:01.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
everyone knows that
dogs chase cats.

30:01.366 --> 30:08.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: No. My guess is
cats are a symbol of something
they could eat, but don't eat?

30:08.974 --> 30:12.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't know. That's
my best shot.

30:12.544 --> 30:18.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mitra's first experiment in
self-organized learning took
place years ago and far away,

30:18.016 --> 30:22.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the turn of the 21st century
here in Delhi, where he worked
for a huge Indian software

30:22.287 --> 30:24.956 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
firm.

30:24.956 --> 30:29.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Worried about information
poverty and the digital divide
between those who can afford

30:29.895 --> 30:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
computers and those who can't,
Mitra simply cut a hole in the
boundary wall between his

30:35.367 --> 30:40.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
firm and the fetid slum next
door and put in a computer,
connected to the Internet,

30:40.639 --> 30:42.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and watched.

30:42.174 --> 30:47.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUGATA MITRA: I put it there and
we opened it, and by the same
evening, Vivek (ph), who

30:47.412 --> 30:52.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was doing the main observation,
came back and said that the kids
are browsing. And by

30:52.317 --> 30:55.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the second day, a whole bunch of
kids were browsing and doing
various functions.

30:55.654 --> 31:01.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So Mitra built more
holes in more walls, 1,000 more,
in fact, which led

31:01.059 --> 31:05.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to more experiments,
and more questions.

31:05.330 --> 31:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUGATA MITRA: The hole in the
wall experiment showed that
children can learn to use
computers

31:09.401 --> 31:13.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the Internet on their own.
What else could they learn?

31:13.205 --> 31:19.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Meanwhile, back in
Harlem, the kids are hard at it,
the clock ticking.

31:19.211 --> 31:34.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: Well, cats are small
and even though they have nails,
dogs are like the males.

31:34.626 --> 31:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: We should only try to
get the most correct answer.

31:41.633 --> 31:46.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: He might injure the
cat by biting it too hard.

31:46.505 --> 31:48.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUDENT: It says, others
preserve cats as prey.

31:48.073 --> 31:48.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUDENT: A dog-cat fight
can be devastating.

31:48.974 --> 31:49.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENTS: P-E-R-C-E-I-V-E.

31:49.174 --> 31:51.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Thank you.

31:51.176 --> 31:52.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: Write it in your own
words. And we need to hurry up.
There's only seven minutes.

31:52.978 --> 31:53.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's concentrate.

31:53.311 --> 31:55.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANNOUNCER: This is CNN.

31:55.347 --> 32:00.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The hole in the wall experiments
made Mitra famous, a star on the
stage, a threat to the

32:00.619 --> 32:03.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
education industry as
the world knows it.

32:03.455 --> 32:09.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUGATA MITRA: Could it be that
we don't need to go to school at
all? Could it be that at

32:09.561 --> 32:15.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the point in time when you need
to know something, you can find
out in two minutes? Could it

32:15.634 --> 32:20.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be that we're headed towards or
may be in a future where knowing
is obsolete?

32:20.405 --> 32:23.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Knowing obsolete?
We don't need schools?

32:23.141 --> 32:24.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE TRUCANO, Senior Education
and Technology Policy
Specialist, World Bank: I think
it's

32:24.576 --> 32:27.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
irresponsible to say we
can do without teachers.

32:27.712 --> 32:31.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Mike Trucano has
worked on global education
technology for the World Bank
for

32:31.082 --> 32:33.285 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
20 years.

32:33.285 --> 32:38.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE TRUCANO: The answer isn't
technology. The answer is
providing children with a rich

32:38.557 --> 32:42.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learning environment, with a
highly capable, competent,
committed teacher there
alongside

32:42.327 --> 32:45.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them to help guide
their learning.

32:45.330 --> 32:50.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thinking that technology alone
and kids left to their own
devices can educate themselves

32:50.235 --> 32:55.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the way that we hope and
become the types of people they
want to be, I think, is
ludicrous.

32:55.006 --> 33:00.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In fact, Mitra has
adapted. Two years ago, he began
building schools in the

33:00.512 --> 33:06.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cloud. There are now seven, five
in India, two in the U.K., where
a teacher gets groups

33:06.751 --> 33:12.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of children to self-organize
into learning environments and
investigate almost anything,

33:12.123 --> 33:16.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SOLEs or, you might say,
holes in the classroom.

33:16.494 --> 33:20.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this school's principal,
Natasha Spann, was still a
devout skeptic when she first

33:20.432 --> 33:23.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
heard of Mitra's lab
for self-learning.

33:23.368 --> 33:26.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATASHA SPANN, Principal,
PS-197: So, when I first heard
that, I said, get out of here.

33:26.605 --> 33:27.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:27.772 --> 33:29.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NATASHA SPANN: And I said,
no, really, get out of here.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:30.876 --> 33:35.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATASHA SPANN: We were already
what was considered a focus
school, according to New York
state,

33:35.547 --> 33:41.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which was a failing school. So,
for me to pitch the idea to my
superintendent that I'm

33:41.319 --> 33:45.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to completely get rid of
all of the desks and chairs in a
classroom and have kids

33:45.590 --> 33:51.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work together by themselves,
absent of the teacher, on
different levels, that was like,

33:51.296 --> 33:54.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think so. That's
not happening here.

33:54.032 --> 33:58.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Meanwhile, in this
classroom, time was running out,
the students finishing

33:58.270 --> 34:00.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up their findings, prepping
their conclusions.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Two minutes.

34:02.941 --> 34:06.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It was time for
the final presentations.

34:06.278 --> 34:13.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUGATA MITRA: Why do dogs chase
cats? Who would you like to make
the first presentation?

34:13.518 --> 34:21.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: A dog can grab and
easily wound or kill the cat by
crushing her in his jaws.

34:21.693 --> 34:26.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: He might injure a cat
by biting too hard even in play.

34:26.798 --> 34:31.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: Like many things dogs
do, chasing cats is instinctual.

34:31.403 --> 34:35.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUGATA MITRA: They are the first
group who are trying to explain
why.

34:35.573 --> 34:39.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: Some want to play with
the cat. Others perceive cats as
prey and will harm a cat

34:39.411 --> 34:42.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if they catch her.

34:42.514 --> 34:45.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUGATA MITRA: Do you see now
that every group actually was
adding to everybody else and

34:45.917 --> 34:49.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
building up a whole
-- whole picture?

34:49.120 --> 34:52.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Following the SOLE
demonstration, we had our own
question.

34:52.557 --> 34:55.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But it's got to be scary
to a lot of teachers, no?

34:55.727 --> 34:59.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUIMANI MILLS, Teacher: When
I first did SOLE, so scary.

34:59.297 --> 35:02.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Suimani
Mills teaches at PS-197.

35:02.267 --> 35:07.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUIMANI MILLS: They utilized the
skills that we gave them without
our assistance.

35:07.372 --> 35:10.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Leana Borges
also teaches here.

35:10.842 --> 35:15.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEANA BORGES, Teacher: Those
critical thinking skills are
what students need teachers for.

35:15.513 --> 35:18.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what -- that's the
coaching that we do. And then
they apply those principles
within

35:18.683 --> 35:20.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the SOLE lab.

35:20.618 --> 35:26.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUIMANI MILLS: This is the part
where you test yourself as a
teacher, and you have to

35:26.958 --> 35:30.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
walk away from your garden and
let them flower and grow.

35:30.762 --> 35:34.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: As to the
school's skeptical principal:

35:34.299 --> 35:39.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATASHA SPANN: Once I got to see
them actually in a session with
the question and the learning

35:39.237 --> 35:42.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that came out of it, I said, we
have to have this at my school.

35:42.841 --> 35:44.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZINA BURTON-MYRICK, United
Federation of Teachers: I was
seriously surprised that there
wasn't

35:44.976 --> 35:48.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an adult saying, you go to this
group or you go to this group.

35:48.380 --> 35:52.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But did union rep
Zina Burton-Myrick, here to
watch from the United Federation
of

35:52.517 --> 35:55.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Teachers, see a threat
to her profession?

35:55.286 --> 36:00.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZINA BURTON-MYRICK: I would have
thought that it would have posed
a threat. But after seeing

36:00.358 --> 36:05.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it and looking at how useful a
program like this would be, I
think that it's something

36:05.230 --> 36:07.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I would love to see in
other schools in the Harlem
community.

36:07.999 --> 36:12.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: So does
Sugata Mitra disagree?

36:12.170 --> 36:16.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Doesn't this threaten to destroy
one of the largest industries on
Earth?

36:16.875 --> 36:22.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUGATA MITRA: Yes. If you're
talking about the education
industry, yes, they are under

36:22.013 --> 36:28.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
threat. They are under threat
not of destruction, but of
imminent change. They'd better
do it

36:28.553 --> 36:30.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if they have to survive.

36:30.588 --> 36:33.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, is it the
beginning of a revolution?

36:33.558 --> 36:39.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE TRUCANO: I think the jury's
still out. We see amazing things
happen from technology

36:39.631 --> 36:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
use, but we also need to be a
bit sober in what's actually
possible and separating the

36:44.736 --> 36:47.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hope from the hype. Just because
something is new and different
doesn't necessarily make

36:47.338 --> 36:49.507 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it better.

36:49.507 --> 36:55.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But for this group
of students, more than a third
classified as special needs,

36:55.713 --> 37:02.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fully half living in shelters,
all of them poor, self-learning
is new, different and

37:02.120 --> 37:04.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
perhaps better as well.

37:04.989 --> 37:10.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: Sometimes, when you're
stuck, a group -- your group can
help you out.

37:10.595 --> 37:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: From PS-197 in
Harlem, New York, this is

GWEN IFILL: President Obama
awarded the Medal of Honor today
to retired Army Captain Florent

37:35.120 --> 37:40.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Groberg for risking his life to
stop a suicide bomber in
Afghanistan.

37:40.592 --> 37:46.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The 32-year-old French-born
soldier, who often goes by Flo,
is just the 10th living service

37:46.998 --> 37:53.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
member to receive the nation's
highest military honor for
actions in Afghanistan or Iraq.

37:53.371 --> 37:56.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: And so it was on
an August day three years

37:56.708 --> 38:02.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago that Flo found himself
leading a group of American and
Afghan soldiers as they escorted

38:02.046 --> 38:06.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their commanders to a
meeting with local Afghans.

38:06.351 --> 38:11.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a journey that the team
had done many times before -- a
short walk on foot, including

38:11.556 --> 38:15.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
passage over a narrow bridge.

38:15.293 --> 38:20.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Flo noticed something to his
left -- a man, dressed in dark
clothing, walking backwards,

38:20.798 --> 38:26.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just some 10 feet away. The man
spun around and turned toward
them, and that's when Flo

38:26.804 --> 38:31.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sprinted toward him. He pushed
him away from the formation, and
as he did, he noticed an

38:31.843 --> 38:36.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
object under the man's
clothing -- a bomb.

38:36.581 --> 38:39.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at that moment, Flo did
something extraordinary -- he
grabbed the bomber by his vest
and kept

38:39.517 --> 38:43.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pushing him away.

38:43.655 --> 38:48.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of Flo's comrades, Sergeant
Andrew Mahoney, had joined in,
too, and together they shoved

38:48.526 --> 38:52.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the bomber again and again. And
they pushed him so hard he fell
to the ground onto his

38:52.530 --> 38:56.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
chest. And then the
bomb detonated.

38:56.201 --> 39:02.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ball bearings, debris, dust
exploded everywhere. Flo was
thrown some 15 or 20 feet and
was

39:02.740 --> 39:06.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
knocked unconscious. And moments
later, he woke up in the middle
of the road in shock.

39:06.644 --> 39:10.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His eardrum was blown out. His
leg was broken and bleeding
badly.

39:10.748 --> 39:17.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That blast by the bridge claimed
four American heroes -- four
heroes Flo wants us to remember

39:17.188 --> 39:19.324 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

39:19.324 --> 39:26.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of his mentors, a 24-year
Army vet, Command Sergeant Major
Kevin Griffin.

39:26.998 --> 39:31.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A West Pointer who loved hockey
and became a role model to
cadets and troops because

39:31.402 --> 39:36.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he always cared more about other
people than himself, Major Tom
Kennedy.

39:36.674 --> 39:43.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A popular Air Force leader known
for smiling with his whole face,
Major David Gray.

39:43.681 --> 39:49.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, finally, a USAID foreign
service officer, a man who moved
to the United States from

39:49.420 --> 39:57.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Egypt and reveled in everything
American, Ragaei Abdelfattah.

39:57.929 --> 40:04.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We honor Flo because his actions
prevented an even greater
catastrophe. You see, by pushing

40:04.702 --> 40:09.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the bomber away from the
formation, the explosion
occurred farther from our
forces, and on the

40:09.907 --> 40:15.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ground instead of in the open
air. And while Flo didn't know
it at the time, that explosion

40:15.113 --> 40:21.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also caused a second, unseen
bomb to detonate before it was
in place.

40:21.052 --> 40:26.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The truth is, Flo says that day
was the worst day of his life.
And that is the stark reality

40:26.791 --> 40:33.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behind these Medal of Honor
ceremonies, because on his very
worst day, he managed to summon

40:33.698 --> 40:42.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his very best. That's the nature
of courage, not being unafraid,
but confronting fear and

40:42.940 --> 40:49.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
danger and performing
in a selfless fashion.

40:49.080 --> 40:53.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He showed his guts. He showed
his training, how he would put
it all on the line for his

40:53.985 --> 40:57.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teammates. That's an American
we can all be grateful for.

40:57.155 --> 41:02.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's why we honor Captain
Florent Groberg today.

41:02.760 --> 41:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: The president of the United
States of America, authorized by
act of Congress, March

41:08.900 --> 41:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
3, 1863, has awarded in the name
of Congress the Medal of Honor
to Captain Florent A. Groberg,

41:12.704 --> 41:14.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
United States Army.

41:14.172 --> 41:16.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

41:16.674 --> 41:25.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAPT. FLORENT GROBERG, U.S.
Army: This medal is the greatest
honor you could ever receive.

41:25.083 --> 41:30.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I am blessed and just
grateful to have been given the
opportunity to serve my country.

41:30.822 --> 41:36.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this medal belongs to the
true heroes, Command Sergeant
Griffin, Major Gray, Major

41:36.928 --> 41:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kennedy, and Ragaei Abdelfattah,
who made the ultimate sacrifice
and didn't come home.

41:42.033 --> 41:47.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It also belongs to their
families, the true heroes who
live with that day every day
missing

41:47.138 --> 41:49.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one of the key members
of their families.

41:49.907 --> 41:59.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I'm honored. I'm overwhelmed,
but I hope to become the right
carrier for them and better

41:59.250 --> 42:12.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
myself as a human being for
the rest of my life for them.

42:12.530 --> 42:21.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: She's one of the
most well-known French actresses
of her generation, and she

42:21.005 --> 42:25.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has carved an unusual and
distinct career path.

42:25.443 --> 42:30.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Juliette Binoche has appeared in
more than 40 feature films, the
latest of which, "The

42:30.681 --> 42:35.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
33," opens tomorrow. It's about
the 33 Chilean miners who were
trapped underground for 69

42:35.353 --> 42:38.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
days in 2010.

42:38.990 --> 42:42.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, Binoche is
focused on new stage work,
taking on the role of a
classical

42:42.527 --> 42:45.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
heroine in a Greek tragedy.

42:45.163 --> 42:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She sat down recently
with Jeffrey Brown.

42:48.933 --> 42:58.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: If a man puts family or
friends ahead of fatherland, I
count him absolutely good

42:58.843 --> 43:01.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for nothing.

43:01.279 --> 43:06.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A political
leader, King Creon, declares
that the security of the state
must

43:06.184 --> 43:10.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take precedence over individual
need, and orders that the body
of a slain rebel not

43:10.455 --> 43:12.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be given burial rites.

43:12.156 --> 43:14.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTOR: You dare to
disobey the law?

43:14.992 --> 43:20.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIETTE BINOCHE, Actress: What
they call law didn't begin today
or yesterday. When

43:20.965 --> 43:26.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they say law, they do not
mean a statute of today.

43:26.471 --> 43:30.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The rebel's
sister, named Antigone, and
played here by Juliette Binoche,
defies

43:30.641 --> 43:34.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that order and buries her
brother, leading to her own
death.

43:34.512 --> 43:39.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIETTE BINOCHE: She has this
need of remembering where we
come from, the origin of where
we

43:39.717 --> 43:42.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
come from, and where
we're going back to.

43:42.720 --> 43:49.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the play is an immense -- is
reaching immense subjects of
what we go through.

43:49.727 --> 43:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The playwright
Sophocles wrote Antigone in
Athens, Greece, some 2,500 years

43:54.966 --> 43:59.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago, and it has resonated with
audiences and actors ever since,
including Binoche, one

43:59.770 --> 44:05.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of today's leading
international actresses.

44:05.610 --> 44:09.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
At the Kennedy Center in
Washington, D.C., she recently
wrapped up a tour of the play

44:09.080 --> 44:13.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that took her to cities
around Europe and the U.S.

44:13.084 --> 44:17.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So what is the attraction for
you to do an ancient play like
this?

44:17.655 --> 44:23.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIETTE BINOCHE: Well, because
the myths put you into a
teaching of what is -- what

44:23.394 --> 44:26.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are we doing here on this Earth?
It's about transformation

44:26.264 --> 44:28.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's
a big question.

44:28.199 --> 44:32.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIETTE BINOCHE: It's a big
question, but we here, all --
all of us, we're trying to

44:32.003 --> 44:38.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
find out. And, of course, the
outside world wants us to go
here and there and spread
ourselves.

44:38.976 --> 44:44.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But somehow we have to make a
relationship within ourselves.
And plays and art are helping

44:44.549 --> 44:48.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make this link, to think,
to feel, to reconnect.

44:48.352 --> 44:51.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTOR: You're in love
with him aren't you?

44:51.822 --> 44:58.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIETTE BINOCHE: I'm not in
love with him. I am in love with
ghosts. It's so easy. He's

44:58.863 --> 45:01.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
another ghost.

45:01.365 --> 45:05.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Binoche, now 51,
is best known for her
Oscar-winning supporting actress
role

45:05.570 --> 45:09.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the 1996 film "The
English Patient."

45:09.440 --> 45:15.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIETTE BINOCHE: And these are
for your husband, and refined
cacao nibs from Guatemala to
awaken

45:15.613 --> 45:18.583 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the passion.

45:18.583 --> 45:21.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTRESS: You have obviously
never met my husband.

45:21.586 --> 45:25.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIETTE BINOCHE: You have
obviously never tried these.

45:25.356 --> 45:31.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And an
Oscar-nominated best actress
performance in the 2000 comedy
"Chocolat."

45:31.362 --> 45:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's had a prolific movie
career, from big budget hits to
obscure art house films, that

45:36.601 --> 45:40.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continues, as strong as ever, to
this day. But she's also
regularly gone back to the

45:40.605 --> 45:42.273 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
theater.

45:42.273 --> 45:45.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIETTE BINOCHE: It's true.
Sometimes, I say yes to a
project, and I don't really know

45:45.309 --> 45:47.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
why I said yes. But the
intuition tells you.

45:47.612 --> 45:48.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?
You don't know why?

45:48.746 --> 45:53.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIETTE BINOCHE: No. The
intuition tells you, so that the
intuition brings you into

45:53.584 --> 45:57.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this unknown. But yet, as you're
going and you're discovering
what you're doing, this

45:57.989 --> 46:03.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is it. This is why I said yes to
it. And it suddenly becomes very
meaningful.

46:03.127 --> 46:13.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look at what is happening to me,
and look at the men who are
doing it.

46:13.070 --> 46:17.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The production of
"Antigone" directed by Ivo van
Hove was a spare one in

46:17.808 --> 46:21.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
its language, its
movement, its set.

46:21.045 --> 46:25.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I asked Binoche if she liked the
quiet of this onstage world as a
contrast to the noise

46:25.883 --> 46:27.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of much of today's
entertainment.

46:27.218 --> 46:28.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JULIETTE BINOCHE: I
love everything.

46:28.285 --> 46:30.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You
love everything?

46:30.488 --> 46:35.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIETTE BINOCHE: I don't put
things aside. No, I think it's
another -- it's like painting.

46:35.893 --> 46:40.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, you love different
styles, because it shows
someone's need to express
something.

46:40.931 --> 46:48.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I feel the need, that's
beyond style. I don't care where
it comes from, which country,

46:48.406 --> 46:51.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what period, because
it has truth.

46:51.876 --> 46:56.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The reference to
painting is a personal one.
Binoche did her own paintings

46:56.147 --> 47:01.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a film in which she played
an artist, and has even had
exhibitions of her work.

47:01.986 --> 47:08.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Curious or restless, she's
thrown herself into all kinds of
things, including performing

47:08.893 --> 47:12.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on stage in contemporary dance.

47:12.263 --> 47:19.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIETTE BINOCHE: I like to
confront myself with new
perspectives and possibilities,
because

47:19.170 --> 47:26.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, we're alive, so let's
do it now. And we have so many
possibilities. So, I don't

47:26.911 --> 47:30.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like to stay in one
comfortable place.

47:30.347 --> 47:35.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There is much
discussion, again, about --
especially about women actresses

47:35.519 --> 47:42.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aging, not getting as many good
roles, what happens to them. Do
you even think about that?

47:42.927 --> 47:50.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIETTE BINOCHE: I think if you
keep yourself creative -- I
mean, I have aged, you know?

47:50.167 --> 47:57.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have had experience. And so
it's not as if I'm not facing
it.

47:57.308 --> 48:03.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's not a fear, because
time is a tool to grow. If you
don't have that tool, how

48:03.647 --> 48:11.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can you grow? How can you
transform? So you have to
believe that time is your best
friend.

48:11.088 --> 48:15.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Imagine if you have to die when
you're young. You feel like,
wow. What I have learned with

48:15.059 --> 48:18.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
time is amazing.

48:18.062 --> 48:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Juliette Binoche, thank you so
much.

48:23.400 --> 48:30.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIETTE BINOCHE: Thank you.

48:30.608 --> 48:38.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight,
another installment in our
series of "NewsHour" essays.

48:38.115 --> 48:42.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Essays are part of a long
tradition on the "NewsHour," and
in the coming weeks and months,

48:42.386 --> 48:47.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we hope to bring you a range of
voices as varied as the ideas
they will share with you.

48:47.424 --> 48:52.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, author Ylonda Gault
shares her view on a
particularly challenging
personality:

48:52.096 --> 48:53.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the bragging parent.

48:53.898 --> 48:59.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YLONDA GAULT, Author: It will
start innocently, a chance
run-in.

48:59.036 --> 49:03.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will see a fellow mom at the
grocery store or the park, maybe
a coffee shop. I will say,

49:03.841 --> 49:08.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hey, girl. We will hug. At least
I will, because I'm a hugger.

49:08.212 --> 49:13.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will compliment her outfit.
She may notice my new
highlights. We will trade
innocent

49:13.384 --> 49:20.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gossip. I will ask about her
work, then the family, to which
she will respond with a sigh,

49:20.891 --> 49:26.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as though fatigued, because, for
moms, every season touts tired
as the new black.

49:26.931 --> 49:35.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thus begins the humble brag,
feigning exasperation. Said mom
will half-giggle and wax
self-mocking.

49:35.005 --> 49:42.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, Sophie scored 2,200 on her
MDNM SATs, despite this slacker
mom, who forgot to get

49:42.746 --> 49:46.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new calculator batteries. And
Zach's fourth grade teacher
recommended him for advanced

49:46.717 --> 49:49.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
calculus.

49:49.320 --> 49:53.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, his dad and I don't
still get new math, old math, or
even everyday math. These

49:53.824 --> 49:57.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kids, I tell you.

49:57.361 --> 50:05.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A wan smile will wash over my
face. It's the expression I
usually reserve for my
8-year-old

50:05.069 --> 50:11.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when he's regaling with my
intricate details of obscure
superheroes and their powers.

50:11.041 --> 50:16.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When she laughs and throws her
head back, I do the same thing
on the outside. Inside,

50:16.280 --> 50:23.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wince, and whisper to myself,
bless her heart, as momma would
say.

50:23.687 --> 50:29.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For black people, those sweet
little words are a nice way of
saying, how pitiful.

50:29.493 --> 50:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a gracious phrase, and I
mean it in the best possible
way, because a part of me truly

50:35.633 --> 50:41.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aches to see a grown woman,
smart and accomplished in her
own right, boasting about her
children

50:41.505 --> 50:45.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as though they were prized
heifers at the county fair.

50:45.109 --> 50:51.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's odd to me, because,
growing up, momma always played
down what my siblings and I

50:51.415 --> 50:58.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did. It may be a black thing,
but I think it's also an
old-school thing. No one wanted

50:58.455 --> 51:02.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their kids to get too
big-headed, I suppose.

51:02.626 --> 51:08.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Importantly, parenting wasn't an
extreme sport back in the day.
And, remember, there was

51:08.832 --> 51:14.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no Facebook. Social media posts
are the lifeblood of the humble
braggart.

51:14.672 --> 51:20.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I get it. They feel less secure
in their own worth, so tethered
are the kiddos to their

51:20.110 --> 51:25.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own self-image, the offsprings'
accomplishments become their
own.

51:25.749 --> 51:32.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Intellectually, I know most
studies will show that mothers
and fathers hell-bent on this

51:32.189 --> 51:37.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
image of perfection desperately
need the world to take note of
their kids' awesomeness. It's

51:37.528 --> 51:45.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a way of saying, see, my kids
are great. Therefore, I am
great. Look at me. See? I'm a
great parent.

51:45.402 --> 51:48.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Really, I am.

51:48.706 --> 51:56.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do they believe it? Sadly, I
don't think so. It's not that
these parents don't have good

51:56.580 --> 52:03.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kids. I mean, all kids are good,
right, just like all babies are
-- ahem -- cute.

52:03.120 --> 52:10.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
See, all moms lie. As the humble
braggart prattles on, I pretend
to listen. And when

52:10.361 --> 52:19.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she's done, I put on my best
girlfriend face and try to sound
super astonished. I say,

52:19.903 --> 52:27.511 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wow. Go, you.

52:27.511 --> 52:35.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online: Earlier this week, we
introduced you to a man who's

52:35.319 --> 52:40.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
walking around the world. Paul
Salopek isn't trying to set a
record. He's walking to tell

52:40.224 --> 52:44.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the stories of the people and
places he encounters along the
way.

52:44.795 --> 52:50.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's already logged about 4,000
miles. What's it like? You can
ask him yourself at 1:00

52:50.401 --> 52:54.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
p.m. Eastern tomorrow on our
Twitter chat with National
Geographic. Details are on our

52:54.338 --> 52:57.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
home page.

52:57.708 --> 53:03.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And 65 years after Charles
Schulz introduced the world to
Charlie Brown, the gang is
reunited

53:03.514 --> 53:08.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the big screen in the form of
"The Peanuts Movie." To
celebrate, we have compiled
eight

53:08.252 --> 53:15.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things you didn't know about
Snoopy and the gang. That's on
our home page, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:15.859 --> 53:19.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tune in later tonight on
"Charlie Rose": more on the
fight against ISIS in Iraq and
efforts

53:19.630 --> 53:22.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to reclaim a key city.

53:22.800 --> 53:25.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:25.936 --> 53:30.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening with Mark
Shields and Michael Gerson.

53:30.574 --> 53:32.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you, and good
night.
