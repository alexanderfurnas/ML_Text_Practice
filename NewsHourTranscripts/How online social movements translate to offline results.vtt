HARI SREENIVASAN: The day after
the inauguration of President
Donald Trump, an estimated 3.5

00:07.200 --> 00:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
million people in cities around
the country and the world
took part in the Women's March

00:11.833 --> 00:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protesting the Trump agenda in
what may have been the largest
collective protest in American

00:17.500 --> 00:19.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The march started with
a single Facebook post
and grew from there.

00:22.033 --> 00:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Raleigh, North Carolina,
Professor Zeynep Tufekci was
one of those faces in the crowd.

00:25.800 --> 00:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZEYNEP TUFEKCI: Marches are
great, they're really empowering
to people, but the magic

00:30.466 --> 00:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
isn't really in the streets by
itself or any online action.

00:34.600 --> 00:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's when you look at the action
when you're say, a legislator,
thinking, 'Hmm, if they

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can march with a million
people what else can they do?'

00:45.000 --> 00:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tufekci
teaches in the School
of Information at the
University of North

00:48.633 --> 00:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Carolina Chapel Hill and is
the author of the new book,
"Twitter and Tear Gas: the

00:54.833 --> 00:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Power and Fragility
of Networked Protest."

00:56.833 --> 00:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZEYNEP TUFEKCI, AUTHOR OF
TWITTER AND TEAR GAS: The twist
in the 21st century seems to

00:59.033 --> 01:04.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
be since we can a do
things much easier with
digital technology,
they don't necessarily

01:06.100 --> 01:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have the same level of teeth a
similar action say a March on
Washington might have 30, 40,

01:12.300 --> 01:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
50 years ago, because that
was a result of a long
process of organizing.

01:19.200 --> 01:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The March
on Washington for Jobs and
Freedom in 1963 took six months

01:26.333 --> 01:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to organize -- arranging
buses, bag lunches,
singers and speakers, for
a quarter of a million

01:31.600 --> 01:33.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who attended.

01:33.700 --> 01:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tufekci says the march was a
show of strength for the Civil
Rights Movement built over the

01:36.733 --> 01:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
previous 10 years.

01:38.833 --> 01:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZEYNEP TUFEKCI: It pushed
the people in power to take
the threat pretty seriously.

01:44.933 --> 01:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One year
later, Congress passed and
President Lyndon Johnson signed

01:47.366 --> 01:49.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the landmark Civil
Rights Act of 1964.

01:49.933 --> 01:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More recently, Tufekci cites
the success of the conservative
"Tea Party" movement.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It began in the spring of
2009 with a viral video.

01:58.133 --> 01:59.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RICK SANTELLI, CNBC'S
SQUAWK BOX, FEBRUARY
2009: This is America.

01:59.833 --> 02:02.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How many of you people
want to pay for your
neighbor's mortgage?

02:02.300 --> 02:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Followed
by tax day protests
around the country.

02:05.633 --> 02:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By the November 2010 midterm
elections, the movement
had a measurable impact.

02:09.766 --> 02:13.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ZEYNEP TUFEKCI: They got
50 plus Congress people.

02:13.866 --> 02:18.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They essentially blocked
President Obama's
second term agenda, and
arguably, they elected

02:20.833 --> 02:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a president that they like, so
it just shows what the protest
leads to depends on what

02:26.500 --> 02:28.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happens next.

02:28.566 --> 02:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In 2011, on
the other side of the political
spectrum, one email, inspired

02:33.933 --> 02:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the Arab Spring protests,
started "Occupy Wall Street."

02:37.200 --> 02:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Within weeks, it was a
movement with encampments
all over the country.

02:40.833 --> 02:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when the camps came
down, "Occupy" had little
to show for its agenda.

02:45.400 --> 02:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZEYNEP TUFEKCI: On the one
hand, it was really powerful in
bringing to people's attention

02:51.566 --> 02:53.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something that was
important: inequality.

02:53.666 --> 02:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you look at the electoral
results or at sort of the
policy, it wasn't taken as

03:00.800 --> 03:02.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a threat.

03:02.900 --> 03:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the people in power just
didn't really change their
way: inequality hasn't gone

03:06.333 --> 03:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down, we don't have any
new legislation that tries
to dampen inequality.

03:11.266 --> 03:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you can sort of see
that the digital technology
empowered both of them,
but they start taking

03:17.800 --> 03:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
different turns right
after, with really
different consequences.

03:21.200 --> 03:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The ease of
organizing and mobilizing online
has led to a common critique.

03:27.633 --> 03:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For a while, it was just
considered "slacktivism."

03:29.733 --> 03:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it too easy, just to click
a link and signal that I like
this and I don't like this?

03:37.766 --> 03:39.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How does it translate
into action?

03:39.566 --> 03:44.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ZEYNEP TUFEKCI: I think
it's a great first step.

03:44.166 --> 03:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that's why I don't like
the term "slacktivism."

03:46.966 --> 03:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think it's slacking
in anything to click.

03:50.733 --> 03:52.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It could be a very
powerful first step.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Even if it stops
there, it's got power.

03:55.233 --> 04:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is: How do you
take that very widespread, but
relatively shallow level of

04:02.266 --> 04:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
engagement and give people
who clearly wanting to
do something else, right?

04:08.433 --> 04:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you organize it so that
more people can step and say,
"Here are things you could

04:10.800 --> 04:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do collectively," and by doing
it collectively along the way
you'll build those important

04:18.466 --> 04:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
skills of decision-making
together and hanging together.

04:21.133 --> 04:25.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
While activists adopted
digital technology
tools, governments tried

04:25.566 --> 04:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and failed to disrupt them.

04:27.633 --> 04:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For instance, Tufekci
points to the 2011 protests
in Cairo's Tahrir Square.

04:31.600 --> 04:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZEYNEP TUFEKCI: The government
just didn't know what to do,
so they just shut off the

04:35.200 --> 04:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
internet, which completely
backfired, it was the absolute
wrong thing to do if you were

04:39.800 --> 04:41.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a government.

04:41.833 --> 04:45.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Because it just brings
attention, and a lot
of parents who were
getting news from their

04:45.366 --> 04:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kids in Tahrir Square the
cell phones were also cut.

04:47.833 --> 04:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But
governments have also learned
how to use digital technology.

04:51.600 --> 04:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Five years later, during an
attempted coup in Turkey,
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan

04:55.733 --> 05:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relied on digital technology
-- his iPhone Facetime app --
to rally supporters against

05:01.500 --> 05:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rebellious soldiers.

05:03.033 --> 05:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ZEYNEP TUFEKCI: It was really
sort of amazing to watch this.

05:06.200 --> 05:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was just this little
screen, but it confirmed to
the country that he was alive.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They realized very
quickly that the internet,
and digital technology
would be on their side

05:18.100 --> 05:20.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to counter this coup.

05:20.100 --> 05:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You point
out how crucial Twitter and
Facebook were in getting people

05:23.966 --> 05:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to come out to the street.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you also point out that
there's a tremendous amount of
power on these platforms now and

05:32.766 --> 05:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the way that the algorithms
are designed, could actually
determine the success or failure

05:36.833 --> 05:37.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a movement?

05:37.766 --> 05:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ZEYNEP TUFEKCI: Absolutely.

05:39.833 --> 05:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, Facebook, uses an
algorithm, a computer program
to choose how to rank what

05:45.533 --> 05:47.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it shows you.

05:47.533 --> 05:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So if you don't see something
from someone, maybe Facebook
isn't showing it to you.

05:50.633 --> 05:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For a social movement that's
incredibly consequential.

05:53.533 --> 05:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It was
consequential in the summer of
2014, as protests erupted on

06:00.666 --> 06:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the streets of Ferguson,
Missouri, following the
fatal shooting of an
unarmed black teenager,

06:03.500 --> 06:05.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Michael Brown, by a
white police officer.

06:05.800 --> 06:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Early on, Tufekci says, the
protests got a lot of attention
on Twitter but less so on

06:12.733 --> 06:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Facebook because of
another viral sensation:
the Ice Bucket Challenge.

06:16.200 --> 06:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZEYNEP TUFECKI: Facebook kept
showing me the Ice Bucket
Challenge, even if it was from

06:23.866 --> 06:25.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weeks ago kept showing
the same thing.

06:25.900 --> 06:29.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You know how you go
on and there's baby
picture, baby picture,
it just shows you things

06:29.200 --> 06:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are cute and cuddly
and that get the "likes,"
and that's how it operates.

06:33.433 --> 06:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For a social movement, trying
to break into the public sphere
that could mean a form of

06:40.733 --> 06:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
algorithmic censorship because
the algorithm likes certain
things and doesn't like certain

06:47.233 --> 06:49.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

06:49.300 --> 06:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tufekci says
the motivations of social media
companies and social movements

06:51.933 --> 06:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are not necessarily aligned.

06:53.966 --> 06:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZEYNEP TUFEKCI: In the end,
it's a platform that is based
on delivering you ads, and they

07:00.500 --> 07:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to sort of keep you
on there with things that
will keep you on there.

07:03.500 --> 07:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all of their business
models aren't necessarily in the
interests of what the movements

07:08.066 --> 07:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are trying to do long term.

07:10.100 --> 07:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How does the
Women's March or Black Lives
Matter how do they sustain

07:12.900 --> 07:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
themselves and turn themselves
into powerful actors that can
be a threat to whomever it

07:19.100 --> 07:21.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is that they want to
force change through?

07:21.366 --> 07:23.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ZEYNEP TUFEKCI: Right.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The lesson I take from all of
my research into this isn't
stop using digital technologies.

07:26.933 --> 07:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's recognize what they're
good for, and use them
fully what they're good for.

07:33.500 --> 07:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But really recognize what
they're not good for.

07:37.100 --> 07:42.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You can use a hashtag to
get millions of people
to the street, but you
can't use a hashtag

07:44.100 --> 07:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to figure out how does a group
of 100 people in one zip code
figure out who is going to

07:53.566 --> 07:55.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
run for school board.

07:55.933 --> 08:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to come to a hybrid
model, where we use tech for
what it's good for but not

08:03.800 --> 08:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be blinded by the power it gives
us in some areas and ignore
that it's actually weakening

08:11.000 --> 08:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us in other areas by helping
us scale up almost too fast.

08:15.933 --> 08:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know you are going from 0
to 100 miles in just a month or
two you need a better steering

08:22.700 --> 08:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wheel than a Facebook group.
