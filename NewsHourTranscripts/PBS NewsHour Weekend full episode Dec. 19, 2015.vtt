PULL DOWN AWLAKI'S MATERIAL.

FROM AWLAKI.

03:07.921 --> 03:08.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IS THE THING THAT ACTUALLY

03:08.722 --> 03:09.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRIGGERS SOMEONE TO PICK UP ARMS

03:09.689 --> 03:10.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST THE UNITED STATES?

03:10.924 --> 03:13.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IN WRITING THIS BOOK ABOUT

03:13.160 --> 03:16.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

AWLAKI TALKING.

03:22.469 --> 03:25.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO UNDERSTAND

RADICALIZATION, WANT TO

03:26.573 --> 03:28.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTAND TERRORISM, THESE ARE

03:28.408 --> 03:30.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT THINGS TO LOOK AT.

03:30.577 --> 03:32.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

KNOW?

03:38.618 --> 03:40.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN SOME WAYS THE MAIN ENGINES OF

03:56.736 --> 03:58.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:07.987 --> 13:08.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME AREAS THAT WE'RE NOT DOING

13:08.955 --> 13:11.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:17.463 --> 13:18.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TOP PERFORMING METRICS ARE

13:18.898 --> 13:21.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIBRARY USERS, TREE MAINTENANCE,

13:21.601 --> 13:22.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:23.936 --> 13:25.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITYSCORE ALSO DISPLAYS METRICS

13:25.772 --> 13:27.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE WEEK, MONTH, AND

13:27.640 --> 13:28.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUARTER.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:30.109 --> 13:31.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERN.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IF IT CONTINUES OVER A WEEK,

13:32.512 --> 13:34.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER A MONTH, OR OVER A QUARTER,

13:34.247 --> 13:35.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A BAD

13:35.314 --> 13:36.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TREND, RIGHT.

13:36.382 --> 13:37.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHAT THE MAYOR CAN DO IS

13:37.383 --> 13:38.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TACKLE THESE TRENDS WHEN THEY'RE

13:38.618 --> 13:39.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNALING THAT THEY'RE GOING BAD

13:39.952 --> 13:42.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY GO BAD.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S A REAL SEA CHANGE, IN

13:43.656 --> 13:45.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR OPINION, BECAUSE I THINK

13:45.124 --> 13:46.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST MUNICIPALITIES ARE LOOKING

13:46.626 --> 13:48.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT DATA MAYBE IN AN ANNUAL

>> Reporter: HOW IS IT THAT A

13:51.931 --> 13:55.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SINGLE NUMBER CAN POSSIBLY TELL

13:55.068 --> 13:56.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MAYOR WHAT'S GOING ON IN

13:56.235 --> 13:57.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUCH A BIG CITY?

13:57.704 --> 13:59.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DAY.

14:03.409 --> 14:04.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
