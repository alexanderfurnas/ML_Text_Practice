new year. nd in its last

00:17.851 --> 00:21.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
season, we look at how the
British drama "Downton Abbey"

00:21.488 --> 00:23.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has captivated American
audiences.JULIAN FELLOWES,

00:23.657 --> 00:27.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Creator, "Downton Abbey": One of
the important things about drama

00:27.294 --> 00:31.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is to remind the viewer that
everyone is a hundred percent at

00:31.665 --> 00:35.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the center of their own life.

UDY WOODRUFF: This New Year's
Day was marred by violence in

00:43.310 --> 00:47.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Israel after a gunman opened
fire on a popular bar in Tel

00:47.681 --> 00:51.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Aviv, killing two people before
fleeing the scene. At least

00:51.318 --> 00:55.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
three others were wounded. The
city's mayor said it appeared to

00:55.322 --> 00:58.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be -- quote -- "a terrorist
attack motivated by

00:58.592 --> 01:02.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nationalism." A manhunt is under
way for the shooter, who has yet

to be officially identified.
ith extremist violence on the

United Nations reported the

01:09.937 --> 01:14.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
number of deaths in Iraq last
month rose to 980 people. That

01:14.308 --> 01:19.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is up from 888 in November. More
than half of those killed were

Bavaria's top security official

01:21.581 --> 01:24.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says there's no longer any
concrete indications of a

01:24.851 --> 01:28.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
specific terror threat. Police
in Munich evacuated two train

after word that Islamic State

01:31.758 --> 01:34.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
extremists planned to attack
them. Officials said the overall

01:35.028 --> 01:38.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terror threat in Europe remains
high, and security was still

01:38.665 --> 01:41.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tight today, with some 100 extra
officers deployed.Despite

01:41.935 --> 01:45.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
security threats, people around
the world welcomed the start of

01:45.572 --> 01:48.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a new year today with fireworks,
celebrations, and well-wishes.

World Day of Peace by urging
people to respect the

FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic

01:59.019 --> 02:01.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Church (through translator):
Sometimes, we ask ourselves how

02:01.989 --> 02:05.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it is possible that human
injustice persists unabated, and

02:05.258 --> 02:08.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the arrogance of the
powerful continues to demean the

02:08.895 --> 02:12.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weak, relegating them to the
most squalid outskirts of our

02:12.532 --> 02:16.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world. All of us are called to
immerse ourselves in this ocean,

02:16.903 --> 02:20.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to let ourselves be reborn, to
overcome this indifference which

02:20.540 --> 02:23.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
blocks solidarity, and to leave
behind the false neutrality

02:23.810 --> 02:26.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which prevents sharing. UDY
WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, in his

02:26.713 --> 02:30.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
annual New Year's speech, North
Korean leader Kim Jong-un called

02:30.350 --> 02:33.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for reunification talks with
South Korea, but he blamed Seoul

02:33.987 --> 02:37.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for mistrust between the two
nations.And in the U.S., the

02:37.991 --> 02:41.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
127th Rose Parade rolled down
the streets of Pasadena,

700,000 spectators who turned
out for the event, but

02:47.434 --> 02:50.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
authorities said there were no
known threats.Officials in

02:50.704 --> 02:54.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dubai are investigating what
caused a massive New Year's Eve

02:54.341 --> 02:57.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fire at a high-rise luxury
hotel. It became engulfed in

02:57.978 --> 03:01.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
flames two hours before
midnight, as crowds of revelers

03:01.314 --> 03:04.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gathered nearby. Smoke continued
to billow out of the 63-story

03:04.951 --> 03:08.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
building today, as firefighters
worked to cool it down. There

03:08.588 --> 03:12.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were no fatalities, but 14
people were treated for minor

03:12.225 --> 03:15.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
injuries. he world's most
polluted city slashed the number

03:15.495 --> 03:18.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of vehicles allowed on its
streets today. Authorities in

03:18.765 --> 03:22.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New Delhi, India, kicked off a
two-week test that alternates

03:22.402 --> 03:26.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the days private cars may be
driven based on whether their

03:26.406 --> 03:30.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
license plates end in an odd or
even number. Authorities hope

03:30.410 --> 03:34.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the initiative will help combat
record levels of air pollution

03:34.047 --> 03:37.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the capital. ack in this
country, weary Missouri

03:37.317 --> 03:40.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
residents found some relief
today from the record-setting

03:40.220 --> 03:43.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
floods that have swept across
much of the state. Major

03:43.857 --> 03:47.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interstates in the Saint Louis
area reopened to traffic as high

03:47.861 --> 03:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
waters retreated. But, for other
communities downstream, the

03:50.764 --> 03:54.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
worst is yet to come.
loodwaters began to recede

03:54.034 --> 03:57.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
near many of the hardest-hit
Saint Louis suburbs, where the

03:57.671 --> 04:00.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
surging Meramec River damaged
hundreds of homes. Meanwhile,

04:00.640 --> 04:03.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crews worked through the night
and into the morning,

04:03.910 --> 04:06.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
desperately trying to restore
services in Missouri. They

04:06.813 --> 04:08.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reopened two major
transportation arteries,

04:08.615 --> 04:12.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Interstates 55 and 44, which had
been flooded for days. But

04:12.619 --> 04:16.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recovery efforts for those
forced to flee have only just

04:16.256 --> 04:19.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
begun.Residents in the Saint
Louis suburb of Valley Park,

04:19.893 --> 04:24.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where the Meramec crested at a
record 44 feet, returned for the

04:24.264 --> 04:27.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first time today to survey the
damage. Meanwhile, farther

04:27.534 --> 04:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
downstream, the threat of
additional flooding remained

04:30.070 --> 04:32.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high. llinois Governor Bruce
Rauner ordered the National

04:32.973 --> 04:36.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Guard to active duty and told
residents to brace for more

04:36.977 --> 04:40.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
damage. OV. BRUCE RAUNER (R),
Illinois: I'm mostly concerned

04:40.247 --> 04:44.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about Alexander County at the
moment south here. It's going to

04:44.251 --> 04:48.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be 50 feet down there; it's
cresting right now. And we were

04:48.622 --> 04:53.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just told an hour ago that it's
breached the levee. The levee is

04:53.360 --> 04:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to wash away. And we're --
we have been asking everybody in

04:58.098 --> 05:01.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Alexander County to evacuate.
UDY WOODRUFF: And officials

05:01.067 --> 05:04.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
warn the high waters could
travel south to Arkansas and

05:04.704 --> 05:08.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tennessee.Louisiana has also
declared a state of emergency in

05:08.341 --> 05:12.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anticipation of the flooding
that is to come. So far, the

05:12.345 --> 05:15.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
floodwaters have been blamed for
at least 22 deaths. resident

Obama is exploring unilateral
steps he can take to address gun

05:19.986 --> 05:23.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violence. In his first weekly
radio address of 2016, he said

05:23.990 --> 05:27.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his staff has been looking into
potential executive actions. Mr.

05:27.627 --> 05:30.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama will meet Monday with
Attorney General Loretta Lynch

05:30.897 --> 05:35.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to explore options to keep guns
out of the hands of -- quote --

05:36.002 --> 05:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"an irresponsible, dangerous
few." ARACK OBAMA, President

05:38.538 --> 05:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the United States: I get too
many letters from parents, and

05:42.909 --> 05:47.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teachers, and kids to sit around
and do nothing. The gun lobby is

05:47.647 --> 05:50.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
loud and well-organized in its
defense of effortlessly

05:50.550 --> 05:55.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
available guns for anyone. The
rest of us are going to have to

05:55.288 --> 05:58.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be just as passionate and
well-organized in our defense of

05:58.925 --> 06:02.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our kids. UDY WOODRUFF: The
president will reportedly take

06:02.262 --> 06:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
action to set a -- quote --
"reasonable threshold" for when

06:06.266 --> 06:09.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sellers need to seek a
background check. he new year

06:09.903 --> 06:14.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also ushered in a host of new
laws; 14 states and several

06:14.274 --> 06:17.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cities raised the minimum wage.
California and Massachusetts

06:17.177 --> 06:20.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
increased it to $10 an hour,
while Seattle's minimum hourly

06:20.814 --> 06:24.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wage rose to $13. New
legislation in Texas has made it

06:24.818 --> 06:29.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
easier to openly carry guns. And
Hawaii became the first state in

06:29.189 --> 06:33.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the nation to raise the legal
smoking age from 18 to 21.We

06:33.927 --> 06:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also mark the passing of two
talented entertainers. Natalie

legend Nat King Cole, died

06:40.834 --> 06:44.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
overnight in Los Angeles
following a series of health

06:44.104 --> 06:48.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
problems. The R&amp;B singer first
made a name for herself with the

06:48.475 --> 06:52.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
1975 breakout hit "This Will
Be," and went on to win nine

06:52.846 --> 06:56.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Grammy Awards. In 2010, Cole
performed the gospel song "I

06:56.483 --> 07:01.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to
Be Free" at the White House.

the first three of the show's 11
seasons. Wayne Rogers was 82

be implemented fully. Just this

07:59.512 --> 08:02.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week, most of Iran's stockpiles
of low-enriched uranium were

08:02.849 --> 08:06.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
removed from the country by
ship. ut there are renewed

08:06.486 --> 08:10.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tensions between Iran and the
U.S. that could affect the

08:10.123 --> 08:13.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nuclear accord. Recent ballistic
missile tests by Iran were said

08:13.760 --> 08:17.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the United Nations to violate
prohibitions on missile testing.

08:17.397 --> 08:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Obama administration then
drew up additional sanctions on

08:20.667 --> 08:23.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iran's missile program. ut,
last night, The Wall Street

08:23.937 --> 08:27.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Journal reported the White House
had delayed those sanctions for

08:27.574 --> 08:30.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now. Iran's president, Hassan
Rouhani, said yesterday his

08:30.477 --> 08:33.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nation wouldn't only continue
its missile development, but

08:33.380 --> 08:36.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
expand it.And just last
weekend, Iranian boats within

08:36.649 --> 08:40.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the very tight quarters of the
Straits of Hormuz, the gateway

08:40.653 --> 08:44.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the Persian Gulf, fired a
rocket near the U.S. aircraft

08:44.657 --> 08:48.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
carrier Harry Truman, a move the
U.S. called highly provocative.

08:48.294 --> 08:51.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The carrier and its battle
group, and a French naval

08:51.931 --> 08:55.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vessel, were sailing into the
Gulf to continue the bombardment

08:55.568 --> 09:00.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Islamic State in Iraq and
Syria.As we begin the new

09:00.306 --> 09:04.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
year, where do things stand
between the U.S. and Iran?For

09:04.377 --> 09:07.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we turn to Karim
Sadjadpour. He's senior

09:07.280 --> 09:09.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
associate at the Carnegie
Endowment for International

09:09.816 --> 09:12.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Peace.Welcome back to the
program.KARIM SADJADPOUR,

09:12.719 --> 09:15.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Carnegie Endowment For
International Peace: Thank you,

09:15.255 --> 09:19.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Judy. UDY WOODRUFF: So, what
is going on with Iran? What's

09:19.259 --> 09:22.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
behind these missile tests, what
appears to be provocative firing

09:22.896 --> 09:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very close to a U.S. ship?
ARIM SADJADPOUR: Judy, when we

09:26.900 --> 09:29.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
describe Iran's political
factions, we commonly use the

09:29.803 --> 09:33.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
term moderates and hard-liners.
erhaps a more appropriate term

09:33.072 --> 09:37.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would be to call them -- you
have the bridge-builders, people

09:37.076 --> 09:39.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like President Rouhani and
Foreign Minister Zarif, that

09:39.979 --> 09:43.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want to build bridges with the
West, with the United States,

09:43.983 --> 09:47.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and you have the saboteurs,
those who are very concerned

09:47.620 --> 09:51.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the prospect of a more
integrated Iran.Within the

09:51.257 --> 09:54.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Revolutionary Guards, you have a
lot of saboteurs, people who

09:54.894 --> 09:58.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't have much in terms of
their popular support, but they

09:58.898 --> 10:03.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have a lot in terms of coercive
power. And I think that the

10:03.636 --> 10:07.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
missile tests, the imprisonment
of dual nationals are all meant

10:07.273 --> 10:11.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as a signal to the United States
that the nuclear deal is not

10:12.011 --> 10:15.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about a broader rapprochement,
the relations are going to

10:15.281 --> 10:18.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
remain antagonistic, and to
Iran's own population to send

10:18.551 --> 10:22.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the signal, don't think the
nuclear compromise was a sign of

10:22.555 --> 10:26.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weakness. We remain strong and
in control. UDY WOODRUFF: Were

10:26.192 --> 10:29.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these tests, Karim, legal,
though, under the terms of the

10:29.829 --> 10:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nuclear deal? ARIM SADJADPOUR:
The missile tests weren't a

10:33.099 --> 10:37.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violation of the nuclear deal,
but they were a violation of

10:37.103 --> 10:39.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
U.N. Security Council
resolutions.And I think this

10:40.006 --> 10:43.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is the dilemma that the Obama
administration is in. Now, on

10:44.010 --> 10:47.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one hand, the nuclear deal with
Iran could be the crowning

10:48.014 --> 10:50.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foreign policy achievement of
the Obama administration. They

10:50.917 --> 10:55.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't want to pursue sanctions
if it is going to undermine the

10:55.288 --> 10:58.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nuclear deal. UDY WOODRUFF:
What role did the discussion in

10:58.925 --> 11:02.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Washington, in the White House,
the reporting that the White

11:02.629 --> 11:05.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House might be prepared to
propose sanctions in response,

11:05.899 --> 11:09.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what role does that play in all
of this?KARIM SADJADPOUR:

11:09.903 --> 11:13.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, I think people in Tehran
certainly probably recognize the

11:13.540 --> 11:17.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dilemma the Obama administration
has.They don't want to do

11:17.176 --> 11:21.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anything to sabotage the nuclear
deal. They don't want to do

11:21.180 --> 11:24.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anything which could potentially
weaken these bridge-builders I

11:24.083 --> 11:28.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was talking about in Tehran. At
the same time, they want to

11:28.454 --> 11:32.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
react to Iran's provocations.
o, I think that, internally in

11:32.091 --> 11:35.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the White House, there is
probably debate between folks at

11:35.728 --> 11:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Treasury, at the Pentagon and
those who are at the White House

11:40.099 --> 11:43.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and State Department. UDY
WOODRUFF: And you see -- of

11:43.736 --> 11:48.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
course, you had a number of
Republicans -- as soon as Iran

11:48.107 --> 11:52.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
did this missile testing and the
other tests, there were comments

11:52.111 --> 11:56.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Republicans saying, see, in
essence, we told you so, we

11:56.115 --> 11:59.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can't trust Iran. hat clearly
puts pressure on the White

11:59.752 --> 12:03.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
House. And so how do the
Iranians read that? ARIM

12:03.456 --> 12:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SADJADPOUR: Well, I think, Judy,
there is not only going to be

12:07.827 --> 12:10.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pressure from Republicans, but
also many Democrats who

12:10.730 --> 12:13.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
supported the Obama
administration. nd I think

12:13.266 --> 12:17.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that -- you know, what I always
tell people, that this nuclear

12:17.637 --> 12:23.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deal is going to take -- it has
to be judged over the course of

12:23.109 --> 12:26.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years, not months. It's not
going to bring about a

12:26.746 --> 12:29.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rapprochement between the United
States and Iran anytime soon.

12:30.016 --> 12:34.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nd we're going to have to --
it's a 10-year agreement. And

12:34.387 --> 12:39.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're going to have to assess it
in the months to -- in years to

12:39.859 --> 12:44.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come, but it's going to be a
very perilous deal. And there's

12:44.230 --> 12:47.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many saboteurs in Washington and
Tehran. UDY WOODRUFF: Is it

12:47.867 --> 12:51.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
possible it could become
derailed if this kind of

12:51.137 --> 12:53.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
activity continues? ARIM
SADJADPOUR: Absolutely. think

12:53.673 --> 12:58.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that there are so many moving
parts to this deal. And then you

12:58.411 --> 13:03.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
look at the places in the Middle
East in which the United States

13:03.216 --> 13:06.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Iran are in potential zones
of conflict, whether that's

13:06.853 --> 13:10.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syria, the Israeli-Palestinian
issue. So, there's lots of traps

13:10.123 --> 13:13.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here. UDY WOODRUFF: Yes, very
complex.Finally, Karim, a

13:13.393 --> 13:17.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
number of -- there has been
reporting about a number of

13:17.397 --> 13:19.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iranian-Americans imprisoned in
Iran. It's an additional

13:19.932 --> 13:23.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
irritant in the relationship.
Does that play a role in all

13:23.936 --> 13:28.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this, or is that just side
activity as far as the Iranians

13:28.307 --> 13:31.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are concerned?KARIM
SADJADPOUR: Well, I don't think

13:31.210 --> 13:33.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's affected the Obama
administration's position toward

13:33.746 --> 13:37.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iran, but, certainly, it sours
the mood in the United States,

13:37.750 --> 13:41.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when, after this nuclear deal,
Iran goes and imprisons innocent

13:41.387 --> 13:44.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iranian-Americans, including my
friend Siamak Namazi. think

13:44.290 --> 13:48.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it sends a signal to diaspora
Iranians around the world that,

13:48.294 --> 13:52.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't think that Iran is welcome
and open to business to all of

13:53.032 --> 13:56.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you. This remains a close state
ruled by the Revolutionary

13:56.669 --> 14:00.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Guards and the supreme leader.
UDY WOODRUFF: And that is my

14:00.673 --> 14:03.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
final question. Should Americans
understand that the hard-liners

14:03.643 --> 14:07.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are in charge in Iran or those
who seek to be bridge-builders?

14:08.014 --> 14:11.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARIM SADJADPOUR: I think a
wonderful quote that captures

14:11.284 --> 14:15.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today's Middle East is from the
poem, a poem from Yeats, who

14:15.655 --> 14:19.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said, the best lack all
conviction and the worst are

14:19.292 --> 14:22.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
full of passionate intensity.
nd I think, unfortunately,

14:22.195 --> 14:26.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
within Iran, the hard-liners are
very much a minority, but they

14:26.199 --> 14:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
continue to have a bulk of
political and coercive power.

14:29.836 --> 14:33.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's, as
you said, complicated and one

14:33.473 --> 14:36.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Americans are keeping a
close watch on. arim

UDY WOODRUFF: This past year,
there has been a large focus on

14:44.383 --> 14:48.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the plight of refugees fleeing
the war in Syria. But what about

14:48.755 --> 14:52.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the people who have stayed in
that country? What are

14:52.391 --> 14:55.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conditions like for them?

15:56.823 --> 16:00.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jarrah by Skype and began by
asking him about those still

16:00.827 --> 16:04.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
living in Aleppo, whether they
have water, electricity, food,

16:04.163 --> 16:08.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any semblance of normal life.
AMI JARRAH: In terms of the

16:08.167 --> 16:11.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sort of resources to live on,
electricity is locally

16:11.437 --> 16:14.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
generated. So, people have
generators, and only those that

16:14.707 --> 16:17.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can afford them.So,
electricity is only available in

16:17.977 --> 16:22.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the evenings. It's a service
that has to be paid for through

16:22.348 --> 16:25.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
those that provide those
generated electricity. And that

16:25.251 --> 16:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
depends on diesel. The problem
with that is that that diesel

16:29.255 --> 16:31.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
comes from ISIS-controlled
territory.And those routes

16:31.791 --> 16:36.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been cut off due to the
attacks that are between ISIS

16:36.162 --> 16:40.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and these areas. So, those
routes are cut off. And it

16:40.166 --> 16:44.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
basically means that the people
are cut off from any supplies of

16:44.537 --> 16:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
diesel. lthough that is a good
thing, because it hold ISIS

16:48.541 --> 16:52.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back, but it means that the
civilians here facing the coming

16:52.545 --> 16:56.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
winter also don't fuel to heat
themselves. So that's a setback.

16:56.549 --> 17:00.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In addition to that, water is an
extremely big problem. The

17:00.553 --> 17:04.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(INAUDIBLE) have cut off water
supplies and have -- a number of

17:04.991 --> 17:07.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
towns actually used their
warplanes to destroy water

17:07.894 --> 17:11.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
factories that are located in
Aleppo. nd one of the main

17:11.898 --> 17:15.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
water factories was destroyed
about two months ago. So water

17:15.534 --> 17:19.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is actually being transported
from other areas to Aleppo, one

17:19.171 --> 17:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of which is Idlib and Latakia.
So, in terms of those resources,

17:23.542 --> 17:27.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's actually a very -- the
civilians of Aleppo are facing a

17:27.914 --> 17:32.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lot of hardship.JEFFREY BROWN:
You have been out on the streets

17:32.285 --> 17:36.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
regularly filing reports. And
there is a video we have seen

17:36.289 --> 17:40.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here in which you show the
aftermath of a bombing in

17:40.293 --> 17:45.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
downtown Aleppo. I want to take
a look at that, show that to our

17:45.398 --> 17:49.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
audience. AMI JARRAH: This is
the after-effects of a Russian

17:49.035 --> 17:52.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
airstrikes on the Kalako (ph)
area of Aleppo. ow, the

17:52.672 --> 17:55.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russians are supposed to be
targeting ISIS. SIRENS) AMI

17:55.942 --> 17:59.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JARRAH: The civil defense have
just arrived. CROSSTALK)RAMI

17:59.211 --> 18:02.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JARRAH: After these strikes, a
group of people that are

18:02.915 --> 18:06.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assigned with the task of
getting people out from under

18:06.552 --> 18:10.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the rubble. This is where it
landed. o, this man is

18:10.556 --> 18:13.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
explaining that there's only
civilians living here.JEFFREY

18:13.459 --> 18:17.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: So, the Russians are
saying that they are targeting

18:17.096 --> 18:21.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS and other -- and strategic
sites, but that's not what

18:21.100 --> 18:24.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're seeing.RAMI JARRAH: No,
Jeffrey, that's definitely not

18:24.370 --> 18:27.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what I'm seeing, and it's
definitely not what the

18:27.640 --> 18:31.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
civilians here in Aleppo are
seeing. think this man in the

18:32.011 --> 18:36.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
video is a small example of what
is actually happening. He is

18:36.382 --> 18:39.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
frantically trying to explain,
it's just civilians here.

18:39.285 --> 18:43.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no signs of ISIS here.
Why are they attacking us? We're

18:43.656 --> 18:48.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to stay here. We're not
going to move, as much as you

18:48.394 --> 18:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attack us. Even if it's -- if
the last one of us has to die,

18:53.866 --> 18:58.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're going to stay here. his
is what this man is saying. And

18:58.604 --> 19:02.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's basically the language that
you're going to hear around

19:02.308 --> 19:06.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Aleppo, because the people here
are very much convinced that the

19:06.312 --> 19:09.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russian and Syrian airstrikes
are meant and aimed to target

19:09.949 --> 19:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
civilians and to drive them
either out of Aleppo or to kill

19:14.320 --> 19:18.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them. nd this is something
that they have come to believe

19:18.324 --> 19:21.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because of the constant attacks.
We're witnessing between 10 to

19:21.961 --> 19:25.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
15 airstrikes in central Aleppo
alone on a daily basis. And

19:25.965 --> 19:29.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these airstrikes, what we have
been doing is trying to follow

19:29.969 --> 19:33.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these airstrikes. I have gotten
my hands on -- access to

19:33.973 --> 19:37.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
information of when the strikes
hit. So, I'm following the civil

19:37.977 --> 19:41.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
defense.I haven't, until now,
seen one attack that has landed

19:41.981 --> 19:46.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on a military unit or a depot.
And this is something that we're

19:46.719 --> 19:50.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to document and make
clear. Now, the problem is that

19:50.723 --> 19:53.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last year U.N. Security Council
resolution actually allowed

19:53.626 --> 19:57.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia to actually attack areas
that have ISIS or al-Nusra in

19:57.630 --> 20:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them. ut that's on the basis
that we're taking Russia's take

20:01.634 --> 20:05.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on where those groups are
located. But those groups are

20:05.271 --> 20:09.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not located in these areas. And
that's the excuse that is being

20:09.642 --> 20:13.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
used to attack these areas. So,
this is a major problem. It's

20:14.013 --> 20:17.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who decides where these groups
are.We have been trying to

20:18.017 --> 20:22.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prove that these groups are not
located here. If they were, I

20:22.388 --> 20:26.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wouldn't be able to operate. I
wouldn't be able to do the

20:26.759 --> 20:30.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reports I was doing.JEFFREY
BROWN: So, what are the biggest

20:30.763 --> 20:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fears that you're hearing from
people now? Is it a government

20:34.767 --> 20:38.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
victory backed by Russia? Is it
ISIS, especially, perhaps, as

20:38.404 --> 20:42.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's driven more from Iraq,
coming in even stronger in and

20:42.408 --> 20:46.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
around Aleppo?But what are the
fears that people are voicing?

20:46.412 --> 20:50.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMI JARRAH: The people here
are not in any way worried that

20:50.783 --> 20:55.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Assad or Assad's army or Russia
or Hezbollah forces are going to

20:55.154 --> 20:58.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
invade Aleppo.I haven't heard
this expressed once. The people

20:58.791 --> 21:03.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here are worried that ISIS is
going to, in fact, take over

21:03.229 --> 21:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Aleppo, because of the fact that
the -- not only the Russian

21:07.600 --> 21:10.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
airstrikes, but in addition to
the coalition airstrikes, they

21:10.870 --> 21:14.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are actually forcing ISIS
further away from Iraq and

21:14.140 --> 21:18.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deeper into Syria.And what
that means is past Raqqa, past

21:18.144 --> 21:22.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Deir el-Zour, and into Aleppo.
So there are no signs of ISIS in

21:22.882 --> 21:27.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Aleppo. So, the fear here is
that ISIS takes these areas and

21:27.253 --> 21:31.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that there isn't really much
preventing that by Russia or the

21:31.257 --> 21:35.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syrian regime, who are actually
more so accepting the idea of

21:35.261 --> 21:40.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Aleppo being taken by ISIS, as a
sort of an excuse that can be

21:40.366 --> 21:44.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
used at a later stage to allow
the rest of the international

21:44.737 --> 21:47.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
community also to intervene
against the opposition. EFFREY

21:47.640 --> 21:51.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: Let me just ask you
finally about your own work, the

21:52.011 --> 21:55.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dangers of it, the dangers for
anyone practicing journalism in

21:55.648 --> 21:59.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syria today.RAMI JARRAH: The
dangers, I think they are the

21:59.652 --> 22:03.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
same dangers that the people
here are witnessing.I don't

22:03.355 --> 22:07.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think there is an added danger
to the journalists. The fear

22:07.359 --> 22:12.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that I face here is not from the
rebel groups here. It's not from

22:12.464 --> 22:16.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bullets. It's from airstrikes.
And that is the only danger that

22:16.468 --> 22:20.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
my life faces, is the
airstrikes. o, it's the same

22:20.105 --> 22:24.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
danger that the rest of the
civilians here are facing. I

22:24.109 --> 22:28.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't think there is an added
danger as a journalist. EFFREY

22:28.113 --> 22:32.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: All right, Rami Jarrah in
Aleppo, thank you so much.RAMI

22:51.403 --> 22:55.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nd we already have a little
news in the presidential race,

22:55.407 --> 22:57.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some eye-popping fund-raising
totals. Hillary Clinton's

22:57.576 --> 23:01.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign reports a new record
for a non-incumbent, raising $37

23:01.213 --> 23:05.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
million for her primary bid in
the past three months alone.

23:05.284 --> 23:09.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican Ben Carson raised $23
million. And Ted Cruz has raised

23:09.288 --> 23:12.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about $20 million. He has not
released his official report

23:12.925 --> 23:16.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
yet.To talk about the
election, to look ahead to what

23:16.929 --> 23:21.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is in store in 2016, we have the
analysis of Shields and Gerson.

UDY WOODRUFF: 2016 is finally

23:35.481 --> 23:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here. o, Mark, a lot of money
being raised, but I want to turn

23:40.586 --> 23:44.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to something. We have spent a
lot of time this year talking

23:44.957 --> 23:48.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about Donald Trump. Let's talk
about some of the so-called

23:48.594 --> 23:51.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mainstream Republicans who are
trying to break through,

23:51.497 --> 23:55.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
frankly, to knock him off of his
perch.Jeb Bush has been

23:55.868 --> 23:59.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying. He's had a tough week.
They have redirected resources

23:59.505 --> 24:04.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and staff. Where -- do you see a
way forward for Jeb Bush? ARK

24:04.677 --> 24:08.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHIELDS: Jeb Bush's only way
forward -- every four years,

24:08.314 --> 24:11.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Judy, everybody who runs for
president is an amateur at

24:11.950 --> 24:15.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
running for president. It is so
unlike anything else, 50

24:15.587 --> 24:18.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
different campaigns in 50
different states, all those

24:18.490 --> 24:22.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
demands.But the iron rule of
politics prevails. And that is,

24:22.494 --> 24:26.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nobody has ever been elected
president of the United States

24:26.131 --> 24:30.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the modern era who didn't win
the New Hampshire primary, at

24:30.502 --> 24:35.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the very worst finish second, as
George W. Bush did in 2000 to

24:35.240 --> 24:39.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John McCain, and as Barack Obama
did.But everybody else has

24:39.244 --> 24:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been a winner. And so, all of a
sudden, you realize all the

24:43.982 --> 24:46.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
national headquarters I have,
national support doesn't mean

24:46.885 --> 24:51.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anything if I can't come out of
New Hampshire as one of the two,

24:51.991 --> 24:56.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or maybe at the very worst
third. And, right now, it looks

24:56.362 --> 25:00.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like, you know, Donald Trump has
the lead. So they're fighting.

25:00.366 --> 25:04.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eb Bush has directed all his
resources. It only took 97,000

25:04.436 --> 25:09.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
votes to win New Hampshire in
2012. So, you say to yourself, I

25:09.174 --> 25:13.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have won Florida. John Kasich, I
have won Ohio. Chris Christie, I

25:13.545 --> 25:17.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have won New Jersey.And so,
all of a sudden, you're saying,

25:17.916 --> 25:22.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can go in with effort, energy
and time. I can persuade enough

25:22.654 --> 25:28.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voters to my side, and I have to
do it if I'm going to survive.

25:28.127 --> 25:32.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UDY WOODRUFF: And so that is
what he has got to do.MARK

25:32.865 --> 25:35.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHIELDS: That's right.JUDY
WOODRUFF: Michael, Iowa one

25:35.768 --> 25:39.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
month away. We're exactly one
month away now from the Iowa

25:39.772 --> 25:43.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
caucuses, and just a week later,
it's New Hampshire. What about

25:43.776 --> 25:47.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeb Bush? ICHAEL GERSON:
That's true. All of those

25:47.045 --> 25:51.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidates you're talking about
take comfort in the fact that 70

25:51.049 --> 25:53.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
percent, according to the
historical examples, of New

25:53.952 --> 25:57.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hampshire voters make their
determination in the last 30

25:57.222 --> 26:00.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
days of the race. It breaks
late. he problem for

26:00.859 --> 26:04.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans here is that they
have four pretty strong

26:04.196 --> 26:07.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidates in that establishment
or mainstream Republican space.

26:07.099 --> 26:10.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump has the blue-collar
populists. Ted Cruz is really

26:10.736 --> 26:13.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
solidifying religious voters,
some Tea Party voters.But this

26:14.006 --> 26:17.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mainstream lane has those four
candidates we have been talking

26:17.643 --> 26:22.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about, and all of them are good.
You watch C-SPAN and see Chris

26:22.381 --> 26:26.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Christie, who has been there 40
times. He's on his game. He's

26:26.752 --> 26:30.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing really well.The Bush
campaign has gone through the

26:30.389 --> 26:34.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stages of grief, OK? They had a
message problem, and they had

26:34.760 --> 26:37.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
performance problems. And
they're doing better. You're

26:37.296 --> 26:40.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
watching them in town hall
meetings. His message is very

26:40.933 --> 26:44.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sharp. And he's making the most
principled criticism of Donald

26:44.570 --> 26:49.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump in this field and wants to
collect those voters. o it's a

26:49.308 --> 26:52.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
real showdown between talented
candidates in this case.JUDY

26:52.578 --> 26:56.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Right.Does one or
another of them, Mark, have an

26:56.582 --> 27:00.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
advantage in some way, as you
see it? ARK SHIELDS: I think

27:00.953 --> 27:04.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Christie is the best candidate.
He's the best natural candidate.

27:04.656 --> 27:08.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UDY WOODRUFF: As a campaigner.
ARK SHIELDS: As a campaigner,

27:08.293 --> 27:13.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's the best.But what all of
them face, Judy, is -- at this

27:13.398 --> 27:18.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
point is that they're starting
to get -- as they pop their head

27:18.136 --> 27:22.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up, whether it's Marco Rubio and
his absenteeism from the Senate,

27:22.140 --> 27:26.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or it's Chris Christie and it's
nine times the credit rating of

27:26.512 --> 27:30.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New Jersey has been lowered, or
if it's John Kasich, and the

27:30.883 --> 27:35.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bush people are now -- or the
Bush PAC, at least, is raising

27:35.621 --> 27:40.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the fact that, in 1994, John
Kasich in the House, as a House

27:40.359 --> 27:44.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
member, voted for the assault
weapons ban, and that this is

27:44.363 --> 27:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now a disqualification, with all
that has happened in this

27:48.000 --> 27:52.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country.But you start to see,
they realize that only one of

27:52.371 --> 27:56.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them probably can really survive
New Hampshire and Iowa. And so

27:56.375 --> 28:01.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the sniping at each other is
going on. I would say Bush is

28:01.113 --> 28:05.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just the anomaly. I mean, Bush
had the best record going in. He

28:05.918 --> 28:10.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was -- he had the best peer
review. He had a record as a

28:11.023 --> 28:13.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conservative in a reasonably
conservative party, a swing

28:13.926 --> 28:18.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state, a Latino wife. He spoke
Spanish.You know, on paper --

28:18.297 --> 28:22.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but he just hasn't connected,
basically. And he's now down to

28:22.301 --> 28:25.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's got to win Peterborough,
he's got to win Keene.

28:25.938 --> 28:29.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CROSSTALK)MICHAEL GERSON:
Right. And he has the best

28:29.207 --> 28:33.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ground game of any of the
candidates. He's got money in

28:33.211 --> 28:36.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bank. ou know, Chris
Christie, if he wins, he's

28:36.848 --> 28:40.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
running a single-state campaign.
There are real questions of

28:40.118 --> 28:44.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether he could follow that up
in the decisive races in March.

28:44.489 --> 28:48.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARK SHIELDS: Yes. I agree. I
agree.MICHAEL GERSON: Someone

28:48.126 --> 28:51.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like Bush could do that, or
Rubio. They're building national

28:51.763 --> 28:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaigns. They are capable of
doing that. So, they're

28:55.033 --> 28:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
distinguishing themselves in
various ways. And the choice

28:57.936 --> 29:01.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be fascinating.MARK
SHIELDS: I will just say that I

29:02.007 --> 29:05.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think Bush acknowledges that
he's not running a national

29:05.277 --> 29:08.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign now. He knows... UDY
WOODRUFF: By saying he's putting

29:08.914 --> 29:12.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
staff and money...(CROSSTALK)
ARK SHIELDS: By putting all

29:12.184 --> 29:16.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the resources -- by taking the
television money out of Iowa.

29:16.188 --> 29:19.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's basically saying, New
Hampshire is big casino for him.

29:19.825 --> 29:24.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think what it proves to me,
anyway, is that Chris Christie

29:24.196 --> 29:27.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would have been Barack Obama's
strongest opponent in 2012.

29:27.466 --> 29:31.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will
see what... ARK SHIELDS: I

29:31.103 --> 29:35.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mean, he was really -- he's just
a gifted campaigner.JUDY

29:35.107 --> 29:39.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: I want to ask you both
about somebody else on the

29:39.478 --> 29:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican side who's having --
who has had an even more

29:43.482 --> 29:46.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
difficult time this week,
Michael, and that's Ben Carson.

29:46.752 --> 29:50.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
e's now had five staffers, two
very senior people leave the

29:50.789 --> 29:54.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign. Where does he stand?
ICHAEL GERSON: Well, this is

29:54.459 --> 29:58.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the problem of campaigning as a
candidate with no experience.

29:58.130 --> 30:01.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have no experience.
LAUGHTER) ICHAEL GERSON: I

30:01.066 --> 30:05.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mean, he has not run a good
campaign. It's imploding. He had

30:05.470 --> 30:09.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
broad resignations on people,
because he had two power centers

30:09.141 --> 30:12.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the campaign that were
obviously being played off

30:12.444 --> 30:16.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against one another.And all
this redounds to the benefit of

30:16.481 --> 30:20.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ted Cruz, particularly in Iowa,
who is, I think, picking up a

30:20.886 --> 30:24.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lot of that ground that Carson
is conceding. UDY WOODRUFF:

30:24.556 --> 30:28.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's a reminder that money
may not make the difference. As

30:28.960 --> 30:32.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we just said, he raised $23
million in the last quarter.

30:32.998 --> 30:37.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARK SHIELDS: But they spent a
lot of money to raise the money,

30:37.769 --> 30:42.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Judy. he key number in all of
those figures is cash on hand,

30:42.541 --> 30:47.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how much they have -- how much
they have spent to raise it. And

30:47.679 --> 30:52.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ben Carson, it comes back, that
campaign has become a civil war

30:52.084 --> 30:55.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a leper colony.(LAUGHTER)
ARK SHIELDS: He has basically

30:55.754 --> 30:59.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
acknowledged all of it. UDY
WOODRUFF: Oops. ARK SHIELDS:

30:59.057 --> 31:02.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the recriminations back and
forth.And the old saw,

31:02.794 --> 31:07.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bromide, whether it's or not, if
you can't run a campaign, how

31:07.199 --> 31:11.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can you run the country? And I
think that is coming to...

31:11.603 --> 31:15.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ICHAEL GERSON: Some truth to
it, yes.JUDY WOODRUFF: 2015,

31:15.273 --> 31:19.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ask both of you.Michael, I
will start with you. What were

31:19.678 --> 31:24.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the moments that are going to
make a difference, do you think,

31:24.082 --> 31:27.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as we look to this campaign
going forward?MICHAEL GERSON:

31:27.753 --> 31:32.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, the event is the obvious
one, which is, Donald Trump has

31:32.157 --> 31:36.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
found a new way to run a
presidential campaign.I have

31:36.194 --> 31:40.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been part of three of them. You
put out policy papers. You give

31:40.966 --> 31:44.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
speeches. You get endorsements.
You raise money. He has tweeted

31:44.636 --> 31:49.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his way to dominance in this new
media environment. It is a new

31:49.407 --> 31:53.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way to conduct a campaign, the
reality television version. I

31:53.078 --> 31:57.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think that it's many times
vulgar and shallow, but it has

31:57.115 --> 32:00.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an audience, and that's clearly
true. nd the moment, though,

32:00.786 --> 32:04.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that I think is the most
important is the leading

32:04.523 --> 32:07.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican candidate referring
to the Japanese internment, this

32:07.459 --> 32:11.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
historical example, in December
as a positive example in the

32:11.129 --> 32:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
context of the war on terror.
ARK SHIELDS: Yes. ICHAEL

32:14.800 --> 32:19.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GERSON: It is the -- for me,
personally, that was a really

32:19.204 --> 32:22.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terrible moment in modern
Republican history. And, you

32:22.140 --> 32:25.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, I think it's going to have
consequences going forward.

32:25.811 --> 32:29.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UDY WOODRUFF: What about for
you, Mark, moments in 2015?

32:29.481 --> 32:33.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARK SHIELDS: I would say the
Trump phenomenon. irst of all,

32:33.518 --> 32:37.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have to say that Bernie
Sanders -- the idea that Bernie

32:37.923 --> 32:41.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sanders could emerge to the
point where he is, with 2.5

32:41.960 --> 32:44.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
million contributors, with, you
know, actually having changed

32:44.896 --> 32:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the terms of the debate for the
Democratic nomination, the

32:48.567 --> 32:52.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dialogue, I think, is a real
surprise. ut, to me, the Trump

32:52.971 --> 32:56.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- the Trump model, where the
unscripted sort of off-the-cuff,

32:56.641 --> 33:00.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no teleprompter, speaking, and
making, Judy, what could at best

33:00.312 --> 33:04.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be called reckless statements,
at worst be called divisive, but

33:04.049 --> 33:08.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to be called untruths,
whether it's, I saw thousands of

33:08.086 --> 33:12.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people in Jersey City on the day
of September 11 dancing in the

33:12.858 --> 33:16.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
streets at the prospect or the
reality of the... UDY

33:16.528 --> 33:19.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Nine-eleven.MARK
SHIELDS: ... World Trade Center

33:19.464 --> 33:24.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
falling.But each of them is
reckless in its own way. When he

33:24.236 --> 33:28.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said that 81 percent of whites
who are murdered in this country

33:28.640 --> 33:32.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are murdered by black Americans,
when, in fact, it's the

33:32.310 --> 33:37.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opposite, I mean, the reality is
that 80 -- 16 percent of whites

33:37.082 --> 33:41.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are killed by black Americans
and 82 percent of whites are

33:41.119 --> 33:45.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
killed by whites. ut -- and
then, when called on this, he

33:45.523 --> 33:50.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pays no price. That's -- I guess
that's -- if it's our fault, if

33:50.662 --> 33:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's the voters who are just fed
up, I don't know. UDY

33:55.066 --> 33:58.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Is that something,
though, that endures into this

33:58.370 --> 34:02.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
next year? Do you see that
phenomenon of being able to say

34:02.841 --> 34:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what he wants to say and having
it stand lasting and having an

34:07.612 --> 34:11.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effect? ICHAEL GERSON: I think
it's raising a very fundamental

34:11.283 --> 34:15.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issue in American politics,
which is, what is the meaning of

34:15.320 --> 34:18.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
authenticity? s it this kind
of, you know, offhand comment

34:18.990 --> 34:23.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Donald Trump engages in, or
is it crafted rhetoric? Is it

34:23.395 --> 34:26.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
careful policy? Is it
seriousness? And right now, we

34:26.698 --> 34:30.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have a model, a presidential
model of authenticity that means

34:30.368 --> 34:34.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thoughtlessness. And I think
that that's going to have to be

34:34.406 --> 34:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
retaken in the Republican Party.
UDY WOODRUFF: You know,

34:37.709 --> 34:40.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Michael, you mentioned
immigration, or at least what --

34:41.012 --> 34:45.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part of what Trump said, but
what -- Mark, what issues do you

34:45.784 --> 34:49.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see shaping this next -- these
-- this next phase, the

34:49.821 --> 34:53.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election, and leading up to
November? ARK SHIELDS: Well, I

34:53.491 --> 34:56.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think there's two that really
work against the Democrats,

34:56.795 --> 35:00.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
basically, a third White House
term. he first is the

35:00.465 --> 35:03.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
revelation in surveys, in Wall
Street Journal/NBC poll in

35:03.835 --> 35:07.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
particular, that 73 percent of
people want to change policies

35:07.505 --> 35:11.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from President Obama. So, every
election is either change or

35:11.176 --> 35:15.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
continuity. We're going to
continue or we're going to go in

35:15.213 --> 35:17.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a different direction.
CROSSTALK)JUDY WOODRUFF: ...

35:17.782 --> 35:20.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
50 percent, but 73 percent...
CROSSTALK)MARK SHIELDS:

35:20.719 --> 35:23.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Seventy-three percent want to
change the policies.That's

35:23.655 --> 35:28.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exactly the same number, Judy,
as it was in the summer of 2007,

35:28.426 --> 35:32.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when President Bush was in his
seventh year, which, remember,

35:32.097 --> 35:37.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2008 was very much of a change
year. And I would say the other

35:37.235 --> 35:40.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one is the Paris and San
Bernardino, when the emphasis

35:40.905 --> 35:44.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the focus switched in
America, which hurt Ben Carson,

35:44.576 --> 35:48.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obviously, but switched to
terrorism and sort of a fear and

35:48.613 --> 35:52.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
war on terror.And I think that
helps Republicans have -- who,

35:53.018 --> 35:56.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over the past generation, are
seen as better than the

35:56.688 --> 36:00.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats on national security.
Whether they should be or not,

36:00.358 --> 36:04.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they are. UDY WOODRUFF: What
issues do you see?MICHAEL

36:04.095 --> 36:08.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GERSON: I will tell you one
hopeful issue for 2016. ith

36:08.133 --> 36:11.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the right lineup, with, say,
President Rubio and Speaker

36:11.436 --> 36:15.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ryan, both of them have tried,
from the Republican side, to

36:15.473 --> 36:19.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
engage the issue of poverty.
Paul Ryan has traveled the

36:19.144 --> 36:22.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country looking at examples of
community-based efforts. Rubio

36:22.080 --> 36:26.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has put out serious policy on
EITC and other things.I'm

36:26.117 --> 36:29.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hoping that, under certain
circumstances -- it would be

36:29.421 --> 36:33.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
different from Cruz, for
example, or Trump -- but under

36:33.091 --> 36:36.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
certain circumstances, you do
have the groundwork laid for a

36:36.761 --> 36:40.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debate about social mobility in
this country that I think could

36:40.799 --> 36:44.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be very productive and is
necessary.JUDY WOODRUFF: And

36:44.102 --> 36:48.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on that hopeful note, we will
end it and once again say happy

36:48.873 --> 36:52.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new year to you both, 2016.
ARK SHIELDS: OK. Happy new

36:52.911 --> 36:56.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
year. ICHAEL GERSON: Happy new
year. UDY WOODRUFF: Michael

36:56.214 --> 36:59.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gerson, Mark Shields, thank you.
ARK SHIELDS: Judy Woodruff,

36:59.517 --> 37:02.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happy new year. LAUGHTER)
UDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.Now

37:02.887 --> 37:06.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
another in our conversations
with winners of the 2015

37:06.191 --> 37:09.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
National Book Awards. dam
Johnson, a professor of creative

37:09.494 --> 37:13.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
writing at Stanford and a 2012
Pulitzer winner, won the fiction

37:13.531 --> 37:16.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
category for his collection of
stories, "Fortune Smiles."

37:16.468 --> 37:20.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effrey Brown talked with him
recently at the Miami Book Fair,

37:20.505 --> 37:24.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
starting with a question about
the appeal of writing short

37:24.175 --> 37:27.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stories.ADAM JOHNSON, National
Book Award Winner: I love the

37:27.846 --> 37:32.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
short story.Having written two
novels in a row, I missed the

37:32.250 --> 37:37.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
power of the short story. To me,
a short story is like a battery

37:37.388 --> 37:41.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that can store emotion and just
charge you up directly with it,

37:41.793 --> 37:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it can hold emotion for as
long as you want and then

37:46.564 --> 37:50.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
transmit it.I have always
loved research. I have always

37:50.235 --> 37:54.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
loved going out into the world
and finding a twin for what's

37:54.639 --> 37:57.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going on inside me. Maybe
technology's part of that.

37:57.942 --> 38:01.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EFFREY BROWN: So, what starts
a story for you?ADAM JOHNSON:

38:01.980 --> 38:06.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have learned over the years to
trust my obsessions.JEFFREY

38:06.084 --> 38:08.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BROWN: Obsessions.ADAM
JOHNSON: When I get obsessed

38:09.020 --> 38:13.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about Nirvana songs, listening
to them over and over, or buying

38:13.057 --> 38:16.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mauri dade (ph) over the
Internet late at night and

38:16.728 --> 38:20.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
running up my eBay bill, it
usually means it's connected to

38:20.765 --> 38:25.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something inside. And I won't
know what it is until I put that

38:25.537 --> 38:29.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obsession into a story. EFFREY
BROWN: Mm-hmm. And does it come

38:29.574 --> 38:33.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quickly once you start? DAM
JOHNSON: These stories came very

38:33.244 --> 38:37.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quickly.You know, when you're
writing a novel, and it takes

38:37.282 --> 38:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years, there are all these
beautiful tempting stories that

38:40.585 --> 38:44.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come along and they say, write
me. Oh, no, quit your novel.

38:44.989 --> 38:48.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's hard work. It might fail.
Come write me. I'm alluring.

38:49.027 --> 38:52.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And...(LAUGHTER)ADAM
JOHNSON: But you have got to say

38:52.697 --> 38:56.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no to those.JEFFREY BROWN: You
have a personal relationship

38:56.367 --> 38:59.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with these stories, huh?ADAM
JOHNSON: That's the devil

38:59.671 --> 39:03.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talking, because you must
complete your novel and the long

39:03.408 --> 39:08.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
journey.And when I was done, I
couldn't wait to go write some

39:08.179 --> 39:12.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stories.JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.
And once you start, is there a

39:12.217 --> 39:16.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lot of chiseling that goes into
them? How crafted are -- no.

39:16.621 --> 39:20.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAM JOHNSON: I would say,
rather than drafting, it's more

39:20.291 --> 39:24.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about discovering.I write
scene by scene, and I think, I

39:24.329 --> 39:29.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want to get my character to this
point. I want to get my

39:29.100 --> 39:33.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
characters to the bedroom. I
want to get my characters toward

39:33.137 --> 39:37.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the appearance of the first
hologram. And then I just -- I

39:37.542 --> 39:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to really ponder and think
about what is going to happen

39:41.946 --> 39:45.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
next. think contemporary
fiction is very closely related

39:45.250 --> 39:48.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to improvisational jazz. The
jazz musician has a tradition,

39:48.553 --> 39:52.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has a talent, has some concerns.
It's in conversation. But he or

39:52.957 --> 39:57.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she doesn't know what the song
is going to be. It appears

39:57.362 --> 40:00.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before them.JEFFREY BROWN: The
first story, called "Nirvana,"

40:00.665 --> 40:04.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
involves holograms, involves new
technology. There, you had to do

40:04.335 --> 40:07.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a different kind of research, I
assume. DAM JOHNSON: Well,

40:08.006 --> 40:12.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just -- I just had to look
around me.JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

40:12.410 --> 40:16.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAM JOHNSON: I live in San
Francisco, and I work in Silicon

40:16.814 --> 40:19.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Valley and there are
self-driving cars. And on

40:19.751 --> 40:22.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Stanford campus, there will be
flying solar-powered autonomous

40:22.687 --> 40:26.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things zipping around, or things
that balance on one wheels that

40:26.724 --> 40:29.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
students are making.JEFFREY
BROWN: And yet we're still

40:30.028 --> 40:34.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
human, right, which is part of
what comes through in the story.

40:34.432 --> 40:38.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAM JOHNSON: That's exactly
it. And what is it going to mean

40:38.836 --> 40:42.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have holograms in our lives?
ou know, Josephine Baker is

40:42.874 --> 40:46.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going on tour next year.
EFFREY BROWN: Yes, you're

40:46.177 --> 40:50.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talking -- the great singer
FMDNMOØlong dead, but is going on

40:50.214 --> 40:53.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tour through a hologram.ADAM
JOHNSON: Long dead. That's

40:53.518 --> 40:56.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right.(CROSSTALK) EFFREY
BROWN: And that triggers

40:56.087 --> 40:59.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something for you.ADAM
JOHNSON: People are going to

40:59.390 --> 41:02.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fill auditoriums, because the
tickets have already sold out

41:06.431 --> 41:11.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

human voice is there, I think it

hen you and I talked after you

I just went back to look at that
interview. You said to me, when

41:52.310 --> 41:56.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I asked you, why North Korea,
"It seemed, as a writer, that

what we are talking about,

in stories. What does it do to

historian Carol Wallace, author
of To Marry an English Lord, Sir

45:29.126 --> 45:33.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"To Marry an English Lord": When
he had been asked by the

45:33.531 --> 45:36.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
producers to write a series
about English aristocrats, he

45:36.834 --> 45:41.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had been reading To Marry an
English Lord. And he said he

45:41.238 --> 45:45.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thought it was all very well for
these heiresses to marry, but

45:45.643 --> 45:50.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then what happened to them 20
years later when they were -- I

45:50.414 --> 45:55.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think he put it -- freezing in a
house in Cheshire, aching for

45:55.186 --> 45:58.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Long Island? And that, of
course, Cora Grantham's dilemma,

45:58.489 --> 46:02.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there she is right there. UDY
WOODRUFF: Wallace's book tells

46:02.159 --> 46:05.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the true stories of young
American heiresses who left the

46:05.896 --> 46:10.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. in the late 1800s to shop
for husbands in England. Their

46:10.301 --> 46:13.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
money attracted down at the
heels aristocrats who had titles

46:13.971 --> 46:18.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and little else.What would he
have seen in these stories, in

46:18.376 --> 46:22.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this history? AROL WALLACE: I
think what Julian saw, the

46:22.046 --> 46:26.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
source of the drama is exactly
the asymmetry of expectation --

46:26.083 --> 46:29.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what these American girls
thought marriage was going to be

46:29.754 --> 46:33.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and what it turned out to be,
and how their American

46:33.791 --> 46:37.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
expectations kind of, trailed
along with them and formed their

to people and houses and the

something that just felt it's

had a big impact on our personal
lives and we have been in it

47:12.396 --> 47:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
together. UDY WOODRUFF: The
drama began in 1912, the day

47:16.067 --> 47:19.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after the sinking of the
Titanic, and has proceeded

47:19.370 --> 47:24.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

flu and the jazz age. Season six

47:24.141 --> 47:28.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

many formerly rich families

47:28.546 --> 47:31.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
abandoning the life Downton
epitomizes, unable to afford the

47:31.849 --> 47:35.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
expanse. Like the character she
plays, McGovern is married to an

47:35.886 --> 47:40.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Englishman and lives in the U.
K.How is it different from

47:40.291 --> 47:42.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other television series?
LIZABETH MCGOVERN: Well, the

47:42.860 --> 47:46.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one extraordinary difference is
that every word is written by

47:46.530 --> 47:50.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one man. I don't know of any
other television show that works

47:50.935 --> 47:54.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that way. And I, to this day,
find it absolutely mindboggling.

actually thrilled to get other

48:02.680 --> 48:07.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

reason which I can't really

48:07.151 --> 48:11.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
explain, the series seem to have
quite a distinctive voice. And

48:11.188 --> 48:16.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we did try, at the beginning, to
see if we could get other people

48:16.327 --> 48:20.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to replicate that voice. And we
tried with very good people. But

48:20.731 --> 48:24.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it seemed that if we wanted to
sustain this particular voice,

48:24.769 --> 48:28.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it had to be me.REBECCA EATON,

suffering but the family is

49:03.374 --> 49:07.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

49:24.295 --> 49:27.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that. ULIAN FELLOWES: It's
this business of entitlement,

49:27.231 --> 49:31.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that a child of the middle or
upper caste is brought up to

49:32.002 --> 49:36.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
believe that certain things are
sort of their right, that this

49:36.040 --> 49:40.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is the way they will live.
Whereas other people are brought

49:40.077 --> 49:44.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up to feel like outsiders -- oh,
you're overreaching, so that's

49:44.114 --> 49:49.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not for the likes of us, and all
this stuff still goes on. t

49:49.253 --> 49:53.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
does interests me. It shocks me
and it drives me mad when people

49:54.024 --> 49:58.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
try to pretend it doesn't exist,
because, of course, it doesn't

49:58.062 --> 50:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exist for them. There are
millions of people who are being

50:02.099 --> 50:05.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cheated of their proper destiny
because it does still exist.

50:05.769 --> 50:09.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UDY WOODRUFF: Do you think
Downton contributes to the

50:09.073 --> 50:12.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conversation, to the discussion
of that?JULIAN FELLOWES: I

50:12.376 --> 50:16.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hope it contributes. I mean, I
think in our society,

50:16.046 --> 50:19.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
particularly for the me-me-me
generation, there is a kind of

50:19.717 --> 50:24.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
underlined solipsism in so many
of us that the only life that's

50:24.121 --> 50:28.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really happening is our own. And
everyone else's life is sort of

50:28.525 --> 50:32.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dependent on our life.One of
the important things about drama

50:32.563 --> 50:36.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is to remind the viewer that
everyone is 100 percent at the

50:36.967 --> 50:41.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
center of their own life. That
there is no life being lived

50:41.372 --> 50:45.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
under that roof that is more or
less important; that Mary or

50:45.776 --> 50:49.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Daisy, what happens to them is
just as important. And that's

50:49.813 --> 50:53.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why we have equal dramatic
weight for all the stories, to

50:53.851 --> 50:57.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
show that.JUDY WOODRUFF: What
do you think will give people

50:57.888 --> 51:01.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
great joy and excitement and
surprise, in a good way? And

51:01.926 --> 51:05.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what do you think will leave
people sad or devastated or

51:06.030 --> 51:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disappointed? ULIAN FELLOWES:
I adore these questions because

51:08.966 --> 51:12.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're always asked in such
optimism, as if there is any

51:13.003 --> 51:17.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chance that I will answer. I
mean, of course, there are some

51:17.408 --> 51:21.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things in the season that will
make people sad and there are

51:21.812 --> 51:26.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other things that will make them
happy. And Maggie will say some

51:26.216 --> 51:30.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things that I hope will make
them laugh. UDY WOODRUFF: What

51:30.254 --> 51:33.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should fans expect, the audience
expect? LIZABETH MCGOVERN: I

51:33.557 --> 51:37.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would say that the audience will
feel satisfied that they've had

51:37.594 --> 51:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a chance to say goodbye to every
character in a gratifying way. I

51:42.366 --> 51:45.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think they'll feel full and not
shortchanged. ULIAN FELLOWES:

51:45.669 --> 51:50.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's enough for me that people
enjoyed it, and they had a thing

51:50.441 --> 51:54.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Sunday night and they would
say to each other, hurry up,

51:54.845 --> 51:58.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Downton is starting in five
minutes or whatever. I love

51:58.515 --> 52:03.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that. nd I think that if we
all manage to produce a show

52:03.354 --> 52:06.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that families could watch
together and argue over the

52:06.657 --> 52:11.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
water cooler in the office the
next day, that's enough of an

52:11.061 --> 52:15.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
achievement for me. I don't need
to feel that the world will

52:15.466 --> 52:19.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
never be the same again after
Downton, because it will. UDY

WOODRUFF: And beginning the
first Sunday in January, fans

52:22.806 --> 52:27.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can lose themselves in the lives
of the people they have come to

52:27.578 --> 52:30.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know as friends.And the
"NewsHour" caught up with

52:30.881 --> 52:34.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
additional actors from the
series. They talk about the

52:34.184 --> 52:37.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
characters they play and the
experience working on "Downton

52:37.488 --> 52:41.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Abbey." That's to be seen Sunday
on "NewsHour Weekend."On the

52:41.525 --> 52:44.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"NewsHour" online right now:
Meet one Syrian refugee family,

Read about their challenges, as
well as the support they have

52:51.435 --> 52:55.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
received since they arrived. All
that and more is on our Web

NewsHour Weekend" Saturday:

52:58.409 --> 53:02.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Millions of Americans live in
manufactured homes -- why are

53:02.079 --> 53:05.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of them facing financial
obstacles.Here's an excerpt

53:05.449 --> 53:09.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from that report. ARRATOR: In
2006, Carla Burr was looking for

53:09.486 --> 53:12.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a new home. She bought this
three-bedroom manufactured home

53:12.790 --> 53:17.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for $113,000. Now 61 years old,
Burr and her home may need to

53:17.561 --> 53:22.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
move. hile she owns the home
-- she made the purchase in cash

53:22.332 --> 53:25.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- she doesn't own the land
underneath. Every month, Burr

53:26.003 --> 53:30.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pays rent to a property manager.
Over the past 10 years, that lot

53:30.774 --> 53:35.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rent has gone up 30 percent,
from $740 a month to $1,022 a

53:35.546 --> 53:39.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
month.CARLA BURR, Homeowner: I
had no clue that the rent was

53:39.950 --> 53:45.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to go up the way it did. I
mean, it's to the point now

53:45.456 --> 53:49.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where it's more than half my
Social Security.JUDY WOODRUFF:

53:49.126 --> 53:52.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's tomorrow night on "PBS
NewsHour Weekend."And we will

53:52.796 --> 53:57.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

53:57.201 --> 54:00.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

54:00.504 --> 54:04.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

baby. hat is the "NewsHour"
