JUDY WOODRUFF: We return to our
series Inside Putin's Russia
-- tonight, the fate of some

00:04.933 --> 00:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Kremlin's opponents.

00:07.033 --> 00:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
According to one study, in the
past three years, 38 prominent
Russians have been murdered

00:12.833 --> 00:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or died suspiciously.

00:14.833 --> 00:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The high mortality rate
among some Russian critics
has a long history.

00:19.400 --> 00:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But critics say it is emblematic
of how President Vladimir
Putin runs today's Russia.

00:26.466 --> 00:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Nick
Schifrin and producer Zach
Fannin report from Moscow.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In today's
Russia, there are consequences
to criticizing the state.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Police tell protesters their
rally isn't sanctioned.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are asking President
Vladimir Putin not to
run for reelection.

00:43.900 --> 00:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This demonstration is
sponsored by the opposition
group Open Russia.

00:47.300 --> 00:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Saint Petersburg, and across
the country, police arrested
more than 100 protesters.

00:51.933 --> 00:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA, Open
Russia: These democratic
opposition activists
are being arrested and

00:55.433 --> 00:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
given lengthy prison sentences.

00:57.466 --> 01:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is members of the democratic
opposition who are being
forced into exile, or harassed,

01:01.066 --> 01:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or attacked, or murdered.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN:
Thirty-five--year-old
Vladimir Kara-Murza is Open
Russia's vice chairman.

01:06.433 --> 01:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is an outspoken activist,
demonstrating against Putin
and organizing protests.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We first sat down with
him late last year.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA: We
believe in the rule of law.

01:15.333 --> 01:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We believe in human rights.

01:17.466 --> 01:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We believe that Russia
should enjoy the same
democratic institutions
that the rest of Europe

01:20.500 --> 01:22.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
enjoys.

01:22.533 --> 01:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: To try and create
those democratic institutions,
he teamed up with the man he

01:24.500 --> 01:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
calls his mentor, Boris Nemtsov,
a former deputy prime minister
who became the country's

01:29.100 --> 01:31.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
leading dissident.

01:31.133 --> 01:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The two traveled to Washington
to highlight the mysterious
death of Sergei Magnitsky,

01:34.100 --> 01:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lawyer who exposed corruption
among senior officials.

01:38.066 --> 01:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nemtsov and Kara-Murza
convinced the U.S. Congress to
freeze the assets of Russians

01:42.066 --> 01:44.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believed connected
to Magnitsky's death.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA:
These people in the
current Russian regime who
rule like to keep their

01:47.800 --> 01:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
money, their assets in the West.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They want to
vacation in the West.

01:51.100 --> 01:53.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They send their kids
to schools to the West.

01:53.600 --> 01:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this personal accountability
may well be the only thing
that will make them think

01:58.000 --> 02:00.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
twice.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: A little more
than two years later, Nemtsov
was assassinated a few hundred

02:02.600 --> 02:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
feet from the Kremlin's walls.

02:04.133 --> 02:06.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His death was
brazen and shocking.

02:06.166 --> 02:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the spot where
Boris Nemtsov was killed.

02:09.100 --> 02:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can see the corner of
the Kremlin, right there, just
a few hundreds yards away,

02:13.166 --> 02:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and you can see the memorial
for him that's on this bridge.

02:17.333 --> 02:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Today in Moscow, a court
sentenced five people
in Nemtsov's murder.

02:20.900 --> 02:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether or not they were the
masterminds, they permanently
silenced Nemtsov's outspoken

02:25.333 --> 02:26.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
criticism.

02:26.800 --> 02:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kara-Murza believes someone
used poison to silence him too.

02:29.033 --> 02:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA: And I
started suddenly feeling really,
really sick, and within a

02:33.300 --> 02:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
space of 15 to 20 minutes, I
went from feeling completely
normal, like I am now, to having

02:39.733 --> 02:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a really rapid heart rate,
sweating, palpitation.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I started vomiting, and then
I just lost consciousness.

02:44.733 --> 02:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kidneys, I think went first.

02:46.433 --> 02:51.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then it was the heart,
the lungs, the stomach,
the liver, everything.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everything just shut down.

02:54.833 --> 02:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I have no doubt that
this was a deliberate
attempt to murder, based
on my political activities,

02:59.100 --> 03:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
motivated by my activities
in the Russian opposition.

03:01.066 --> 03:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: There are
people who are working as
opposition who are not targeted.

03:06.933 --> 03:09.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What is the line that
you apparently crossed?

03:09.500 --> 03:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA: There's
the clear line between just
saying things that are against

03:13.533 --> 03:18.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the regime, and it's a totally
different thing to go after
their own personal interests,

03:18.066 --> 03:19.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after their pockets.

03:19.566 --> 03:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The history of
assassination goes back decades.

03:22.533 --> 03:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In 1940, Leon Trotsky was
killed with an ice axe.

03:25.666 --> 03:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2006, crusading
Russian journalist Anna
Politkovskaya was murdered.

03:30.300 --> 03:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in 2014, Alexander
Litvinenko, a former
intelligence agent who
accused Putin of ordering

03:36.766 --> 03:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Politkovskaya's death, was
killed by radioactive tea.

03:39.300 --> 03:43.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Denis Voronenkov was a pro-Putin
lawmaker who defected to
Ukraine and became a Putin

03:43.766 --> 03:45.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
critic.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In March, he was walking down
the street in Kiev when a
gunman shot him three times.

03:48.666 --> 03:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
His body bled out on
the sidewalk in the
middle of the day.

03:51.900 --> 03:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Maria Maksakova is his widow.

03:53.933 --> 03:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIA MAKSAKOVA, Widow of Denis
Voronenkov: I was dreaming
about my first spring in Kiev

03:57.500 --> 03:59.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Denis.

03:59.066 --> 04:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was dreaming so desperately.

04:01.533 --> 04:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At first, I thought it's better
not to be born at all when
you lose something like that.

04:06.500 --> 04:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Maksakova
lives in Kiev, where she
is raising their son.

04:09.600 --> 04:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Moscow, she and Voronenkov
were both lawmakers
allied with Putin, and
they enjoyed the spoils

04:14.166 --> 04:16.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that come from power.

04:16.733 --> 04:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he'd also been an
investigator who uncovered
corruption in the Russian
intelligence agency,

04:20.033 --> 04:21.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the FSB.

04:21.233 --> 04:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Who do you think
killed your husband?

04:22.500 --> 04:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARIA MAKSAKOVA: He
had certain enemies.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And these enemies
are in the FSB.

04:27.633 --> 04:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The anti-corruption teams that
he would investigate from here,
that is loss of money and loss

04:37.833 --> 04:42.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of influence, loss of
everything, positions.

04:42.733 --> 04:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that was something that
they would not let him do.

04:45.100 --> 04:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Russia calls
her claim a fabrication.

04:48.033 --> 04:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But his death fits a pattern.

04:50.066 --> 04:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A once-loyal family member
becomes an outspoken
opponent and ends up dead.

04:53.233 --> 04:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MASHA GESSEN, Author/Activist:
A mafia family, you can be born
into, you can be adopted into

04:56.533 --> 04:57.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

04:57.533 --> 04:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can't leave it voluntarily.

04:59.566 --> 05:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People who have tried to leave
the Putin family voluntarily
have not fared very well.

05:03.066 --> 05:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Masha Gessen is a
Russian journalist, author, and
prolific anti-Putin activist.

05:08.033 --> 05:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have been dubbed by
some an enemy of the state.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are you an enemy of the state?

05:13.800 --> 05:15.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MASHA GESSEN: Well, I
am certainly an enemy
of the mafia state.

05:15.433 --> 05:16.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely, yes.

05:16.666 --> 05:19.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm not an enemy of
the Russian state.

05:19.100 --> 05:22.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Gessen
was the first journalist
blacklisted by Putin's Kremlin.

05:22.866 --> 05:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's also been targeted
because she's a lesbian who's
raising adopted children.

05:26.066 --> 05:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
He was born by a woman I don't
know and first met when he

05:32.800 --> 05:34.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
was 2.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In 2013,
she helped lead a video
campaign criticizing
an anti-gay propaganda

05:36.900 --> 05:38.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law.

05:38.933 --> 05:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It helped condone homophobia
and attacks on gay Russians, and
Gessen argues the law explains

05:42.533 --> 05:44.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
how Putin rules.

05:44.633 --> 05:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MASHA GESSEN: The autocrat
needs everybody out in the
street with flags aloft.

05:49.733 --> 05:51.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is primarily the
need for mobilization.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To have mobilization,
you need to have enemies.

05:54.466 --> 05:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can have LGBT people as
enemies today, and then you
can have Americans tomorrow,

05:59.433 --> 06:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and keep the LGBT people in
your back pocket and then pull
them out when you need them

06:02.700 --> 06:04.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

06:04.766 --> 06:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And Gessen says
above it all is a boss served
by loyal lieutenants, who

06:07.966 --> 06:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't need explicit
instructions to launch attacks.

06:10.200 --> 06:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MASHA GESSEN: The patriarch
of the family will say, do I
always have to tell you what

06:15.666 --> 06:17.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do?

06:17.200 --> 06:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like, don't you know what
the right thing to do is?

06:19.366 --> 06:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Does the Kremlin
kill its political enemies?

06:21.333 --> 06:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SERGEY MARKOV, Russian
National Strategic Council:
One hundred percent sure not.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The Kremlin
declined our interview request.

06:25.566 --> 06:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Sergey Markov, a
member of Putin's party
and Russia's National
Strategic Council, reflects

06:32.700 --> 06:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Kremlin's defense,
counterpunch and embrace
conspiracy theories, starting
with the assassinated

06:35.400 --> 06:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opposition leader Boris Nemtsov.

06:37.133 --> 06:39.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SERGEY MARKOV: Who
organized his killing?

06:39.600 --> 06:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I strongly believe that it's
terrorist organization SBU,
intelligence service of Ukraine.

06:46.166 --> 06:48.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Ukraine
killed Boris Nemtsov?

06:48.133 --> 06:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SERGEY MARKOV: Not Ukraine.

06:50.833 --> 06:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ukraine is country run by
terrorists, but terrorists who
captured Ukraine, they killed

06:57.400 --> 06:58.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Boris Nemtsov.

06:58.566 --> 06:59.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But
it's more than Nemtsov.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

07:00.666 --> 07:01.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Vladimir Kara-Murza has
been poisoned twice.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Anna Politkovskaya was killed.

07:04.466 --> 07:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a lot of people
who have criticized the
Kremlin who end up dead.

07:07.233 --> 07:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SERGEY MARKOV: First
of all, not too much.

07:09.233 --> 07:14.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This atmosphere of
killing people exists,
but this atmosphere
had been created not by

07:16.233 --> 07:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Vladimir Putin, but by Western
countries against Russia.

07:20.500 --> 07:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For the people
Putin targets, that argument
is an attempt to distract.

07:24.866 --> 07:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKHAIL KASYANOV, Former
Russian Prime Minister:
Russia surrounded by enemies.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We should support even
stronger than before our
leader, et cetera, et cetera.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is standard propaganda
for any authoritarian regime.

07:35.366 --> 07:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Mikhail
Kasyanov was Putin's
first prime minister.

07:38.333 --> 07:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the early 2000s, the two
worked together to pass much
needed economic reforms.

07:42.866 --> 07:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2004, Putin fired him, and
Kasyanov became an outspoken
opposition politician, appearing

07:49.066 --> 07:52.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
alongside Boris Nemtsov
and Vladimir Kara-Murza.

07:52.033 --> 07:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, a prominent Putin
ally posted a video of him
and Kara-Murza in crosshairs.

07:56.433 --> 07:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But not all of the Kremlin's
enemies end up dead.

07:59.233 --> 08:01.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Some end up humiliated.

08:01.100 --> 08:02.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How did they target you?

08:02.433 --> 08:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIKHAIL KASYANOV: On television.

08:04.466 --> 08:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're blackmailing me and
just creating dirty stories,
et cetera, et cetera.

08:07.933 --> 08:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Five
months before 2015
elections, state television
broadcast Kasyanov having

08:12.766 --> 08:14.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sex with his assistant.

08:14.433 --> 08:16.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The video helped
fracture his party.

08:16.500 --> 08:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKHAIL KASYANOV: They will
try to destroy publicly, to
destroy morally and reputation

08:22.466 --> 08:23.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of all of us.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they're doing this
quite successfully.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they will
continue doing this.

08:27.566 --> 08:30.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And
is there anything you
can do to stop them?

08:30.066 --> 08:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKHAIL KASYANOV: We
cannot do anything because
we have no protection.

08:32.900 --> 08:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA: We have
no free and fair elections.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have censorship in the media.

08:37.133 --> 08:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have political prisoners,
more than 100 political
prisoners now in Russia, today.

08:40.066 --> 08:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: One year after
he nearly died from poisoning,
Kara-Murza got better, and

08:43.966 --> 08:45.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
restarted his work.

08:45.966 --> 08:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In February, he was a few
hours away from boarding a
plane to Washington, where his

08:49.500 --> 08:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
family lives for their
safety, when he says he
was poisoned a second time.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We sat down with him and
his wife, Evgenia, in march.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA:
And I couldn't breathe.

08:57.900 --> 09:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at this stage, when you
are lying there, trying to gasp
for air, you know, I felt just

09:04.500 --> 09:09.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
life slowly going out
of the whole body.

09:10.933 --> 09:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I remember that distinct
feeling that, this is it.

09:12.766 --> 09:14.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is the end.

09:14.933 --> 09:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now I'm going to die.

09:16.966 --> 09:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only thing I was able to
do, I called my wife, Evgenia,
who was here in the United

09:21.166 --> 09:23.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

09:23.233 --> 09:24.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EVGENIA KARA-MURZA, Wife
of Vladimir Kara-Murza:
I asked them to take
him to the hospital,

09:24.666 --> 09:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the same medical team
that had treated him in 2015.

09:27.066 --> 09:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Had he been on the plane, had
he been alone in his apartment,
had he been somewhere with

09:34.500 --> 09:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
- - I don't know, in the streets
of Moscow - - oh, my God.

09:43.466 --> 09:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Kara-Murza
had noticed that, almost
every night, Moscow
city workers removed

09:51.000 --> 09:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Boris Nemtsov's memorial.

09:52.500 --> 09:56.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So he made a film to protect
his mentor's career and life.

09:56.166 --> 10:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA: That
film was the most difficult
thing I ever did in my life.

10:03.166 --> 10:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The film is about the portrait
of a man who could, if not
for a quirk of fate, very well

10:07.733 --> 10:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
become the president of Russia.

10:08.666 --> 10:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Do you miss him?

10:10.666 --> 10:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA: There
are no words to describe
how much I miss him.

10:17.333 --> 10:19.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sorry.

10:19.400 --> 10:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVGENIA KARA-MURZA: The risks,
they do hit close to home,
closer and closer every time.

10:26.800 --> 10:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Have you ever
asked him not to go back?

10:32.966 --> 10:33.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
EVGENIA KARA-MURZA:
It is terrifying.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not going to lie to you.

10:35.933 --> 10:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I want him to continue to
do what he thinks is important,
what he thinks is right.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And her
faith allows Kara-Murza
to keep his faith that
he can change the system.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says, after recovering, he
will go back to Russia to finish
the work that he and Nemtsov

10:53.933 --> 10:55.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
started.

10:55.433 --> 10:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Nick Schifrin in Moscow.

10:58.333 --> 11:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And our week-long
series Inside Putin's Russia
continues tomorrow with a look

11:04.766 --> 11:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the relationship between
Russia and the United States.
