JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.741 --> 00:13.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
presidential
candidates zero in on Donald
Trump. Could

00:13.247 --> 00:18.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
backlash over his comments about
abortion
influence women voters?

00:18.051 --> 00:24.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: how new computer software,
one app,
is giving high school students
cash for getting

00:24.558 --> 00:26.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
good grades.

00:26.493 --> 00:31.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PRESTON SILVERMAN, Founder,
Raise.me: Instead
of waiting for four years to
find out if you're

00:31.298 --> 00:35.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
going to receive any
scholarship, students
are getting a short feedback
loop each semester,

00:35.969 --> 00:37.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
each grade they get.

00:37.838 --> 00:43.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And five of the
most prominent
women's soccer players file a
complaint that

00:43.076 --> 00:48.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are being paid less than
the men's team,
despite bring in more revenue.

00:48.382 --> 00:51.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.718 --> 00:55.989 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:56.023 --> 01:09.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's five days
until the Wisconsin
primary, and rivals in both
parties are turning

01:09.836 --> 01:11.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up the heat on Donald Trump.

01:11.939 --> 01:18.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After a rough 24 hours, the
Republican front-runner
stayed mostly out of the public
eye today.

01:18.445 --> 01:25.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Off the campaign trail, Donald
Trump spent
his day at meetings in
Washington. One was

01:25.385 --> 01:31.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with his foreign policy team, a
day after
he refused to rule out a nuclear
strike against

01:31.758 --> 01:33.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Islamic State militants.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC: Can you
tell the Middle
East we're not using a nuclear
weapon on anybody?

01:36.096 --> 01:37.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I would never say that. I would
never take

01:37.297 --> 01:38.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any of my cards off the table.

01:38.665 --> 01:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS MATTHEWS: How about
Europe? We won't
use it in Europe?

01:39.900 --> 01:41.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I -- I'm not going
to take it
off the table.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS MATTHEWS: You might use it
in Europe?

01:43.236 --> 01:43.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:43.737 --> 01:45.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: No.

01:45.572 --> 01:48.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In fact, U.S.
presidents by
tradition do not rule out the
use of nuclear

01:48.475 --> 01:50.344 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weapons.

01:50.377 --> 01:56.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In that same televised town
hall, Trump also
said women who have abortions
should be punished

01:56.783 --> 02:02.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if they're ever made illegal.
Later, in a
new statement, he said the
physician, not

02:02.556 --> 02:04.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the woman, should face
penalties.

02:04.992 --> 02:11.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Republican rival John
Kasich pounced
as he campaigned on Trump's home
turf, New

02:11.365 --> 02:13.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
York City

02:13.100 --> 02:15.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
He becomes unmoored and then has
to spend

02:15.569 --> 02:20.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of time trying to figure
out how to
correct all the mistakes that he
made. And

02:20.207 --> 02:25.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have to tell you that, as a
commander in
chief, and leader of the free
world, you don't

02:25.479 --> 02:27.114 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get do-overs.

02:27.147 --> 02:31.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Purchase, New
York, the
Democratic front-runner, Hillary
Clinton,

02:31.318 --> 02:33.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
zeroed in on the abortion
comments.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
You know one of my favorite
Americans, Maya

02:36.890 --> 02:41.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Angelou, said, when someone
shows you who
they are, believe them.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:43.397 --> 02:48.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Donald
Trump is showing
us exactly who he is, and we
should believe

02:48.068 --> 02:49.970 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton's rival,
Bernie Sanders,
took on Trump's comments
indirectly in Pittsburgh.

02:53.707 --> 02:57.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
All of you are aware of
Republicans running

02:57.878 --> 03:05.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all over the country talking
about family
values. And what they mean is no
woman in

03:05.252 --> 03:13.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this huge room, in this state,
in this country
should have the right to control
her own body.

03:13.493 --> 03:14.061 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I disagree.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:15.929 --> 03:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For all of the
candidates,
the next big day of reckoning
looms Tuesday,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in primaries in Wisconsin.

03:22.035 --> 03:27.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will talk with one of Donald
Trump's main
foreign policy advisers right
after the news

03:27.340 --> 03:29.109 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

03:29.142 --> 03:33.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parts of the South kept watch
today for heavy
thunderstorms and possible
tornadoes. Heavy

03:33.713 --> 03:39.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rainfall triggered flood watches
in Georgia
and Louisiana, and tornado
alerts in parts

03:39.252 --> 03:45.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Mississippi, Alabama,
Tennessee, and Kentucky.
Last night, a tornado touched
down several

03:45.258 --> 03:51.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
times in Northeastern Oklahoma.
It damaged
homes and businesses and injured
at least

03:51.098 --> 03:52.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
seven people.

03:52.966 --> 03:58.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least 21 people died in India
today when
an overpass that was under
construction collapsed.

03:58.705 --> 04:05.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happened in a busy commercial
district
in Kolkata. More than 70 people
were injured,

04:05.212 --> 04:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with an undetermined number
still to be rescued.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jonathan Miller of Independent
Television
News has our report.

04:11.785 --> 04:19.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN MILLER: A frantic,
terrifying chaos
followed the Kolkata collapse,
as people tore

04:19.359 --> 04:25.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with their bare hands at twisted
reinforcing
steel and crumbled concrete to
free those

04:25.632 --> 04:27.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
trapped and still alive.

04:27.634 --> 04:34.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A freshly concreted
300-foot-long section
of the flyover had given way,
crushing cars

04:34.307 --> 04:40.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and trucks and auto-rickshaws,
pinning pedestrians
and vehicle occupants under tons
of mangled

04:40.380 --> 04:43.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
metal and cement.

04:43.984 --> 04:50.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CCTV footage caught the moment,
two yellow
ambassador taxis among the
vehicles crawling

04:50.190 --> 04:57.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
along Burrabazar, then this.
Someone said
it sounded like a bomb
exploding. You can

04:57.564 --> 05:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see how many must have been
entombed in this
small area alone.

05:01.101 --> 05:07.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"There were loads of people
standing underneath,"
this man says. "Rickshaws,
taxis, everything

05:07.440 --> 05:08.608 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was buried."

05:08.642 --> 05:12.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Local residents as furious as
they were horrified.

05:12.546 --> 05:17.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"I can't tell you exactly why it
collapsed,"
this man says, "but it happened
because they

05:17.717 --> 05:20.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were trying to finish its
construction in
a rush."

05:20.053 --> 05:26.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"This is the state of our
engineering," she
says. "There is corruption
everywhere."

05:26.826 --> 05:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, the search-and-rescue
efforts have
continued under spotlights, the
army and specialist

05:33.934 --> 05:40.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
teams deployed now, all as
recriminations
build in advance of next month's
state elections.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are likely to be political
victims of
this tragedy as well.

05:43.910 --> 05:47.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The cause of the
incident is
now under investigation.

05:47.981 --> 05:53.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, there's word of one of
the deadliest
attacks since a cease-fire took
effect a month

05:53.653 --> 05:59.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago. Opposition activists say at
least 23
people died in government
airstrikes that

05:59.492 --> 06:05.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hit near a school and hospital
just east of
Damascus. That area is divided
among various

06:05.966 --> 06:07.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
factions.

06:07.801 --> 06:12.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Embattled South African
President Jacob Zuma
is facing more legal trouble.
The country's

06:12.372 --> 06:17.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
highest court ruled today that
he failed to
uphold the constitution by using
more than

06:17.777 --> 06:23.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$20 million in state money to
upgrade his
private home. It's the latest in
a string

06:23.283 --> 06:27.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of claims that Zuma has abused
his power.

06:27.220 --> 06:31.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the North
Korean nuclear
threat dominated a meeting
between President

06:31.658 --> 06:36.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama and his counterparts from
Japan and
South Korea. It was the first
time they'd

06:36.730 --> 06:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
met since the North's latest
nuclear and missile
tests.

06:40.467 --> 06:45.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afterward, the leaders warned
their countries
could take new action to counter
any threats

06:45.805 --> 06:47.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from the North.

06:47.607 --> 06:49.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
We recognize that our security
is linked,

06:49.843 --> 06:56.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we have to work together to
meet this
challenge, and we also recognize
that it is

06:56.783 --> 07:03.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
important to the entire
international community
to vigilantly reinforce the
strong U.N. security

07:03.657 --> 07:09.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
measures that were passed in
light of some
of the ballistic missile and
nuclear activity

07:09.462 --> 07:12.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Pyongyang has been engaging
in.

07:12.265 --> 07:17.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Obama also
met with Chinese
President Xi Jinping. We will
take a closer

07:17.437 --> 07:22.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look at the challenges Xi faces
at home after
the news summary.

07:22.442 --> 07:29.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In economic news, California
lawmakers approved
raising the state minimum wage
to $15. That's

07:29.316 --> 07:31.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the highest in the nation.

07:31.518 --> 07:37.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street was mostly down.
The Dow Jones
industrial average lost 31
points to close

07:37.223 --> 07:44.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at 17685. The Nasdaq rose a
fraction, and
the S&amp;P 500 slipped four.

07:44.864 --> 07:51.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And famed architect Zaha Hadid
died today,
in Miami, after a heart attack.
She was known

07:51.338 --> 07:56.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for bold, futuristic designs,
and was the
first woman to win
architecture's Pritzker

07:56.843 --> 08:02.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prize. Hadid's work includes the
glittering
opera house in Guangzhou, China,
the curved

08:02.816 --> 08:09.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heydar Aliyev center in Baku,
Azerbaijan,
and the London Aquatics Center
used for the

08:09.389 --> 08:14.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2012 Olympics. Zaha Hadid was 65
years old.

08:14.561 --> 08:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a Donald
Trump foreign policy adviser on
the GOP front-runner's

08:20.100 --> 08:26.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world view; what is driving the
women's vote
for president this year; China's
president

08:26.906 --> 08:36.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Washington amid unusual
public criticism
back home; and much more.

08:36.950 --> 08:43.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Washington amid unusual
public criticism
back home; and much more.

08:43.123 --> 08:48.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We return now to politics, and a
look at where
the candidates stand on foreign
policy.

08:48.228 --> 08:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we focus on Republican
front-runner
Donald Trump. He met with his
foreign policy

08:53.500 --> 08:55.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
team earlier today.

08:55.402 --> 09:00.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are joined now by one of
the advisers
in that meeting. He's Walid
Phares. He was

09:00.340 --> 09:03.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an adviser to Mitt Romney in the
2012 campaign.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, Mr. Phares, welcome to the
program.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALID PHARES, Donald Trump
Foreign Policy
Adviser: Thank you very much.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You were just
telling me the
meeting went on for two hours.

09:09.616 --> 09:13.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's just get this on the
table. There's
been a lot of criticism lately
that Mr. Trump

09:13.052 --> 09:18.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not well-informed when it
comes to international
affairs. How well-informed is
he?

09:18.558 --> 09:22.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID PHARES: Well, in this
meeting, we felt
that he was informed about many
actors and

09:22.929 --> 09:24.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
players in the world.

09:24.798 --> 09:29.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, he has to be informed
by his advisers
now, and, hopefully, if he wins,
by the actual

09:29.369 --> 09:33.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agencies. So he is collecting
that information,
collecting the assessment, and
focusing on

09:33.840 --> 09:36.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the most important and
priorities for him.

09:36.276 --> 09:40.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He's gotten some
headlines
lately for comments he's made
about the use

09:40.447 --> 09:47.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of nuclear weapons both in the
Asian theater
and in Europe toward ISIS. Would
U.S. policy

09:47.687 --> 09:51.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the use of nuclear weapons
in any way
change under a President Trump,
do you think?

09:51.825 --> 09:55.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID PHARES: Well, let's pay
attention to
his words. He said, I won't rule
it out. It

09:55.728 --> 09:58.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
won't be off the table, but then
there would
be an exception.

09:58.531 --> 10:03.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the exception would be if in
a case that
terrorists would obtain nukes,
then maybe

10:03.269 --> 10:07.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his adviser will tell him, we
would need that.
But it is not going to change
our whole posture

10:07.774 --> 10:09.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Russians and the
Chinese and others
as well.

10:09.809 --> 10:15.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that because
he doesn't
want to take them off the table?
What is behind

10:15.315 --> 10:17.050 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that thinking?

10:17.083 --> 10:18.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID PHARES: In his doctrine
and probably
his in approach to all issues,
he doesn't

10:18.885 --> 10:22.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to let go of any of the
options. It doesn't
mean that he's going to use that
option.

10:22.856 --> 10:27.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, his new doctrine of national
security
is going to be one a little bit
wider in scenarios,

10:27.460 --> 10:29.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how to build those scenarios,
and how to react
to these scenarios.

10:30.029 --> 10:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He's also made
news in the
last few days with his comments
about NATO,

10:33.566 --> 10:37.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying he thinks NATO should
pick up more
of the cost of its own defense.
Is that because

10:37.704 --> 10:41.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he thinks NATO is not under
serious threat
from Russia?

10:41.241 --> 10:45.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID PHARES: Actually, that's
another example
of how probably the perception
of what he

10:45.111 --> 10:46.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said is different from what he
meant.

10:46.946 --> 10:52.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why these important
meetings are very
helpful. What he meant by a NATO
review is

10:52.252 --> 10:57.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that NATO was created under --
during the
Cold War, and the posture
changed. Most of

10:57.724 --> 11:02.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the crises now are in the Levant
and North
Africa and other places. So, he
wants to restructure

11:02.095 --> 11:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the NATO alliance on the one
hand and then
restructure the policy towards
Russia as well.

11:06.566 --> 11:09.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that because
he thinks Russia
is not a serious threat?

11:09.936 --> 11:14.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID PHARES: He does believe
that Russia
-- we and Russia have serious
problems, serious

11:14.641 --> 11:17.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tensions, and he recognized them
in Ukraine,
in Crimea.

11:17.577 --> 11:21.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he also knows that Russia is
also threatened
by the jihadists or by ISIS. And
it's threatened

11:21.814 --> 11:25.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even more than us. So he thinks
that that
could be an area where we can
collaborate

11:25.818 --> 11:29.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Russians against the
jihadists, while
we maintain our friendship and
alliance with

11:29.489 --> 11:31.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our partners in Europe.

11:31.291 --> 11:34.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of
the jihadists,
you were telling us that one of
the things

11:34.193 --> 11:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
discussed today was a new
approach toward
ISIS. What could that look like?

11:38.231 --> 11:42.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID PHARES: That new approach
could be,
number one, having something to
do with a

11:42.435 --> 11:48.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
collaboration, not just with
Russia, but also
maybe with China, with India,
with other African

11:48.041 --> 11:49.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
countries, with Egypt.

11:49.876 --> 11:53.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, increase the series of
coalitions in the
region on the one hand. On the
other hand,

11:53.379 --> 11:58.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most important element
against ISIS may
well be an Arab coalition, and a
serious Arab

11:58.184 --> 12:01.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coalition that would actually do
the job on
the ground, but we need to be
helpful with

12:01.654 --> 12:03.556 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as you know,
this administration
has tried to put together an
Arab coalition,

12:05.458 --> 12:10.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tried to get countries in the
region to work
together toward ISIS. It hasn't
happened.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How would Mr. Trump be able to
make it happen?

12:12.231 --> 12:16.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID PHARES: Because maybe the
reason for
why it didn't happen, one of the
reasons,

12:16.402 --> 12:21.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the Iran deal, in the sense
that the administration
was very nervous about not
endangering the

12:21.074 --> 12:25.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran deal. And, therefore, the
Arab coalition
was very nervous about the Iran
deal.

12:25.211 --> 12:27.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now it has been signed, so a new
era could
be opened with the Arab leaders.

12:27.880 --> 12:31.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally, I
want to ask
you, Mr. Phares, about a comment
made today

12:31.184 --> 12:36.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the Chinese leader, Xi
Jinping, where I'm
just now seeing on the wires
he's saying words

12:36.823 --> 12:42.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to this effect, that he's not
going to allow
other nations to violate China's
sovereignty

12:42.228 --> 12:44.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the South China Sea.

12:44.063 --> 12:47.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, he's referring to the
dispute over
the islands there. How would a
President Trump

12:47.767 --> 12:49.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
address China under these
circumstances?

12:49.736 --> 12:54.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID PHARES: Well, we're in the
primaries.
That's very, very early. And
even if he clinches

12:54.774 --> 12:58.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the nomination, it is going to
still be early,
because for these kind of
strategic decisions,

12:58.878 --> 13:03.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he would definitely need the
information available
at the agencies, within the
government, within

13:03.149 --> 13:06.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the defense agencies, and other,
of course,
allies.

13:06.552 --> 13:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the posture is going to be,
national security
of the United States comes
first.

13:10.289 --> 13:14.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Walid Phares, who
is an adviser
to Donald Trump, we thank you
very much.

13:14.761 --> 13:17.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALID PHARES: Thank you for
having me.

13:17.163 --> 13:22.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another issue in
the spotlight
this week: women voters. In
2012, they made

13:22.602 --> 13:26.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up 53 percent of the electorate
in the presidential
race.

13:26.205 --> 13:30.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To check in on that crucial
voting bloc and
what is driving the thinking of
women voters

13:30.810 --> 13:36.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this year, we are joined by
Rebecca Traister.
She's a journalist and author of
"All The

13:36.416 --> 13:42.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Single Ladies: Unmarried Women
and the Rise
of an Independent Nation." Kelly
Dittmar,

13:42.088 --> 13:47.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she's a scholar at the Center
for American
Women and Politics at Rutgers
University.

13:47.560 --> 13:51.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And pollster Ann Selzer, she's
president of
Selzer &amp; Company.

13:51.964 --> 13:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all three of you
to the program.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let me start with you, Kelly
Dittmar.

13:56.469 --> 14:01.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remind us, how did American
women vote in
the last few presidential
elections?

14:01.274 --> 14:03.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KELLY DITTMAR, Rutgers
University: Sure.

14:03.176 --> 14:07.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there's a persistent gender
gap in terms
of women's support and
presidential vote choice,

14:07.447 --> 14:11.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where we see women more likely
to vote for
the Democratic candidate than
their male counterparts.

14:11.818 --> 14:17.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you just look at 2012,
for example,
you see that women were
supporting Barack

14:17.423 --> 14:22.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama at about 55 percent, and
compared to
men at about 45 percent, so we
would call

14:22.562 --> 14:24.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that a 10-point gender gap.

14:24.664 --> 14:29.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, if you sort of
break that
down, you see even stronger
support among

14:29.335 --> 14:33.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women of color for Barack Obama
at 96 percent,
for example, among black women.

14:33.940 --> 14:40.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ann Selzer, what
do we see
so far this year in how the
women's vote is

14:40.413 --> 14:45.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
breaking down based on the exit
polls in these
primaries so far? And let's
start with the

14:45.184 --> 14:46.986 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republicans.

14:47.019 --> 14:48.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J. ANN SELZER, Selzer &amp; Company,
Inc.: Well,
we're just starting to see
things really kind

14:48.354 --> 14:50.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of coalesce here.

14:50.289 --> 14:55.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of the primaries with
Bernie Sanders
and Hillary Clinton, she is
leading with women.

14:55.995 --> 15:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's not necessarily leading
with younger
women. And so that really
remains her challenge

15:00.700 --> 15:03.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as she thinks about heading into
a general
election.

15:03.569 --> 15:11.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of the Republican side
of this, what
you have is a stronger showing
by Cruz among

15:11.844 --> 15:18.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women and a stronger showing for
Trump among
men. He pretty much dominates
the male vote.

15:18.284 --> 15:23.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a two-point race between
Trump and Cruz
in terms of the primary vote.

15:23.055 --> 15:26.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Ann, just
quickly, has
that been consistent through the
primaries

15:26.592 --> 15:28.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or has that been shifting?

15:28.394 --> 15:33.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J. ANN SELZER: Well, what we
have been seeing
is the favorability shifting
quite a bit in

15:33.232 --> 15:38.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
terms of Donald Trump in
particular, in that
he has started out from a
negative position

15:38.938 --> 15:44.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in terms of overall
favorability, and he's
only gotten more giving in terms
of how women

15:44.844 --> 15:46.546 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are rating him.

15:46.579 --> 15:52.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That -- women are the people --
that's the
constituency that elects
presidents, as we

15:52.919 --> 15:57.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just heard from the numbers of
Romney vs.
Obama, and for Donald Trump to
have an unfavorable

15:57.790 --> 16:02.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number in 60 percent among
women, that makes
it very hard for him to think
about winning

16:02.428 --> 16:04.096 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an election.

16:04.130 --> 16:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rebecca Traister,
you have
been looking at what's driving
the women's

16:07.600 --> 16:11.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote. As we mentioned, you have
written a
book about unmarried women, but
across the

16:11.737 --> 16:17.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
board, what do you see women --
what is it
that motivates women when they
go to the polls?

16:17.376 --> 16:19.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA TRAISTER, Author, "All
The Single
Ladies: Unmarried Women and the
Rise of an

16:19.178 --> 16:21.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Independent Nation": Well, as
you said, you
know, I have been looking
specifically at

16:21.581 --> 16:24.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unmarried women, who make up a
huge part of
the electorate.

16:25.017 --> 16:29.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2012, they comprised --
unmarried women
comprised 23 percent of the
electorate, and

16:29.455 --> 16:34.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they seem to vote very far left.
I mean, they
voted for Barack Obama in 2012
-- again, it's

16:34.393 --> 16:39.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
almost a quarter of the
electorate -- voted
for Barack Obama 67 percent to
31 percent.

16:40.032 --> 16:44.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things that I
think we're seeing
reflected on the Democratic
platform, both

16:44.804 --> 16:49.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders and Hillary
Clinton are putting
forth all kinds of policies that
increasingly

16:49.041 --> 16:53.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making sense in a world in which
women are
living more independently from
marriage than

16:53.246 --> 16:59.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever before, and those things
include the
increase in minimum wage.

16:59.085 --> 17:03.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two-thirds of minimum-wage
workers are women,
half of them unmarried women.
Things like

17:03.656 --> 17:10.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
paid leave, and better
subsidized early childhood
education and day care. Both
candidates are

17:10.796 --> 17:16.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking about reducing college
costs. Of course,
you know, women are very
interested often

17:16.235 --> 17:20.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- especially, those who lean
left are very
interested in protecting
reproductive rights,

17:20.773 --> 17:25.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which are obviously part of the
Democratic
-- those are strong Democratic
priorities.

17:25.811 --> 17:31.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think this election in
particular, you're
seeing a lot of people, a lot of
women voting

17:31.651 --> 17:37.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic and talking about
their economic
concerns and wanting to see new
social and

17:37.456 --> 17:41.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economic programs that are going
to stabilize
their economic life.

17:41.127 --> 17:46.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And let me turn
back to Kelly
Dittmar about women voting in
the Republican

17:46.365 --> 17:48.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
primaries.

17:48.134 --> 17:52.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems they're not necessarily
motivated
by the same things that are
motivating women

17:52.038 --> 17:54.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who turn out to vote Democratic.

17:54.373 --> 17:58.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLY DITTMAR: Yes, I think one
interesting
thing we have been seeing in
some of the polling

17:58.277 --> 18:01.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the Republican side is that
there has been
a strong security push.

18:01.747 --> 18:06.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have talked in past
elections about
security moms as a certain
subset of voter,

18:06.886 --> 18:11.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but actually more so in this
election than
some. In elections in the past,
you have seen

18:11.223 --> 18:15.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
some gender gaps in the
prioritization of
security-related issues, things
like concerns

18:16.028 --> 18:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about terrorism in light of
recent attacks
or concerns overall about
somebody's ability

18:21.000 --> 18:26.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be commander in chief, and
that that seems
more important among Republican
women voters

18:26.372 --> 18:28.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than among Democratic women
voters.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Ann Selzer,
what would
you add to that about the
difference about

18:31.344 --> 18:35.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what's motivating women on the
Democratic
side and women on the Republican
side and

18:35.848 --> 18:37.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what's -- how they're making
these decisions?

18:37.717 --> 18:42.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J. ANN SELZER: Well, one of the
things, I
think, is the obvious women's
issues, we don't

18:42.588 --> 18:48.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really talk about them as
women's issues anymore.
We don't talk about the pay gap
as much as

18:48.094 --> 18:49.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're talking about income
inequality.

18:49.829 --> 18:55.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are ways in which sort of
the woman
part of women's issues is sort
of fading,

18:55.901 --> 19:00.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it doesn't mean that that's
not important
to women anymore. It's more just
kind of the

19:01.007 --> 19:04.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hushed side of it that is the
feminism side
of some of those issues.

19:04.910 --> 19:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will just add that our most
recent Bloomberg
Politics national poll, we did a
package on

19:09.648 --> 19:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trade and took a look at how
people are feeling
in the environment where
especially the Republicans

19:14.320 --> 19:19.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are talking about more
restrictions, tightening
up what is happening with free
trade. And

19:19.458 --> 19:24.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women are more protectionist --
this is women
overall, Republicans and
Democrats -- than

19:24.997 --> 19:26.832 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
men.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there are ways in which women
are responding
to issues very differently, and
this is shaping

19:29.168 --> 19:33.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up to be such a different
election for us
all, as we look at the way the
tea leaves

19:33.606 --> 19:35.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are falling.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that,
Rebecca Traister?
I mean, could this year turn
upside-down some

19:38.878 --> 19:43.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the assumption about women,
whether they're
married or unmarried, as they
think about

19:43.649 --> 19:45.418 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
whom to support?

19:45.451 --> 19:49.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA TRAISTER: Well, I think
the election
is already sort of offering a
whole set of

19:49.922 --> 19:53.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new choices. I don't think we
have ever had
a candidate like Donald Trump,
for instance.

19:53.325 --> 19:56.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know whether he will
wind up the Republican
nominee or not.

19:56.128 --> 20:02.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in terms of his style of
speaking, his
approach doesn't match previous
models. And,

20:02.635 --> 20:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of course, when it comes to
either Hillary
Clinton or Bernie Sanders,
you're looking

20:06.105 --> 20:11.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at candidates who are unlike
anything we have
ever seen before. And I think
that, in fact,

20:11.243 --> 20:17.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not only, in that she is a woman
and he is
a Jewish self-described
socialist, I think

20:17.349 --> 20:22.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you're also looking at a
Democratic platform
that is much further to the left
in general

20:22.121 --> 20:26.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in terms of a whole suite of
issues than we
have seen in recent memory.

20:26.859 --> 20:30.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so I think a lot of
expectations are very
much up in the air. I think very
few people

20:30.896 --> 20:34.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could have predicted going in
and very few
people did predict Donald
Trump's success

20:34.967 --> 20:37.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
or, for that matter, the
strength of Bernie
Sanders' campaign.

20:37.136 --> 20:41.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, I think we don't -- I
think it's
very hard to use old models to
predict what

20:41.807 --> 20:43.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is going to happen over the next
six months.

20:43.676 --> 20:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kelly Dittmar,
just quickly,
as we look to the primaries that
are remaining

20:48.147 --> 20:53.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the general election, is
there something
these candidates need to keep in
mind if they

20:53.119 --> 20:55.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hope to appeal to women across
the board?

20:55.321 --> 21:00.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLY DITTMAR: Well, I think one
thing is
to recognize, as everyone has
said tonight,

21:00.192 --> 21:02.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that women voters are not a
monolithic bloc.

21:02.628 --> 21:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so when you're trying to
appeal to women
voters, you have to really
specify which women

21:07.500 --> 21:11.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're trying to appeal to. And
so primary
electorates are going to be
different than

21:11.737 --> 21:16.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your general electorates. And
the messages
that you need to resonate with
Republican

21:16.575 --> 21:22.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women vs. Democratic women, or
women of color,
black women vs. white women in
many cases,

21:22.214 --> 21:24.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or unmarried vs. married women,
are going
to be different.

21:24.750 --> 21:29.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think candidates do a
disservice when
they try to target women as a
bloc and do

21:29.889 --> 21:35.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things that end up appearing
either patronizing
or sort of essentialist. And so
I think candidates

21:35.628 --> 21:40.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need to be looking at the
diversity among
women voters. And that's going
to get them

21:40.232 --> 21:43.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the finish line, whether in
the primary
or the general election.

21:43.235 --> 21:46.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A good reminder,
as we wrap
this up. And, of course, we're
going to continue

21:46.639 --> 21:50.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to stay focused on the women's
and the men's
vote throughout this election.

21:50.876 --> 21:55.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But thank you, all three, Ann
Selzer, Rebecca
Traister and Kelly Dittmar.

21:55.481 --> 22:00.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KELLY DITTMAR: Thank you.

22:00.686 --> 22:09.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:09.562 --> 22:15.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
rise of so-called
micro-scholarships; what's
behind the rapid

22:15.201 --> 22:21.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decline of Venezuela's economy;
and top female
soccer players take action
against unequal

22:21.707 --> 22:23.576 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pay.

22:23.609 --> 22:28.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, as tensions mount
between the
United States and China over a
number of issues,

22:28.714 --> 22:31.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tensions within China are also
rising.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has the story.

22:33.552 --> 22:38.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For the
Chinese leader,
it's a moment on the world
stage, on issues

22:38.824 --> 22:43.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ranging from the growing
tensions over China's
military activity in the South
China Sea,

22:43.996 --> 22:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Beijing's ability to rein in
North Korea's
nuclear efforts.

22:47.900 --> 22:52.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
XI JINPING, Chinese President
(through translator):
Especially, we want to enhance
communication

22:52.338 --> 22:57.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and coordination on the Korea
nuclear issue
and other regional and global
issues, and

22:57.343 --> 23:00.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to consolidate and expand our
shared interests.

23:00.079 --> 23:04.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But Xi's
biggest challenge
may be back home, where there
are signs of

23:04.316 --> 23:10.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growing discontent. Partly, it's
economic,
a stock crash, sliding currency
values and

23:10.322 --> 23:12.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the weakest economic growth in a
quarter-century.

23:12.625 --> 23:16.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Outwardly, at least, Xi's
government has remained
upbeat.

23:16.528 --> 23:20.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LI KEQIANG, Chinese Premier
(through translator):
We are fully confident of
China's long-term

23:20.532 --> 23:24.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economic growth. The economy
will not suffer
a hard landing.

23:24.169 --> 23:29.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But Xi has
also raised hackles
with his crackdown on dissent.
Last month,

23:29.708 --> 23:34.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he visited state media
organizations, warning
that absolute loyalty to the
party is their

23:34.380 --> 23:40.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
highest priority. That drew
criticism from
real estate magnate Ren
Zhiqiang, among others,

23:40.252 --> 23:43.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and his social media accounts
were suspended.

23:43.155 --> 23:47.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This month, a government-run Web
site posted
a letter calling for Xi's
resignation. It

23:47.826 --> 23:50.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was signed "Loyal Communist
Party Members."

23:50.496 --> 23:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Soon after, a number of people,
including
well-known columnist Jia Jia,
went missing,

23:57.069 --> 24:01.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
apparently as part of an
investigation into
the letter's origin. Protesters
in Hong Kong

24:01.874 --> 24:03.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
demanded to know his
whereabouts.

24:03.742 --> 24:09.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEUNG KWOK-HUNG, Hong Kong
Lawmaker: I think
Xi Jinping stressed that China
should be and

24:09.048 --> 24:15.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be ruled by law. But what
happened in
China after he is in power, he
threatened,

24:16.021 --> 24:24.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he arrests, and kidnapped all
kinds of activists
from different part of civic
society. Journalists,

24:24.096 --> 24:30.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lawyer, social worker are all in
-- on his
target.

24:30.569 --> 24:35.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Columnist Jia
has since
been released.

24:35.908 --> 24:40.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We explore the internal
divisions within China
with Christopher Johnson. He had
a two-decade

24:40.612 --> 24:45.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
career at the CIA, where he
focused on China.
He's now at the Center for
Strategic and International

24:45.351 --> 24:49.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Studies. And Andrew Nathan is a
professor
at Columbia University. He's the
author and

24:49.188 --> 24:52.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
editor of many books, including
"The Tiananmen
Papers."

24:52.224 --> 24:53.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Andrew, I want to start with
you.

24:54.026 --> 24:58.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How significant are these public
letters,
these internal dissents?

24:58.697 --> 25:03.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW NATHAN, Columbia
University: I think
they are very meaningful,
because I think

25:03.168 --> 25:10.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the key is that Xi is losing the
support of
the high levels of the Chinese
Communist Party.

25:10.309 --> 25:15.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not willing to rally
around him the
way that they did in the Mao
period.

25:15.047 --> 25:21.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a more critical time.
They're more independent.
He's demanding absolute loyalty,
and people

25:21.620 --> 25:23.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are no longer willing to offer
that.

25:23.822 --> 25:27.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Christopher
Johnson, do
you see this as a significant
threat to the

25:27.760 --> 25:29.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leadership of President Xi?

25:29.495 --> 25:31.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON, Center for
Strategic
and International Studies: I
don't. And I

25:31.196 --> 25:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would actually strongly disagree
with Dr.
Nathan's characterization of
sort of elite

25:34.833 --> 25:36.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
support for Xi Jinping.

25:36.502 --> 25:39.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what is really important
to focus
on with these letters is, number
one, their

25:39.405 --> 25:42.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
provenance. We have done some
work here on
CSIS, some forensic work, trying
to figure

25:42.541 --> 25:46.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out where these came from. And
our sense is
that they originated from
outside of China.

25:46.612 --> 25:50.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the notion that there is a
core group of
elite members of the Communist
Party who are

25:50.816 --> 25:55.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pushing back on Xi Jinping and
asking him
to step down just doesn't seem
to be the case.

25:55.187 --> 25:58.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the other thing to
emphasize is that,
historically, when we have
looked at these

25:58.490 --> 26:02.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues, when there is elite
fighting, the
faction or the group, if you
will, that leaks

26:02.828 --> 26:06.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the outside first, especially
the Western
media, is usually the one that
is losing the

26:06.799 --> 26:08.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fight and ends up losing the
fight.

26:08.667 --> 26:12.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew Nathan,
does it matter
if the letter was written -- it
was a homegrown

26:12.971 --> 26:15.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
letter vs. one that was sent
from outside
activists?

26:15.340 --> 26:19.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW NATHAN: Well, there are a
number of
different documents, but
certainly it does

26:19.545 --> 26:21.280 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
matter.

26:21.313 --> 26:26.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If they're just outside
activists hacking
these things onto Web sites
inside China,

26:26.151 --> 26:31.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
then it's a very clever
operation, but it
doesn't signal a split in the
leadership.

26:31.457 --> 26:36.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's very dangerous, though,
for the leadership
is if there is a split and it
comes out into

26:36.595 --> 26:42.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the open. That then sends a
signal to lots
of people in China who are
dissatisfied.

26:42.501 --> 26:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are many people unhappy
because the
economy is slowing down and
because people

26:48.540 --> 26:54.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are losing jobs. Xi Jinping is
attacking the
state-owned enterprises to try
to force them

26:54.046 --> 26:59.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be more efficient. He wants
to reorganize
the military. He has this big
anti-corruption

26:59.985 --> 27:01.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

27:01.753 --> 27:05.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we know there are a lot of
people who
are dissatisfied, but they're
afraid to do

27:05.290 --> 27:13.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anything. But if they see a
split in the leadership,
which is what people saw back in
1989, when

27:13.365 --> 27:19.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they view that split in the
leadership, there
is a real risk of social
disorder in China.

27:19.972 --> 27:25.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it does matter a great deal
whether these
documents reflect a real split
in the top

27:25.577 --> 27:29.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leadership. I'm not talking
about just ordinary
party members.

27:29.781 --> 27:35.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Christopher
Johnson, what
about the idea that the
centralizing of power

27:35.153 --> 27:40.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the president has been
engaged in over
the past several months is
something of concern

27:40.392 --> 27:42.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to people who have had that
power taken away
from them?

27:42.895 --> 27:46.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there increased pressure on
him to give
some of that power back?

27:46.598 --> 27:48.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON: Absolutely.

27:48.400 --> 27:53.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, what we see with
President Xi is a
rapid centralization of power.
He claims -- or,

27:53.038 --> 27:57.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, the body language is
that he's doing
so because there are very
difficult changes,

27:57.376 --> 28:01.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what happened during his
predecessor's
tenure is that the government,
the senior

28:01.547 --> 28:04.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
leadership, was overly
consensus-oriented,
and what that meant was that
they couldn't

28:04.850 --> 28:06.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get anything done.

28:06.718 --> 28:10.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these problems of the
state-owned enterprises,
of debt, of environmental
degradation just

28:10.622 --> 28:14.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
piled up and piled up. Xi
Jinping's solution
has been to centralize this
power. But the

28:14.393 --> 28:19.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
real question is, is the
centralization of
the power a means to an end, an
end we may

28:19.498 --> 28:22.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all be able to live with in
terms of some
of these economic reforms
they're talking

28:22.534 --> 28:26.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about, or an end in and of
itself, and that
he is indeed a power-mad
megalomaniac like

28:26.972 --> 28:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mao Zedong, which I strongly
doubt.

28:28.941 --> 28:34.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew Nathan,
what about
that idea, that even if this
power is being

28:34.379 --> 28:38.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
centralized, this is perhaps the
person that
the United States or everyone
else can deal

28:38.483 --> 28:40.185 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with?

28:40.218 --> 28:44.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Do you see these kind of
internal struggles
actually facing -- or creating a
threat for

28:44.456 --> 28:45.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
him to lose power?

28:45.724 --> 28:48.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW NATHAN: Potentially, it
does.

28:48.293 --> 28:55.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that -- I agree with
Chris that Xi
was brought into power by the
previous leadership

28:55.867 --> 29:02.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they needed a strong
leader to confront
all these of issues that I
mentioned before,

29:02.374 --> 29:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and he has been a strong leader.

29:04.276 --> 29:10.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the trouble is, he's
responsible for the
results. And a lot of the
results have displeased

29:10.048 --> 29:15.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, including the slowdown
of the economy.
I think Chinese -- other Chinese
top leaders

29:15.954 --> 29:22.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do not accept the idea that the
economy slowdown
is natural, necessary. Xi has
said: Our economy

29:22.494 --> 29:24.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is going to do great.

29:24.296 --> 29:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had a clip from the premier
saying this.
And it's not really doing that
well. So, he

29:28.834 --> 29:33.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gets the blame for that. As
well, there is
a lot of pushback against his
foreign policy

29:33.372 --> 29:39.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Southeast Asia. And so he's
responsible
for the results. And I think
it's -- he has

29:39.378 --> 29:43.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a hard job and it's not easy to
produce results
that satisfy other people.

29:44.016 --> 29:48.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's where I think the
criticism is
coming from, especially from his
demand that

29:48.954 --> 29:56.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nobody can criticize him. That's
what this
dust-up is about, his saying
that others in

29:56.962 --> 30:00.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the party, they have to shut up
and take what
I give them.

30:00.599 --> 30:04.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's where I think people are
no longer
willing to put up with it the
way they did

30:05.003 --> 30:06.371 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Mao.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Christopher
Johnson, is
this par for the course?

30:08.540 --> 30:12.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON: You know,
my own sense
is that what we have to watch
here is, there

30:12.377 --> 30:18.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is going to be a major
transition in the Politburo
next fall. And Xi Jinping
clearly has a very

30:18.950 --> 30:21.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clear agenda as to what he wants
to do that.

30:21.153 --> 30:26.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The key indicators of how
powerful he is going
to be are, will he follow the
so-called rules

30:26.792 --> 30:30.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have been followed in the
past with regard
to age, and will he signal a
succession, things

30:30.962 --> 30:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this? This will tell us a
lot about how
significant this pushback is, as
Dr. Nathan

30:35.534 --> 30:37.402 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
suggested?

30:37.436 --> 30:43.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Christopher Johnson,
Andrew Nathan, thanks so much
for joining

30:43.709 --> 30:44.976 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

30:45.010 --> 30:50.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON: Thank you.

30:50.182 --> 30:58.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's hard to
overstate just
how expensive college can be,
more than $40,000

30:58.123 --> 31:04.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a year for a private school,
over $34,000
for an out-of-state public
school.

31:04.329 --> 31:09.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many students do qualify for
greater financial
aid, but a start-up has come up
with a way

31:09.334 --> 31:14.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to let high school students earn
money for
college much earlier.

31:14.172 --> 31:18.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman has the
story. It's part of his Making
Sense series,

31:18.610 --> 31:21.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which airs Thursdays on the
"NewsHour."

31:21.646 --> 31:29.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: At the engineering
classroom
of a top public magnet school in
Miami, Terra

31:29.354 --> 31:34.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
High School, Sebastian Rodriguez
and his team's
entry in a national robot
competition.

31:34.493 --> 31:38.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN RODRIGUEZ, Student:
You have to
pick up a lot of Wiffle balls
and stack them

31:38.230 --> 31:43.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into this canister here and then
be able to
propel them upwards into
6-foot-tall tubes.

31:43.201 --> 31:48.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Turns out this
whole school is
as competitive as the robotniks.
You need

31:48.373 --> 31:51.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high grades and test scores just
to get in.

31:51.343 --> 31:54.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't get any extra money
for having built
a really cool robot, do you?

31:54.846 --> 31:57.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN RODRIGUEZ: No, not at
all. Just
the fun of having to build a
robot.

31:57.816 --> 32:03.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And why ask about
money? Because,
here, kids get paid for
achievements through

32:03.522 --> 32:07.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a college scholarship app called
Raise.me.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Senior Barbara Groh:

32:09.694 --> 32:13.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA GROH, Student: They call
them micro-scholarships,
and it's all based on your
portfolio, your

32:13.265 --> 32:13.765 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
profile.

32:13.799 --> 32:15.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Right.

32:15.534 --> 32:18.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA GROH: So, for different
aspects of
my profile, I can get different
amounts of

32:18.570 --> 32:21.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money from different schools. So
these are
all my AP classes.

32:21.339 --> 32:23.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Are these your
grades?

32:23.175 --> 32:27.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA GROH: Yes. For getting
an A, you can
get $25 to $1,000, depending on
the school.

32:27.879 --> 32:34.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: More than 140
colleges and universities
already, from Florida state to
Oberlin, Penn

32:34.853 --> 32:40.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State to Notre Dame, using their
own formulas
to offer money in the form of an
eventual

32:40.425 --> 32:46.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
merit scholarship for high
school achievements,
starting in ninth grade and
guaranteed, though

32:46.631 --> 32:50.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only if the student applies and
is actually
admitted.

32:50.702 --> 32:56.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Raise.me, a private company
funded by venture
capital and several foundations,
charges the

32:56.708 --> 33:02.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
schools annual fees to
participate. The scholarship
money is provided by the schools
themselves.

33:02.714 --> 33:04.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Take an honors or an advanced
course.

33:04.616 --> 33:09.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA GROH: Participating in
an extracurricular
activity, taking the PSATs,
SATs, and also

33:09.621 --> 33:13.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for getting good scores, you can
get even
more money.

33:13.525 --> 33:18.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: More money for
immediate achievements,
says Raise.me's founder Preston
Silverman.

33:18.463 --> 33:23.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PRESTON SILVERMAN, Founder,
Raise.me: Instead
of waiting for four years to
find out if you're

33:23.835 --> 33:28.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
going to receive any
scholarship, students
are getting a short feedback
loop each semester,

33:28.874 --> 33:30.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
each grade they get.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANEESH RAMAN, Raise.me: It's a
huge pool of
money that colleges are giving
out to kids

33:32.410 --> 33:36.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after they have applied, after
they have gotten
in, now goes to kids starting as
early as

33:36.348 --> 33:37.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ninth grade.

33:38.016 --> 33:41.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Yes, it only goes
to them as
a promise, contingent on
acceptance, says

33:41.553 --> 33:45.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Raise.me vice president Aneesh
Ramen, but
no matter where they go:

33:45.390 --> 33:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANEESH RAMAN: It motivates them
to do better
in high school and it prepares
them better

33:48.960 --> 33:53.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for college, so, when they go,
they actually
finish, get a diploma, find a
job, live the

33:53.698 --> 33:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
American dream. That's the idea.

33:55.467 --> 34:00.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Senior Sabrina
Rosell is one
of Terra's typically high
achievers. But,

34:00.438 --> 34:07.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like almost all the students
here, 40 percent
of whom qualify for federal
school lunch aid,

34:07.078 --> 34:12.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rosell needs help to attend the
college of
her choice, nearby Florida
International.

34:12.651 --> 34:16.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's relatively inexpensive,
but, then, she
has four siblings.

34:16.421 --> 34:19.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SABRINA ROSELL, Student: It may
look like
my family doesn't qualify for
financial aid,

34:19.824 --> 34:23.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it doesn't mean that I can
just dish out
the $6,000 for tuition every
single year.

34:23.828 --> 34:29.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The $8,000 she's
earned on Raise.me
thus far represents a fair chunk
of that tuition.

34:29.334 --> 34:33.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SABRINA ROSELL: It's just like
-- almost like
a gift in exchange for all of
our hard work.

34:33.538 --> 34:35.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Rosell's fellow
students agree.

34:35.473 --> 34:39.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUSTIN LEE, Student: I finally
found out something
that I can get from working
hard, besides

34:39.511 --> 34:41.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just the good feeling from
working hard, you
know?

34:41.913 --> 34:46.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But if the students
at Terra
don't need the motivational
nudge of financial

34:46.051 --> 34:52.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incentives, even if most need
the money, students
elsewhere seriously need both,
says Raise.me

34:52.457 --> 34:54.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
founder Silverman.

34:54.225 --> 34:57.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PRESTON SILVERMAN: We spend
almost all of
our time reaching out to schools
and school

34:57.629 --> 35:03.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
districts that are serving
lower-income populations
and schools that serve a large
percentage

35:03.268 --> 35:08.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of first-generation college
students. Those
are the students that we're most
passionate

35:08.173 --> 35:09.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about supporting.

35:09.407 --> 35:11.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: How many of you want to
go to college?

35:11.209 --> 35:12.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

35:13.011 --> 35:17.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: OK, so, next
morning, we joined
a Raise.me reach-out rally at a
distinctly

35:17.916 --> 35:20.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
non-magnet school, Carol City
High.

35:20.652 --> 35:25.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: OK. Let's take some guesses
on how you
much you can earn for different
things on

35:25.690 --> 35:29.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Raise. Everyone who answers
right, we will
give you a prize.

35:29.561 --> 35:36.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much do you guys think you
can get for
getting an A or a B in class?

35:36.034 --> 35:37.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

35:37.736 --> 35:41.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Carol City is just
a few miles
away from Terra, but in terms of
academic

35:41.206 --> 35:45.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
motivation, a world apart. So
will financial
incentives work here?

35:45.877 --> 35:49.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELONDRA JACKSON, Student: Yes, I
do think
people will try harder if they
knew, like,

35:49.714 --> 35:53.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the benefits of getting money to
go to college
and be successful in life.

35:53.752 --> 35:59.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Christina Derby,
Carol City high's
valedictorian, doesn't need the
extra incentive.

35:59.124 --> 36:03.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she too thinks Raise.me will
instill and
reinforce good habits.

36:03.962 --> 36:06.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINA DERBY, Student: I
think, as the
money accumulates over time,
then kids will

36:06.297 --> 36:07.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be like I shouldn't fall down
and get behind
in my work. I should actually
work harder

36:07.565 --> 36:12.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and do more things, because, in
the end, it
will pay off.'

36:12.937 --> 36:19.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But Kristin
Klopfenstein, who
studies the economics of
education, worries

36:19.411 --> 36:22.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, for many kids, Raise.me
will simply
fall flat.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTIN KLOPFENSTEIN, University
of Northern
Colorado: A lot of times, kids,
particularly

36:25.417 --> 36:31.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from disadvantaged backgrounds,
don't understand
the path from here to there. And
so just saying,

36:31.389 --> 36:38.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oh, we will reward you if you
pass this test,
the kids might get all excited
about the incentive,

36:38.329 --> 36:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but then they have no idea about
how to go
about actually achieving that
goal.

36:42.734 --> 36:45.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Especially with so
many other
distractions.

36:45.470 --> 36:49.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Another instance of
violence hitting
too close to a Miami-Dade
school.

36:49.541 --> 36:54.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Just hours after we
left Carol
City, there was a drive-by
shooting out front.

36:54.779 --> 36:58.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: A bunch of kids just
started running,
because I heard like a shot,
like pop, pop,

36:58.249 --> 37:00.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pop. Security, everybody took --
getting inside.

37:00.085 --> 37:03.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTIN KLOPFENSTEIN: I think
those kids face
an entirely different situation,
where, when

37:03.555 --> 37:09.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you're in an advantaged
background, from an
advantaged background, your time
horizon can

37:09.060 --> 37:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be much longer. You can be
looking forward
and planning for two, four years
down the

37:14.599 --> 37:18.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
road: This is the college I want
to go to,
this is what I want to be when I
grow up.

37:18.736 --> 37:24.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you talk to kids who are in
neighborhoods
and schools like you're talking
about, what

37:24.075 --> 37:29.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do you want to be when you grow
up, sometimes
the kids will scratch their
heads, and, you

37:29.047 --> 37:32.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, I don't think that far
away. I may not
grow up.

37:32.350 --> 37:34.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But Klopfenstein
does have an
alternative.

37:34.886 --> 37:41.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTIN KLOPFENSTEIN: Rewards
for intermediate
actions that lead to positive
outcomes. So,

37:41.259 --> 37:47.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for reading books or doing
positive study
skills and behaviors that will
lead to higher

37:47.966 --> 37:54.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grades, I will give you $2 for
every book
you read. That has a tremendous
impact on

37:54.405 --> 37:56.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reading comprehension.

37:56.274 --> 38:00.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: At nearby Florida
International,
however, an urban public
university with 55,000

38:01.012 --> 38:07.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students, 60 percent of them
Hispanic, director
of admissions Jody Glassman says
Raise.me

38:07.819 --> 38:12.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had already had a positive
impact. It has
raised hopes for those who might
not have

38:12.991 --> 38:14.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
otherwise applied.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JODY GLASSMAN, Florida
International University:
There's been so much hype. Is
the price of

38:16.861 --> 38:21.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a college education worth it?
Are you going
to be gainfully employed when
you graduate?

38:21.132 --> 38:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you going to graduate with
all of this
debt? And Raise.me really helps
us portray

38:28.173 --> 38:31.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to students that college is
affordable.

38:31.543 --> 38:37.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And even to the
high-achieving
students at the magnet school,
it turns out,

38:37.081 --> 38:43.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Raise.me has had real value.
It's ratcheted
up even further the drive that
already spurs

38:43.488 --> 38:45.290 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUSTIN LEE: We're just always
competing with
each other. So if one of them
said, hey, I

38:47.392 --> 38:52.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have $80,000 to this school on
Raise.me, the
other one will say, well, I have
$82,000,

38:52.163 --> 38:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we will just keep going at
it and trying
to see what we can add to it.

38:55.733 --> 39:00.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," economics
correspondent Paul Solman,
reporting from

39:00.805 --> 39:04.976 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Miami.

39:05.009 --> 39:14.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to Venezuela.

39:14.619 --> 39:20.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The oil-rich South American
nation is in the
throes of a deep economic
crisis, as its version

39:20.725 --> 39:26.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of socialism faces the crash in
global oil
prices and political turmoil.

39:26.898 --> 39:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our look.

39:28.833 --> 39:35.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A symbolic
burning of the Judas,
something of an Easter tradition
in some Catholic

39:35.039 --> 39:38.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries. Effigies of unpopular
figures are
set ablaze.

39:39.010 --> 39:44.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This year in Venezuela, those
figures were
politicians, including President
Nicolas Maduro

39:44.182 --> 39:49.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a local mayor. But President
Obama wasn't
spared. The U.S. has long been a
favorite

39:49.821 --> 39:52.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
target of Venezuelan anger.

39:52.123 --> 39:57.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Venezuelans have much to
enrage them right
now. The global price of oil,
the country's

39:57.295 --> 40:03.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
main commodity, has fallen
dramatically, crushing
the government's bottom line.
Meanwhile, the

40:03.067 --> 40:08.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Venezuelan Central Bank began
printing money
at record levels, the result,
massive inflation

40:09.007 --> 40:10.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in this socialist country.

40:11.009 --> 40:16.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The cost of consumer goods
increased 275 percent
last year, according to the
International

40:16.714 --> 40:23.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Monetary Fund. And that number
is expected
to double in 2016. Long lines
and empty shelves

40:23.454 --> 40:28.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have come to define life for
many, as well
as anger at the Maduro
government.

40:28.559 --> 40:34.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In elections last year, the
opposition party
won a majority of seats in the
national Parliament.

40:34.365 --> 40:41.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier this month, after weeks
without water,
protests erupted in this San
Cristobal neighborhood.

40:41.139 --> 40:47.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Caracas, nurses
protested a
lack of medicines and equipment,
while, across

40:47.412 --> 40:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
town, demonstrators called for
the president's
resignation.

40:51.683 --> 40:56.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for a look at the crisis
facing Venezuela,
we welcome Scott Tong of public
radio's Marketplace.

40:56.654 --> 40:59.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He recently returned from a
reporting trip
there.

40:59.190 --> 41:02.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Scott, I should say, was
formerly a colleague
of ours here at the "NewsHour."

41:02.960 --> 41:04.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, first, welcome to you,
Scott.

41:04.195 --> 41:05.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT TONG, Marketplace: Thanks,
Jeff.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Alright, so
Venezuela.

41:06.798 --> 41:12.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We hear about the impact of low
oil prices
on certain countries out there.
You saw it

41:12.236 --> 41:16.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up close. You describe a country
in economic
freefall. What does that look
like?

41:16.708 --> 41:21.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT TONG: Oil is everything
there; 96 percent
of their export revenue comes
from oil.

41:22.013 --> 41:27.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They hardly do anything else
there. And that's
one level of the problem there.
Since they

41:27.051 --> 41:31.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got oil 100 years ago, the
gusher came, and
it pushed out a lot of other
sectors, so they

41:31.723 --> 41:35.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't make much domestically, so
everything
has to be imported now.

41:35.693 --> 41:41.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so now the price of oil has
fallen. Two
years ago, it was over $110.
It's around $40

41:41.199 --> 41:44.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now. And so they don't have
dollars to import
the things. And so when you fly
there and

41:44.802 --> 41:46.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you get there you, you just see
lines.

41:46.070 --> 41:47.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, give me an
example.

41:47.205 --> 41:48.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT TONG: Everybody's in line.

41:48.439 --> 41:49.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, everybody's
in line for
everything.

41:49.741 --> 41:50.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT TONG: For everything.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

41:52.744 --> 41:55.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT TONG: So, I traveled to
the Western
city of Maracaibo, which is the
original oil

41:55.680 --> 41:57.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
city in Venezuela.

41:57.482 --> 42:01.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there, I got there around
8:30 into a
line, and I ran into two
sisters. It was 8:30

42:01.719 --> 42:04.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the morning, and they were
already in the
back. And they said, well, if
you want to

42:04.655 --> 42:08.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get in front, you're probably
there at 1:00
in the morning sleeping in line.

42:08.059 --> 42:11.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they told me was, they make
minimum wage.
They sell empanadas in the
street and make

42:11.596 --> 42:17.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10,000 bolivars, which is 10
U.S. dollars
right now, per month. And they
didn't have

42:18.002 --> 42:22.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anything for lunch, so they had
to try to
find whatever they could at the
store. There

42:22.306 --> 42:25.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was no guarantee there was going
to be anything
on the shelves when they got
there, but they

42:25.676 --> 42:27.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were just going to see.

42:27.612 --> 42:34.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I went and I bought a hot
dog on the streets
of Caracas. It's called a
pepito. It's this

42:34.585 --> 42:39.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big gastronomic, coronary event,
right, with
all these things on top of it.
And the first

42:39.657 --> 42:44.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
time I went, it was 900
bolivars. And I said,
I wanted to go back and get
another one. Three

42:44.362 --> 42:47.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
days later, it was a 1,050.

42:47.231 --> 42:50.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the prices just go up like
that. And I
talked the seller, and he said
well, the import

42:50.735 --> 42:54.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prices are going up like crazy.
Either he
has to stand in line like
everybody else does

42:54.705 --> 42:58.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to buy the ketchup and the other
things, or
he goes to the black market.

42:58.509 --> 42:59.710 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:59.744 --> 43:00.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, that's
where I wanted
to go next.

43:00.278 --> 43:02.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SCOTT TONG: Yes.

43:02.180 --> 43:02.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because when --
in many countries,
when you have these kinds of
shortages, it

43:03.014 --> 43:04.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
means the black market
flourishes.

43:04.982 --> 43:09.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have been writing. I
have been reading
some of your blog posts about
that experience.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.189 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

43:11.222 --> 43:13.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TONG: In city of
Maracaibo, it's an
actual physical place. It's a
physical black

43:13.491 --> 43:15.293 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
market.

43:15.326 --> 43:19.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you go behind the plantains
and the other
produce, and you see the illegal
things kind

43:19.497 --> 43:23.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of sitting on these little
tables. And people
are a little careful to sell
them, but it's

43:23.201 --> 43:26.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everything that you and I find
in aisle three
of the Safeway.

43:26.904 --> 43:28.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

43:28.739 --> 43:33.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT TONG: Toilet paper,
Pampers, kilo sack
of rice, corn flour for
breakfast. It's the

43:33.778 --> 43:36.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
most basic things.

43:36.147 --> 43:41.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we did a little math, my
translator and
I, and we found the average
markup was about

43:41.919 --> 43:46.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
17 times the government-set
price. So, going
back to the people in line who
are making

43:46.357 --> 43:50.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minimum wage, to buy a big can
of milk, that's
a week of your salary.

43:50.461 --> 43:54.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what kind of
response is
there from the government at
this point? What

43:55.032 --> 43:57.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are they able to do? What are
they doing?

43:57.768 --> 44:00.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT TONG: Well, the government
is split
right now.

44:00.304 --> 44:06.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The presidency -- the Socialist
Party is the
ruling party. It controls the
presidency.

44:06.911 --> 44:10.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The opposition won the
Parliament and won
the Congress. And so the
opposition wants

44:10.381 --> 44:15.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get rid of President Maduro.
That's what
they keep talking about now.

44:15.219 --> 44:20.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I was there, President
Maduro gave a
speech, a five-hour speech,
where he said,

44:20.091 --> 44:23.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OK, we're going to solve some of
our problems
by increasing the price of
gasoline, which

44:24.028 --> 44:26.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is almost free. And we're going
to modify...

44:26.764 --> 44:28.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:28.599 --> 44:29.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, almost free.
It is truly
as cheap -- probably the
cheapest in the world.

44:29.767 --> 44:30.601 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

44:30.635 --> 44:32.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT TONG: It is. Here's the
math.

44:32.370 --> 44:34.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, under the new, more
expensive gasoline
price -- I did the math with my
translator

44:34.138 --> 44:39.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- two tanks of gasoline is one
bottle of
water. It's free. And so these
reforms, to

44:39.277 --> 44:45.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most people, are meaningless,
because inflation,
by one estimate, the official
estimate is

44:45.349 --> 44:51.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
180 percent. It could be 400.
The IMF says
it could be 700 this year.

44:51.088 --> 44:52.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your money just isn't worth
anything right
now.

44:52.823 --> 44:55.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And were you able
to -- how
much were you able to tell about
the impact

44:55.960 --> 45:01.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of what's happening economically
on the politics
there? Will the president -- how
much pressure

45:01.198 --> 45:03.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is he under? Will he survive?

45:03.401 --> 45:07.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT TONG: So, the people I
asked this question
to, they said, look, there are
two big questions

45:07.838 --> 45:13.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for 2016. Can the country pay
off its debt?
And, if it does, then it will
have hardly

45:13.811 --> 45:16.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any money left to import food
and medicine.
So, that's question one.

45:16.914 --> 45:21.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other question is, what
happens to President
Maduro? His predecessor, Hugo
Chavez, was

45:21.852 --> 45:27.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beloved. He was charismatic. The
people in
the barrios, the slums, tears
come to their

45:27.358 --> 45:31.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eyes sometimes when they talk
about him. He
was truly a beloved figure.

45:31.729 --> 45:39.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nicolas Maduro is charisma-less.
He doesn't
speak well, and now the economy
has just collapsed.

45:39.904 --> 45:44.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The question is, can the
opposition push through
the mechanisms in Congress and
get the signatures

45:45.009 --> 45:49.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to try to force him from power?
But that seems
to be their number one priority
now.

45:49.046 --> 45:52.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Scott Tong of
"Marketplace,"
thanks so much.

45:52.617 --> 45:59.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT TONG: Thanks, Jeff.

45:59.690 --> 46:06.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When the U.S.
women's soccer
team won the World Cup last
year, there were

46:06.964 --> 46:10.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
celebrations and acclaim for
their achievement.

46:10.334 --> 46:15.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But five members of that team
have now filed
a complaint with the federal
Equal Employment

46:15.239 --> 46:21.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Opportunity Commission. And they
say U.S.
soccer is practicing wage
discrimination.

46:21.078 --> 46:27.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The filing says, even though the
women's team
generated $20 million more in
revenue than

46:27.351 --> 46:33.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the men's team, the women earned
four times
less. The top women on the team
earn a salary

46:33.758 --> 46:41.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of $72,000, plus bonuses. But
the women say
the gaps in bonuses and other
pay is huge.

46:41.232 --> 46:48.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Women, for example, can earn
$99,000 if they
win at least 20 exhibition games
a year. Men

46:49.006 --> 46:53.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could earn $263,000 for doing
the same thing.

46:53.744 --> 46:59.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The women, including Hope Solo,
Carli Lloyd,
and Alex Morgan, appeared on The
Today Show

46:59.150 --> 47:00.951 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

47:00.985 --> 47:03.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOPE SOLO, U.S. National Women's
Soccer Team:
I have been on this team a
decade-and-a-half,

47:03.521 --> 47:09.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I have been through numerous
CBA negotiations,
and, honestly, not much has
changed. We continue

47:09.660 --> 47:14.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be told we should be grateful
just to have
the opportunity to play
professional soccer

47:14.565 --> 47:16.434 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and to get paid for doing it.

47:16.467 --> 47:22.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in this day and age, you
know, it's about
equality. It's about equal
rights. It's about

47:22.073 --> 47:23.841 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
equal pay.

47:23.874 --> 47:28.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a statement,
U.S. soccer
said it was disappointed. It
also said later

47:28.179 --> 47:32.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- quote -- "We are committed to
and engaged
in negotiating a new collective
bargaining

47:32.550 --> 47:35.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
agreement that addresses
compensation."

47:35.386 --> 47:39.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We look at this dispute with a
former goalie
for the U.S. women's team who's
played in

47:39.724 --> 47:44.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three World Cups, including the
championship
team in 1999.

47:44.195 --> 47:48.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Briana Scurry has long spoken
out on these
issues, and she joins me now.

47:48.833 --> 47:50.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome back to the program.

47:50.634 --> 47:51.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIANA SCURRY, Former U.S.
Women's National
Soccer Team Member: Thank you
for having me.

47:51.202 --> 47:53.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's great to be here.

47:53.037 --> 47:55.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what is the
basis for this?
You and I were just talking. You
were saying

47:55.506 --> 47:57.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this goes back a while. How far
back does
it go?

47:58.008 --> 48:00.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRIANA SCURRY: This goes back
decades.

48:00.377 --> 48:04.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back when I first started being
on the team
in the late '90s, we had this
discussions

48:04.715 --> 48:09.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the U.S. Soccer Federation.
At that time,
it was about massage therapists
and other

48:09.453 --> 48:13.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things like that. And, also,
getting paid
at all in general back then was
what -- was

48:13.591 --> 48:15.359 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the issue.

48:15.392 --> 48:20.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now it seems, obviously,
that they want
equal pay to the men. But the
problem is,

48:20.131 --> 48:25.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that U.S. soccer states
oftentimes their
thing is, hey, we sponsor the
women, we support

48:25.870 --> 48:28.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the women better than any other
federation
in the world.

48:28.038 --> 48:32.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been pushed to do
that. And that
is why they do that, because we
often had

48:32.343 --> 48:37.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to come to the table and do
different things
and try to get them to move the
bar higher,

48:37.848 --> 48:39.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like the women have done today.

48:39.617 --> 48:42.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We were struck --
or I was
struck by some of the things
women spoke about

48:42.386 --> 48:47.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
today about playing on
artificial turf when
they said they were -- that's
more prone to

48:47.958 --> 48:49.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
injury in that situation.

48:49.693 --> 48:51.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRIANA SCURRY: Yes.

48:51.495 --> 48:55.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are some of
the factors
of life on the soccer circuit,
if you will,

48:55.733 --> 48:57.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for women?

48:57.334 --> 48:59.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIANA SCURRY: One of the issues
that you
mentioned just now was
artificial turf.

48:59.703 --> 49:05.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The women weren't allowed to
have their lawsuit
go through about being on the
turf. They weren't

49:05.142 --> 49:08.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allowed to give their opinion.
Even though
they found companies that were
willing to

49:08.479 --> 49:13.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
replace artificial turf with
actual natural
grass, they weren't allowed to
do that. And

49:13.150 --> 49:14.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so that's one of the issues they
have had.

49:14.919 --> 49:19.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the years, you know,
different things
like hotel standards -- the
hotels aren't

49:19.990 --> 49:25.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as nice as the men play at, and
everything
like that. And, of course, now
is equal pay.

49:25.229 --> 49:27.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that is the biggest
disparity that there
is right now.

49:27.264 --> 49:31.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How long have the
women players
known that their pay was that
different from

49:31.635 --> 49:32.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what the men are earning?

49:32.870 --> 49:35.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRIANA SCURRY: I think they have
probably
known for a while.

49:35.372 --> 49:41.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I feel like it's not until
recently that
they really got to see the
numbers. In the

49:41.111 --> 49:45.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
past, the issue has always been,
well, we
don't need to pay you the same
as we pay the

49:45.282 --> 49:49.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
men because you don't make
enough revenue
in order to sustain that pay.

49:49.253 --> 49:51.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obviously, now that is no longer
the issue.

49:51.188 --> 49:52.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's not the
case.

49:53.023 --> 49:54.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIANA SCURRY: It is not the
case anymore.
That is no longer the argument
that they can

49:54.391 --> 49:55.893 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
give.

49:55.926 --> 49:59.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so now I feel that they
should be allowed
to ask and get equal pay.

50:00.030 --> 50:04.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why do you think
they are -- or
why are they resorting to going
to the federal

50:04.568 --> 50:06.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission?

50:06.470 --> 50:12.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why not try to resolve this
through the league,
through U.S. soccer, through
their own union?

50:12.977 --> 50:17.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIANA SCURRY: I am pretty much
certain that
they have tried. They have
probably exhausted

50:17.348 --> 50:23.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every other avenue they could,
with the exception
of filing a lawsuit or a
complaint, with the

50:23.587 --> 50:25.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
federation.

50:25.389 --> 50:28.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I'm sure they have gone
through several
rounds of negotiations in trying
to get the

50:28.292 --> 50:32.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Soccer Federation to move
in the right
direction of equal pay for equal
play. And

50:32.763 --> 50:34.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they're just not moving there.

50:34.531 --> 50:38.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to be honest, they probably
had their
last opportunity and last chance
to make this

50:38.202 --> 50:40.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happen, and this was it.

50:40.070 --> 50:43.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Briana Scurry, I
was -- again,
I was struck by U.S. soccer's
statement. They

50:43.040 --> 50:44.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
went, we're disappointed.

50:44.875 --> 50:48.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They went on to say -- they
said: "We are
proud of the commitment we have
made to building

50:48.312 --> 50:52.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the women's game in the United
States over
the past 30 years."

50:52.316 --> 50:58.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, and, as we said, they made a
later statement
where they commented on
compensation. But

50:58.122 --> 50:59.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what do you make of their
reaction?

50:59.657 --> 51:02.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRIANA SCURRY: It's the standard
reaction
they have always had.

51:02.559 --> 51:07.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's unfortunate, because the
bar is so low
for every other federation in
the world, that

51:07.598 --> 51:12.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they can easily claim, yes,
we're the leading
company, we're the leading
standard in that.

51:12.503 --> 51:16.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the problem is, is that,
over the last
several decades, we have had --
we, meaning

51:17.007 --> 51:23.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
myself when I played -- we had
to push them
to a higher standard. And that's
because we

51:23.580 --> 51:29.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were winning Olympics, we were
winning World
Cups. And so they had to have
some sort of

51:29.486 --> 51:33.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
equality for the women's team.
They really
couldn't ignore that.

51:33.657 --> 51:38.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they had to have a higher
standard
than every other country out
there for the

51:38.228 --> 51:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women's teams. And that's not
necessarily
a feather in their cap. It was
more so as

51:43.334 --> 51:45.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something that they were
obligated to do.

51:45.536 --> 51:49.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you think
is going to
end up being resolved? What is
your instinct?

51:49.273 --> 51:53.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIANA SCURRY: I really hope
it's resolved
after this lawsuit's been filed.
I really

51:53.410 --> 51:58.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hope it doesn't come down to the
women's team
feeling they have to strike in
order to get

51:58.248 --> 52:00.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their equal pay for equal play.

52:00.150 --> 52:05.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I really hope that they can come
to the table
again, hopefully soon, and get
this all resolved,

52:05.422 --> 52:10.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because I'm telling you right
now none of
those players that signed that
petition and

52:10.127 --> 52:13.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
none of the players that play on
the team
want to be dealing with any of
this right

52:13.263 --> 52:15.165 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

52:15.199 --> 52:17.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're in the process of
training for Olympic
Games. And that's what they
should be focusing

52:17.768 --> 52:19.570 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

52:19.603 --> 52:22.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Briana Scurry,
who is a former
goalie for the winning U.S.
women's soccer

52:22.406 --> 52:27.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
team, thank you very much.

52:27.945 --> 52:32.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRIANA SCURRY: Thank you.

52:32.416 --> 52:39.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: Springtime
in Washington is unmistakably
pink, thanks

52:39.990 --> 52:45.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the city's famous cherry
blossoms. We visited
the iconic Tidal Basin recently,
where the

52:45.596 --> 52:51.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trees were in peak bloom. And we
filmed a
360-degree view. You can watch
as the sun

52:51.935 --> 52:57.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
rises over the Jefferson
Memorial, and you
can view the magnificent scenery
from all

52:57.141 --> 52:58.909 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sides.

52:58.942 --> 53:05.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

It's PBS.org/NewsHour. Worth
looking at.

53:05.416 --> 53:07.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
