WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, WERE PASSED

00:25.367 --> 00:26.967
AS MUCH FOR POLITICAL REASONS AS

00:26.967 --> 00:27.800
SOME VAGUE SENSE OF JUSTICE.

00:27.800 --> 00:28.700

01:52.933 --> 01:56.667

01:56.667 --> 01:57.600
>> THE LAST 24 HOURS YOU HAVE

01:57.600 --> 01:58.600
BEEN ABLE TO CATCH UP WITH SOME

01:58.600 --> 01:59.367
OF THE VICTIMS.

01:59.367 --> 02:00.433
WHAT WAS THE SCENE THAT THEY

02:00.433 --> 02:01.400
DESCRIBED?

02:01.400 --> 02:02.933
>> IT WAS THE MIDDLE OF THE

02:02.933 --> 02:05.733
NIGHT, SO PEOPLE WERE COMPLETELY

02:05.733 --> 02:07.833
CONFUSED BY WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

02:07.833 --> 02:10.567
THEY HEARD ENORMOUS EXPLOSIONS

02:10.567 --> 02:11.300
AROUND THEM.

02:11.300 --> 02:13.433
THEN THERE WOULD BE PAUSES, THEN

02:13.433 --> 02:15.400
RENEWED EXPLOSIONS.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.933
THEY WERE -- SOME PEOPLE, THOSE

02:16.933 --> 02:19.867
WHO SURVIVED WERE HELPED TO GET

02:19.867 --> 02:22.433
INTO BUNKERS BY THE HOSPITAL

02:22.433 --> 02:23.633
STAFF AND YOU HAVE TO REALIZE

02:23.633 --> 02:26.067
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WERE, FOR

02:26.067 --> 02:27.933
ONE THING, THEY WERE QUITE STICK

02:27.933 --> 02:29.133
OR THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN

02:29.133 --> 02:31.067
THE HOSPITAL.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.033
AND THERE WERE FAMILY MEMBERS

02:32.033 --> 02:36.400
WITH THEM AS WELL, AND WHAT

02:36.400 --> 02:37.633
THEIR EXPERIENCE WAS A SENSE

02:37.633 --> 02:39.300
THAT THEY WERE IMMINENTLY GOING

02:39.300 --> 02:40.067
TO DIE.

02:40.067 --> 02:41.733
AT LEAST TWO OR THREE PEOPLE

02:41.733 --> 02:42.900
SAID THEY THOUGHT IT WAS THEIR

02:42.900 --> 02:44.733
LAST MOMENTS ON EARTH.

02:44.733 --> 02:46.200
>> YOU EVEN TALKED TO SOME

02:46.200 --> 02:48.133
PEOPLE WHO HAD COME IN FROM THE

02:48.133 --> 02:49.333
FIGHTING, WHO ALREADY HAD

02:49.333 --> 02:49.900
SUFFERED LOSSES.

02:49.900 --> 02:50.567
>> YES.

02:50.567 --> 02:52.633
I MEAN, SEVERAL OF THE PEOPLE

02:52.633 --> 02:54.500
THERE HAD EITHER LOST FAMILY

02:54.500 --> 02:57.400
MEMBERS OR HAD THEM BADLY

02:57.400 --> 02:59.000
WOUNDED AND HAD COME TO THE

02:59.000 --> 03:00.600
HOSPITAL FOR REFUGE SO THEY

03:00.600 --> 03:03.800
ALREADY HAD GONE THROUGH

03:03.800 --> 03:06.833
BOMBINGS OR GUNSHOTS AND BEEN IN

03:06.833 --> 03:08.467
THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG

03:08.467 --> 03:09.567
TIME.

03:09.567 --> 03:11.500
THESE WERE ALL CIVILIANS AND

03:11.500 --> 03:13.067
THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS, I

03:13.067 --> 03:15.267
THINK, A TERRIBLE SHOCK WHEN

03:15.267 --> 03:17.400
THEY EMERGED WHEN THE BOMBING

03:17.400 --> 03:19.900
STOPPED AND SAW THE DESTRUCTION,

03:19.900 --> 03:22.433
NOT JUST AT THE HOSPITAL BUT OF

03:22.433 --> 03:24.633
PATIENTS WHO DIED DURING THE

03:24.633 --> 03:26.400
ATTACK.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.633
>> WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE

03:27.633 --> 03:28.667
INVESTIGATION?

03:28.667 --> 03:32.167
I MEAN, PREVIOUS PRESIDENT HAMID

03:32.167 --> 03:33.433
KARZAI HAD TO DEAL WITH THE

03:33.433 --> 03:35.167
POLITICAL BLOWBACK FROM THESE

03:35.167 --> 03:37.400
FRIENDLY FIRE OR ACCIDENTAL

03:37.400 --> 03:38.833
BOMBINGS AND AIR RAIDS.

03:38.833 --> 03:40.500
>> WELL, I THINK IT HAS BEEN

03:40.500 --> 03:41.933
VERY INTERESTING, I MEAN TODAY

03:41.933 --> 03:45.033
THERE HAS NOT BEEN SUBSTANTIAL

03:45.033 --> 03:45.767
COMMENTARY ON IT.

03:45.767 --> 03:49.100
THERE HAS BEEN SOME ON OFFICIAL

03:49.100 --> 03:50.533
MEDIA BUT THERE HAVE BEEN MORE

03:50.533 --> 03:52.133
PICTURES ON THE TELEVISION OF

03:52.133 --> 03:54.100
THE ARMY HANDING OUT FOOD IN

03:54.100 --> 03:56.967
AREAS THAT THEY CONTROL IN

03:56.967 --> 04:00.200
KUNDUZ, BUT NOT THE KIND OF

04:00.200 --> 04:02.900
WIDESPREAD CRITICISM I WOULD

04:02.900 --> 04:04.700
HAVE EXPECTED, FRANKLY, AND I AM

04:04.700 --> 04:07.467
NOT SURE IF PEOPLE ARE ABSORBING

04:07.467 --> 04:10.200
WHAT HAPPENED OR IF THERE IS

04:10.200 --> 04:12.033
ENORMOUS AMBIVALENCE BECAUSE ON

04:12.033 --> 04:13.433
THE ONE HAND MANY PEOPLE WOULD

04:13.433 --> 04:15.967
LIKE THE TALIBAN TO BE REMOVED

04:15.967 --> 04:17.567
FROM THE CITY AND THE CITY TO GO

04:17.567 --> 04:20.200
BACK INTO GOVERNMENT HANDS, AND

04:20.200 --> 04:22.000
THEN I AM NOT SURE THE AFGHAN

04:22.000 --> 04:24.033
MILITARY CAN DO IT ON ITS OWN SO

04:24.033 --> 04:25.533
THEY ARE HESITANT TO BE TOO

04:25.533 --> 04:26.633
CRITICAL.

04:26.633 --> 04:27.833
IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION

04:27.833 --> 04:29.400
TO FIGURE OUT.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.733
AND HAMID KARZAI AS YOU RECALL

04:31.733 --> 04:33.267
LED A LOT OF THE CRITICISM OF

04:33.267 --> 04:36.833
THE UNITED STATES IN THOSE --

04:36.833 --> 04:40.033
WHEN THERE WERE CIVILIAN

04:40.033 --> 04:41.733
CASUALTIES AND THE NEW PRESIDENT

04:41.733 --> 04:43.700
HAS SAID MUCH LESS THAN, MUCH

04:43.700 --> 04:46.167
LESS THAT IS CRITICAL LATELY.

04:46.167 --> 04:50.500
>> ALYSSA RUBIN JOINING US FROM

04:50.500 --> 04:52.100

04:52.100 --> 04:52.867

04:52.867 --> 04:53.800
RUSSIA IS CARRYING OUT

04:53.800 --> 04:55.167

04:55.167 --> 04:56.433

04:56.433 --> 04:58.067
THEIR JETS BOMBED TEN ISLAMIC

05:01.133 --> 05:02.600

05:06.567 --> 05:08.300
MAKING A "MISTAKE" BACKING

GOVERNMENT-ISSUED PHOTO I.D. AT

07:47.767 --> 07:49.333

07:49.333 --> 07:51.100
NORTH CAROLINA IS ONE OF THEM,

07:51.100 --> 07:52.633
AND IT WENT MUCH FURTHER,

07:52.633 --> 07:54.400
PASSING REFORMS TWO YEARS AGO

07:54.400 --> 07:56.167

07:57.033 --> 07:58.833
VOTER FRAUD.

07:58.833 --> 08:00.400
CRITICS SAY THE NEW REQUIREMENTS

08:00.400 --> 08:01.600

08:02.467 --> 08:03.800
MINORITIES.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.400

08:53.100 --> 08:55.533
MANY BLACK VOTERS AS POSSIBLE.

08:55.533 --> 08:56.733
>> ALL OF THESE ATTACKS ON

08:56.733 --> 08:58.433
VOTING RIGHTS STARTED RIGHT

08:58.433 --> 08:59.667
AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA WON IN

08:59.667 --> 09:00.800
STATES, AND IT CHANGED THE

09:00.800 --> 09:03.233
DYNAMIC.

09:03.233 --> 09:04.833
PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER WHO HAD

09:04.833 --> 09:09.100
NOT BEEN COMING TOGETHER IN THE

09:09.100 --> 09:09.667
SOUTH.

09:09.667 --> 09:10.600
WE KNOW THAT THIS IS AN ATTEMPT

09:10.600 --> 09:12.300
TO ROLL US BACKWARDS.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.933
>> Reporter: BARBER AND THE

09:13.933 --> 09:15.533
N.A.A.C.P. BELIEVE PHOTO VOTER

09:15.533 --> 09:16.800
I.D. LAWS IN NORTH CAROLINA AND

09:16.800 --> 09:18.867
MORE THAN A DOZEN OTHER STATES

09:18.867 --> 09:20.433
SUPPRESS MINORITY VOTER TURNOUT,

09:20.433 --> 09:21.800
BECAUSE BLACK AND LATINO VOTERS

09:21.800 --> 09:22.900
ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO LACK AN

09:22.900 --> 09:24.433
ACCEPTABLE PHOTO I.D. OR THE

09:24.433 --> 09:26.200
DOCUMENTS TO GET ONE.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.667
DECREASES IN VOTER TURNOUT HAVE

09:27.667 --> 09:28.933
BEEN FOUND IN STATES THAT

09:28.933 --> 09:31.467
REQUIRE PHOTO I.D.'S TO VOTE.

09:31.467 --> 09:33.000
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE 2008 AND

09:33.000 --> 09:34.933
2012 ELECTIONS, THE NONPARTISAN

09:34.933 --> 09:36.533
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE

09:36.533 --> 09:38.100
ATTRIBUTED A 2% DECREASE IN

09:38.100 --> 09:39.767
TURNOUT IN KANSAS AND A 2-3%

09:39.767 --> 09:41.400
DECREASE IN TENNESSEE TO THEIR

09:41.400 --> 09:43.100
PHOTO I.D. LAWS.

09:43.100 --> 09:45.033
AND MANY VOTERS IN NORTH

09:45.033 --> 09:46.467
CAROLINA ARE STRUGGLING WITH

09:46.467 --> 09:48.033
THEIR NEW VOTER I.D. LAW THAT

09:48.033 --> 09:52.600
GOES INTO EFFECT IN 2016.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.433
94-YEAR OLD ROSANELL EATON IS

09:53.433 --> 09:55.467
ONE OF THEM.

09:55.467 --> 09:57.167
HER DAUGHTER DROVE HER 250 MILES

09:57.167 --> 09:58.933
BACK AND FORTH FROM THE

09:58.933 --> 10:01.133
DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND

10:01.133 --> 10:03.000
SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICES TO GET A

10:03.000 --> 10:04.633
PHOTO I.D., BECAUSE THE NAME ON

10:04.633 --> 10:05.967
HER DRIVER'S LICENSE-HER MARRIED

10:05.967 --> 10:08.100
NAME DID NOT MATCH HER MAIDEN

10:08.100 --> 10:09.400
NAME ON HER VOTER REGISTRATION

10:09.400 --> 10:12.233
FROM OVER 70 YEARS AGO.

10:12.233 --> 10:13.867
SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY, IT REALLY

10:13.867 --> 10:14.800
ISN'T THAT HARD UNDER THIS NEW

10:14.800 --> 10:16.500
LAW TO GET WHAT YOU NEED.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.467
>> IT'S NOT EASY AT ALL.

10:18.467 --> 10:21.133
IT WAS JUST UNNECESSARY.

10:21.133 --> 10:22.400
>> Reporter: THE EXPERIENCE

10:22.400 --> 10:24.033
REMINDED HER OF THE HURDLE SHE

10:24.033 --> 10:25.167
FACED THE FIRST TIME SHE TRIED

10:25.167 --> 10:26.433
TO REGISTER TO VOTE IN

10:26.433 --> 10:28.133
SEGREGATED NORTH CAROLINA ALMOST

10:28.133 --> 10:29.967
THREE QUARTERS OF A CENTURY AGO.

10:29.967 --> 10:33.567
THREE WHITE MEN TOLD HER...

10:42.567 --> 10:44.500
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.333
SO, I DID AS THEY COMMANDED.

10:46.333 --> 10:47.200
>> Reporter: YOU RECITED THE

10:47.200 --> 10:48.667
PREAMBLE TO THE U.S.

10:48.667 --> 10:49.733
CONSTITUTION?

10:49.733 --> 10:51.467
>> YES.

10:51.467 --> 10:52.567
>> Reporter: THE 1965 VOTING

10:52.567 --> 10:53.667
RIGHTS ACT CHANGED THINGS

10:53.667 --> 10:55.600
DRAMATICALLY.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.800
BY 2012, ABOUT 75% OF SOUTHERN

10:56.800 --> 10:59.933
BLACKS WERE REGISTERED.

10:59.933 --> 11:01.533
AND FOR 50 YEARS, THAT VOTING

11:01.533 --> 11:03.067
RIGHTS ACT EMPOWERED THE JUSTICE

11:03.067 --> 11:05.000
DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW ANY CHANGES

11:05.000 --> 11:06.633
IN VOTING LAWS IN ALL STATES OR

11:06.633 --> 11:08.467
PARTS OF STATES WITH A HISTORY

11:08.467 --> 11:10.933
OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION.

11:10.933 --> 11:12.233
ONETIME PROTESTERS, LIKE MARTIN

11:12.233 --> 11:15.000
LUTHER KING PROTÉGÉE MICKEY

11:15.000 --> 11:17.533
MICHAUX, BECAME LEGISLATORS.

11:17.533 --> 11:18.800
15 YEARS AGO, MICHAUX WAS PART

11:18.800 --> 11:20.500
OF EFFORTS BY A DEMOCRATIC

11:20.500 --> 11:22.233
LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR TO MAKE

11:22.233 --> 11:36.033
VOTING MUCH EASIER, WITH:

11:36.033 --> 11:36.800
IF YOU WERE AWAY FROM HOME, YOU

11:36.800 --> 11:38.300
COULD VOTE WHERE YOU WERE, AND

11:38.300 --> 11:39.400
PRE-REGISTRATION FOR 16 AND 17-

11:39.400 --> 11:40.267
YEARS-OLDS WHO WERE GETTING

11:40.267 --> 11:42.500
THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.867
MICHAUX IS EXCEPTIONALLY CANDID

11:43.867 --> 11:45.967
ABOUT WHY THIS WAS DONE:

11:45.967 --> 11:47.600
>> BASICALLY A PARTY SITUATION.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.700
MOST OF YOUR AFRICAN-AMERICANS

11:49.700 --> 11:52.733
VOTED DEMOCRATIC.

11:52.733 --> 11:54.800
AND SO IN ORDER NOT TO LOSE THAT

11:54.800 --> 11:57.367
BASE VOTE, THEY SAW A WAY WHERE

11:57.367 --> 11:59.467
YOU COULD INCREASE AFRICAN-

11:59.467 --> 12:01.567
AMERICAN VOTING AND TAKE CREDIT

12:01.567 --> 12:03.600
FOR HAVING PASSED ALL OF THESE

12:03.600 --> 12:07.133
OPENINGS IN YOUR VOTER LAWS.

12:07.133 --> 12:08.267
>> Reporter: IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT

12:08.267 --> 12:09.800
YOU'RE SAYING, WERE PASSED AS

12:09.800 --> 12:11.200
MUCH FOR POLITICAL REASONS AS

12:11.200 --> 12:12.500
SOME VAGUE SENSE OF JUSTICE.

12:12.500 --> 12:13.700
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.033
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

12:15.033 --> 12:16.567
>> Reporter: AND IT WORKED: IN

12:16.567 --> 12:18.233
THE PAST DECADE, 70% OF BLACKS

12:18.233 --> 12:19.600
IN NORTH CAROLINA VOTED EARLY,

12:19.600 --> 12:20.633
COMPARED WITH ABOUT 50% OF WHITE

12:20.633 --> 12:22.833
VOTERS.

12:22.833 --> 12:24.267
BUT IN 2010, THE POLITICS OF

12:24.267 --> 12:25.400
NORTH CAROLINA WERE TURNED

12:25.400 --> 12:27.067
UPSIDE DOWN.

12:27.067 --> 12:28.533
REPUBLICANS GAINED CONTROL OF

12:28.533 --> 12:29.933
BOTH HOUSES OF THE STATE

12:29.933 --> 12:31.167
LEGISLATURE FOR THE FIRST TIME

12:31.167 --> 12:33.400
SINCE RECONSTRUCTION.

12:33.400 --> 12:34.633
AND WITH THAT CONTROL CAME A

12:34.633 --> 12:36.133
CONCERTED EFFORT TO UNDO THE

12:36.133 --> 12:37.433
CHANGES THE DEMOCRATS HAD PUT

12:37.433 --> 12:38.200
INTO PLACE JUST A FEW YEARS

12:38.200 --> 12:41.933
EARLIER.

12:41.933 --> 12:42.867
IN 2013, THE REPUBLICAN-

12:42.867 --> 12:44.333
DOMINATED LEGISLATURE PASSED A

12:44.333 --> 12:45.333
VOTER I.D. LAW, AND THE NEWLY-

12:45.333 --> 12:46.333
ELECTED REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR

12:46.333 --> 12:49.667
SIGNED IT.

12:49.667 --> 12:50.933
BACKERS CITED VOTER FRAUD, BUT

14:54.067 --> 14:55.333
THAT LIMITED THE SO-CALLED"

14:55.333 --> 14:56.767
SOULS TO THE POLLS" EFFORT,

14:56.767 --> 14:58.333
WHEN MANY BLACK CHURCHES

14:58.333 --> 14:59.467
TRANSPORT CONGREGATES TO THEIR

14:59.467 --> 15:01.767
POLLING STATIONS.

15:01.767 --> 15:03.100
THAT LOOKS LIKE, FROM THE

15:03.100 --> 15:04.867
SUPERFICIAL LEVEL, AT LEAST,

15:04.867 --> 15:05.900
THAT HAD TO HAVE BEEN TARGETED

15:05.900 --> 15:06.767
TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN

15:06.767 --> 15:09.100
COMMUNITY.

15:09.100 --> 15:10.733
>> I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK SO.

15:10.733 --> 15:12.167
MANY OF OUR STATE AGENCIES ARE

15:12.167 --> 15:17.767
NOT REQUIRED TO WORK ON SUNDAYS.

15:17.767 --> 15:19.700
EVEN IF YOU WANT TO ATTEST OR

15:19.700 --> 15:22.767
BELIEVE THAT WE DID SOMETHING

15:22.767 --> 15:24.900
FOR PARTISAN ADVANTAGE, IT

15:24.900 --> 15:26.400
CERTAINLY WASN'T DONE WITH A

15:26.400 --> 15:28.733
RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY INTENT.

15:28.733 --> 15:30.233
>> Reporter: BUT THAT'S NO

15:30.233 --> 15:32.000
CONSOLATION FOR DALE HICKS, A

15:32.000 --> 15:32.700
FORMER MARINE WHO SERVED IN

15:32.700 --> 15:34.667
AFGHANISTAN.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.233
LAST YEAR, HICKS AND HIS WIFE

15:36.233 --> 15:37.633
MOVED FROM JACKSONVILLE, NORTH

15:37.633 --> 15:39.067
CAROLINA, TO RALEIGH.

15:39.067 --> 15:41.167
A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE 2014

15:41.167 --> 15:42.367
ELECTION, HE CALLED HIS ELECTION

15:42.367 --> 15:43.567
BOARD TO LEARN HIS NEW POLLING

15:43.567 --> 15:46.367
PLACE.

15:46.367 --> 15:47.633
>> THEY TOLD ME ACTUALLY, "NO,

15:47.633 --> 15:49.067
THIS MEANS YOU CAN'T VOTE IN

15:49.067 --> 15:50.167
RALEIGH, BECAUSE YOUR ADDRESS ON

15:50.167 --> 15:51.433
YOUR REGISTRATION SAYS

15:51.433 --> 15:53.067
JACKSONVILLE.

15:53.067 --> 15:54.567
YOU CAN'T VOTE IN JACKSONVILLE,

15:54.567 --> 15:56.333
EVEN THOUGH YOUR ADDRESS SAYS

15:56.333 --> 15:57.333
JACKSONVILLE, YOU DON'T LIVE IN

15:57.333 --> 15:58.467
JACKSONVILLE, SO IT'S NOT

15:58.467 --> 16:00.133
VALID."

16:00.133 --> 16:01.400
I BASICALLY FELT LIKE I LOST THE

16:01.400 --> 16:02.600
RIGHT TO VOTE AT THAT POINT.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.733
>> Reporter: WITH NO MORE SAME-

16:03.733 --> 16:05.100
DAY REGISTRATION DURING EARLY

16:05.100 --> 16:06.600
VOTING OR OUT-OF-PRECINCT

16:06.600 --> 16:08.200
VOTING, HICKS COULD ONLY CAST A

16:08.200 --> 16:09.067
PROVISIONAL BALLOT, WHICH WENT

16:09.067 --> 16:09.933
UNCOUNTED UNDER THE NEW VOTING

16:09.933 --> 16:11.033
RULES.

16:11.033 --> 16:13.033
>> IT JUST MADE ME ANGRY.

16:13.033 --> 16:14.067
I KNEW THESE BARRIERS WERE BEING

16:14.067 --> 16:16.767
PUT UP, YOU KNOW.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.267
AND IT WORKED.

16:19.267 --> 16:20.833
>> Reporter: IF PARTISAN

16:20.833 --> 16:22.300
POLITICS IS BEHIND THIS FIGHT,

16:22.300 --> 16:23.300
IT RAISES AN INTRIGUING

16:23.300 --> 16:24.600
QUESTION.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.433
COURTS GENERALLY APPROVE

16:25.433 --> 16:26.600
LEGISLATION THAT IS POLITICALLY

16:26.600 --> 16:28.733
MOTIVATED.

16:28.733 --> 16:29.733
THEY ARE MUCH, MUCH TOUGHER ON

16:29.733 --> 16:30.833
LEGISLATION THAT SEEMS RACIALLY

16:30.833 --> 16:32.133
INSPIRED.

16:32.133 --> 16:33.500
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF THOSE TWO

16:33.500 --> 16:36.733
SEEM HOPELESSLY ENTANGLED.

16:36.733 --> 16:38.067
ONE RESPONSE COMES FROM CARTER

16:38.067 --> 16:39.400
WRENN, A LONG-TIME REPUBLICAN

16:39.400 --> 16:40.267
POLITICAL CONSULTANT IN NORTH

16:40.267 --> 16:42.133
CAROLINA.

16:42.133 --> 16:43.600
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, WHAT'S

16:43.600 --> 16:45.533
THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THIS?

16:45.533 --> 16:46.367
>> PARTISAN POLITICS, PURE AND

16:46.367 --> 16:50.633
SIMPLE.

16:50.633 --> 16:52.333
I MEAN, RACE, IT GETS MIXED UP

16:52.333 --> 16:54.167
IN IT, BUT IT'S REPUBLICANS

16:54.167 --> 16:56.333
LOOKING TO HELP REPUBLICANS.

16:56.333 --> 16:57.733
>> Reporter: IS THERE A MORAL

16:57.733 --> 16:58.933
EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN WANTING MORE

16:58.933 --> 16:59.867
PEOPLE TO VOTE, AND WANTING

16:59.867 --> 17:01.633
FEWER PEOPLE TO VOTE?

17:01.633 --> 17:03.000
>> YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.167
NOBODY'S MOTIVATIONS ARE PURE

17:04.167 --> 17:05.533
HERE.

17:05.533 --> 17:07.133
IF THE PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T VOTE

17:07.133 --> 17:08.867
WERE MORE LIKELY TO VOTE

17:08.867 --> 17:10.700
REPUBLICAN, I DON'T THINK FOR A

17:10.700 --> 17:12.433
MINUTE THE DEMOCRATS WOULD BE

17:12.433 --> 17:14.700
TRYING TO GET THEM TO VOTE.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.400
>> IT IS RACE.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.100
THE GREATER MAKEUP OF THE

17:18.100 --> 17:19.133
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THIS STATE

17:19.133 --> 17:21.133
IS AFRICAN-AMERICAN.

17:21.133 --> 17:23.167
SO IF THE WAY THAT YOU-YOU GRAB

17:23.167 --> 17:25.133
POWER IS YOU TAKE BACK THOSE

17:25.133 --> 17:26.467
THINGS THAT HAVE AFFECTED

17:26.467 --> 17:27.400
AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO GO TO THE

17:27.400 --> 17:30.300
POLLS AND VOTE.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.833
>> Reporter: THE SAME DAY NORTH

17:31.833 --> 17:33.400
CAROLINA'S VOTING REFORMS WERE

17:33.400 --> 17:36.033
SIGNED INTO LAW, THE N.A.A.C.P,

17:36.033 --> 17:37.500
SUED TO STOP THEM.

17:37.500 --> 17:38.633
SO DID THE NONPARTISAN LEAGUE OF

17:38.633 --> 17:39.800
WOMEN VOTERS AND THEN, THE US

17:39.800 --> 17:42.800
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

17:42.800 --> 17:43.900
>> THIS IS AN INTENTIONAL

17:43.900 --> 17:44.967
ATTEMPT TO BREAK A SYSTEM THAT

17:44.967 --> 17:46.233
WAS WORKING.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.367
IT DEFIES COMMON SENSE.

17:48.367 --> 17:49.800
>> Reporter: NORTH CAROLINA'S

17:49.800 --> 17:51.833
OWN STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS

17:51.833 --> 17:54.067
FOUND THAT 318,000 VOTERS LACKED

17:54.067 --> 17:56.167
THE NECESSARY PHOTO ID TO VOTE

17:56.167 --> 17:57.967
ONE THIRD OF THEM WERE AFRICAN

17:57.967 --> 17:59.500
AMERICANS, WHO MAKE UP ONLY ONE

17:59.500 --> 18:01.733
FIFTH OF THE ELECTORATE.

18:01.733 --> 18:03.300
FOLLOWING A THREE WEEK TRIAL

18:03.300 --> 18:04.967
THIS SUMMER, A FEDERAL JUDGE IS

18:04.967 --> 18:06.500
NOW DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT

18:06.500 --> 18:08.400
THOSE NORTH CAROLINA VOTING

18:08.400 --> 18:10.400
REFORMS ARE CONSTITUTIONAL.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.267
BACKERS OF THE LAW POINT OUT

18:12.267 --> 18:16.867
THAT BLACK VOTER TURNOUT IN 2014

18:16.867 --> 18:18.033
ACTUALLY ROSE 16% FROM THE

18:18.033 --> 18:19.800
PREVIOUS MIDTERMS IN 2010.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.767
BUT ACTIVISTS CREDIT THIS TO A

18:21.767 --> 18:23.433
COMPETITIVE U.S. SENATE RACE IN

18:23.433 --> 18:24.667
2014 AND TO THEIR GET-OUT-THE-

18:26.267 --> 18:27.767
WHICHEVER WAY THE JUDGE HERE

18:27.767 --> 18:29.067
RULES AND WITH SIMILAR LAWSUITS

18:29.067 --> 18:33.200
IN OTHER STATES, THE ISSUE SEEMS

18:33.200 --> 18:34.233
DESTINED AGAIN FOR THE US

18:34.233 --> 18:35.233
SUPREME COURT, WHOSE DECISION

18:35.233 --> 18:36.500
COULD HELP DETERMINE WHO VOTES

18:51.400 --> 18:52.900
THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

18:52.900 --> 18:54.367
AGENCY UNVEILED NEW RULES TO

18:54.367 --> 18:55.633
REDUCE SMOG, BY LIMITING THE

18:55.633 --> 18:57.067
POLLUTING GASES EMITTED BY U.S.

18:57.067 --> 18:58.567
FACTORIES AND CARS.

18:58.567 --> 19:00.433
ALSO, INDIA, THE WORLD'S THIRD-

19:00.433 --> 19:02.300
LARGEST AIR POLLUTER AFTER THE

19:02.300 --> 19:04.600
U.S. AND CHINA, ANNOUNCED A $2.5

19:04.600 --> 19:06.267
TRILLION PLAN TO REDUCE ITS

19:06.267 --> 19:07.067
CARBON EMISSIONS OVER THE NEXT

19:07.067 --> 19:08.567
15 YEARS.

19:08.567 --> 19:10.200
CHINA HAS A NEW PLAN, TOO.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.867
JOINING ME HERE IN THE STUDIO TO

19:11.867 --> 19:12.800
DISCUSS THESE DEVELOPMENTS IS

19:12.800 --> 19:14.067
NAVEENA SADASIVAM FROM

19:14.067 --> 19:17.633
"INSIDE CLIMATE NEWS."

19:17.633 --> 19:19.100
>> SO THE NEW SMOG RULES, THERE

19:19.100 --> 19:20.200
WAS TENSION THERE, THE

19:20.200 --> 19:21.733
ENVIRONMENT LIST WANTED TO

19:21.733 --> 19:23.500
DECREASE IT MUCH LOWER, INDUSTRY

19:23.500 --> 19:25.000
WANTED TO LEAVE IT THE SAME,

19:25.000 --> 19:26.800
WHAT DID THE EPA DO?.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.267
THEY ARE TRYING TO WALK A FINE

19:29.267 --> 19:30.467
LINE BETWEEN DOING WHAT IS

19:30.467 --> 19:32.133
MANDATED TO DO, WHICH IS PROTECT

19:32.133 --> 19:34.633
AIR QUALITY, AND IMPROVE PUBLIC

19:34.633 --> 19:37.233
HEALTH FOR MEMORIES, BUT ALSO

19:37.233 --> 19:39.933
ENSURING THAT THE COST TO THE

19:39.933 --> 19:41.667
INDUSTRY AREN'T ONEROUS, SO WHAT

19:41.667 --> 19:43.100
THEY ENDED UP DOING IS SETTING

19:43.100 --> 19:47.400
THE STANDARD AT 70 PARTS PER

19:47.400 --> 19:49.000
BILLION, WHICH IS THE WEAKER

19:49.000 --> 19:49.967
SIDE OF WHAT SCIENTISTS HAVE

19:49.967 --> 19:50.533
RECOMMENDED.

19:50.533 --> 19:51.400
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.567
SO PARTS PER BILLION, JUST TO

19:52.567 --> 19:54.433
TRY TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE,

19:54.433 --> 19:55.900
DOES THAT REALLY MATTER IF IT

19:55.900 --> 19:59.033
GOES FROM 75 TO 70 OR 70 TO 65?

19:59.033 --> 20:01.167
THE EPA WANTED TO TALK ABOUT HOW

20:01.167 --> 20:02.767
MANY LIVES IT WOULD SAVE AND ALL

20:02.767 --> 20:04.800
OF THESE DIFFERENT COSTS, BUT

20:04.800 --> 20:06.133
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER IF THEY

20:06.133 --> 20:06.800
MOVED IT LOWER?

20:06.800 --> 20:08.633
>> IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN TERMS

20:08.633 --> 20:10.700
OF SAVING LIVES, I THINK THE

20:10.700 --> 20:12.767
DIFFERENCE IN THE ASTHMA CASES

20:12.767 --> 20:14.100
WERE SEVERAL MILLION BETWEEN

20:14.100 --> 20:16.233
LOWERING IT TO 65 PARTS PER

20:16.233 --> 20:17.500
BILLION AND 70 PARTS PER BILLION

20:17.500 --> 20:18.700
AND IN TERMS OF SAVING LIVES AS

20:18.700 --> 20:19.467
WELL.

20:19.467 --> 20:20.467
>> Sreenivasan: AND THE

20:20.467 --> 20:21.633
INDUSTRY SAYS IT IS GOING TO

20:21.633 --> 20:23.400
TAKE SOME TIME TO TRY TO PUT

20:23.400 --> 20:25.400
THESE SCRUBBERS, THESE FILTERS

20:25.400 --> 20:26.733
ON THESE SMOKESTACKS.

20:26.733 --> 20:28.933
>> RIGHT WE HEARD FROM SOME

20:28.933 --> 20:30.400
INDUSTRY GROUPS SAYING THEY ARE

20:30.400 --> 20:32.767
STILL STRUGGLING TO MEET 2008

20:32.767 --> 20:33.733
STANDARDS THAT WERE SET.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.233
>> Sreenivasan: ANOTHER PIECE

20:35.233 --> 20:36.267
OF NEWS STARTING TO CROSS THE

20:36.267 --> 20:37.533
WIRES IS BOTH CHINA AND

20:37.533 --> 20:38.600
INDEPENDENT I CAN'T IN THE PAST

20:38.600 --> 20:40.033
COUPLE OF WEEKS SAYS HERE ARE

20:40.033 --> 20:42.767
OUR PLANS FOR TACKLING CLIMATE

20:42.767 --> 20:43.900
CHANGE DO, THESE MATTER?

20:43.900 --> 20:47.367
>> WE DO, THEY ARE QUITE

20:47.367 --> 20:48.067
SUBSTANTIAL, SIGNIFICANT

20:48.067 --> 20:50.100
EMISSION REDUCTION BUT WE ARE TO

20:50.100 --> 20:51.167
REMEMBER THEY ARE NOWHERE CLOSE

20:51.167 --> 20:54.933
TO WHAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY

20:54.933 --> 20:56.433
STAVE OFF THE WORSE EFFECTS OF

20:56.433 --> 20:58.667
CLIMATE CHANGE, SCIENTISTS ARE

20:58.667 --> 21:00.000
SAYING WE NEED TO KEEP

21:00.000 --> 21:01.533
TEMPERATURE RISE BELOW

21:01.533 --> 21:03.900
TWO DEGREES CELSIUS AND THE DATA

21:03.900 --> 21:08.700
SO FAR, OVER 140 COUNTRIES AND

21:08.700 --> 21:10.233
DEPENDING ON THE ANALYSIS YOU

21:10.233 --> 21:14.233
LOOK AT ONLY 2.7 TO 2.5 SO WE

21:14.233 --> 21:17.267
HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO, BUT

21:17.267 --> 21:19.067
CHINA, THEY GIVE THE

21:19.067 --> 21:19.900
INTERNATIONAL MINUTE MOMENTUM

21:19.900 --> 21:21.467
GOING INTO THE PARIS TALKS, YOU

21:21.467 --> 21:22.733
KNOW, THE SIGNS ARE ALL THERE

21:22.733 --> 21:24.900
THAT WE WILL HAVE A PRETTY

21:24.900 --> 21:25.867
STRONG AGREEMENT AT THE END OF

21:25.867 --> 21:26.567
THE YEAR.

21:26.567 --> 21:27.733
>> Sreenivasan: AND WHERE DOES

21:27.733 --> 21:29.233
THE U.S. STAND IN THE AND HOW

21:29.233 --> 21:30.667
DOES IT HELP IN THESE TALKS?

21:30.667 --> 21:33.500
>> SO THE U.S. ITSELF SORT OF

21:33.500 --> 21:34.767
STARTED OFF BY TABLING THE LEAD

21:34.767 --> 21:36.700
ON THIS ISSUE, FOR A LONG TIME

21:36.700 --> 21:37.833
THE WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE SAYING

21:37.833 --> 21:40.867
IF THE U.S. IS NOT TAKING THE

21:40.867 --> 21:42.467
LEAD, AND IF THEY ARE NOT TAKING

21:42.467 --> 21:44.367
THE LEAD THERE IS NO POINT IN US

21:44.367 --> 21:45.333
STEPPING UP BECAUSE WE ARE NOT

21:45.333 --> 21:46.167
THE CREATORS OF THIS PROBLEM.

21:46.167 --> 21:46.867
>> Sreenivasan: RIGHT.

21:46.867 --> 21:48.367
>> BUT THE U.S. HAS TAKEN IN THE

21:48.367 --> 21:52.333
LAST FEW CAREERS WE HAVE SEEN IT

21:52.333 --> 21:54.467
RELEASE, AIMING TO CUT CARBON

21:54.467 --> 21:55.700
POLLUTION FROM POWER PLANTS SO

21:55.700 --> 21:57.333
THAT SENT A VERY STRONG SIGNAL

21:57.333 --> 22:00.433
IT WAS SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING

22:00.433 --> 22:01.400
COMMITMENTS TO ATTACK CLIMATE

22:01.400 --> 22:02.033
CHANGE.

22:02.033 --> 22:02.667
>> Sreenivasan: NAVEENA

22:02.667 --> 22:04.533
SADASIVAM FROM INSIDE CLIMATE,

22:04.533 --> 22:06.033
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

22:06.033 --> 22:10.533
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

22:10.533 --> 22:15.600
>>

22:15.600 --> 22:16.667
>> Sreenivasan: NEW RULES FOR

22:16.667 --> 22:17.667
HOME MORTGAGES HAVE TAKEN EFFECT

22:17.667 --> 22:18.767
THIS WEEKEND.

22:18.767 --> 22:20.100
THE SO-CALLED "KNOW BEFORE YOU

22:20.100 --> 22:21.400
OWE" RULES ARE MEANT TO PROTECT

22:21.400 --> 22:22.900
HOME BUYERS FROM SURPRISES AT

22:22.900 --> 22:24.400
THEIR CLOSING OR COMMITTING TO

22:24.400 --> 22:25.700
PAYMENTS THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND.

22:25.700 --> 22:26.833
YESTERDAY, I SPOKE WITH "WALL

22:26.833 --> 22:27.767
STREET JOURNAL" REPORTER JOE

22:27.767 --> 22:31.167
LIGHT ABOUT THESE NEW RULES.

22:31.167 --> 22:32.000
>> WHAT IS THE AVERAGE CONSUMER

22:32.000 --> 22:33.533
LIKELY TO SEE AS A DIFFERENCE

22:33.533 --> 22:35.567
BECAUSE OF THESE RULES?

22:35.567 --> 22:36.833
>> ONE OF THE FORMS WOW GET

22:36.833 --> 22:38.967
RIGHT AFTER YOU MAKE A MORTGAGE

22:38.967 --> 22:40.300
APPLICATION AND A FORM YOU GET

22:40.300 --> 22:42.133
RIGHT BEFORE CLOSING IS GOING TO

22:42.133 --> 22:43.367
BE SIMPLIFIED.

22:43.367 --> 22:44.967
THE TERMS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

22:44.967 --> 22:46.433
EASIER TO UNDERSTAND, YOU ARE

22:46.433 --> 22:47.767
SUPPOSED TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU

22:47.767 --> 22:49.400
HAVE AN ADJUSTABLE RATE AND, YOU

22:49.400 --> 22:50.733
KNOW, THE RATE WILL GO HIGHER

22:50.733 --> 22:53.400
AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.967
>> THE SECOND CHANGE IS BEFORE

22:54.967 --> 22:56.067
CLOSING YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GET

22:56.067 --> 22:58.733
THESE DOCUMENTS AT LEAST THREE

22:58.733 --> 23:00.133
BUSINESS DAYS BEFORE CLOSING,

23:00.133 --> 23:01.600
AND THAT IS DESIGNED SO YOU HAVE

23:01.600 --> 23:03.267
TIME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE

23:03.267 --> 23:04.400
GETTING INTO BEFORE YOU SIGN ON

23:04.400 --> 23:06.133
THE DOTTED LINE.

23:06.133 --> 23:07.700
NOW, IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE, BUT

23:07.700 --> 23:09.800
IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES WITHIN

23:09.800 --> 23:11.133
THAT THREE-DAY WINDOW, THAT

23:11.133 --> 23:13.200
RESETS THE THREE DAYS, AND AS

23:13.200 --> 23:15.033
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO,

23:15.033 --> 23:17.767
YOU KNOW, CLOSELY TIME HOME

23:17.767 --> 23:18.867
CLOSINGS, RESETTING THAT

23:18.867 --> 23:20.233
THREE-DAY WINDOW CAN LEAD TO

23:20.233 --> 23:20.733
SOME HEADACHES.

23:20.733 --> 23:21.733
>> Sreenivasan: HOW ARE WE

23:21.733 --> 23:23.033
GOING TO KNOW IF THESE RULES

23:23.033 --> 23:24.400
HAVE HELPED CONSUMERS?

23:24.400 --> 23:26.267
>> I GUESS WE WON'T REALLY KNOW

23:26.267 --> 23:27.967
UNTIL THE NEXT FINANCIAL CRISIS

23:27.967 --> 23:29.800
HITS, RIGHT, AND THEN WE WILL

23:29.800 --> 23:32.467
SEE WHETHER THE CONSUMERS WHO

23:32.467 --> 23:34.467
ARE ABLE OR UNABLE TO PAY THEIR

23:34.467 --> 23:35.833
LOANS FEEL LIKE THEY KNEW WHAT

23:35.833 --> 23:37.000
THEY WERE GETTING INTO.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.400
THE THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IN

23:38.400 --> 23:40.600
THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS HOE IS

23:40.600 --> 23:42.533
WHETHER THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY

23:42.533 --> 23:45.367
IS READY, THE RAE INDUSTRY HAS

23:45.367 --> 23:47.800
GONE THROUGH THIS LARGE

23:47.800 --> 23:48.900
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE OVER, THEY

23:48.900 --> 23:50.100
NEED TO BE READY ON MONDAY SO

23:50.100 --> 23:51.433
WHAT WILL HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT

23:51.433 --> 23:52.567
FEW MONTHS WE WILL SEE WHETHER

23:52.567 --> 23:54.167
OR NOT HOME CLOSINGS ARE

23:54.167 --> 23:55.200
HAPPENING ON TIME OR WHETHER,

23:55.200 --> 23:57.667
YOU KNOW, SOME OF THESE MORTGAGE

23:57.667 --> 23:59.433
LENDERS ARE, OR REAL ESTATE

23:59.433 --> 24:00.600
AGENTS WEREN'T READY AND WE SEE

24:00.600 --> 24:01.967
