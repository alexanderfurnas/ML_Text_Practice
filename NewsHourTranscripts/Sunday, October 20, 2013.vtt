00:13.133 --> 00:14.667
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TENTATIV

00:14.667 --> 00:16.500
$13 BILLION PENALTY THAT THE

00:16.500 --> 00:18.833
NATION'S LARGEST BANK WILL PAY

00:18.833 --> 00:21.233
IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT, HAWAII

00:21.233 --> 00:22.733
RESIDENTS TAKING ON COMPANIE

00:22.733 --> 00:25.833
DEVELOPING GENETICALLY MODIFIE

00:25.833 --> 00:26.367
SEEDS.

00:26.367 --> 00:28.800
THEY CLAIM THE PESTICIDES USED

00:28.800 --> 00:30.500
ARE MAKING THEM SICK

00:30.500 --> 00:31.867
>>> MORE THAN 100 YEARS AFTE

00:31.867 --> 00:34.333
HIS DEATH, MARK TWAIN REVEALED

00:34.333 --> 00:44.667
NEXT ON PBS NEWS HOUR WEEKEND.

00:44.667 --> 00:50.033
FROM THE TISH WPB STUDIOS IN NEW

00:50.033 --> 00:55.200
YORK, HARI SREENIVASAN

00:55.200 --> 00:56.067
>> GOOD EVENING.

00:56.067 --> 01:04.100
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

01:04.100 --> 01:05.300
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH A CLOSER

01:05.300 --> 01:07.000
LOOK AT THE TENTATIVE DEAL

01:07.000 --> 01:08.100
REACHED YESTERDAY BETWEEN TH

01:08.100 --> 01:10.300
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND JP MORGAN

01:10.300 --> 01:10.433
CHASE.

01:10.433 --> 01:11.600
THE AGREEMENT WOULD REQUIR

01:11.600 --> 01:13.100
CHASE, THE NATION'S LARGES

01:13.100 --> 01:15.833
BANK, TO PAY A RECORD $1

01:15.833 --> 01:18.133
BILLION PENALTY.

01:18.133 --> 01:21.200
IT STEMS FROM ALLEGATIONS THAT

01:21.200 --> 01:22.733
CHASE KNOWINGLY SOLD MORTGAGES

01:22.733 --> 01:24.200
TO PEOPLE.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.633
IT WAS BETWEEN DIRECT TALKS OF

01:25.633 --> 01:26.600
JAMIE DIAMOND, THE CHIEF

01:26.600 --> 01:27.867
EXECUTIVE OFFICER.

01:27.867 --> 01:29.333
WE'RE JOINED WITH THE REPORTER

01:29.333 --> 01:30.600
FROM BLOOMBERG NEWS, HAS BEE

01:30.600 --> 01:31.733
FOLLOWING THE CHASE STORY FO

01:31.733 --> 01:32.733
SOME TIME.

01:32.733 --> 01:34.533
BESIDE THE $13 BILLION NUMBER,

01:34.533 --> 01:36.267
WHY IS THIS SO SIGNIFICANT

01:36.267 --> 01:38.100
>> WE'RE SEEING KIND OF A SE

01:38.100 --> 01:39.700
CHANGE RIGHT NOW FOR WALL STREET

01:39.700 --> 01:40.967
AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WIT

01:40.967 --> 01:41.233
WASHINGTON

01:41.233 --> 01:42.967
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS

01:42.967 --> 01:45.100
GOTTEN NOTHING BUT CRITICISM FOR

01:45.100 --> 01:46.367
NOT GOING AFTER BANKS HARD

01:46.367 --> 01:47.767
ENOUGH FOR THE FINANCIAL CRISIS,

01:47.767 --> 01:49.233
AND NOW WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS

01:49.233 --> 01:50.800
LITTLE BIT OF CATCH-UP

01:50.800 --> 01:52.500
SOME ANALYSTS THINK THAT BECAUSE

01:52.500 --> 01:54.467
BANKS ARE HEALTHIER NOW, THEY'RE

01:54.467 --> 01:56.600
BETTER POSITIONED TO ABSOR

01:56.600 --> 01:57.700
THESE LOSSES

01:57.700 --> 01:58.900
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING THE

01:58.900 --> 02:00.467
ADMINISTRATION KICK UP PRESSUR

02:00.467 --> 02:01.567
ON THEM.

02:01.567 --> 02:04.000
YOU'RE ALSO SEEING, FOR JP

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
MORGAN, THIS RESOLVED A NUMBER

02:07.000 --> 02:09.833
OF INVESTIGATIONS, BUT THI

02:09.833 --> 02:11.400
RESOLVED ABOUT FIVE DIFFEREN

02:11.400 --> 02:12.700
INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST J

02:12.700 --> 02:14.100
MORGAN, ONE OF WHICH WAS A

02:14.100 --> 02:15.800
ACTUAL LAWSUIT FROM THE FEDERA

02:15.800 --> 02:16.933
HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY

02:16.933 --> 02:18.367
THAT WAS FOR LOSSES THAT FANNI

02:18.367 --> 02:20.233
AND FREDDIE INCURRED ON BA

02:20.233 --> 02:23.667
LOANS THAT THEY BOUGHT FROM JP

02:23.667 --> 02:25.733
MORGAN, FROM BEAR STEARNS, FRO

02:25.733 --> 02:27.200
WASHINGTON MUTUAL THAT THE

02:27.200 --> 02:29.167
BOUGHT FROM THOSE TWO ENTITIES

02:29.167 --> 02:30.200
DURING THE CRISIS.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.867
SO YOU'RE SEEING A VERY DRAMATIC

02:31.867 --> 02:33.300
AND VERY TOUGH STANCE IN

02:33.300 --> 02:34.900
WASHINGTON AGAINST BANKERS I

02:34.900 --> 02:35.133
GENERAL.

02:35.133 --> 02:39.300
>> SO PART OF THAT IS DEFINED AS

02:39.300 --> 02:41.400
$4 BILLION RELEASED FO

02:41.400 --> 02:41.567
CONSUMERS.

02:41.567 --> 02:42.400
WHAT'S THAT MEAN

02:42.400 --> 02:43.700
>> WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE HO

02:43.700 --> 02:44.967
THAT'S GOING TO BE STRUCTURE

02:44.967 --> 02:45.233
YET.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.667
WHAT WE DO KNOW FOR SURE -

02:46.667 --> 02:47.967
WELL, WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:47.967 --> 02:50.367
FIGURE OUT, REALLY, ACTUALLY, IS

02:50.367 --> 02:52.300
HOW IT AFFECTS BONDHOLDERS

02:52.300 --> 02:54.767
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO LOS

02:54.767 --> 02:56.033
MONEY ON THESE INVESTIGATION

02:56.033 --> 02:57.567
ARE THE BONDHOLDERS.

02:57.567 --> 02:59.400
BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK AS GOOD IF

02:59.400 --> 03:01.033
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT GETS MONEY

03:01.033 --> 03:04.567
BACK FOR BILLIONAIRES LIKE BIL

03:04.567 --> 03:05.967
GROSS AT PEMCO

03:05.967 --> 03:08.000
SO WHAT WE BELIEVE THEY'VE DON

03:08.000 --> 03:09.433
IS THEY'VE STRUCTURED SOME SOR

03:09.433 --> 03:11.533
OF MORTGAGE RELEASE, MAYBE

03:11.533 --> 03:13.000
PRINCIPAL REDUCTION, MAYBE

03:13.000 --> 03:14.267
INTEREST RATE REDUCTION.

03:14.267 --> 03:16.133
IT DOESN'T HURT THE BANK AS MUCH

03:16.133 --> 03:17.700
WHEN THEY STRUCTURE IT THAT WA

03:17.700 --> 03:20.533
SO THE BANK CAN GIVE MORE MONE

03:20.533 --> 03:22.233
TOWARDS THAT BECAUSE IT'S TA

03:22.233 --> 03:22.500
DEDUCTIBLE

03:22.500 --> 03:24.067
IT ALSO, I DON'T BELIEVE, HAS TO

03:24.067 --> 03:25.500
RECOGNIZE ALL THOSE COSTS UP

03:25.500 --> 03:25.767
FRONT.

03:25.767 --> 03:28.067
AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYIN

03:28.067 --> 03:29.033
TO FIGURE OUT.

03:29.033 --> 03:30.167
>> SO ONE OF THE DISTINCTION

03:30.167 --> 03:32.300
INSIDE THIS IS THAT CHASE IS NOT

03:32.300 --> 03:33.033
IMMUNE FROM CRIMINAL

03:33.033 --> 03:33.300
INVESTIGATION.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.000
>> NO.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.733
>> WHY THAT CLARIFICATION, AND

03:35.733 --> 03:37.167
IS THAT GOING TO HAVE AN IMPAC

03:37.167 --> 03:39.000
FOR INVESTORS ON MONDAY?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.733
>> IT MAY HAVE AN IMPACT FOR

03:41.733 --> 03:42.967
INVESTORS, NOT LIKEL

03:42.967 --> 03:44.133
NECESSARILY IMMEDIATELY ON

03:44.133 --> 03:44.400
MONDAY

03:44.400 --> 03:45.967
YOU MAY SEE THE STOCK MOVE A

03:45.967 --> 03:47.533
LITTLE BIT, BUT THE IMPACT WOULD

03:47.533 --> 03:49.700
BE LATER ON IF THE JUSTICE

03:49.700 --> 03:50.900
DEPARTMENT DECIDES TO GO FORWARD

03:50.900 --> 03:54.100
WITH SOME SORT OF DEFERRED

03:54.100 --> 03:54.767
PROSECUTION AGREEMENT.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.867
CHASE IS ALREADY UNDER A

03:56.867 --> 03:59.700
DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT

03:59.700 --> 04:01.633
FOR ACTIVITIES IN SELLING BOND

04:01.633 --> 04:04.033
IN ALABAMA, TWO MUNICIPALITIES

04:04.033 --> 04:04.467
THERE.

04:04.467 --> 04:06.033
SO THEIR MUNICIPAL BOND SALE

04:06.033 --> 04:07.167
PRACTICES HAVE ALREADY COM

04:07.167 --> 04:08.567
UNDER CRIMINAL SCRUTINY AN

04:08.567 --> 04:09.467
THEY'RE ALREADY UNDER AN

04:09.467 --> 04:10.867
AGREEMENT THERE.

04:10.867 --> 04:12.433
THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER SIMILA

04:12.433 --> 04:13.867
TYPE OF INVESTIGATION WITH THE

04:13.867 --> 04:16.700
SAME KINDS OF RAMIFICATIONS,

04:16.700 --> 04:18.100
ALSO EXECUTIVES MIGHT BE AT RISK

04:18.100 --> 04:18.533
AS WELL.

04:18.533 --> 04:20.667
>> SPEAKING OF EXECUTIVES, JAMIE

04:20.667 --> 04:22.367
DIAMOND HAS BEEN KIND OF A

04:22.367 --> 04:23.100
POLARIZING FIGURE.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.933
ON THE ONE HAND, CHASE HAS HAD

04:25.933 --> 04:27.467
70% STOCK GROWTH SINCE THE

04:27.467 --> 04:28.633
FINANCIAL CRASH IN 2008.

04:28.633 --> 04:29.933
ON THE OTHER HAND, IT'S JUST

04:29.933 --> 04:31.200
PENALTY AFTER PENALTY AFTE

04:31.200 --> 04:31.467
PENALTY.

04:31.467 --> 04:32.333
>> IT IS

04:32.333 --> 04:37.133
JP MORGAN HAS GOTTEN CREDIT FROM

04:37.133 --> 04:40.200
INVESTORS -- LARGE INVESTORS AND

04:40.200 --> 04:42.433
ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR BEING

04:42.433 --> 04:45.400
A GOOD MANAGER, FOR MAKING GOO

04:45.400 --> 04:46.300
MONEY.

04:46.300 --> 04:51.533
THEY MADE A RECORD 4.2 BILLION

04:51.533 --> 04:52.500
THEY'RE ONE OF THE MOS

04:52.500 --> 04:54.300
PROFITABLE BANKS IN THE WORLD.

04:54.300 --> 04:58.133
THERE'S NO DISPUTING THAT,

04:58.133 --> 04:59.533
HOWEVER, THERE IS PENALTY AFTE

04:59.533 --> 05:01.500
PENALTY AFTER PENALTY.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.467
THESE AREN'T THINGS TH

05:02.467 --> 05:03.900
GOVERNMENT MADE UP, THESE AR

05:03.900 --> 05:07.333
THINGS THE COMPANY ACTUALLY DI

05:07.333 --> 05:09.600
WRONG, IN SOME CASES ADMITTING

05:09.600 --> 05:09.900
WRONGDOING

05:09.900 --> 05:11.600
THEY MANIPULATED SOME MARKETS IN

05:11.600 --> 05:12.867
CALIFORNIA, THEY ADMITTED TO

05:12.867 --> 05:15.567
MISTAKES IN THE LONDON WHALE

05:15.567 --> 05:16.300
LOSS LAST YEAR

05:16.300 --> 05:17.633
THEY'RE UNDER INVESTIGATION FO

05:17.633 --> 05:20.267
THEIR HIRING PRACTICES IN ASIA

05:20.267 --> 05:21.533
THEY'RE A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS

05:21.533 --> 05:23.100
AND THE COMPANY IS TRYING TO

05:23.100 --> 05:24.367
HITTEN THE INTERNAL CONTROLS

05:24.367 --> 05:25.500
BUT WHAT SOME PEOPLE HAV

05:25.500 --> 05:27.967
THOUGHT IS MAYBE THEY WEREN'T IN

05:27.967 --> 05:29.800
AS MUCH SCRUTINY BEFORE BECAUS

05:29.800 --> 05:31.500
THEY'RE SO WELL MANAGED, AND NOW

05:31.500 --> 05:33.233
THIS IS JUST THE FEDERAL

05:33.233 --> 05:35.600
GOVERNMENT CATCHING UP TO ALL OF

05:35.600 --> 05:36.233
THAT

05:36.233 --> 05:39.867
>> DAWN KOPECKI IN BLOOMBERG

05:39.867 --> 05:40.867
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

05:40.867 --> 05:41.900
>> THANK YOU

05:41.900 --> 05:43.167
>>> THEY AIRED THEIR DIFFERENCES

05:43.167 --> 05:44.867
IN WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE

05:44.867 --> 05:46.433
FAILED STRATEGY OF TRYING TO

05:46.433 --> 05:48.000
ROLL BACK THE AFFORDABLE CAR

05:48.000 --> 05:49.833
ACT BY SHUTTING DOWN THE FEDERAL

05:49.833 --> 05:49.967
GOVERNMENT

05:49.967 --> 05:51.567
SENATOR TED CRUZ, WHO LED TH

05:51.567 --> 05:53.500
CAMPAIGN TO TRY TO UNDO THE LAW,

05:53.500 --> 05:54.533
LEFT OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT

05:54.533 --> 05:56.733
HE WOULD TRY THE SAME TACTIC

05:56.733 --> 05:58.467
AGAIN.

05:58.467 --> 05:59.000
WILL YOU RULE OUT PUSHING TO THE

05:59.000 --> 06:01.800
BRINK OF OTHER SHUTDOWN BY

06:01.800 --> 06:03.233
SAYING YOU WOULD BLOCK FUNDING

06:03.233 --> 06:04.500
FOR GOVERNMENT UNLESS OBAMA CARE

06:04.500 --> 06:05.633
IS DEFUNDED?

06:05.633 --> 06:06.767
WOULD YOU DO THAT AGAIN?

06:06.767 --> 06:08.600
>> I WOULD DO ANYTHING, AND

06:08.600 --> 06:09.600
WILL CONTINUE TO DO ANYTHING I

06:09.600 --> 06:10.900
CAN, TO STOP THE TRAIN WRECK

06:10.900 --> 06:12.033
THAT IS OBAMA CARE

06:12.033 --> 06:14.433
>> TWO OTHER PROMINENT

06:14.433 --> 06:17.300
REPUBLICANS, FORMER FLORID

06:17.300 --> 06:19.000
GOVERNOR JEB BUSH AND SENATO

06:19.000 --> 06:23.967
JOHN McCAIN ALSO RIDICULED THE

06:23.967 --> 06:25.533
PRESIDENT'S LEGISLATION.

06:25.533 --> 06:26.700
THEY POINTED OUT DIFFICULTIE

06:26.700 --> 06:29.067
SIGNING UP FOR THE HEALTH CARE

06:29.067 --> 06:30.933
UNDER THE GOVERNMENT'S WEBSITE

06:30.933 --> 06:33.900
>> HAVE A LITTLE BIT O

06:33.900 --> 06:34.067
SELF-RESTRAINT

06:34.067 --> 06:35.900
IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A

06:35.900 --> 06:36.767
POLITICALLY BETTER APPROACH TO

06:36.767 --> 06:39.467
SEE THE MASSIVE DYSFUNCTION.

06:39.467 --> 06:42.867
BUT WE DON'T EVEN HEAR ABOUT

06:42.867 --> 06:44.300
THAT BECAUSE WE'VE STEPPED O

06:44.300 --> 06:45.167
THAT MESSAGE

06:45.167 --> 06:47.733
>> WE THE REPUBLICANS LIKE I

06:47.733 --> 06:50.867
KEEP UP WITH THAT FIGHT, BUT W

06:50.867 --> 06:55.100
HAVE TO LATER-SHOT IT, RATHE

06:55.100 --> 06:59.333
THAN HITTING SOME VEHICLES BUT

06:59.333 --> 07:01.800
WE WERE RELEASED

07:01.800 --> 07:07.767
THEY WERE SET FORTH AFTER PRISON

07:07.767 --> 07:08.067
OFFICIALS.

07:08.067 --> 07:09.600
THEY WILL NOW CHECK BACK WIT

07:09.600 --> 07:11.467
JUDGES TO CONFIRM EARLY RELEASES

07:11.467 --> 07:12.900
BEFORE SETTING PRISONERS FREE.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.567
A MAJOR BRIBERY SCANDAL IS

07:14.567 --> 07:15.600
UNFOLDING IN THE NAVY.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.900
THE "WASHINGTON POST" REPORTED

07:16.900 --> 07:19.000
THAT TWO HIGH-LEVEL NAVY

07:19.000 --> 07:20.300
OFFICERS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED.

MAYBE PERSONNEL IN EXCHANGE FO

07:34.133 --> 07:37.433
CLASSIFIED BUSINESS THAT LED T

07:37.433 --> 07:42.300
MONEY FROM THE FIRM.

07:42.300 --> 07:44.867
THAT WORD TODAY FROM THE ARA

LEAGUE

07:47.133 --> 07:52.433
SECRETARY OF STATE TO MEET WIT

07:52.433 --> 07:53.267
SYRIAN OPPOSITION GROUPS

07:53.267 --> 07:54.667
IN SYRIA THERE WAS ANOTHER

07:54.667 --> 07:58.000
BOMBING AT A SECURITY CHEC

07:58.000 --> 08:00.833
POINT, THE SECOND IN TWO DAYS.

08:00.833 --> 08:04.400
A SUICIDE BOMBER BLEW HIMSELF UP

08:04.400 --> 08:06.500
IN A TRUCK

08:06.500 --> 08:07.900
MOST OF THE VICTIMS WERE

08:07.900 --> 08:09.333
CIVILIANS EVEN THOUGH MILITARY

08:09.333 --> 08:12.467
PERSONNEL WERE THE TARGETS

08:12.467 --> 08:17.300

IF THE DISCOVERIES ARE NEW T

19:47.000 --> 19:47.233

I THINK A LOT WILL BE NEW TO

19:48.967 --> 19:49.467
GENERAL READERS.

19:49.467 --> 19:51.533
A LOT OF GENERAL READERS

19:51.533 --> 19:53.067
PROBABLY DON'T REALIZE, FO

19:53.067 --> 19:55.200
EXAMPLE, THAT MARK TWAIN'S WAS A

19:55.200 --> 19:58.967
LIFE LIVED ON THE GRAND SCALE.

19:58.967 --> 20:15.500
BUT HE SPINT SPEND HIS WHOLE TOM

20:15.500 --> 20:15.767

20:27.733 --> 20:31.300
THERE IS A LOT OF THAT IN VOLUME

20:31.300 --> 20:34.433

20:36.067 --> 20:40.100
PRIVATE HOME IN HIS HOME THE

20:59.233 --> 21:02.500
THAT CAN PIPE MUSIC INTO HOMES

21:02.500 --> 21:04.433
