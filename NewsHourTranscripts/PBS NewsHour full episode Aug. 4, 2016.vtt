JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.806 --> 00:06.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:08.508 --> 00:11.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
Donald Trump's campaign does
damage control

00:11.778 --> 00:17.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after a troubled start to the
general election,
as Hillary Clinton benefits from
a steady

00:17.317 --> 00:19.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
post-convention bounce.

00:19.152 --> 00:24.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Thursday: On the
eve of the Olympics, an
investigation uncovers

00:24.157 --> 00:28.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decades of sexual abuse ignored
by U.S. gymnastic
officials.

00:28.295 --> 00:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And making the
most out of
a career low point -- why
hunting for a new

00:33.567 --> 00:37.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
job can bring opportunities to
reconnect and
reinvent.

00:37.537 --> 00:41.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN, Job Seeker: I
have to take
every phone call, every lunch,
every coffee

00:41.742 --> 00:47.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I can take and my days are
booked from
7:15 in the morning until late
at night.

00:47.514 --> 00:55.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:55.255 --> 00:58.058 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:58.091 --> 01:08.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Donald Trump has
spent this day
trying to recover, after a
series of statements

01:08.735 --> 01:11.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that triggered a storm of
criticism.

01:11.271 --> 01:16.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He campaigned today in the face
of sliding
poll numbers, and more
defections within Republican

01:16.777 --> 01:18.011 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ranks.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Correspondent Lisa Desjardins
has today's
developments.

01:20.747 --> 01:26.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: The
unconventional Donald
Trump spent the day in an
unexpected place,

01:26.153 --> 01:29.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Portland, Maine, with remarks
focused on immigrants
and crime.

01:29.423 --> 01:33.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We are letting people come in
from terrorist

01:33.860 --> 01:37.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nations that shouldn't be
allowed, because
you can't vet them.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no way of vetting them.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have no idea who they are.

01:40.267 --> 01:43.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This could be the great Trojan
horse of all
time.

01:43.637 --> 01:48.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For Trump,
winning Maine,
with a history of voting for
Democrats for

01:48.342 --> 01:50.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president, would be a coup.

01:50.177 --> 01:55.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he has other electoral map
concerns: A
dozen states are thought to be
in play, and

01:55.415 --> 02:02.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new polls out today show Trump
down significantly
in three key states, Michigan,
Pennsylvania,

02:02.155 --> 02:03.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and New Hampshire.

02:03.857 --> 02:09.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also behind, but within the
margin of
error, in the often decisive
Florida.

02:09.162 --> 02:14.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Running mate Mike Pence today
was in yet another
November battleground, North
Carolina.

02:14.568 --> 02:18.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Raleigh, an 11-year-old boy,
off-camera,
put him on the spot.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOY: You have been kind of
softening up on
his words.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.275 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:22.309 --> 02:25.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Over how Pence
has been handling
Trump's recent missteps.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.447 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
You know, sometimes, things
don't come out

02:28.448 --> 02:30.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like you mean, right?

02:30.851 --> 02:33.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald Trump and I are
absolutely determined
to work together.

02:33.787 --> 02:34.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have differences styles.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You might have noticed that.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:38.325 --> 02:42.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But some other
Republicans
are attacking, not defending
Trump.

02:42.229 --> 02:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressman Mike Coffman of
Colorado is launching
this ad slamming the nominee.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.801 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE COFFMAN (R), Colorado: So,
if Donald
Trump is president, I will stand
up to him,

02:50.971 --> 02:52.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
plain and simple.

02:52.806 --> 02:55.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And the list of
GOP members
of Congress who've gone beyond
just criticism,

02:55.208 --> 02:58.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and publicly say they won't vote
for Trump,
is growing.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It now includes Air Force vet
Adam Kinzinger
of Illinois.

03:01.948 --> 03:07.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He joins Charlie Dent of
Pennsylvania, plus
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Carlos
Curbelo of

03:07.287 --> 03:09.022 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Florida.

03:09.056 --> 03:11.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's also New York's Richard
Hanna, who's
going a step further, saying he
will vote

03:11.958 --> 03:13.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for Hillary Clinton.

03:13.860 --> 03:18.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And today, the top Republican in
Congress,
House Speaker Paul Ryan, tried
to walk the

03:18.698 --> 03:19.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tightrope.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump has refused to endorse
him.

03:22.002 --> 03:26.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ryan says he still supports
Trump, but he
implied that could change.

03:26.473 --> 03:31.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ryan also told a Wisconsin radio
show he will
keep pushing back when he thinks
Trump is

03:31.078 --> 03:32.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out of bounds.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.713 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: I
don't like to do this, I don't
want to do

03:35.415 --> 03:38.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, but I will do this because
I feel I
have to in order to defend
Republicans and

03:38.785 --> 03:44.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our principles, so that people
don't make
the mistake of thinking we think
like that.

03:44.291 --> 03:48.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump did
extend an olive
branch today, telling a crowd he
thinks Ryan

03:48.595 --> 03:51.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a good guy, but still not
endorsing him.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, on the left:

03:53.733 --> 03:55.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JILL STEIN, Green Party
Presidential Candidate:
I would feel terrible if Donald
Trump gets

03:55.702 --> 03:57.437 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
elected.

03:57.471 --> 04:00.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Green Party
candidate Jill
Stein released her first
campaign ad, going

04:00.440 --> 04:03.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after Donald Trump and Democrat
Hillary Clinton
both.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As for Clinton, she was in Las
Vegas talking
about jobs.

04:07.681 --> 04:13.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As she left one stop, she turned
to respond
to a question about outsourcing,
and Donald

04:13.186 --> 04:15.055 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

04:15.088 --> 04:15.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
When you run for president, you
need to be

04:15.789 --> 04:17.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
judged by what you have done.

04:17.324 --> 04:19.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think the evidence is
pretty clear.

04:19.526 --> 04:21.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everything he's made, he's made
somewhere
else.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's not put Americans to work.

04:23.430 --> 04:27.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's imported foreign workers,
instead of
hiring Americans at his country
clubs and

04:27.367 --> 04:28.468 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his resorts.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has cheated contractors.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I take that personally.

04:31.838 --> 04:35.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The other half
of the Democratic
ticket, Tim Kaine, stopped in
Baltimore for

04:35.142 --> 04:39.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the National Urban League
Conference this
morning, before a tour through
the Upper Midwest

04:39.579 --> 04:40.780 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tomorrow.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa

gymnastics

04:48.622 --> 04:50.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the eve of the Olympics in
Brazil.

04:50.924 --> 04:56.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Indianapolis Star and USA
Today Network
reported widespread claims that
coaches have

04:56.730 --> 04:59.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sexually abused young athletes.

04:59.266 --> 05:02.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It said the sport's governing
body has mostly
dismissed the claims.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will explore this in full
right after the
news summary.

05:05.939 --> 05:11.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Israel, the head
of a Christian
charity's operations in Gaza is
now accused

05:11.378 --> 05:16.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of diverting donations to Hamas
to build tunnels
and buy weapons.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mohammad El Halabi was arrested
in June.

05:18.718 --> 05:25.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He appeared in court today on
charges he siphoned
up to $50 million from World
Vision over 10

05:25.625 --> 05:27.093 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

05:27.127 --> 05:30.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
World Vision says it's shocked
and has no
reason to believe the charges.

05:30.096 --> 05:35.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A stabbing spree
in the heart
of London last night left one
American woman

05:35.168 --> 05:37.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dead and five other people
wounded.

05:37.537 --> 05:42.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The attacker was a Norwegian
teenager of Somali
origin.

05:42.275 --> 05:46.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Investigators worked the crime
scene today,
and said it appeared to be the
result of mental

05:46.613 --> 05:48.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
illness, not terrorism.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But people in the area were
rattled.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: It's such a busy area.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is right by Euston station.

05:54.054 --> 05:57.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There must be thousands of
people who pass
through this area every day.

05:57.390 --> 06:01.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I heard on the news this morning
that the
police response was quite quick.

06:01.361 --> 06:05.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, so that gives some
comfort, but, yes,
I'm shocked.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The suspect is in
custody.

06:08.468 --> 06:10.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of the wounded remains
hospitalized.

06:10.270 --> 06:14.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, the National
Institutes of Health is moving
to promote

06:14.608 --> 06:18.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
research using human stem cells
in animal
embryos.

06:18.812 --> 06:24.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It could help find ways to treat
Alzheimer's
and other diseases, or grow
organs for transplants.

06:24.618 --> 06:29.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIH proposed today to lift the
moratorium
on government funding for the
research.

06:29.089 --> 06:32.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was imposed last September
because of ethical
concerns.

06:32.425 --> 06:38.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Much of the
Southwestern U.S.
is bracing for new flooding as
monsoon seasonal

06:38.131 --> 06:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rains sweep across the region.

06:40.634 --> 06:46.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Six states, Arizona, California,
Colorado,
Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah,
were warned

06:46.840 --> 06:48.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
today to be ready.

06:48.675 --> 06:52.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flash floods hit parts of the
region earlier
this week, after intense storms
that knocked

06:52.779 --> 06:55.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down power lines and left
drivers stranded.

06:55.615 --> 06:59.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A major recall today
from the
Ford Motor Company.

06:59.219 --> 07:04.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It involves 830,000 vehicles in
the U.S. and
Mexico.

07:04.224 --> 07:09.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They could have faulty side door
latches that
break, allowing the doors to
open while the

07:09.329 --> 07:11.097 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

Ford says the recall covers six
different
models ranging from model years
2012 to 2016.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And Wall Street
mostly marked
time, ahead of tomorrow's jobs
report for

07:22.208 --> 07:23.677 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
July.

07:23.710 --> 07:28.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost about
three points to close at 18352.

07:28.948 --> 07:33.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose six points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added half-a-point.

GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the
"NewsHour":
years of unreported sexual abuse
accusations

07:38.758 --> 07:45.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against U.S. gymnastics coaches;
stepping
up the fight against ISIS in
Libya; a shrinking

07:45.298 --> 07:51.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jewish community on India's
coast; and much
more.

07:52.005 --> 08:03.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the eve of the
opening Olympic
ceremonies in Brazil, a new
investigation

08:03.917 --> 08:09.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into USA Gymnastics uncovers
some disturbing
details.

08:09.422 --> 08:15.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As athletes are gathering in
Rio, a stunning
report from The Indianapolis
Star and USA

08:15.161 --> 08:21.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today Network dominated this
day: It found
top executives in charge of
gymnastics' national

08:21.468 --> 08:28.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
governing body for years
routinely ignored
allegations of sexual abuse by
coaches of

08:28.441 --> 08:32.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
young athletes, in some cases
going back to
the 1990s.

08:33.012 --> 08:40.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report said USA Gymnastics
had files on
more than 50 coaches around the
country, claims

08:40.053 --> 08:44.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that had long sat in drawers at
its office
in Indianapolis.

08:44.891 --> 08:48.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That included a former coach,
Mark Schiefelbein.

08:48.395 --> 08:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The news report said gymnastics
officials
had a thick file of complaints
about him for

08:53.266 --> 09:00.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years before he was convicted of
sexual battery
and sexual exploitation of a
minor.

09:00.940 --> 09:05.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former gymnast Becca Seaborn
says he molested
her as a young girl.

09:06.012 --> 09:12.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her parents learned of the
extensive file
USA Olympics had only after he
was convicted.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JILL ROBINSON, Parent: Our
daughter now is
26 years old.

09:14.587 --> 09:17.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This happened when she was 10
and 11.

09:17.090 --> 09:23.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for it still to be where
it's at and for
them not to have changed
anything, it just

09:23.263 --> 09:28.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
makes me sick that this is still
happening,
that these children aren't being
protected.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's just not fair.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Olympics is going to start.

09:32.038 --> 09:37.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These kids are going to want to
go jump in
gyms and be just like these
heroes they see

09:37.677 --> 09:40.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on TV, and it just starts all
over again.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it just makes me really sad.

09:42.849 --> 09:48.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In another case,
the report
found gymnastics officials had
sexual misconduct

09:48.888 --> 09:56.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
files on coach James Bell five
years before
he was arrested for molesting
other gymnasts.

09:56.896 --> 10:02.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kaylin Maddox Brietzke said she
was 7 when
Bell inappropriately touched
her, and she

10:02.769 --> 10:04.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is angry at USA Gymnastics.

10:04.571 --> 10:09.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAYLIN MADDOX BRIETZKE, Sexual
Abuse Survivor:
Any corporation that puts their
reputation

10:09.209 --> 10:16.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
above safety, honestly, is
something that
I don't want to be a part of at
all.

10:16.883 --> 10:20.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was part of USA Gymnastics
for a very
long time.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It doesn't matter who you are
protecting.

10:22.422 --> 10:28.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't matter that they are
part of your
organization and you want to
save face.

10:28.661 --> 10:31.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How about saving me?

10:31.564 --> 10:37.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a statement,
Steve Penny,
the president of USA Gymnastics,
said the

10:37.504 --> 10:42.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organization is -- quote --
"committed to
promoting a safe environment"
and -- quote

10:42.375 --> 10:48.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "believes it has a duty to
report to law
enforcement whatever
circumstances warrant."

10:48.214 --> 10:54.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he also said the group seeks
first-hand
knowledge whenever allegations
arise and noted

10:54.621 --> 11:00.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- quote -- "We feel The Star
left out significant
facts that would have painted a
more accurate

11:00.393 --> 11:02.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
picture."

11:02.495 --> 11:06.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For a closer look at all this,
we turn to
Marisa Kwiatkowski.

11:06.165 --> 11:11.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's investigative reporter for
The Indy
Star, which is part of the USA
Today Network,

11:12.005 --> 11:17.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Nancy Hogshead-Makar, a
three-time Olympic
gold medalist in swimming.

11:17.510 --> 11:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's a lawyer and the CEO of
Champion Women,
which provides legal advocacy
for girls and

11:23.383 --> 11:25.018 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
women in sports.

11:25.051 --> 11:30.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the record, we invited USA
Gymnastics
to appear, but no one was
available.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we want to thank both of you
for joining
us.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marisa Kwiatkowski, to you
first.

11:34.994 --> 11:38.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Help our audience to understand
the role that
USA Gymnastics plays.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is it to the sport of
gymnastics?

11:40.833 --> 11:45.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARISA KWIATKOWSKI, Indianapolis
Star: USA
Gymnastics is the sport's
national governing

11:45.672 --> 11:51.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
body, so they set the rules and
policies that
govern the sport of gymnastics
in the United

11:51.344 --> 11:53.146 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

11:53.179 --> 11:56.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also are the ones who
select the Olympic
team, the team that will
represent the United

11:56.816 --> 11:58.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
States in the Olympics.

11:58.751 --> 12:04.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, the report
today suggested
something like 50 coaches may
have been involved

12:04.891 --> 12:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over a period of how many years?

12:07.293 --> 12:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARISA KWIATKOWSKI: We know that
USA Gymnastics
compiled sexual misconduct
complaint files

12:12.966 --> 12:17.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on at least 54 coaches between
1966 and 2006.

12:17.837 --> 12:24.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so we're
talking about
something that allegedly went on
for a long

12:24.143 --> 12:25.979 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

12:26.012 --> 12:30.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARISA KWIATKOWSKI: Well, the
issue of sexual
misconduct has been a problem in
all different

12:30.650 --> 12:34.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of sports, all different
disciplines
over a long time.

12:34.454 --> 12:40.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Marisa
Kwiatkowski, as
we just heard, USA Gymnastics is
saying, "We

12:41.027 --> 12:47.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
feel The Star left out
significant facts that
would have painted a more
accurate picture."

12:47.100 --> 12:48.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you think they're
referring to?

12:49.002 --> 12:52.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARISA KWIATKOWSKI: I'm not sure
what they're
referring to.

12:52.071 --> 12:57.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can tell you that we feel that
we were extremely
fair to the information that
they provided.

12:57.176 --> 13:02.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, on our Web site,
IndyStar.com, we
do have all of the questions
that we asked

13:02.515 --> 13:07.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them, along with all of their
responses, so
the public can see for
themselves specifically

13:07.120 --> 13:09.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what we asked and what they
responded.

13:09.088 --> 13:14.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have also posted their
statement that you're
referring to in its entirety on
our Web site.

13:14.327 --> 13:21.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what is their
best explanation
for why these files sat there
and why people

13:21.100 --> 13:26.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- parents weren't notified, why
this wasn't
more public, why something
wasn't done sooner?

13:26.706 --> 13:31.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARISA KWIATKOWSKI: Well, we
don't know at
this time what's in those files
because they

13:31.310 --> 13:35.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are sealed by the judge in the
criminal case.

13:35.448 --> 13:38.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And USA Gymnastics has declined
to release
them to us.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They cited the privacy of those
involved.

13:41.521 --> 13:47.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we do know that those
involved allegations
of sexual misconduct against
coaches.

13:47.293 --> 13:52.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't know whether or not
those were investigated
by USA Gymnastics or whether
they were reported

13:52.598 --> 13:54.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to authorities.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And do you have
any sense of
what happens next after -- now
that this report

13:57.070 --> 13:58.805 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is public?

13:58.838 --> 14:02.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARISA KWIATKOWSKI: Well, we
have a number
of articles that we're
continuing to work

14:02.141 --> 14:06.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on, on this topic that will be
coming out
through Indy Star and USA Today
Network in

14:06.779 --> 14:07.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the future.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, specifically, there's a
lawsuit.

14:09.882 --> 14:15.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The lawsuit is ongoing, so the
judge will
at some point rule both on our
motion to intervene

14:15.254 --> 14:19.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get access to those documents
and also
to the plaintiff's case.

14:19.892 --> 14:23.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me turn now
to Nancy Hogshead-Makar.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What was your reaction when you
first saw
this story?

14:26.733 --> 14:30.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY HOGSHEAD-MAKAR, Champion
Women: Well,
I was aware of this rule.

14:30.503 --> 14:36.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I knew that United States
Swimming also has
a similar rule, which says that
it will only

14:36.609 --> 14:40.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
review complaints that are filed
by either
victims or parents of victims.

14:41.013 --> 14:46.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that rule is not required by
the SPORTS
Act or by any sports law.

14:46.886 --> 14:52.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's just -- it's sort of a
random rule,
but it works to keep national
governing bodies

14:52.725 --> 14:59.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from having to go and do these
investigations
or go and file reports with the
police and

14:59.165 --> 15:01.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other authorities.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Was there an
awareness -- staying
with you Nancy Hogshead-Makar,
was there an

15:04.837 --> 15:08.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
awareness that this might have
been going
on over time?

15:08.841 --> 15:13.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY HOGSHEAD-MAKAR: Well, the
issue of sexual
abuse in club and Olympic sports
is one that

15:13.880 --> 15:16.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have been working on for a
number of years.

15:16.616 --> 15:22.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you, as an employee, are
protected by
Title VII.

15:22.155 --> 15:27.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a student, they are protected
by Title
IX that requires that schools
investigate

15:27.426 --> 15:29.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and sanction those abusers or
sexual violence.

15:29.996 --> 15:33.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We got the president of the
United States
involved.

15:33.332 --> 15:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when it comes to club and
Olympic sports,
there is no civil rights
protection for them.

15:40.072 --> 15:45.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So these national governing
bodies, what they
will say in court that we don't
owe a legal

15:45.278 --> 15:50.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
duty to the kid who is harmed,
that the club
should handle it, that the
parent should handle

15:50.850 --> 15:55.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, that other people, but not
the national
governing bodies, should handle
it.

15:55.755 --> 16:01.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they -- so, consequently, you
get the rules
like the one they have which
says that, you

16:01.327 --> 16:05.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, unless the kid makes the
complaint,
they're not going to do
anything.

16:05.097 --> 16:11.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know that molesters are
very good at
getting molester -- or getting
kids to be

16:11.270 --> 16:12.939 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
quiet.

16:12.972 --> 16:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why when we find out
about molesters,
somebody like the Sandusky type,
you just

16:16.976 --> 16:19.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
find dozens, if not hundreds of
cases.

16:19.345 --> 16:26.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what is the
recourse, then,
for parents, for men or women
who may have

16:26.786 --> 16:34.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been involved in -- may have
been involved
in a case of molestation years
ago or currently?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What can they do?

16:36.362 --> 16:38.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY HOGSHEAD-MAKAR: Yes, there
is not the
same league protection.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's not -- I mean, right.

16:40.733 --> 16:44.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's consequently why
it's hard to
hear about it, why we don't hear
about a lot

16:44.670 --> 16:46.405 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it.

16:46.439 --> 16:51.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's usually people who
are deeply
in the sport that know best
about just how

16:51.577 --> 16:57.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bad it is and where the problems
are, things
like what The Indianapolis Star
revealed in

16:57.516 --> 16:59.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their investigation.

16:59.619 --> 17:04.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if a parent thinks that they
have a problem,
they should definitely report to
their national

17:04.357 --> 17:11.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
governing body, you know,
because we know
that both parents and victims,
they will do

17:11.163 --> 17:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an investigation, that they will
report to
the appropriate authorities.

17:14.333 --> 17:18.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But one of the
things that's
so disturbing is how young these
children

17:18.371 --> 17:19.338 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
were.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.339 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Seven years old?

17:20.373 --> 17:21.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NANCY HOGSHEAD-MAKAR:
Absolutely.

17:21.741 --> 17:22.708 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No, these are small children.

17:25.811 --> 17:30.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The easy part for governing
bodies to do is
the education piece.

17:30.349 --> 17:36.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The much harder part is getting
a coach out.

17:36.122 --> 17:41.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, listen, police have a
hard time
dealing with sexual abuse and
getting and

17:41.327 --> 17:44.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
convicting these people and
making sure that
they are in prison.

17:44.297 --> 17:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Any youth-serving organization
needs to have
very strong protections.

17:48.501 --> 17:53.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we want them to have is an
independent
duty to do these investigations
and get the

17:53.105 --> 17:55.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
molesters out of the
organization.

17:55.041 --> 18:00.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I know, for
one thing,
I'm sure everyone hopes that
this kind of

18:00.313 --> 18:06.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public reporting of this could
begin to make
some difference.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're going to leave it there.

18:08.154 --> 18:11.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marisa Kwiatkowski, Nancy
Hogshead-Makar,
we thank you both.

18:11.557 --> 18:13.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NANCY HOGSHEAD-MAKAR: Thank you
very much.

18:13.292 --> 18:15.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARISA KWIATKOWSKI: Thank you.

18:15.194 --> 18:19.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in other
Olympics news,
this evening, the International
Olympic Committee

18:19.598 --> 18:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
approved the entry of 271
Russian athletes
for the Rio games.

18:25.171 --> 18:29.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had faced questions as to
whether or
not Russian athletes would be
banned due to

18:29.342 --> 18:37.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
allegations of doping.

18:37.783 --> 18:49.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The chaos in Libya
after the fall
of Moammar Gadhafi created a
vacuum, filled

18:50.029 --> 18:52.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in part by the Islamic State.

18:52.198 --> 18:56.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now the United States is
stepping up pressure
on the group's stronghold there
with new attacks

18:56.702 --> 18:58.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
launched this week.

18:58.104 --> 19:01.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Foreign affairs correspondent
Margaret Warner
begins our coverage.

19:01.841 --> 19:06.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: President Obama
visited the
Pentagon today to confer with
his military

19:06.912 --> 19:10.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leadership about the battle
against the Islamic
State.

19:10.649 --> 19:15.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had this to say about the
newest U.S. military
front in that fight in Libya.

19:15.354 --> 19:18.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
At the request of Libya's
government of national

19:18.157 --> 19:22.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accord, we are conducting
strikes in support
of government-aligned forces as
they fight

19:22.461 --> 19:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to retake Sirte from ISIL, and
we will continue
to support the government's
efforts to secure

19:27.633 --> 19:29.368 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their country.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The meeting
came three days
after the U.S. launched a series
of air and

19:32.738 --> 19:38.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drone strikes against the
Islamic State's
Libyan stronghold, in and around
the town

19:38.110 --> 19:39.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Sirte.

19:39.979 --> 19:45.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. air campaign comes in
support of
a Libyan government-backed
coalition of brigades

19:45.051 --> 19:48.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and militias fighting ISIS on
the ground.

19:48.721 --> 19:54.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those forces have taken heavy
casualties trying
to clear the town block by
block, pushing

19:54.060 --> 19:56.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS fighters into the city
center.

19:56.495 --> 20:01.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Despite the obstacles
and difficulties we have faced,
such as land

20:01.801 --> 20:05.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mines, booby traps and snipers,
we have made
good progress forward.

20:05.438 --> 20:10.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But their slow
going prompted
the U.N. and Western-backed
Libyan government

20:10.242 --> 20:13.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Tripoli to request the U.S.
support.

20:13.946 --> 20:18.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Tripoli government isn't the
only one
claiming legitimate rule in the
country.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It has a competitor in the east.

20:20.920 --> 20:26.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Benghazi, renegade General
Khalifa Haftar
has been fighting Islamists and
other rival

20:26.058 --> 20:28.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
militias for supremacy there.

20:28.461 --> 20:31.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He rejects the Tripoli
government's claim
to power.

20:31.730 --> 20:36.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for now, the U.S. military
is focused
on the fight for Sirte, at the
heart of the

20:36.769 --> 20:43.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Islamic State's bid to make
Libya its most
important outpost outside of
Iraq and Syria.

20:44.009 --> 20:46.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

20:46.679 --> 20:51.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Joining me now for
more on this
is Frederic Wehrey of the
Carnegie Endowment

20:51.283 --> 20:52.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for International Peace.

20:53.018 --> 20:57.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's just returned from a
research trip to
the front lines of the battle
for Sirte.

20:57.723 --> 21:01.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He was embedded with
government-backed militias
as they battled Islamic State
fighters.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.062 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY, Carnegie
Endowment for International
Peace: Thank you.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: We heard the
president today boast
of success against ISIS, whether
it was in

21:06.665 --> 21:12.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syria or Iraq or Afghanistan,
and he also
scolded Russia's role.

21:12.404 --> 21:16.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Libya seems like it's a
whole more complicated
issue.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Absolutely.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, there's no government, or
it's split.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, there's many
governments.

21:22.081 --> 21:27.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the forces that are fighting
the Islamic
State are a coalition of
militias that are

21:27.086 --> 21:30.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very loosely affiliated to this
government
of national accord.

21:30.556 --> 21:35.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the United States' effort
is to really
use airpower to support that
offensive.

21:35.995 --> 21:39.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, beyond that, you have got
enormous challenges
of building the Libyan state.

21:39.865 --> 21:42.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How widespread is
the ISIS footprint
in Libya?

21:42.601 --> 21:47.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Right now, it's
concentrated
in this coastal city of Sirte.

21:47.106 --> 21:50.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I heard estimates of about 500
fighters.

21:50.075 --> 21:55.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also has a presence, a slight
presence,
in the West, a presence in
Benghazi.

21:55.714 --> 22:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But over the past year, we have
really seen
Libyan forces of their own
accord push back

22:00.486 --> 22:02.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
against the Islamic State.

22:02.354 --> 22:04.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We have heard the
president use
an interesting term today in his
remarks today.

22:04.623 --> 22:09.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He talked about the risk of this
becoming
global Whac-A-Mole.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that what Libya is?

22:11.864 --> 22:17.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Well,
certainly, this is
an affiliate that is powerful,
that was growing.

22:17.036 --> 22:21.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think the president of
the United
States and our Western allies
felt the need

22:21.941 --> 22:24.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to support local forces in this
battle.

22:24.677 --> 22:29.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Libya is strategically located
close to Africa,
close to Europe.

22:29.782 --> 22:34.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By some estimates, it is the
most powerful
affiliate outside of Syria and
Iraq.

22:34.286 --> 22:38.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tell us about Sirte
and tell us
about Misrata, two key areas
here.

22:38.824 --> 22:40.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Right.

22:40.092 --> 22:43.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, Sirte was Gadhafi's
hometown and base
of support.

22:43.896 --> 22:48.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The town really fell into
disrepair and disarray
after the revolution.

22:48.834 --> 22:52.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Islamic State was able
to exploit
that, exploit tribal grievances,
and come

22:52.972 --> 22:59.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in and set up a form of
governance there,
a very draconian form of
government.

22:59.411 --> 23:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Misrata is a town just down the
road to the
west that fields the most
powerful militias.

23:05.084 --> 23:10.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are providing most of
the fighters
that are launching that assault
on Sirte.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And that's who you
spent a lot
of time with, these fighters,
when you were

23:13.192 --> 23:14.994 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the ground.

23:15.027 --> 23:19.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what evidence did you see as
you traveled
on the front lines of the
presence of ISIS?

23:19.999 --> 23:24.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Well, you
certainly see ISIS
beyond the front lines.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

23:25.804 --> 23:29.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: They -- we went
into a bomb-making
factory, and you see ISIS
corpses.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ISIS is in the city.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Misratan forces are flying
drones.

23:33.345 --> 23:36.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are observing the ISIS
fighters.

23:36.348 --> 23:38.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So they are dug in.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have sniper in buildings.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They set up booby traps and
mines.

23:43.289 --> 23:46.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have a few artillery and
tank pieces
that the U.S. just hit.

23:46.992 --> 23:48.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So they're prepared for the long
haul.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the thing is, they don't
have anywhere
to go.

23:50.696 --> 23:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why they're fighting
so ferociously,
to the death.

23:53.699 --> 23:56.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You wrote that you
saw a structure
for crucifixions?

23:56.902 --> 24:04.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: This was a
roundabout on
the outskirts of Sirte that was
used for crucifixions

24:04.610 --> 24:08.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that had a metal scaffolding
that the Misratans,
when they went in, they
dismantled it.

24:08.714 --> 24:13.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a very powerful moment
when they took
this down, because that's where
the Islamic

24:13.852 --> 24:15.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
State held their public
executions.

24:15.788 --> 24:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How sophisticated
are the ISIS
fighters?

24:19.391 --> 24:24.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: They enjoy a
lot of support
from foreign fighters that seem
to have quite

24:24.997 --> 24:30.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of expertise in tactics
like mortars
and sniping and booby traps,
mines.

24:30.736 --> 24:37.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you talk to the Misratan
and GNA fighters,
they're suffering a lot from
mines.

24:37.409 --> 24:42.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are reports of some
defections from
Libyan fighters because they see
the noose

24:42.314 --> 24:43.282 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tightening.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they're in it for the long
haul.

24:45.217 --> 24:49.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And yet, as you
started off pointing
out, and we always come back
around to this

24:49.254 --> 24:54.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every place that the U.S. is
engaged in, which
is internal politics on the
ground affect

24:54.159 --> 24:55.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what the future will be.

24:55.527 --> 24:57.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Absolutely.

24:57.429 --> 25:02.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Libya, the government, even
if ISIS is
ousted from Sirte, there are
enormous challenges

25:02.735 --> 25:04.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for rebuilding this country.

25:04.570 --> 25:08.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we heard, there is the
faction in the east
under General Khalifa Haftar
that rejects

25:08.173 --> 25:11.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this government in Tripoli.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's the question of oil
revenues.

25:13.045 --> 25:15.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This government in Tripoli is so
fragile.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it hasn't been able to exert
its authority.

25:17.883 --> 25:22.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think one purpose
behind the U.S.
strikes was to help this
government, to show

25:22.054 --> 25:26.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government that the U.S. has
your back,
we're helping you in this
campaign.

25:26.358 --> 25:29.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: With the
understanding that the
U.S. will be done once ISIS is
done?

25:29.328 --> 25:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: Well, I think
U.S. and the
other allies want to help this
government

25:33.799 --> 25:37.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rebuild its army, get the
economy back on
track.

25:37.503 --> 25:39.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Europeans have a huge role
to play here.

25:39.938 --> 25:44.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we heard the president
acknowledge
that we really dropped the ball
in the year

25:44.410 --> 25:47.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after Gadhafi fell, so there's
tremendous
work to be done.

25:47.679 --> 25:51.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Frederic Wehrey of
the Carnegie
Endowment for International
Peace, thank you.

25:51.583 --> 25:52.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FREDERIC WEHREY: My pleasure.

25:52.584 --> 25:56.522 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

25:56.555 --> 26:05.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

26:05.764 --> 26:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": why
the U.S.
sent Iran $400 million the same
day four hostages

26:12.738 --> 26:19.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were released; what one man's
very public
job search teaches us about
being unemployed;

26:19.411 --> 26:23.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Alec Baldwin explains why he
was born
to be a radio host.

26:23.749 --> 26:29.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, first: the
last hurrah
in a once thriving Jewish
community in one

26:29.388 --> 26:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the diaspora's farthest-flung
places.

26:32.491 --> 26:34.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fred de Sam Lazaro takes us to
India.

26:34.259 --> 26:38.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A version of this story aired on
"Religion
&amp; Ethics Newsweekly."

26:38.363 --> 26:45.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In its
nearly 900-year
history, this synagogue had
never seen an

26:45.571 --> 26:50.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
observance like this one.

26:50.309 --> 26:56.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They came from four continents
to this unlikely
location, the coastal Indian
city of Cochin,

26:56.048 --> 27:01.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the first Sabbath service in
decades -- and
possibly the last one ever.

27:01.153 --> 27:06.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A once thriving Jewish community
of several
thousand has mostly faded into a
bittersweet

27:06.391 --> 27:10.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
history in the age of modern-day
Israel, said
Yeshoshua Sivan, a British-born
Israeli.

27:10.896 --> 27:17.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YESHOSHUA SIVAN, British-born
Israeli: I'm
very sad to see communities
disappear.

27:17.135 --> 27:23.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, I'm very
happy to see that
after all these years of
dispersion the prophecy

27:23.709 --> 27:32.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the return to the land of
Israel is in
my time being -- I'm part of it
-- is being

27:32.284 --> 27:33.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
realized.

27:33.986 --> 27:37.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least we see the synagogues,
we see the
streets, we see how life was
once here.

27:37.456 --> 27:41.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Jewish life
along India's
Malabar Coast dates back to the
ancient spice

27:41.994 --> 27:45.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trade that drew explorers from
across the
sea.

27:45.564 --> 27:50.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They come now as tourists, but
they came in
ancient times to trade, and, in
the case of

27:50.235 --> 27:56.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some Jews, to settle -- from
Yemen, Mesopotamia,
and later a few from Spain and
Portugal after

27:56.341 --> 27:59.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Inquisition.

27:59.244 --> 28:04.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Away from tourist enclaves,
there's a struggle
to preserve what remains of the
Jewish heritage

28:04.716 --> 28:06.485 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

28:06.518 --> 28:10.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm standing in what was the
women's section
of a synagogue in Mala, about
four or five

28:10.355 --> 28:12.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
miles in from the coastline.

28:12.190 --> 28:17.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a thriving Jewish
community here
until 1955, when they decided,
all of them,

28:17.663 --> 28:20.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
en masse, to emigrate to Israel.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they turned this building
over to local
municipal authorities.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PROFESSOR C. KARMACHANDRAN,
India: They were
very good friends.

28:26.371 --> 28:27.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They were very good neighbors.

28:27.606 --> 28:29.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They were very good traders.

28:29.474 --> 28:33.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Some left
for religious
fulfillment in the new Jewish
homeland, says

28:33.412 --> 28:39.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
retired Professor C.
Karmachandran, who heads
a local historic preservation
committee.

28:39.284 --> 28:45.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Others thought Israel had better
economic
prospects, he adds, but none
left in fear.

28:45.157 --> 28:48.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Scholars agree that there's
little history
of anti Semitism in India.

28:48.760 --> 28:53.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PROFESSOR C. KARMACHANDRAN: They
were given
all the protection by the rulers
as well as

28:53.699 --> 29:00.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the local people to maintain
their culture,
their religion, their belief and
their practices,

29:00.205 --> 29:08.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and this in fact is the living
symbol of that
particular lofty tradition.

29:08.213 --> 29:13.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But even
lofty traditions
come under development pressure
or suffer

29:13.051 --> 29:15.220 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
neglect.

29:15.253 --> 29:20.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Already half the old Jewish
cemetery has been
appropriated for a stadium,
Karmachandran

29:20.392 --> 29:21.593 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
complains.

29:21.627 --> 29:25.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rest is overgrown with
weeds, where livestock
graze.

29:25.163 --> 29:30.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Fading memories breed
indifference, he says,
but in a time of growing
religious tensions

29:30.068 --> 29:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in India, it's critical to
preserve the heritage
here.

29:33.338 --> 29:36.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PROFESSOR C. KARMACHANDRAN: To
keep it up
for posterity.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: For
posterity.

29:38.076 --> 29:40.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PROFESSOR C. KARMACHANDRAN: This
is a lesson
of tolerance.

29:40.812 --> 29:47.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Sixty-year-old Elias Josephai
was made caretaker of the
synagogue in Cochin.

29:48.020 --> 29:52.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's one of the last remaining
members of
a community that numbers no more
than a handful

29:52.924 --> 29:53.892 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

29:53.925 --> 29:56.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is where school children
sat?

29:56.561 --> 30:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the space where children once
studied on
the Shabbat, he runs a nursery
and aquarium

30:01.166 --> 30:02.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supply business.

30:02.801 --> 30:08.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The synagogue proper served as a
dusty warehouse
when I first visited Josephai.

30:08.206 --> 30:09.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the scrolls from here are?

30:09.641 --> 30:11.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIAS JOSEPHAI, India: In
Israel.

30:11.343 --> 30:15.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Its sacred
scrolls were
donated years ago to a museum in
Israel.

30:15.681 --> 30:20.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lacking the minyan or quorum of
10 men required
for a Shabbat service, there
hadn't been one

30:20.919 --> 30:22.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
since 1972.

30:22.054 --> 30:24.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIAS JOSEPHAI: I cry every
Shabbat, every
holiday.

30:24.956 --> 30:27.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I cry in my heart.

30:27.459 --> 30:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: About a year
ago, Josephai
shared that lament with some
Israeli tourists

30:35.000 --> 30:36.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who stopped by.

30:36.735 --> 30:38.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARI GREENSPAN, Tourist: And when
he told us
that they hadn't prayed in that
synagogue

30:39.004 --> 30:44.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since 1972, I said to myself,
I've got to
come back with a group, with a
quorum of 10

30:44.609 --> 30:46.478 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
men.

30:46.511 --> 30:50.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Brooklyn
native Ari Greenspan,
a dentist and amateur chef now
in Israel,

30:50.849 --> 30:56.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did indeed organize a return
tour of India's
Jewish communities, complete
with a kosher

30:56.555 --> 30:58.323 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
menu.

30:58.356 --> 31:02.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARI GREENSPAN: So here we have a
traditional
Jewish cook and a traditional
Indian cook,

31:02.661 --> 31:09.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ravi, who's been traveling with
us all week,
making sure that we have both
strictly kosher

31:09.534 --> 31:14.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and amazingly tasty kosher
Indian food.

31:14.372 --> 31:19.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: As they
prepared the Shabbat
meal, some of the 35 visitors
took time for

31:19.678 --> 31:21.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pre-Shabbat prayers.

31:21.980 --> 31:28.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
Most came here under the
auspices of the
U.S.-and-Israel-based
Orthodox Union, which encourages
Jewish heritage

31:28.587 --> 31:30.489 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tours.

31:30.522 --> 31:33.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL WIMPFHEIMER, Tourist:
It's still wonderful
to go into a building which
hasn't been used

31:33.258 --> 31:35.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a very long time.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least you're able to have it
function again
for the purpose a synagogue was
meant, namely

31:37.529 --> 31:38.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to hold a prayer service.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's kind of a revitalization,
even for a
short time.

31:41.500 --> 31:47.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: For
Josephai, it was a
dream 44 years in the making, as
the visitors

31:47.939 --> 31:50.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
entered a sanctuary that had
been spiffed
up.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They heaped praise on their
host.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARI GREENSPAN: You're sort of on
the cusp.

31:54.179 --> 31:59.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the last guy here, and when
he goes -- he
should live to be 120 years old,
right, but,

31:59.251 --> 32:01.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when he goes, that's it.

32:01.186 --> 32:03.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Two thousand years of Cochin is
gone.

32:03.088 --> 32:08.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Josephai
actually plans
to be gone in four years,
retiring and settling,

32:08.326 --> 32:10.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like all the rest, in Israel.

32:10.729 --> 32:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not an easy decision,
leaving a land
he holds dear and a place so
influential in

32:15.734 --> 32:17.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
forming who he is.

32:17.569 --> 32:21.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIAS JOSEPHAI: I will keep my
heart over
here and then go.

32:21.506 --> 32:25.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Always, I love India, but it is
inevitable.

One day, today or tomorrow, I
have to leave
the country, not because of the
discrimination,

32:34.452 --> 32:39.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but, as a Jew, to live, to be as
a Jew.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Elias

be that last Jew, the one who'll
turn out

JUDY WOODRUFF: Fred's reporting
is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories

GWEN IFILL: The Iran nuclear
deal has been
a major issue in this year's
presidential

33:21.933 --> 33:23.735 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

33:23.768 --> 33:28.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Detractors blame Hillary Clinton
and the Obama
administration for caving to
Iranian demands,

33:28.440 --> 33:30.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
while receiving little in
return.

33:30.609 --> 33:35.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now revelations about U.S.
payments to the
Iranian government add a new
wrinkle to those

33:35.914 --> 33:36.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
critiques.

33:36.982 --> 33:38.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has more.

33:38.884 --> 33:42.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This week, The
Wall Street
Journal broke news that the
Obama administration

33:42.687 --> 33:47.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
secretly airlifted $400 million
in cash to
Iran.

33:47.292 --> 33:51.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The money was owed as part of a
failed arms
deal prior to the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.

33:51.863 --> 33:57.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the payment coincided within
the release
of four Americans imprisoned in
Tehran, raising

33:57.302 --> 33:59.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
questions about cash for
prisoners.

34:00.005 --> 34:03.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump criticized the move
today at
his rally in Portland, Maine.

34:03.375 --> 34:07.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Four hundred million in cash.

34:07.112 --> 34:09.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's being flown in an airplane
to Iran.

34:09.948 --> 34:12.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wonder where that money really
goes, by
the way.

34:12.183 --> 34:13.151 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

34:13.184 --> 34:14.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I wonder where it really goes.

34:14.853 --> 34:21.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, it went to either in their
pockets,
which I actually think more so,
or toward

34:21.092 --> 34:23.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
terrorism, probably a
combination of both.

34:23.762 --> 34:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Late this
afternoon, President
Obama pushed back and defended
the U.S. decision

34:28.767 --> 34:30.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to send the cash to Iran.

34:30.368 --> 34:32.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He spoke at the Pentagon.

34:32.237 --> 34:37.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
We announced these payments in
January, many

34:37.676 --> 34:38.643 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
months ago.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It wasn't a secret.

34:41.046 --> 34:44.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We announced them to all of you.

34:44.549 --> 34:52.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran had pressed a claim before
an international
tribunal about them recovering
money of theirs

34:52.457 --> 34:58.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we had frozen that, as a
consequence
of its working its way through
the international

34:58.396 --> 35:03.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tribunal, it was the assessment
of our lawyers
that we were now at a point
where there was

35:03.868 --> 35:10.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
significant litigation risk, and
we could
end up costing ourselves
billions of dollars.

35:10.775 --> 35:14.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It was their advice and
suggestion that we
settle.

35:14.646 --> 35:18.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For more on
this, I'm joined
by the reporter who broke the
story, The Wall

35:18.383 --> 35:20.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Street Journal's Jay Solomon.

35:20.185 --> 35:24.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also the author of the
forthcoming book
"The Iran Wars: Spy Games, Bank
Battles and

35:24.656 --> 35:26.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Secret Deals That Reshaped
the Middle
East."

35:26.925 --> 35:28.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jay, thanks for joining us.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not every day that the
secretary of state
and then the president come out
and sort of

35:31.196 --> 35:33.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
challenge the newsiness of your
story.

35:33.698 --> 35:37.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At one point, the president
called this part
of manufactured outrage.

35:37.635 --> 35:42.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess the central question
here is, was
this part of this pre-negotiated
payment for

35:42.674 --> 35:44.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the arms deal in the late '70s?

35:44.976 --> 35:49.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What has your reporting shown
that this might
have been something closer to a
ransom payment?

35:49.247 --> 35:51.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY SOLOMON, The Wall Street
Journal: The
difficult part of this story
from the very

35:51.649 --> 35:57.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
beginning was, the
administration did announce
back in January this $1.7
billion payment.

35:57.555 --> 36:03.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as far as the specifics, the
mechanics,
they have refused to answer,
like, when did

36:03.228 --> 36:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the money arrive, how was it
spent, was it
sent in cash, until, through our
reporting,

36:08.933 --> 36:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we found out that actually this
money was
sent in pallets of cash on a
plane secretly.

36:15.440 --> 36:21.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to this day, we're still
trying to figure
out the timing, when did this
money arrive,

36:21.079 --> 36:27.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and through this reporting,
there is indications
that it was secret, that
basically these Americans

36:27.452 --> 36:31.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weren't going to be released
until that money
arrived.

36:31.289 --> 36:33.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So then it becomes a question
really of timing.

36:33.525 --> 36:38.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, which
leads you to believe
that there was a quid pro quo,
that the prisoners

36:38.463 --> 36:40.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wouldn't be released until the
cash was in
hand?

36:40.832 --> 36:43.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAY SOLOMON: That is part of
what we're seeing.

36:43.768 --> 36:46.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is hard, because various
elements are true.

36:46.171 --> 36:54.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House says this was a
decades-old
dispute over financing over this
arms deal.

36:54.312 --> 36:56.081 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That is true.

36:56.114 --> 36:59.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of different
disputes that
have been -- that are continuing
between Iran

36:59.417 --> 37:01.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the U.S. on the financial
side.

37:01.719 --> 37:07.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the particulars of how this
was paid and
when the money got there is
still -- they

37:07.859 --> 37:09.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
refuse to answer those
questions.

37:09.828 --> 37:14.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they could easily resolve
this by just
saying, yes, the money arrived
then, it was

37:14.833 --> 37:16.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
paid in cash, and there was no
problem.

37:16.768 --> 37:20.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you watched the State
Department transcript
today, they were repeatedly
asked and they

37:20.472 --> 37:22.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would just not answer that
question.

37:22.373 --> 37:26.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The president
seemed to
say that it was cash partly
because our sanctions

37:26.444 --> 37:31.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against Iran were working so
well and that
we don't have a banking
relationship with

37:31.149 --> 37:32.584 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

37:32.617 --> 37:34.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he said sort of, well,
because we
couldn't write them a check.

37:34.119 --> 37:36.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY SOLOMON: I think that is --
there is probably
truth to that as well.

37:36.721 --> 37:38.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there are a lot of
possible truths
to this.

37:39.023 --> 37:42.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Was it had to go in cash because
there was
no other way to get there?

37:42.961 --> 37:44.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can believe that.

37:44.762 --> 37:48.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Was it also the situation where
the Iranian
side wouldn't give up these
Americans until

37:49.000 --> 37:50.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they got that money?

37:50.101 --> 37:52.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I could see that.

37:52.036 --> 37:57.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Iranians -- some of the
generals themselves
had publicly said that this was
-- they would

37:57.475 --> 38:00.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only release the spies, as they
called them,
once the money arrived.

38:00.712 --> 38:04.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And there's
also recent
reporting in The Wall Street
Journal this

38:04.149 --> 38:08.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
morning about the tension
between the Department
of Justice and the State
Department in doing

38:08.052 --> 38:09.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this at all.

38:09.821 --> 38:12.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY SOLOMON: And the Department
of Justice
is interesting, because there
seemed to be

38:12.290 --> 38:16.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consensus within the government
that this
was -- the amount of money was
actually a

38:16.661 --> 38:20.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
good deal, that this was a
37-year dispute.

38:20.365 --> 38:25.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The initial payment was -- kind
of the principal
was $400 million, and just
paying an additional

38:26.004 --> 38:29.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$1.3 billion in interest wasn't
a bad deal
for the United States.

38:29.807 --> 38:35.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there was a concern about
the optics and
how the Iranian side would spin
it, that they

38:35.880 --> 38:41.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were going to basically take the
timing of
and the arrival of cash as a
sign that this

38:41.186 --> 38:47.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was ransom or quid pro quo and
that they would
use this possibly in future
cases.

38:47.525 --> 38:52.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what a lot of people
in the U.S.
government are concerned of, in
the last six

38:52.730 --> 38:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months, there have been -- last
year, there
have been three more
Iranian-Americans taken

38:56.401 --> 38:58.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
prisoner.

38:58.236 --> 39:05.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are another three European
and Canadian
Iranian nationals who have been
taken prisoner

39:05.743 --> 39:07.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the last, I think, three
months.

39:07.645 --> 39:09.414 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So it's a cycle.

39:09.447 --> 39:12.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you look back on the
history of the
United States-Iranian relations
going back

39:12.417 --> 39:16.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the revolution, you see this
cycle, you
know, that the American
diplomats who were

39:16.754 --> 39:23.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taken hostage, the resolution
for that was
partly the unfreezing of assets
in the United

39:23.328 --> 39:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States that were the shah's
money.

39:25.096 --> 39:31.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The three hikers who were taken
prisoner in
2009, their release was also
tied to both

39:31.769 --> 39:34.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a prisoner exchange and cash
being paid..

39:34.405 --> 39:36.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it's not like this is a
one-off.

39:36.574 --> 39:38.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you take a step back, it's a
longer cycle.

39:38.743 --> 39:42.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Jay
Solomon of
The Wall Street Journal, thanks
for joining

39:42.981 --> 39:45.917 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
us tonight.

39:45.950 --> 39:51.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAY SOLOMON: Thank you.

39:51.923 --> 39:59.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This week, a
former news reporter
and professor, Sree Sreenivasan,
was named

39:59.364 --> 40:02.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chief digital officer for New
York City.

40:02.400 --> 40:08.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the culmination of a very
public job
search Srinivasan embarked on
just last month.

40:08.106 --> 40:12.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Roben
Farzad looks at
what Sreenivasan's experience
could teach

40:12.510 --> 40:14.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the rest of us.

40:14.178 --> 40:18.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of our series Making
Sense, which
airs Thursdays on the
"NewsHour."

40:18.082 --> 40:24.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: At 7:00 a.m. in
New York's Riverside
Park, Digital Guru Sree
Sreenivasan was walking

40:24.522 --> 40:26.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his beagle mix, Tara.

40:26.124 --> 40:29.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this was also an early
morning networking
session.

40:29.227 --> 40:32.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's one thing you have
learned from the
other places you're able to
apply here?

40:32.630 --> 40:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN, Job Seeker: I
think finding
your key influencers and your
largest audience.

40:36.634 --> 40:41.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Four days earlier,
Sreenivasan
lost his job as chief digital
officer at New

40:41.239 --> 40:43.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
York's financially strained
Metropolitan Museum
of Art.

40:43.708 --> 40:47.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: After three
amazing years,
I will be leaving The Met on
June 30.

40:47.078 --> 40:51.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: It was a career
low point that
his network knew all about
because he himself

40:51.449 --> 40:53.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
broadcast the news on social
media.

40:53.651 --> 40:58.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"If you want to invite me to
anything," he
wrote, "I now have time,
including for meaningful

40:58.389 --> 40:59.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cups of coffee and drinks.

40:59.791 --> 41:02.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would also love to go walking
with anyone
available."

41:02.794 --> 41:06.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: And I gave
people this form,
which might have been the
funniest thing,

41:06.431 --> 41:10.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where people could go in and
give me suggestions
on what to do.

41:10.435 --> 41:12.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Over 1,000 people
sent advice.

41:12.570 --> 41:14.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: Visit with our
camera club.

41:14.605 --> 41:15.807 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Go fishing.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.308 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Rescue Twitter.

41:17.342 --> 41:18.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Start a social media consulting
firm.

41:18.910 --> 41:21.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Vacation first,
then host your
own TV show.

41:21.112 --> 41:24.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: All the good
TV shows are
taken, so there's no chance.

41:24.949 --> 41:29.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: His Facebook post
got almost
500 comments, including some job
offers.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sreenivasan turned them down.

41:31.356 --> 41:34.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: People may not
always know
what's the right thing, but they
want to help.

41:34.459 --> 41:36.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Sreenivasan is
prolific online.

41:36.994 --> 41:40.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He taught social media at
Columbia Journalism
School for years.

41:40.365 --> 41:45.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while radical transparency
is all the
rage these days, even he was
reluctant to

41:45.303 --> 41:46.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
take his plight public.

41:46.471 --> 41:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: Oh, I didn't
want to do
this.

41:48.272 --> 41:56.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had no interest in talking
about myself
in a moment of weakness, as it
is right now.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My goal was to get a job.

41:58.349 --> 42:03.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Tell us about the
most memorable
or audacious overtures people
have made to

42:03.054 --> 42:04.856 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

42:04.889 --> 42:08.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: I have been
really touched
by the folks who have said,
including one

42:08.259 --> 42:14.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of my friends who said, I can't
hire you full-time,
but I have a single day of
consulting money,

42:14.832 --> 42:17.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and will you come speak to us on
July 21?

42:17.402 --> 42:19.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it was so meaningful.

42:19.437 --> 42:24.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I had someone drop off a
pair of Nike
shoes because they heard that I
want to go

42:24.642 --> 42:25.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on a walk.

42:25.643 --> 42:27.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Someone even sent
money.

42:27.445 --> 42:31.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: "Sree, I am
sending this
check in case you run out of
rice, noodles,

42:31.682 --> 42:32.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lentils or dollars."

42:32.917 --> 42:34.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, who does that?

42:34.352 --> 42:36.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is such a generous gesture.

42:36.254 --> 42:41.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: At home with his
wife, Roopa,
a consultant, and their family,
Sreenivasan

42:41.692 --> 42:43.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was trying to capitalize on that
good will.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: Former chief
digital officer
of The Met.

42:45.563 --> 42:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Working the phone.

42:46.564 --> 42:47.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREE SREENIVASAN: Sorry.

42:47.565 --> 42:48.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for holding.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm just checking my calendar.

42:50.067 --> 42:51.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Lunch with a
former colleague
at Columbia Journalism School.

42:51.602 --> 42:54.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: What is your
advice for
people when they stumble?

42:54.639 --> 42:57.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: It happens to all of us.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People use it as an opportunity
to grow.s

42:59.644 --> 43:02.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: And miles of
walking and talking.

43:02.213 --> 43:06.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: I have to take
every phone
call, every lunch, every coffee
that I can

43:06.884 --> 43:11.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take and my days are booked from
7:15 in the
morning until late at night.

43:11.556 --> 43:14.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ROBEN FARZAD: So he was
connecting with as
many people as possible.

43:14.192 --> 43:18.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: Do you feel
like people
are surprised to know that a New
Yorker cartoonist

43:18.863 --> 43:20.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
needs to reinvent herself?

43:20.631 --> 43:24.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: A walk with
cartoonist Liza
Donnelly became an impromptu
Facebook Live

43:24.969 --> 43:25.937 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
session.

43:25.970 --> 43:26.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: Hi, everybody.

43:26.971 --> 43:28.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: With an audience
of over 2,000.

43:28.806 --> 43:31.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: Folks, just
tell us where
you're watching from, and hit
share right

43:31.843 --> 43:36.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
now on Facebook, so your
friends, family,
enemies can join us.

43:36.581 --> 43:37.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: The theme of the
day?

43:37.782 --> 43:39.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Reinvention.

43:39.684 --> 43:43.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: Lauren says,
"How does one
reinvent themselves while
working in the same

43:43.087 --> 43:44.555 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
craft?"

43:44.589 --> 43:47.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIZA DONNELLY, Cartoonist: I try
to push my
limits and use different tools.

43:47.725 --> 43:50.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, these are subway
drawings that I
did on my phone.

43:50.862 --> 43:52.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a little boy looking out
the window.

43:52.930 --> 43:54.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I sit there with my finger and
draw.

43:54.932 --> 44:00.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: I think
reinvention, and
you're an example of this, is
that it's reinventing

44:00.805 --> 44:06.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not who you are, but how you do
your work,
your processes, getting the word
out.

44:06.611 --> 44:09.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to do this when you
don't need to
do it.

44:09.280 --> 44:14.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBEN FARZAD: Granted,
Sreenivasan is a high-profile,
highly networked figure, such a
mainstay on

44:14.252 --> 44:19.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twitter that he even gave his
job search a
hashtag, #sree3oh.

44:19.657 --> 44:23.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what about the vast majority
of jobless
who lack Sreenivasan's resources
and know-how?

44:23.361 --> 44:27.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATRINA SEALS RUIZ, Job Seeker:
I just want
to find the right position for
me.

44:27.064 --> 44:30.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Katrina Seals Ruiz
recently
learned her event management
position would

44:30.701 --> 44:32.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be cut in a bank merger.

44:32.537 --> 44:38.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you in a position to do what
Sree is doing,
in that opening it up really,
truly to the

44:38.409 --> 44:40.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
world, leaving nothing a secret?

44:40.645 --> 44:43.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATRINA SEALS RUIZ: I would
never think to
post on Facebook.

44:43.047 --> 44:47.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He already has that relationship
with the
social media space.

44:47.084 --> 44:49.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think I have that
relationship
yet.

44:49.520 --> 44:52.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm still kind of dabbling in
it.

44:52.223 --> 44:57.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: So her news would
reach just
250 friends on Facebook,
compared to Sreenivasan's

44:57.295 --> 44:59.597 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
5,000.

44:59.630 --> 45:00.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's new to Twitter.

45:00.932 --> 45:04.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her dozen or so followers are
dwarfed by Sreenivasan's
80,000.

45:04.468 --> 45:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Have you had any unsolicited job
offers yet?

45:07.972 --> 45:10.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KATRINA SEALS RUIZ: No.

45:10.241 --> 45:11.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No unsolicited job offers.

45:11.475 --> 45:13.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would welcome that greatly.

45:13.377 --> 45:17.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: But Seals Ruiz is
working the
connections she has, even
contacting professionals

45:17.949 --> 45:19.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
she doesn't know on LinkedIn.

45:19.817 --> 45:25.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATRINA SEALS RUIZ: I have no
problem using
LinkedIn as an InMail reaching
out to folks.

45:25.056 --> 45:28.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, when I started this
job search,
I reached out to one of those
people that

45:28.759 --> 45:32.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had InMailed, and she happened
to say -- "Katrina,"
she said, "you're not going to
believe this,

45:32.964 --> 45:33.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but I just mentioned your name."

45:34.031 --> 45:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I hadn't spoken to her in
months.

45:35.666 --> 45:38.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She didn't have a job for me,
but we just
had a great conversation.

45:38.336 --> 45:40.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ROBEN FARZAD: And like
Sreenivasan, she's
taking every appointment.

45:40.871 --> 45:43.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATRINA SEALS RUIZ: It's great
to sit down
with you now.

45:43.140 --> 45:45.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wish it was under different
circumstances.

45:45.109 --> 45:48.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Laura Kottkamp
directs corporate
relations at Virginia
Commonwealth University's

45:48.746 --> 45:51.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Business School, near Katrina's
home base
in Richmond.

45:51.315 --> 45:54.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LAURA KOTTKAMP, Virginia
Commonwealth University
Business School: You could look
at the same

45:54.218 --> 45:55.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
industry, which would be talking
to other
banks.

45:55.987 --> 46:00.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then I would recommend that we
put you in
touch with some people that are
in, say, an

46:00.458 --> 46:02.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I.T. company.

46:02.226 --> 46:04.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATRINA SEALS RUIZ: I really --
it think you
have had some really great
suggestions and

46:04.462 --> 46:07.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recommendations that I will
definitely utilize.

46:07.531 --> 46:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAURA KOTTKAMP: It's tiring, I
think.

46:09.934 --> 46:11.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KATRINA SEALS RUIZ: It's
exhausting.

46:11.869 --> 46:17.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's discouraging, too, I mean,
because you
know I feel like I'm a big deal.

46:17.608 --> 46:18.576 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:18.609 --> 46:21.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAURA KOTTKAMP: We think that
too.

46:21.912 --> 46:23.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATRINA SEALS RUIZ: And, you
know, so I'm
like, how come they don't see
that?

46:23.381 --> 46:24.749 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:24.782 --> 46:32.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Seals Ruiz is
working hard to
get her name out there.

46:32.990 --> 46:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the meantime, she's drawing
on another
talent, performing at private
events.

46:37.061 --> 46:40.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATRINA SEALS RUIZ: The next
several months,
it might be what I rely on, just
depending

46:40.498 --> 46:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on how things work out with my
job search.

46:42.466 --> 46:46.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: She travels to New
York regularly
for gigs.

46:46.070 --> 46:48.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So we hooked her up with
Sreenivasan, who
was walking with a friend.

46:49.006 --> 46:51.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: People want to
help you.

46:51.075 --> 46:52.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And your friends want to help
you.

46:52.877 --> 46:57.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But 99 percent of the time, they
have no idea
what you actually do and what
you can do.

46:57.481 --> 47:00.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have had very good friends
say, well, what
can you actually do?

47:00.317 --> 47:06.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, making something simple that
can be forwarded
to somebody, very useful, very
important.

47:06.090 --> 47:09.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Back at home,
Sreenivasan hoped
more people could learn from his
experience.

47:09.727 --> 47:13.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREE SREENIVASAN: If you are
working right
now, don't be complacent.

47:13.898 --> 47:18.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Make sure that you use this
opportunity to
build out your network, to
continue to build

47:18.969 --> 47:25.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the digital skills that are
relevant to your
industry, your kind of work now,
because one

47:25.076 --> 47:28.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the things we have learned is
that jobs
come and go.

47:28.479 --> 47:30.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you have -- but your network
never leaves.

47:30.948 --> 47:34.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I tell people that it's too late
to figure
out Twitter when the plane has
just landed

47:34.618 --> 47:36.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the Hudson.

47:36.253 --> 47:39.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's too late to figure out
LinkedIn when
your company starts having
layoffs.

47:39.156 --> 47:40.124 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, I should.

47:40.157 --> 47:41.826 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

47:41.859 --> 47:46.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Sree, for his
part, starts his
new job with New York City this
fall.

47:46.197 --> 47:47.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Katrina is still looking.

47:47.264 --> 47:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But she refuses to sing the
blues.

47:49.567 --> 47:52.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Hit her up on Twitter or
LinkedIn if you know
of something.

47:52.937 --> 48:01.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" I'm Roben
Farzad in
New York.

48:01.112 --> 48:15.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Next, to another in
our Brief
But Spectacular series, where
interesting

48:15.226 --> 48:17.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people talk about their
passions.

48:17.128 --> 48:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from Alec
Baldwin, famous
for his decades-long career in
film and television.

48:22.666 --> 48:28.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is also now host of a WNYC
Studios podcast,
"Here's the Thing."

48:28.973 --> 48:33.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: When I first started
listening, I remember
thinking he was born to host
public radio.

48:33.244 --> 48:34.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:34.245 --> 48:35.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALEC BALDWIN, Actor: Good lord.

48:35.446 --> 48:37.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wow, I have never been insulted
like that
in my life.

48:37.615 --> 48:42.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't need to be in some
Batman vs. Superman
kind of film anymore.

48:42.419 --> 48:43.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm too old for that.

48:43.521 --> 48:44.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I was born to host?

48:44.855 --> 48:53.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What am I, Leonard Lopate Jr.?

48:53.731 --> 48:54.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Acting was like sex.

48:54.732 --> 48:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And when I was young, I would do
it with anybody.

48:56.534 --> 48:59.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You get bedazzled by money and
by other things.

48:59.637 --> 49:07.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I always say to people, don't
live a big life
in your early career, so you can
really, really

49:07.444 --> 49:13.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a career, like Liam Neeson
or like Daniel
Day-Lewis, Colin Firth, Kevin
Kline, people

49:13.050 --> 49:14.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that I really admire.

49:14.819 --> 49:17.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The who succeed the most in the
business,
it's the most important thing in
their lives,

49:17.855 --> 49:21.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or at least during a very --
kind of the halcyon
years.

49:21.358 --> 49:23.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Get out there and give
everything you have
got while you're young and
beautiful.

49:23.828 --> 49:26.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I gave this advice to Leonardo
DiCaprio, and
look what he's doing.

49:26.497 --> 49:28.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is just working like a charm
for him.

49:28.299 --> 49:32.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's did everything I told him
to do, and,
look, he's got women jumping out
of the trees

49:32.903 --> 49:36.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on him and he's got an Oscar.

49:36.507 --> 49:38.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, you're welcome, Leo.

49:38.809 --> 49:40.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is Alec Baldwin.

49:40.644 --> 49:46.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're listening to "Here's
the Thing,"
my chance to talk with artists,
policy-makers

49:46.150 --> 49:47.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and performers.

49:47.151 --> 49:48.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't view this show as an
interview.

49:48.886 --> 49:50.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I view it as a conversation.

49:50.588 --> 49:52.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People have complained.

49:52.289 --> 49:55.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're like, "Oh, Alec, shut
up," and that
I'm intruding on the people
there.

49:55.326 --> 49:59.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm kind of trying to push
them toward
something I think we don't
already know about

49:59.864 --> 50:01.632 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

50:01.665 --> 50:04.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You leave them alone in the
longer format,
and 15 or 20 minutes goes by,
and they're

50:04.535 --> 50:06.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
telling you everything that you
had hoped
that they would tell you.

50:06.237 --> 50:08.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it's their decision.

50:08.038 --> 50:12.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the most interesting
interviews was
Paul Simon, who -- if we had
videotaped it,

50:12.509 --> 50:14.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, he just like stared at
me.

50:14.311 --> 50:15.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would be like, so, what did
you have for
breakfast?

50:15.880 --> 50:19.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He would be like, no, I'm not
going to talk
about what I had for breakfast.

50:19.216 --> 50:25.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it was like, he's so
private, where there's
other people who, you roll the
tape and they

50:25.089 --> 50:27.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just do an unbroken monologue
for like an
hour.

50:27.558 --> 50:30.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I could get up out of -- and
leave the room
and go have lunch and come back
and they wouldn't

50:31.028 --> 50:32.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
even notice I was gone.

50:32.263 --> 50:34.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really about people's
feelings about
what they do.

50:34.131 --> 50:36.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Like, when you're Paul
McCartney, do you ever
sit up there and, like, you get
really wistful

50:36.867 --> 50:39.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and think, man, I'm still doing
this 50 years
later?

50:39.236 --> 50:43.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., what do
you -- when
you see images of your dad, what
do you think?

50:43.674 --> 50:48.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The drama of your family, how
does that play
out in your daily life and who
you are?

50:48.112 --> 50:51.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, the biggest one
for me I wanted
-- I wanted to get was Obama.

50:51.582 --> 50:56.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did it feel to do that job
for eight years,
the ups and the downs?

50:56.220 --> 50:59.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was dying to do that, but I
don't think
I'm going to get him.

50:59.390 --> 51:01.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:01.058 --> 51:05.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEC BALDWIN: So, I remember Al
Gore was on
the set of "30 Rock" working
with us.

51:05.095 --> 51:06.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I turned to him.

51:06.897 --> 51:10.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said, "Now, Alec, you
were interested
in politics at some point in
your life, if

51:10.701 --> 51:12.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm not wrong."

51:12.569 --> 51:17.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I said, "Yes, sir, I really was,
but the presidency
of the United States isn't what
it used to

51:17.074 --> 51:18.542 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be."

51:18.575 --> 51:23.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the look he gave me, he just
stared at
me and went, "No, it is not."

51:23.714 --> 51:29.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, what an amazing thing to
have him say,
who had been in that world for
so long.

51:29.219 --> 51:30.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it has changed.

51:30.754 --> 51:34.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had the desire to do something
in the world
of politics when I was young.

51:34.558 --> 51:36.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that waned and waned and
waned.

51:36.093 --> 51:38.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the last maybe 10 years,
it's almost
completely been extinguished.

51:38.395 --> 51:40.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't have any desire for that
at all anymore.

51:40.698 --> 51:43.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got to give me a really
good reason
to leave my house, because I
have got two

51:43.767 --> 51:44.735 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
little kids.

51:44.768 --> 51:46.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And my wife and I are having
another one.

51:46.770 --> 51:51.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that's my big -- my big
production
I'm working on now is my family.

51:51.075 --> 51:52.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Alec Baldwin.

51:52.843 --> 51:59.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And this is my Brief But
Spectacular take
on why I was born to host a
public radio talk

51:59.316 --> 52:00.751 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
show.

52:00.784 --> 52:03.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Reading between the
lines, Judy,
I think he wants our job.

52:03.454 --> 52:04.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You think so?

52:04.455 --> 52:05.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This is what I'm
thinking.

52:05.456 --> 52:07.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We need to talk
further.

52:07.291 --> 52:10.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You can find out by
watching more
of our Brief But Spectacular
videos online

52:10.294 --> 52:11.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at PBS.org/NewsHour/Brief.

52:11.996 --> 52:18.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also online: What
outcomes
could the election have for
Social Security

52:18.202 --> 52:20.037 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Medicare?

52:20.070 --> 52:25.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On our Making Sense page, our
Medicare expert
takes a look at the party
platforms and what

52:25.109 --> 52:26.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the candidates have promised.

52:26.844 --> 52:31.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:31.882 --> 52:34.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a clarification before we
go.

52:34.184 --> 52:38.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, in the introduction
to Julian
Assange, we said that he was
avoiding extradition

52:38.822 --> 52:40.691 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the U.S.

52:40.724 --> 52:45.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We should have said he first
faces extradition
to Sweden for questioning over
sexual assault

52:45.796 --> 52:47.498 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
allegations.

52:47.531 --> 52:52.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From there, he could face
possible charges
in the U.S. related to releasing
classified

52:52.603 --> 52:54.571 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information.

52:54.605 --> 52:58.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tune in later
tonight on "Charlie
Rose": Dr. Anthony Fauci of the
National Institutes

52:58.642 --> 53:04.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Health on the funding
shortage that may
jeopardize the battle against
the Zika virus.

53:04.681 --> 53:06.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:06.116 --> 53:07.084 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:07.117 --> 53:08.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

53:08.986 --> 53:12.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening with Mark Shields and
David Brooks.

53:12.556 --> 53:25.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and

53:25.936 --> 53:28.505 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
good night.
