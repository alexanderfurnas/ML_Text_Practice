00:14.348 --> 00:15.382

FROM AFRICA, THE LATEST ON THE

ISLAMIC MILITANT GROUP BOKO

00:20.921 --> 00:22.055
HARAM AND THE MISSING

00:22.055 --> 00:23.223
SCHOOLGIRLS.

00:23.223 --> 00:24.491
AND IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT,

00:24.491 --> 00:25.559
FROM WEST VIRGINIA, RETHINKING

00:25.559 --> 00:27.160
THE SCHOOL YEAR.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.662
>> THEY GET SO MANY BREAKS THAT

00:28.662 --> 00:29.863
THEY'RE ALWAYS REFRESHED AND

00:29.863 --> 00:31.365
READY TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.199
SO THAT WAS THE WAKEUP CALL TO

00:32.199 --> 00:33.066
ME.

00:33.066 --> 00:34.201
>> Sreenivasan: NEXT ON PBS

00:34.201 --> 00:35.836
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.271

00:37.271 --> 00:39.406

00:39.406 --> 00:41.675
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:41.675 --> 00:42.676
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING,

00:42.676 --> 00:43.543
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:43.543 --> 00:44.645
THE UNITED STATES HAS

00:44.645 --> 00:46.146
INTENSIFIED ITS BOMBING CAMPAIGN

00:46.146 --> 00:47.347
IN IRAQ AGAINST FIGHTERS FROM

00:47.347 --> 00:48.181
THE ISLAMIC STATE EXTREMIST

00:48.181 --> 00:49.283
GROUP.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.584
THE PENTAGON SAID THE LATEST

00:50.584 --> 00:51.852
ATTACKS OCCURRED LATE LAST NIGHT

00:51.852 --> 00:53.720
ON SEVERAL MILITANT POSITIONS

00:53.720 --> 00:54.922
NEAR THE HADITHA DAM, ABOUT 175

00:54.922 --> 00:56.523
MILES FROM BAGHDAD.

00:56.523 --> 00:58.158
AT A NEWS CONFERENCE TODAY,

00:58.158 --> 01:00.227
DEFENSE SECRETARY CHUCK HAGEL

01:00.227 --> 01:01.528
EXPLAINED THE RISKS OF

01:01.528 --> 01:02.863
EXTREMISTS SEIZING OR DESTROYING

01:02.863 --> 01:05.198
THE DAM.

01:05.198 --> 01:07.267
>> THE DAMAGE THAT WOULD CAUSE

01:07.267 --> 01:10.203
WOULD BE VERY SIGNIFICANT AND IT

01:10.203 --> 01:12.205
WOULD PUT A SIGNIFICANT

01:12.205 --> 01:13.573
ADDITIONAL AND BIG RISK INTO THE

01:13.573 --> 01:16.243
MIX IN IRAQ.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.711
>> Sreenivasan: ARAB FOREIGN

01:17.711 --> 01:18.979
MINISTERS, MEETING IN CAIRO

01:18.979 --> 01:20.447
TODAY BACKED A RESOLUTION

01:20.447 --> 01:21.648
CALLING FOR ACTION AGAINST THE

01:21.648 --> 01:24.051
EXTREMISTS IN IRAQ.

01:24.051 --> 01:25.786
AND SEVERAL SENIOR MUSLIM

01:25.786 --> 01:27.321
CLERICS HAVE NOW ISSUED FATWAS

01:27.321 --> 01:29.256
AGAINST THE ISLAMIC STATE IN AN

01:29.256 --> 01:30.424
EFFORT TO STOP YOUNG PEOPLE FROM

01:30.424 --> 01:33.160
JOINING THE RADICAL GROUP.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.461
THAT CEASEFIRE ANNOUNCED FRIDAY

01:34.461 --> 01:35.762
IN EASTERN UKRAINE IS STARTING

01:35.762 --> 01:36.630
TO COME APART.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.198
VIOLENCE ERUPTED OVERNIGHT NEAR

01:38.198 --> 01:39.433
THE CITIES OF DONETSK AND

01:39.433 --> 01:40.500
MARIUPOL.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.401
A WOMAN DIED AND FOUR PEOPLE

01:41.401 --> 01:42.869
WERE INJURED IN THE LATEST

01:42.869 --> 01:44.137
CLASHES BETWEEN PRO-RUSSIAN

01:44.137 --> 01:45.973
SEPARATISTS AND UKRAINIAN

01:45.973 --> 01:47.140
GOVERNMENT TROOPS.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.208
REBELS SAID SEVERAL OF THEIR

01:48.208 --> 01:49.576
FIGHTERS HAD BEEN KILLED AFTER

01:49.576 --> 01:50.510
UKRAINIAN FORCES FIRED ON SIX OF

01:50.510 --> 01:51.278
THEIR POSITIONS.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.346
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THE CRISIS IN

01:52.346 --> 01:53.480
UKRAINE IN A MOMENT.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.583
A 24-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN, MATTHEW

01:56.583 --> 01:58.018
MILLER, WHO HAS BEEN DETAINED IN

01:58.018 --> 01:59.386
NORTH KOREA SINCE APRIL, WILL BE

01:59.386 --> 02:00.887
PUT ON TRIAL NEXT WEEKEND.

02:00.887 --> 02:02.389
THIS ACCORDING TO NORTH KOREA

02:02.389 --> 02:05.525
STATE MEDIA, WHICH DID NOT

02:05.525 --> 02:06.793
SPECIFY THE CHARGES.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.794
TWO OTHER AMERICANS ARE ALSO

02:07.794 --> 02:08.929
BEING HELD THERE.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.397
IN AFGHANISTAN TODAY, SEVEN MEN

02:10.397 --> 02:11.465
WERE SENTENCED TO DEATH AFTER

02:11.465 --> 02:12.799
THE ROBBERY AND GANG RAPE OF

02:12.799 --> 02:13.967
FOUR AFGHAN WOMEN.

02:13.967 --> 02:14.801
AN INCIDENT THAT PROVOKED

02:14.801 --> 02:16.403
WIDESPREAD PROTESTS.

02:16.403 --> 02:17.804
THE VICTIMS WERE DRIVING BACK

02:17.804 --> 02:19.239
FROM A WEDDING LAST MONTH WHEN

02:19.239 --> 02:20.807
THEY WERE STOPPED AND DRAGGED

02:20.807 --> 02:22.075
OUT OF THEIR CARS BY THE MEN,

02:22.075 --> 02:23.276
WHO WERE ARMED AND DRESSED AS

02:23.276 --> 02:24.578
POLICE OFFICERS.

02:24.578 --> 02:25.846
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IS

02:25.846 --> 02:26.913
BELIEVED TO BE COMMONPLACE IN

02:26.913 --> 02:28.215
AFGHANISTAN.

02:28.215 --> 02:30.650
BUT TRIALS OF THIS SORT ARE VERY

02:30.650 --> 02:31.852
UNUSUAL BECAUSE RAPE VICTIMS

02:31.852 --> 02:33.086
OFTEN ARE CONSIDERED DISGRACED

02:33.086 --> 02:34.187
AND TYPICALLY DON'T BRING

02:34.187 --> 02:36.790
CHARGES.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.892
IN AN INTERVIEW BROADCAST TODAY,

02:38.892 --> 02:40.193
PRESIDENT OBAMA EXPLAINED HIS

02:40.193 --> 02:41.628
DECISION TO POSTPONE EXECUTIVE

02:41.628 --> 02:42.896
ACTION ON IMMIGRATION REFORM.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.531
>> I'M BEING HONEST NOW ABOUT

02:44.531 --> 02:47.334
THE POLITICS OF IT.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.536
THIS PROBLEM WITH UNACCOMPANIED

02:49.536 --> 02:51.571
CHILDREN THAT WE SAW A COUPLE

02:51.571 --> 02:53.173
WEEKS AGO, WHERE YOU HAD, FROM

02:53.173 --> 02:55.308
CENTRAL AMERICA, A SURGE OF KIDS

02:55.308 --> 02:59.046
WHO WERE SHOWING UP AT THE

02:59.046 --> 03:01.148
BORDER, GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION.

03:01.148 --> 03:02.649
AND A LOT OF AMERICANS STARTED

03:02.649 --> 03:04.117
THINKING, WE'VE GOT THIS

03:04.117 --> 03:05.552
IMMIGRATION CRISIS ON OUR HANDS.

03:05.552 --> 03:06.853
>> Sreenivasan: DEMOCRATIC

03:06.853 --> 03:07.988
HISPANIC MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

03:07.988 --> 03:10.123
CRITICIZED HIS DECISION.

03:10.123 --> 03:11.324
>> I'M DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED THAT

03:11.324 --> 03:13.093
THE PRESIDENT HASN'T ACTED WHERE

03:13.093 --> 03:13.860
HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE FAILED TO

03:13.860 --> 03:15.862
ACT.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.864
>> IT'S CLEAR THAT PLAYING IT

03:17.864 --> 03:20.133
SAFE IS WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE

03:20.133 --> 03:22.169
WHITE HOUSE AND AMONG DEMOCRATIC

03:22.169 --> 03:23.870
CIRCLES, AND PLAYING IT SAFE

03:23.870 --> 03:25.505
MEANS WALKING AWAY FROM OUR

03:25.505 --> 03:26.873
VALUES AND OUR PRINCIPLES.

03:26.873 --> 03:27.707
>> Sreenivasan: POLICE FORCES

03:27.707 --> 03:29.209
AROUND THE NATION ARE MORE

03:29.209 --> 03:29.976
RACIALLY BALANCED NOW THAN A

03:29.976 --> 03:31.711
GENERATION AGO.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.979
THIS, ACCORDING TO AN ASSOCIATED

03:32.979 --> 03:34.347
PRESS SURVEY CONDUCTED FOLLOWING

03:34.347 --> 03:35.515
THE SHOOTING OF A BLACK TEENAGER

03:35.515 --> 03:36.817
BY A WHITE POLICE OFFICER IN

03:36.817 --> 03:38.318
FERGUSON, MISSOURI.

03:38.318 --> 03:39.453
THE SURVEY SUGGESTS THAT MORE

03:39.453 --> 03:40.587
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE HIRING

03:40.587 --> 03:41.488
BLACK OFFICERS THAN HISPANIC

03:41.488 --> 03:43.056
POLICEMEN.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.191
SEVERAL OFFICIALS QUOTED BY THE

03:44.191 --> 03:45.725
AP SAY THE HIRING OF MINORITY

03:45.725 --> 03:47.160
POLICE OFFICERS DOESN'T

03:47.160 --> 03:48.962
GUARANTEE AN END TO TOUGHER

03:48.962 --> 03:50.130
POLICING OF MINORITY

03:50.130 --> 03:54.468
COMMUNITIES.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.269
AND A NEW SURVEY CONFIRMS WHAT

03:56.269 --> 03:57.370
MOST SUNDAY TALK SHOW VIEWERS

03:57.370 --> 03:58.939
LIKELY ALREADY SUSPECTED.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.408
ARIZONA REPUBLICAN SENATOR JOHN

04:01.408 --> 04:02.943
MCCAIN HAS BEEN THE MOST REGULAR

04:02.943 --> 04:04.211
GUEST DURING THE PAST FIVE

04:04.211 --> 04:06.179
YEARS, FOLLOWED BY SOUTH

04:06.179 --> 04:07.747
CAROLINA REPUBLICAN SENATOR

04:07.747 --> 04:09.149
LINDSEY GRAHAM, FORMER OBAMA

04:09.149 --> 04:10.817
ADMINISTRATION STRATEGIST DAVID

04:10.817 --> 04:12.152
AXELROD AND ILLINOIS DEMOCRAT

04:12.152 --> 04:13.720
SENATOR RICHARD DURBIN.

04:13.720 --> 04:14.988
THE 13 MOST FREQUENT GUESTS WERE

04:14.988 --> 04:29.503
ALL MEN.

04:29.503 --> 04:30.937
>> Sreenivasan: FOR MORE ABOUT

04:30.937 --> 04:32.005
THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE, WE ARE

04:32.005 --> 04:32.906
JOINED NOW BY KIMBERLY MARTEN.

04:32.906 --> 04:33.874
SHE IS A POLITICAL SCIENCE

04:33.874 --> 04:34.875
PROFESSOR AT BARNARD COLLEGE AND

04:34.875 --> 04:39.880
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.715
V AND SO PUTIN WAS ABLE TO SEND

04:41.715 --> 04:42.849
IN FORCES RIGHT BEFORE THIS

04:42.849 --> 04:43.817
CEASE-FIRE.

04:43.817 --> 04:44.784
AND THEN CREATE THIS KIND OF

04:44.784 --> 04:46.753
ALMOST NO MAN'S LAND AND THERE

04:46.753 --> 04:48.588
WEREN'T ANY NEW ROUNDS OF

04:48.588 --> 04:51.658
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS THIS WEEK.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.527
SEEMS LIKE HE WAS IN A MUCH

04:53.527 --> 04:54.361
BETTER POSITION COMING OUT OF

04:54.361 --> 04:55.295
THAT.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.131
>> I THINK EVERYONE REALIZES

04:58.131 --> 04:59.566
THAT WHATEVER POLITICAL

04:59.566 --> 05:03.503
SETTLEMENT IS GOING TO BE ONE

05:03.503 --> 05:06.006
THAT FAVORS PUTIN'S INTERESTS.

05:06.006 --> 05:11.578
-- RUSSIA HAS THE ABILITY TO

05:11.578 --> 05:15.582
CONTROL AS A RESULT OF THE GAS

05:15.582 --> 05:16.516
PIPELINE LINK.

05:16.516 --> 05:18.652
>> FROZEN CONFLICT I MEAN IN THE

05:18.652 --> 05:23.823
REGION IN GEORGIA, AND THEN IN

05:23.823 --> 05:28.295
MOLDOVA, WE FOUND TRANSNISTRA

05:28.295 --> 05:29.729
AND EASTERN UKRAINE AS THIS LONG

05:29.729 --> 05:30.363
STANDING CONFLICT?

05:30.363 --> 05:31.698
>> PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FEELING THAT

05:31.698 --> 05:33.567
FOR THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS THAT

05:33.567 --> 05:35.402
THAT'S WHAT THE END RESULT IS

05:35.402 --> 05:38.505
GOING TO BE IN PUTIN'S INTEREST

05:38.505 --> 05:39.806
BECAUSE HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE

05:39.806 --> 05:40.974
MORE INTEREST IN UKRAINE, HE

05:40.974 --> 05:43.710
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE UKRAINE

05:43.710 --> 05:45.078
ALWAYS KNOCKED SLIGHTLY OFF

05:45.078 --> 05:46.413
BALANCE SO THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT

05:46.413 --> 05:49.950
HE'S GOING TO DO NEXT.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.151
HE WOULD LIKE TO DEMONSTRATE

05:51.151 --> 05:53.386
THAT HE HAS MORE POWER THAN THE

05:53.386 --> 05:54.988
UKRAINIANS DO.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.123
WHERE UKRAINE NEVER REALLY HAS A

05:57.123 --> 05:59.326
DEFINITIVE SENSE OF SOVEREIGNTY

05:59.326 --> 06:00.760
OVER ITS OWN TERRITORY.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.463
THAT'S IN PUTIN'S INTEREST.

06:03.463 --> 06:07.801
>> PUTIN HAS NO INCENTIVE TO

06:07.801 --> 06:10.036
KEEP THIS IN STATUS QUO.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.439
>> PROBABLY BEING BROKEN ON BOTH

06:12.439 --> 06:13.640
SIDES, THE CEASE-FIRE AND THAT'S

06:13.640 --> 06:15.075
NOT SURPRISING BECAUSE BOTH

06:15.075 --> 06:16.109
SIDES REALLY HAVE AN INCENTIVE

06:16.109 --> 06:18.478
TO TRY TO GET MORE FROM THE

06:18.478 --> 06:19.746
MILITARY SITUATION BEFORE THEY

06:19.746 --> 06:21.181
SIGN A FINAL PEACE AGREEMENT.

06:21.181 --> 06:23.383
>> HAVE THE SANCTIONS CREATED

06:23.383 --> 06:26.086
ANY KIND OF DISINCENTIVE OR

06:26.086 --> 06:26.953
STRONG ENOUGH DISINCENTIVE FOR

06:26.953 --> 06:27.787
PUTIN?

06:27.787 --> 06:28.588
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

06:28.588 --> 06:31.625
THE SANCTIONS PROBABLY WILL HAVE

06:31.625 --> 06:33.994
LONG TERM NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON

06:33.994 --> 06:35.295
THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.497
BUT THE GENERAL SENSE IS THE

06:37.497 --> 06:39.199
SANCTIONS WERE PUT INTO PLACE

06:39.199 --> 06:42.035
BECAUSE NOBODY COULD FIGURE

06:42.035 --> 06:44.371
ANYTHING ELSE TO DO.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.072
SHOWING THE UNITED STATES AND

06:46.072 --> 06:48.008
ITS EUROPEAN ALLIES WERE ANGRY

06:48.008 --> 06:50.677
AND NOT GOING TO LET THIS PASS

06:50.677 --> 06:53.613
BUT HAVE VERY LITTLE ABILITY TO

06:53.613 --> 06:57.651
INFLUENCE WHAT RUSSIA DOES.

06:57.651 --> 07:04.491
>> EUROPEANS HAVE MORE TO LOSE

07:04.491 --> 07:05.258
THAN UNITED STATES DOES.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.460
>> YES,.

07:07.460 --> 07:16.703
>> OBVIOUSLY HAS CRIMEA WHICH HE

07:16.703 --> 07:18.305
DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE.

07:18.305 --> 07:23.109
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO IT IS NOT

07:23.109 --> 07:33.253
GOING TO RECOGNIZE CRIMEA.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.789
THE WEST NEEDS THE OIL FIELDS

07:35.789 --> 07:37.691
AND AS LONG AS THERE'S NO

07:37.691 --> 07:40.327
RECOGNITION IT DOESN'T BRING HIM

07:40.327 --> 07:41.394
ANY ECONOMIC GAIN.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.396
HE DOESN'T GAINING IN

07:43.396 --> 07:44.497
ECONOMICALLY ON THIS.

07:44.497 --> 07:47.300
IT IS MORE A GAIN OF WHAT HE CAN

07:47.300 --> 07:49.069
SAY AS PRESIDENT AND SO PRETTY

07:49.069 --> 07:52.138
MUCH MORE AN INDIVIDUAL GAIN FOR

07:52.138 --> 07:53.573
PUTIN POLITICALLY THAN FOR

07:53.573 --> 07:55.075
RUSSIA AS A STATE BECAUSE OVER

07:55.075 --> 07:57.310
THE LONG TERM RUSSIA IS NOT

07:57.310 --> 07:58.278
GOING TO PARTICULARLY BENEFIT

07:58.278 --> 07:59.279
FOR THIS.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.147
>> WHAT ABOUT THE RUSSIAN

08:01.147 --> 08:02.215
TERRITORIES THAT ARE PART OF

08:02.215 --> 08:04.918
NATO, HOW DO THEY SEE THIS?

08:04.918 --> 08:09.923
>> THE OTHER MEMBERS, ESTONIA

08:09.923 --> 08:12.492
LATVIA AND LITHUANIA HAVE BEEN

08:12.492 --> 08:14.861
CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY

08:14.861 --> 08:18.231
OF RUSSIAN AGGRESSION, AND

08:18.231 --> 08:19.933
PUTIN'S AGGRESSION AGAINST

08:19.933 --> 08:22.335
UKRAINE HAVE MADE NATO MORE

08:22.335 --> 08:25.372
FOCUSED ON THOSE AREAS AND

08:25.372 --> 08:26.873
DESIROUS OF SHOWING THAT THEY

08:26.873 --> 08:28.174
ARE NATO MEMBER STATES THAT WILL

08:28.174 --> 08:30.477
BE PROTECTED IN THIS CASE BY A

08:30.477 --> 08:31.644
NEW RAPID RATIONS FORCE THAT

08:31.644 --> 08:34.214
WILL BE A SUBGROUP OF NATO

08:34.214 --> 08:35.749
MEMBER STATES THAT WILL ROTATE

08:35.749 --> 08:37.450
AROUND THE TERRITORY AND BE

08:37.450 --> 08:39.919
PREPARED TO RETALIATE IF

08:39.919 --> 08:42.122
NECESSARY.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.657
>> KIMBERLY MARTEN, FROM BAR

08:44.657 --> 08:46.259
NARD UNIVERSITY, THANK YOU SO

08:46.259 --> 08:47.394
MUCH FOR BEING ON.

08:47.394 --> 08:58.972

08:58.972 --> 09:00.140
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO OUR

09:00.140 --> 09:01.374
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.542
IT'S EARLY SEPTEMBER, AND AFTER

09:02.542 --> 09:03.710
THEIR LONG SUMMER BREAK,

09:03.710 --> 09:04.944
MILLIONS OF CHILDREN AND

09:04.944 --> 09:06.279
TEENAGERS ARE BACK IN THE

09:06.279 --> 09:07.447
CLASSROOM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

09:07.447 --> 09:08.548
SEVERAL MONTHS.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.649
BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR SOME

09:09.649 --> 09:10.550
STUDENTS.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.618
ABOUT 4% OF SCHOOLS ACROSS THE

09:11.618 --> 09:12.585
NATION ARE ON A DIFFERENT

09:12.585 --> 09:13.686
CALENDAR.

09:13.686 --> 09:14.587
ONE THAT HAS THEM IN SCHOOL

09:14.587 --> 09:15.422
YEAR-ROUND.

09:15.422 --> 09:16.389
STUDENTS IN THOSE SCHOOLS GET A

09:16.389 --> 09:17.223
MUCH SHORTER SUMMER VACATION,

09:17.223 --> 09:18.091
BUT MORE BREAKS THROUGHOUT THE

09:18.091 --> 09:18.992
YEAR.

09:18.992 --> 09:19.926
DOES IT HELP LEARNING?

09:19.926 --> 09:20.894
NEWSHOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

09:20.894 --> 09:21.961
ALISON STEWART TRAVELED RECENTLY

09:21.961 --> 09:23.096
TO CHARLESTON WEST VIRGINIA TO

09:23.096 --> 09:24.230
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.465
HER REPORT IS PART OF THE

09:25.465 --> 09:27.500
AMERICAN GRADUATE INITIATIVE.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.269
>> Reporter: WHEN BRYAN AND

09:29.269 --> 09:30.670
LAURA COOPER MOVED TO CHARLESTON

09:30.670 --> 09:32.071
FROM BECKLEY, WEST VIRGINIA, TWO

09:32.071 --> 09:33.506
YEARS AGO WITH THEIR YOUNG SONS,

09:33.506 --> 09:34.574
THEY WERE APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THE

09:34.574 --> 09:35.542
LOCAL SCHOOL IN THEIR NEW

09:35.542 --> 09:37.110
NEIGHBORHOOD.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.611
IT WAS ON A YEAR-ROUND CALENDAR,

09:38.611 --> 09:40.547
WHERE KIDS START SCHOOL JUST

09:40.547 --> 09:42.282
AFTER JULY 4.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.550
>> IT SOUNDED TO ME LIKE THE

09:43.550 --> 09:45.084
KIDS WERE IN SCHOOL CONSTANTLY,

09:45.084 --> 09:46.519
YOU KNOW, WITH MAYBE JUST THREE-

09:46.519 --> 09:48.388
DAY WEEKENDS HERE AND THERE.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.489
>> I WANTED TO STAY AWAY FROM A

09:49.489 --> 09:50.423
SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT INVOLVED

09:50.423 --> 09:51.491
YEAR-ROUND.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.358
>> Reporter: WHY DID YOU WANT TO

09:52.358 --> 09:53.226
STAY AWAY?

09:53.226 --> 09:54.060
>> I THOUGHT THE KIDS WOULDN'T

09:54.060 --> 09:54.894
LIKE IT.

09:54.894 --> 09:55.995
I THOUGHT THAT, YOU KNOW, ME

09:55.995 --> 09:56.763
THINKING BACK AS A CHILD, I

09:56.763 --> 09:57.564
THOUGHT, "MAN, I WOULD HAVE

09:57.564 --> 09:59.165
HATED TO BE IN SCHOOL ALL YEAR

09:59.165 --> 09:59.833
ROUND."

09:59.833 --> 10:01.100
I WOULD HAVE MISSED SUMMER,

10:01.100 --> 10:02.135
HANGING OUT WITH MY FRIENDS,

10:02.135 --> 10:03.503
DOING THOSE ACTIVITIES

10:03.503 --> 10:04.571
>> Reporter: BUT ONCE THE

10:04.571 --> 10:05.505
COOPERS-- WHO BOTH WORK FULL-

10:05.505 --> 10:06.473
TIME-- LEARNED MORE ABOUT THE

10:06.473 --> 10:07.507
CALENDAR AT PIEDMONT ELEMENTARY

10:07.507 --> 10:08.341
SCHOOL, THEY QUICKLY BECAME

10:08.341 --> 10:10.543
CONVERTS.

10:10.543 --> 10:11.911
HERE'S HOW THE SCHEDULE WORKS:

10:11.911 --> 10:13.480
INSTEAD OF ONE EXTENDED SUMMER

10:13.480 --> 10:15.615
BREAK, THE SAME 180 DAYS OF

10:15.615 --> 10:17.283
SCHOOL ARE DIVIDED INTO 9 WEEK

10:17.283 --> 10:18.751
QUARTERS, WHICH ARE THEN

10:18.751 --> 10:20.954
FOLLOWED BY THREE WEEK BREAKS IN

10:20.954 --> 10:22.856
FALL, WINTER, AND SPRING.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.023
THERE'S ALSO ABOUT A MONTH OFF

10:24.023 --> 10:25.758
FOR SUMMER.

10:25.758 --> 10:26.759
IT'S SOMETIMES CALLED A MODIFIED

10:26.759 --> 10:28.628
OR BALANCED CALENDAR.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.163
AND HERE AT PIEDMONT ELEMENTARY

10:30.163 --> 10:31.664
SCHOOL IN CHARLESTON, WEST

10:31.664 --> 10:33.533
VIRGINIA YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLING

10:33.533 --> 10:34.501
HAS BEEN THE NORM FOR ALMOST 20

10:34.501 --> 10:36.236
YEARS.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.971
>> ONCE WE GOT A SENSE OF WHAT

10:37.971 --> 10:39.305
THE SCHEDULE ACTUALLY IS WE JUST

10:39.305 --> 10:40.607
THOUGHT, "MAN, THAT'S GREAT."

10:40.607 --> 10:42.542
WE CAN GO ON VACATION IN

10:42.542 --> 10:43.409
SEPTEMBER INSTEAD OF IN THE

10:43.409 --> 10:45.111
MIDDLE OF SUMMER.

10:45.111 --> 10:46.479
>> THEY NEVER GET THAT FEELING

10:46.479 --> 10:47.714
OF, "OH, I'M SO SICK OF BEING AT

10:47.714 --> 10:49.349
SCHOOL," BECAUSE THEY GET SO

10:49.349 --> 10:50.216
MANY BREAKS THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS

10:50.216 --> 10:51.251
REFRESHED AND READY TO GO BACK

10:51.251 --> 10:52.919
TO SCHOOL.

10:52.919 --> 10:53.920
SO THAT WAS THE WAKEUP CALL TO

10:53.920 --> 10:55.021
ME, TO SEE HOW DIFFERENT THEY

10:55.021 --> 10:56.956
FELT ABOUT IT.

10:56.956 --> 10:58.491
>> HI, HAVE A GOOD DAY.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.692
>> Reporter: PRINCIPAL BETH

10:59.692 --> 11:01.127
STURGILL IS A BIG BELIEVER.

11:01.127 --> 11:02.462
SHE SAYS IN ADDITION TO

11:02.462 --> 11:03.730
PREVENTING STUDENT AND TEACHER

11:03.730 --> 11:05.598
BURNOUT, LESS TIME IS NEEDED FOR

11:05.598 --> 11:08.735
RE-TEACHING AT THE BEGINNING OF

11:08.735 --> 11:10.103
THE YEAR.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.404
AND FOR PIEDMONT, WHICH IS A

11:11.404 --> 11:13.873
DIVERSE INNER CITY SCHOOL WITH A

11:13.873 --> 11:15.775
HIGH POVERTY RATE, HAVING

11:15.775 --> 11:17.577
SHORTER BREAKS THROUGHOUT THE

11:17.577 --> 11:19.112
YEAR CAN PROVIDE MORE STABILITY

11:19.112 --> 11:20.146
FOR AT-RISK STUDENTS.

11:20.146 --> 11:21.414
>> THERE'S LOTS OF FAMILIES THAT

11:21.414 --> 11:22.749
SOMETIMES WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

11:22.749 --> 11:23.783
AND WE LIKE TO CHECK IN WITH AND

11:23.783 --> 11:24.684
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S GOING

11:24.684 --> 11:25.652
WELL.

11:25.652 --> 11:26.986
AND JUST TO HAVE THAT CONSISTENT

11:26.986 --> 11:28.788
FLOW WITHOUT HAVING THAT LONG,

11:28.788 --> 11:29.789
SUMMER BREAK HELPS THEM.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.190
>> Reporter: PRACTICALLY, THE

11:31.190 --> 11:32.358
CALENDAR ALSO GIVES THE SCHOOL

11:32.358 --> 11:33.493
FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE UP SNOW DAYS

11:33.493 --> 11:34.827
DURING SPRING BREAK BEFORE

11:34.827 --> 11:36.529
ANNUAL STANDARDIZED TESTING,

11:36.529 --> 11:37.797
INSTEAD OF WAITING UNTIL THE END

11:37.797 --> 11:39.132
OF THE YEAR.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.300
>> I NEED EVERYBODY FACING ME

11:40.300 --> 11:41.868
AND LISTENING.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.736
>> Reporter: BUT THE BIGGEST

11:43.736 --> 11:45.371
BENEFIT TO RUNNING ON A YEAR-

11:45.371 --> 11:46.606
ROUND SCHEDULE ACCORDING TO

11:46.606 --> 11:47.740
PRINCIPAL STURGILL AND OTHER

11:47.740 --> 11:49.175
EDUCATORS WE SPOKE TO IS THE

11:49.175 --> 11:51.811
POSSIBILITY OF ADDING MORE TIME

11:51.811 --> 11:53.146
IN SCHOOL.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.348
BY BRINGING KIDS BACK DURING THE

11:55.348 --> 11:56.883
FIRST WEEK OF EACH THREE WEEK

11:56.883 --> 11:58.318
BREAK.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.352
IT'S CALLED INTERSESSION.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.219
>> Reporter: WHAT IS

12:00.219 --> 12:01.054
INTERSESSION?

12:01.054 --> 12:03.423
WHAT'S ITS PURPOSE?

12:03.423 --> 12:04.757
>> SO IT'S A VARIETY OF REVIEW

12:04.757 --> 12:05.792
AND RE-TEACH FOR THOSE KIDS THAT

12:05.792 --> 12:06.926
NEED IT.

12:06.926 --> 12:07.994
A LITTLE, EXTRA BOOST AND IT'S

12:07.994 --> 12:09.028
ALSO SOME ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES

12:09.028 --> 12:10.196
JUST TO GIVE THEM SOME FUN

12:10.196 --> 12:11.030
THINGS TO DO.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.398
>> Reporter: THE EXTRA WEEK IS

12:12.398 --> 12:13.499
OPTIONAL AND PAID FOR AT

12:13.499 --> 12:18.938
PIEDMONT USING FEDERAL MONEY

12:18.938 --> 12:20.206
KNOWN AS TITLE ONE FUNDS, WHICH

12:20.206 --> 12:21.307
ARE DESIGNATED FOR SCHOOLS WITH

12:21.307 --> 12:22.275
HIGH POPULATIONS OF LOW-INCOME

12:22.275 --> 12:23.643
STUDENTS.

12:23.643 --> 12:24.978
THE COOPERS' KIDS, SEVEN-YEAR-

12:24.978 --> 12:26.746
OLD ZENE AND NINE-YEAR-OLD

12:26.746 --> 12:28.114
TAYAN, HAVE ALWAYS ATTENDED THE

12:28.114 --> 12:29.482
INTERSESSIONS, WHICH ARE ALSO

12:29.482 --> 12:31.017
WEEKS THAT THEIR PARENTS DON'T

12:31.017 --> 12:32.352
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CHILD CARE.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.753
>> FINDING CHILDCARE FOR THEM

12:33.753 --> 12:34.988
FOR A WHOLE SUMMER IS A LOT

12:34.988 --> 12:36.222
DIFFERENT THAN FINDING CHILDCARE

12:36.222 --> 12:37.123
FOR THEM THREE WEEKS AT A TIME

12:37.123 --> 12:38.758
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.360
>> IT MAKES FOR A VERY EXPENSIVE

12:40.360 --> 12:42.228
SUMMER TO HAVE THREE ENTIRE

12:42.228 --> 12:43.563
MONTHS STRAIGHT WHERE YOU'RE

12:43.563 --> 12:44.998
PAYING FOR CHILD CARE.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.199
>> Reporter: DESPITE THE

12:46.199 --> 12:47.367
BENEFITS OF THE YEAR ROUND

12:47.367 --> 12:48.835
CALENDAR THAT PARENTS AND

12:48.835 --> 12:49.769
TEACHERS CITE, IT'S NOT CLEAR

12:49.769 --> 12:51.504
THAT IT HAS HELPED PIEDMONT'S

12:51.504 --> 12:54.874
ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE.

12:54.874 --> 12:56.409
IN 2013, ONLY 38.1% OF CHILDREN

12:56.409 --> 12:57.443
SCORED AT OR ABOVE MASTERY ON

12:57.443 --> 12:58.711
READING.

12:58.711 --> 12:59.812
AND ONLY 38.9% SCORED AT OR

12:59.812 --> 13:01.447
ABOVE MASTERY AT MATH, BELOW THE

13:01.447 --> 13:02.248
LEVELS FROM A DECADE AGO WHEN

13:02.248 --> 13:04.350
THE STATE FIRST STARTED USING

13:04.350 --> 13:06.653
THIS STANDARD TO EVALUATE

13:06.653 --> 13:09.989
STUDENTS.

13:09.989 --> 13:11.991
>> WHAT THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS

13:11.991 --> 13:13.893
ABOUT THE ACTUAL POSITIVE EFFECT

13:13.893 --> 13:16.095
IS THAT IF IT'S POSITIVE, IT'S

13:16.095 --> 13:17.797
NOT GREAT OVERALL.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.132
>> Reporter: HARRIS COOPER IS A

13:19.132 --> 13:20.733
PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AND

13:20.733 --> 13:22.535
NEUROSCIENCE AT DUKE UNIVERSITY.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.303
WHILE RESEARCH HAS DOCUMENTED

13:24.303 --> 13:25.672
HOW LONG SUMMERS CAN CAUSE

13:25.672 --> 13:27.006
STUDENTS TO LOSE, ON AVERAGE,

13:27.006 --> 13:28.541
ONE MONTH OF INSTRUCTION, HE

13:28.541 --> 13:30.777
SAYS SHIFTING AROUND THE

13:30.777 --> 13:32.045
CALENDAR TO BE YEAR-ROUND IS NOT

13:32.045 --> 13:33.479
A DEFINITIVE WAY TO INCREASE

13:33.479 --> 13:34.747
STUDENT PERFORMANCE.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.115
BUT WHERE IT HAS SHOWN AN IMPACT

13:36.115 --> 13:40.553
HE SAYS IS WITH LOWER-INCOME

13:40.553 --> 13:41.621
STUDENTS.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.256
AND HE ALSO SUGGESTS THAT IT

13:43.256 --> 13:44.957
COULD HELP CHILDREN WITH

13:44.957 --> 13:46.325
LEARNING DISABILITIES, AND THOSE

13:46.325 --> 13:47.593
FOR WHOM ENGLISH IS A SECOND

13:47.593 --> 13:48.961
LANGUAGE.

13:48.961 --> 13:50.296
BUT COOPER CAUTIONS EVEN

13:50.296 --> 13:51.998
PROGRAMS LIKE INTERSESSIONS THAT

13:51.998 --> 13:53.332
CAN ADD EXTRA DAYS TO THE SCHOOL

13:53.332 --> 13:54.300
YEAR ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOING

13:54.300 --> 13:55.435
TO BOOST ACHIEVEMENT.

13:55.435 --> 13:56.235
>> WE SHOULDN'T EVER LOSE SIGHT

13:56.235 --> 13:57.170
OF THE FACT THAT TIME IN SCHOOL

13:57.170 --> 13:59.038
IS A BLACK BOX.

13:59.038 --> 14:00.306
WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL CALENDAR

14:00.306 --> 14:02.175
CAN INFLUENCE A CHILD'S

14:02.175 --> 14:05.211
LEARNING.

14:05.211 --> 14:06.646
BUT WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS HOW

14:06.646 --> 14:07.513
YOU FILL THE TIME THAT THEY'RE

14:07.513 --> 14:09.849
IN SCHOOL.

14:09.849 --> 14:10.917
>> Reporter: PEOPLE ARE STUCK ON

14:10.917 --> 14:11.884
TEST SCORES.

14:11.884 --> 14:12.919
>> OH, THEY ARE.

14:12.919 --> 14:14.020
YES.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.588
THEY ARE.

14:15.588 --> 14:16.689
>> Reporter: UNTIL A BALANCED

14:16.689 --> 14:18.524
CALENDAR CAN SAY, LOOK, WE MAKE

14:18.524 --> 14:19.959
TEST SCORES BETTER, YOU'RE GONNA

14:19.959 --> 14:21.594
HAVE SOME RESISTANCE.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.896
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:23.896 --> 14:25.231
>> I THINK THAT'S A LEGITIMATE

14:25.231 --> 14:26.165
COMMENT.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.433
BUT CAN WE SAY THE TRADITIONAL

14:27.433 --> 14:28.634
CALENDAR MAKES TEST SCORES

14:28.634 --> 14:29.535
BETTER?

14:29.535 --> 14:30.336
I DON'T KNOW.

14:30.336 --> 14:31.871
I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S THE

14:31.871 --> 14:33.306
CASE EITHER.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.340
SO I THINK YOU NEED THE LOOK AT

14:34.340 --> 14:35.975
THE WHOLE CHILD AND THE IMPACT

14:35.975 --> 14:37.009
THAT YEAR-ROUND EDUCATION CAN

14:37.009 --> 14:38.344
HAVE ON THE WHOLE CHILD, AND NOT

14:38.344 --> 14:39.112
JUST DOES IT MAKE YOUR TEST

14:39.112 --> 14:40.646
SCORES HIGHER.

14:40.646 --> 14:41.814
>> Reporter: IN WEST VIRGINIA

MARY C. SNOW WEST SIDE

14:45.485 --> 14:46.319
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, ACROSS TOWN

14:47.920 --> 14:49.122
THERE, ADMINISTRATORS ARE

14:49.122 --> 14:50.890
EXPERIMENTING WITH TWO WEEK

14:50.890 --> 14:52.325
INTERSESSIONS AND MAKING THE

14:52.325 --> 14:53.860
EXTRA TIME MANDATORY.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.228
AND AROUND THE STATE, YEAR-ROUND

14:55.228 --> 14:56.596
SCHOOLS HAVE RECENTLY BECOME A

14:56.596 --> 14:59.565
TOPIC OF DISCUSSION.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.702
THIS FALL A NEW LAW WENT INTO

15:02.702 --> 15:05.037
EFFECT THAT MANDATED 180 DAYS OF

15:05.037 --> 15:07.106
SCHOOL, BUT GRANTED LOCAL SCHOOL

15:07.106 --> 15:08.808
DISTRICTS MORE FLEXIBILITY ABOUT

15:08.808 --> 15:10.243
HOW TO SET THE CALENDAR, SO THAT

15:10.243 --> 15:11.944
IF A DISTRICT WANTED TO ADOPT

15:11.944 --> 15:13.312
YEAR ROUND SCHOOLING IT COULD.

15:13.312 --> 15:16.015
BUT NOT ONE DID.

15:16.015 --> 15:20.019
>> I THINK PEOPLE ARE REALLY

15:20.019 --> 15:21.454
SAYING OUT LOUD, SHOW ME HOW

15:21.454 --> 15:22.221
THIS IS GONNA HELP MY SCHOOL

15:22.221 --> 15:23.456
SYSTEM AND THE STUDENTS IN OUR

15:23.456 --> 15:25.324
SCHOOL SYSTEM.

15:25.324 --> 15:26.793

FEDERATION OF TEACHERS FOR WEST

15:29.829 --> 15:32.031
VIRGINIA, A TEACHERS UNION.

15:32.031 --> 15:33.566

15:33.566 --> 15:34.967
IN ADDITION TO THE NEW STATE LAW

15:34.967 --> 15:36.302
GRANTING SCHOOL DISTRICTS MORE

15:36.302 --> 15:37.403
OPTIONS ON THE CALENDAR, SHE

15:37.403 --> 15:39.205
SAYS SCHOOLS IN WEST VIRGINIA

15:44.710 --> 15:47.580
A NEW TEACHER EVALUATION SYSTEM.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.350
OVERWHELMED WITH ALL THE OTHER

15:51.350 --> 15:55.922
CHANGES THAT THEY'RE JUST NOT

15:55.922 --> 15:57.356
READY TO TAKE ON THAT THAT MUCH

15:57.356 --> 16:01.227
CHANGE OR ONE MORE THING UNTIL

16:01.227 --> 16:02.461
THEY-WE-- WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND

16:02.461 --> 16:04.530
ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE

16:04.530 --> 16:05.631
HAPPENING IN THE STATE AND THE

16:05.631 --> 16:06.999
EDUCATION SYSTEM.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.534
>> Reporter: WHILE CAMPBELL

16:08.534 --> 16:10.169
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT DISTRICTS

16:10.169 --> 16:12.371
SHOULD HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO

16:12.371 --> 16:15.174
TRY A YEAR-ROUND CALENDAR IF

16:15.174 --> 16:16.776
THEY WANT, SHE SAYS THERE ARE

16:16.776 --> 16:17.877
LOGISTICAL COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS

16:17.877 --> 16:19.078
LACK OF AIR CONDITIONING IN MANY

16:19.078 --> 16:20.146
SCHOOLS AND SCHEDULING ISSUES

16:20.146 --> 16:24.417
FOR OLDER STUDENTS.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.486
>> SPORTS IS A HUGE THING WHEN

16:27.486 --> 16:28.921
YOU TALK ABOUT A BALANCED

16:28.921 --> 16:31.023
CALENDAR BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE ONE

16:31.023 --> 16:32.592
COUNTY THAT IS, YOU KNOW, IN THE

16:32.592 --> 16:35.661
SYSTEM, THEY ALL PLAY EACH OTHER

16:35.661 --> 16:36.762
IN THEIR SPORTING EVENTS.

16:36.762 --> 16:38.764
SO WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE WHEN

16:38.764 --> 16:40.299
YOU GO FROM THIS COUNTY TO PLAY

16:40.299 --> 16:41.500
THIS COUNTY AND THEIR CALENDAR

16:41.500 --> 16:42.435
IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT?

16:42.435 --> 16:43.369
>> Reporter: SO FOR PEOPLE WHO

16:43.369 --> 16:44.904
SAY, "SPORTS WILL ADJUST," YOU

16:44.904 --> 16:46.239
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT BIGGER

16:46.239 --> 16:47.373
THAN JUST-- IT'S NOT JUST

16:47.373 --> 16:48.107
SPORTS.

16:48.107 --> 16:48.908
IT'S THE SOCIAL ASPECT...

16:48.908 --> 16:49.742
>> I MEAN, THAT'S PART OF...

16:49.742 --> 16:50.643
>> Reporter: AND THE IMPORTANCE

16:50.643 --> 16:51.444
OF...

16:51.444 --> 16:52.612

16:52.612 --> 16:53.713
BEING INVOLVED IN THOSE THINGS.

16:53.713 --> 16:54.847
AND IT'S A BIG PART OF OUR

16:54.847 --> 16:56.182
CULTURE.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.216
LET'S BE REALISTIC HERE.

16:57.216 --> 16:58.451
>> Reporter: SHE IS ALSO

16:58.451 --> 16:59.719
CONCERNED YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL

16:59.719 --> 17:00.653
WOULD MEAN SERVICE PERSONNEL AND

17:00.653 --> 17:01.954
TEACHERS WOULD BE UNABLE TO KEEP

17:01.954 --> 17:03.189
SECOND JOBS, A NECESSITY FOR

17:03.189 --> 17:03.890
MANY IN WEST VIRGINIA, WHICH

17:03.890 --> 17:05.391
RANKS 47th IN THE COUNTRY IN

17:05.391 --> 17:06.692
TEACHER PAY.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.794
BUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES IS

17:08.794 --> 17:10.263
THAT PROVIDING PROGRAMS LIKE

17:10.263 --> 17:12.298
INTERSESSION COSTS MONEY, AND

17:12.298 --> 17:13.532
DESPITE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR SOME

17:13.532 --> 17:14.901
LOWER INCOME SCHOOLS, IT'S NOT

17:14.901 --> 17:16.002
ALWAYS CLEAR WHO WOULD HAVE TO

17:16.002 --> 17:18.537
FOOT THE BILL.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.238
>> DOES THE COMMUNITY HAVE TO

17:19.238 --> 17:21.140
PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES?

17:21.140 --> 17:22.742
IS THE STATE DEPARTMENT GOING TO

17:22.742 --> 17:25.278
PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THE

17:25.278 --> 17:27.480
INTERCESSIONS?

17:27.480 --> 17:29.448
IF WE'RE GONNA TALK TO.. TALK

17:29.448 --> 17:30.883
ABOUT HOW TO BRIDGE THAT GAP IN

17:30.883 --> 17:32.251
STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT, WHAT DOES

17:32.251 --> 17:34.553
THAT LOOK LIKE?

17:34.553 --> 17:36.255
>> Reporter: FOR THE COOPERS,

17:36.255 --> 17:37.757
THE LACK OF YEAR-ROUND OPTIONS

17:37.757 --> 17:39.692
FOR OLDER KIDS IS A BIG CONCERN.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.160
IN CHARLESTON THERE'S NOT A

17:41.160 --> 17:43.529
SINGLE MIDDLE OR HIGH SCHOOL ON

17:43.529 --> 17:45.431
A BALANCED CALENDAR.

17:45.431 --> 17:47.533
IS THERE GOING TO BE A PERIOD

17:47.533 --> 17:48.401
FOR YOU GUYS WHEN ONE OF YOUR

17:48.401 --> 17:49.468
KIDS IS IN A TRADITIONAL SCHOOL

17:49.468 --> 17:50.670
AND ONE IS ON THIS "BALANCED

17:50.670 --> 17:51.404
CALENDAR"?

17:51.404 --> 17:52.438
>> YEAH.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.073
I DREAD IT.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.741
AND I'M VERY CURIOUS TO SEE HOW

17:55.741 --> 17:57.143
THAT'S GONNA WORK OUT.

17:57.143 --> 17:58.477
>> Reporter: WHAT ARE YOU

17:58.477 --> 17:59.845
CONCERNED ABOUT?

17:59.845 --> 18:01.948
>> I JUST... TAYAN WILL HAVE

18:01.948 --> 18:03.749
DAYS THAT HE HAS TO SCHOOL THAT

ZENE DOESN'T.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.018
ZENE'LL HAVE DAYS OFF THAT TAYAN

18:06.018 --> 18:06.953
HAS TO GO TO SCHOOL.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.287

18:08.287 --> 18:09.221

CAPTURING TERRITORY AND FLYING

19:26.832 --> 19:28.601

THAT'S RIGHT.

19:30.069 --> 19:31.570
WHAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO

19:31.570 --> 19:36.475
HERE IS, IN AN ENTIRE COUNTRY

CAN'T MOVE AND -- DON'T REALLY

20:05.704 --> 20:07.640
POSE A THREAT NO BOKO HARAM.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.376
THEY ARE RAISING THEIR FLAGS IN

20:31.397 --> 20:33.065
A BOKO HARAM STATE IN AFRICA?

20:33.065 --> 20:35.267

20:35.267 --> 20:36.535
PEOPLE CONSTANTLY MISREAD WHAT

20:36.535 --> 20:37.636
BOKO HARAM IS ALL ABOUT.

20:37.636 --> 20:39.505
I THINK THE GOVERNMENT STILL USE

20:39.505 --> 20:43.075
THEM AS YOU KNOW AN ISLAMIC

20:43.075 --> 20:45.010
INSURGENCY THAT IS BENT ON

BOKO HARAM HAS DONE FOR YEARS

20:56.722 --> 20:58.224
THEY'RE GOING ABOUT AND DOING ON

20:58.224 --> 20:59.091
THE UPDATE.

20:59.091 --> 21:04.497

GIRLS THAT CAPTURED WORLD'S

21:07.433 --> 21:08.434

21:08.434 --> 21:11.470
>> DID SPOT GROUP OF 70 GIRLS IN

21:11.470 --> 21:12.938
ONE AREA.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.107
AND 40 GIRLS IN ONE FIELD WHEN

21:15.107 --> 21:16.775
THEY CAME BACK THEY WERE GONE

21:16.775 --> 21:17.943
AGAIN.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.378
IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY THIS.

21:19.378 --> 21:21.680
BOKO HARAM HAS KIDNAPPED

21:21.680 --> 21:24.016
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF GIRLS,

21:24.016 --> 21:26.051
NOT JUST THOSE SCHOOL GIRLS AND

21:26.051 --> 21:27.353
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF BOYS.

21:27.353 --> 21:29.822
THEY WERE POLITICALLY IMPORTANT,

21:29.822 --> 21:31.991
QUITE EARLY ON THEY HAD

21:31.991 --> 21:33.993
SOMETHING THEY REALIZED WAS A

21:33.993 --> 21:34.760
NEGOTIATING CHIP.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.629
BOKO HARAM IS STILL HOLDING

21:40.666 --> 21:42.568
NEGOTIATING TOOL.

21:42.568 --> 21:45.371

KID MADAM, AND THOSE GIRLS,

21:48.574 --> 21:50.042
SCHOOL GIRLS HAVEN'T BEEN GOOD

21:50.042 --> 21:51.377
FOR ANYTHING YOU KNOW, THEY

21:51.377 --> 21:53.145
HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY POLITICAL

21:53.145 --> 21:55.047
CONCESSIONS FROM THEM, THE GIRLS

21:55.047 --> 21:56.315
THEMSELVES AREN'T MADE FOR LIFE

21:56.315 --> 22:00.653
IN THE WORDS, YOU KNOW, IT'S A

22:00.653 --> 22:02.321
BURDEN CARRYING AROUND HUNDREDS

22:02.321 --> 22:04.690
OF TRAUMATIZED SCHOOL GIRLS FOR

22:04.690 --> 22:05.524
BOKO HARAM.

22:05.524 --> 22:06.992
SO BASICALLY THEY ARE IN A

22:06.992 --> 22:07.993
STALEMATE.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.995
THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T SEEM TO GET

22:09.995 --> 22:11.497
THE GIRLS OUT AND BOKO HARAM

22:11.497 --> 22:12.865
CAN'T GET ANYTHING FOR GIRLS

22:12.865 --> 22:14.133
EITHER.

22:14.133 --> 22:18.704
>> DREW IS HINSHAW, JOINING US

22:18.704 --> 22:21.574
FROM ACCRA, GHANA, THANK YOU SO

22:21.574 --> 22:23.275
MUCH.

22:23.275 --> 22:27.179
>> THANK YOU, TOO.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.582
>> THIS

22:29.582 --> 22:32.451
>> Sreenivasan: YOU MIGHT HAVE

22:32.451 --> 22:33.752
HEARD A BIT EARLIER THIS WEEK

22:33.752 --> 22:35.254
ABOUT A REMARKABLE DISCOVERY IN

22:35.254 --> 22:36.789
ARGENTINA.

22:36.789 --> 22:38.290
THE REMAINS OF A DINOSAUR THAT

22:38.290 --> 22:39.491
LIVED NEARLY 80 MILLION YEARS

22:39.491 --> 22:40.859
AGO AND WEIGHED MORE THAN A

22:40.859 --> 22:42.061
BOEING 737.

22:42.061 --> 22:42.895
IT TOOK YEARS TO UNEARTH ALL THE

22:42.895 --> 22:43.762
REMAINS.

22:43.762 --> 22:44.863
I.T.N.'s RICHARD PALLOT HAS THE

22:44.863 --> 22:47.233
DETAILS.

22:47.233 --> 22:50.035
>> IT IS THE MOST COMPLETE LARGE

22:50.035 --> 22:51.303
DINOSAUR SKELETON EVERY FOUND.

22:51.303 --> 22:53.606
SUCH AS THE SIZE IT TAKES A

22:53.606 --> 22:54.707
SECOND TO COMPREHEND.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.508
THIS IS ONLY PART OF ITS LEG.

22:56.508 --> 22:57.843
THIS WAS A TOE.

22:57.843 --> 23:03.048
SO THIS STARTS THE TAIL OF

23:03.048 --> 23:04.083
DREADNAUGHTS.

23:04.083 --> 23:08.387
>> THIS IS PART OF ITS 30 FOOT

23:08.387 --> 23:10.055
TAIL.

23:10.055 --> 23:14.727
THE DREADNAUGHTUS LIVED 70

23:14.727 --> 23:16.328
MILLION YEARS AGO.

23:16.328 --> 23:18.530
AND DESPITE ITS SIZE WAS A

23:18.530 --> 23:19.898
HERBIVORE.

23:19.898 --> 23:21.767
>> WHEN YOU'RE 65 TONS YOU'RE

23:21.767 --> 23:23.969
NOT GOING TO REALLY HAVE ANY

23:23.969 --> 23:27.206
ENEMIES.

23:27.206 --> 23:30.509
AND THAT MADE ME THINK OF THE

23:30.509 --> 23:33.145
OPPORTUNITY OF THE CENTURY

23:33.145 --> 23:34.413
SHIPS, DREADNOUGHTS.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.082
SO I THOUGHT DREADNAUGHTUS,

23:37.082 --> 23:38.150
FEARS NOTHING.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.519
>> THE DREADNAUGHTUS MEASURES IN

23:40.519 --> 23:44.256
AT ROUGHLY THE SAME SIZE AS THE

23:44.256 --> 23:45.324
30 METERS IN LENGTH WHICH

23:45.324 --> 23:46.158
MARKS IT OUT AS ONE OF THE

23:46.158 --> 23:47.526
LONGEST-EVER DINOSAURS.

23:47.526 --> 23:49.295
IT IS ITS WEIGHT THAT SETS IT

23:49.295 --> 23:50.629
APART.

23:50.629 --> 23:54.099
IT'S ABOUT FOUR TIMES AS HEAVY.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.568
SPENDS MOST OF ITS LIFE EATING

23:56.568 --> 23:58.971
JUST TO KEEP ALIVE.

23:58.971 --> 24:01.774
>> THE DIG IN ARGENTINA BEGAN

24:01.774 --> 24:04.176
ALMOST A DECADE AGO, UNCOVERED

24:04.176 --> 24:06.178
TWO DIFFERENT SPECIMENS, THE

24:06.178 --> 24:09.214
LARGER OF WHICH MAY NOT HAVE

24:09.214 --> 24:12.951
BEEN FULLY GROWN WHEN IT DIED.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.119
A METER WIDE, PERFECT FOR

24:14.119 --> 24:15.821
CLOBBERING ANY PREDATOR THAT

24:15.821 --> 24:16.989
ATTACKS.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.792
RICHARD PALLOT, ITN NEWS.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.169
>> Sreenivasan: SOME LATE NEWS

24:30.169 --> 24:31.203
BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU TONIGHT.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.838
PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS CLASHED

24:32.838 --> 24:37.476
IN EAST JERUSALEM.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.244
A TEENAGER HAD BEEN WOUNDED BY

24:39.244 --> 24:40.479
POLICE DURING AN EARLIER

24:40.479 --> 24:41.580
INCIDENT.

24:41.580 --> 24:45.851
BRUCE LEVENSON IS SURRENDERING

24:45.851 --> 24:47.286
CONTROL OF THE ATLANTA HAWKS

24:47.286 --> 24:48.721
AFTER ACKNOWLEDGING HE SENT A

24:48.721 --> 24:51.790
RACIST EMAIL SAYING BLACK FANS

24:51.790 --> 24:53.692
SCARED AWAY WHITES.

24:53.692 --> 24:54.860
AND CELEBRITIES TURNED OUT FOR

24:54.860 --> 24:56.929
THE FUNERAL OF JOAN RIVERS.

24:56.929 --> 24:57.996
THE EVENT WAS CHARACTERIZED AS

24:57.996 --> 24:59.598
SOMBER BUT FUNNY.

24:59.598 --> 25:00.866
RIVERS ONCE DESCRIBED HER

25:00.866 --> 25:03.602
FUNERAL WISHES: I DON'T WANT A

25:03.602 --> 25:05.404
RABBI RAMBLING ON, I WANT MERYL

25:05.404 --> 25:06.672

25:06.672 --> 25:07.573

25:13.912 --> 25:15.581
