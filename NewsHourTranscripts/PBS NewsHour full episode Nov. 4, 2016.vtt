JUDY WOODRUFF: As candidates
make their final
push through swing states, we
ask voters in

00:23.724 --> 00:28.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the battleground of Pennsylvania
whether they
think their vote counts.

00:28.428 --> 00:31.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then: desperate for health care.

00:31.431 --> 00:36.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

need.

SANDRA COOK, Virginia: There's a
lot of poverty
in this area, and the coal
mines, they went

00:39.840 --> 00:45.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down, and the jobs have gotten
really bad.

00:45.112 --> 00:47.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

weekend of crisscrossing the
battleground
states.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump started in New
Hampshire, where
he's now neck-and-neck with
Hillary Clinton,

01:32.993 --> 01:37.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hoping to break through her
electoral wall
of usually blue states.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Granite State last voted

DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
When you see the rusted out
factories and

01:43.203 --> 01:46.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
empty buildings, just remember
this.

01:46.340 --> 01:52.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton's policies and
other's like
her, her friends, did this to
us, all of us.

01:52.245 --> 01:57.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will stop the jobs from
leaving New Hampshire.

01:57.451 --> 02:00.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The theft of American prosperity
will end.

02:00.587 --> 02:02.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have taken away our
prosperity.

02:02.622 --> 02:05.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From now on, it's going to be
America first.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:07.427 --> 02:11.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: New Hampshire
has the nation's
lowest unemployment rate, but
Trump moved

02:11.231 --> 02:15.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on to more likely economic
territory, Ohio
and Pennsylvania.

02:15.302 --> 02:19.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, some remarkable
fallout involving
words Trump said yesterday.

02:19.806 --> 02:24.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told crowds that Hillary
Clinton was likely
to be put on trial for her
actions related

02:24.277 --> 02:25.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to her foundation and e-mail.

02:25.812 --> 02:30.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that was based on a FOX News
report that
has now been scuttled.

02:30.183 --> 02:36.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, FOX News anchor Bret
Baier fully
retracted his story alleging a
likely Clinton

02:36.356 --> 02:37.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
indictment.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He issued this apology:

02:38.358 --> 02:39.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRET BAIER, FOX News: It was a
mistake.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, for that, I'm sorry.

02:41.395 --> 02:45.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I should have said, they will
continue to
build their case.

02:45.532 --> 02:47.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Indictment obviously is a very
loaded word.

02:47.868 --> 02:52.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For her part,
Hillary Clinton
focused today on historically
Democratic strongholds,

02:52.973 --> 02:56.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rekindling her economic message
for middle
and lower classes in Pittsburgh.

02:56.443 --> 03:02.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: So, I
will do everything
I can to get incomes rising for
hardworking

03:02.182 --> 03:03.884 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether you work in steel,
whether you work
in a factory, where you're a
machinist, a

03:05.719 --> 03:12.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nurse, a teacher, a firefighter,
police officer,
whatever you are, you deserve to
be part of

03:12.359 --> 03:14.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a growing, thriving middle-class
economy.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

Clinton's lead in Michigan has
narrowed in
recent days.

03:24.905 --> 03:32.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, President Obama in
North Carolina,
campaigning for Clinton, was
interrupted by

03:32.779 --> 03:34.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a protester dressed in a
uniform.

03:34.781 --> 03:37.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After a few minutes of trying to
calm his
crowd, he urged respect.

03:37.818 --> 03:41.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
We live in a country that
respects free speech.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:44.324 --> 03:48.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: So, second of all,
it looks
like maybe he might have served
in our military.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we ought to respect that.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Tonight,
Clinton is also
hoping to attract voters with
the help of

03:53.667 --> 03:58.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
celebrity supporters, including
a concert
with Jay-Z in Cleveland and a

Wonder in Philly.

04:00.240 --> 04:04.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both campaigns have packed the
weekend with
events, Trump appealing to white
working-class

04:04.644 --> 04:08.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voters and Clinton hoping to
boost minority

JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: The
Labor Department reported that
U.S. workers

04:14.921 --> 04:20.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saw their best pay raises in
seven years last
month in the final jobs report
before the

04:21.027 --> 04:22.863 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

04:22.896 --> 04:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It found that, for the month of
October, U.S.
employers added a net of 161,000
jobs, rounding

04:28.335 --> 04:32.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out what observers say are signs
of a resilient
economy.

04:32.105 --> 04:36.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The unemployment rate improved
by a tenth
of a point, to 4.9 percent.

04:36.977 --> 04:42.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Guilty verdicts today in a
scandal that shadowed
New Jersey Governor Chris
Christie in his

04:42.849 --> 04:44.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
failed run for president.

04:44.651 --> 04:50.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal jury convicted his
former aides
Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni of
shutting

04:50.090 --> 04:54.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down parts of a major bridge in
order to punish
a political opponent.

04:54.494 --> 04:58.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afterward, both sides argued
again over whether
Christie himself should have
been charged.

04:58.965 --> 05:02.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BALDASSARE, Attorney for
Bill Baroni:
One of the things the U.S.
attorneys office

05:02.669 --> 05:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should be ashamed of is where it
decided to
draw the line on who to charge.

05:08.175 --> 05:13.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They should have had belief in
their own case
to charge powerful people, and
they didn't.

05:13.547 --> 05:16.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL FISHMAN, U.S. Attorney,
District of New
Jersey: The evidence that we had
that proved

05:16.082 --> 05:20.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people beyond -- guilty beyond a
reasonable
doubt was sufficient to indict
and convict

05:20.687 --> 05:23.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni,
and that's
the indictment we asked the
grand jury to

05:23.690 --> 05:25.525 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
return.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a statement,
Christie said
again he knew nothing about the
bridge closures

05:28.395 --> 05:30.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
until after the fact.

05:30.230 --> 05:34.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he promised to speak out
soon about what
he called -- quote -- "the lies
told by the

05:34.834 --> 05:37.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
media" and in the courtroom.

05:37.037 --> 05:41.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. intelligence officials say
they have
picked up information that
al-Qaida might

05:41.608 --> 05:44.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stage attacks here on election
eve.

05:44.978 --> 05:50.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reports today said that New
York, Texas and
Virginia were listed as possible
targets.

05:50.083 --> 05:54.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But officials warn, the
information has not
been corroborated.

05:54.521 --> 05:59.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three U.S. military trainers in
Jordan were
killed today outside a military
base.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It happened near the southern
city of Ma'an.

06:02.362 --> 06:06.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Americans were fired on as
their car tried
to enter the base.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is not clear what prompted
the shooting.

06:08.201 --> 06:12.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

06:17.310 --> 06:22.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
top Kurdish lawmakers as part of
what they're
calling terror investigations.

06:22.349 --> 06:27.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The arrests sparked protests
from Istanbul
to Ankara, and police used
pepper spray and

06:27.420 --> 06:30.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
water cannons on the crowds.

06:30.123 --> 06:34.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

lawmakers called
the arrests political genocide.

06:34.461 --> 06:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

bypassed after
the coup attempt.

06:43.270 --> 06:47.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And now the Parliament's
operations have been
officially stopped in illegal
and anti-democratic

06:47.774 --> 06:49.009 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

create an authoritarian
Turkey.

06:51.678 --> 06:57.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

new assault
into eastern Mosul today,
touching off some

07:07.861 --> 07:09.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the fiercest fighting yet.

insulting the Koran.

07:37.891 --> 07:43.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

scandal.

07:51.504 --> 07:56.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It stems from allegations that

let a close confidante meddle in
state affairs.

called the scandal
heartbreaking and said she
accepts responsibility,

08:02.148 --> 08:07.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

Park's approval rating has
fallen to 5 percent.

08:11.358 --> 08:14.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's under mounting pressure to
resign.

Back in this country, a federal
jury today
has found a "Rolling Stone"
magazine story

08:18.865 --> 08:23.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about a gang rape defamed an
administrator
at the University of Virginia.

08:23.970 --> 08:26.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The story has since been
discredited.

08:26.539 --> 08:30.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The official sued the magazine,
its publisher
and the reporter.

08:30.310 --> 08:36.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The jury now decides whether to
award her
$7.5 million in damages.

sexual comments

08:41.321 --> 08:43.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about the women's soccer team.

08:43.156 --> 08:48.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An investigation found that
members of the
men's squad routinely rated
female players

08:48.161 --> 08:51.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on appearance and made lewd
comments.

08:51.097 --> 08:54.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They called it the scouting
report and put
it online.

08:54.567 --> 08:58.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials say it's been going on
since at
least 2012.

08:58.638 --> 09:05.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

09:09.716 --> 09:11.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the presidential race.

09:11.184 --> 09:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

09:21.494 --> 09:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Chicago turned out today to
celebrate
the Cubs' first World Series
since 1908.

09:26.800 --> 09:32.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Chicago River was dyed blue
in their honor,
and hundreds of thousands
cheered the team.

09:32.439 --> 09:37.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The players paraded from Wrigley
Field to
a rally downtown.

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
strategists
weigh in on what each campaign
needs to do

09:41.815 --> 09:47.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from now to the election; how
voters in the
swing state of Pennsylvania view
the integrity

09:47.620 --> 09:52.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the election; a closer look
at the people
with few places to turn for
health care coverage

09:52.859 --> 10:02.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in this country; and much more.

10:02.902 --> 10:08.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in this country; and much more.

10:08.541 --> 10:13.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With 72 hours to go, the
presidential candidates
are making their final pitch to
voters this

10:13.346 --> 10:14.547 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weekend.

10:14.581 --> 10:17.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To size up the race I'm joined
by two campaign
veterans.

10:17.817 --> 10:20.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jim Messina is the CEO of The
Messina Group.

10:20.820 --> 10:25.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He served as campaign manager
for President
Obama in 2012.

10:25.325 --> 10:31.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Matthew Dowd, former chief
strategist
for George W. Bush in 2004, he's
now a political

10:31.197 --> 10:32.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
analyst for ABC News.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

10:35.268 --> 10:38.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm going to ask you both to
put yourself
in the shoes of the folks who
are running

10:39.005 --> 10:41.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Clinton and Trump campaigns
this year.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jim Messina, what are you
thinking right now?

10:44.110 --> 10:45.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are you looking at?

10:45.912 --> 10:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM MESSINA, Former Obama
Campaign Manager:
Well, you have about 102 hours
before the

10:48.147 --> 10:49.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
polls close, Judy.

10:49.983 --> 10:53.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you're thinking about two
things, first
of all, getting out your vote,
making sure

10:53.953 --> 10:58.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that what we call the sporadic
voters, the
people who may not vote in this
election,

10:58.658 --> 11:00.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
absolutely have to vote.

11:00.493 --> 11:04.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's where you have spent
the last two
years building field and data
and resources

11:04.397 --> 11:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to target those people and make
sure you can
turn out your vote.

11:08.201 --> 11:12.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the second, equally crucial
thing is,
we're still sitting here with
about 5 percent

11:12.372 --> 11:15.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of America, maybe 7 percent, who
is undecided.

11:15.808 --> 11:19.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And our research shows clearly
that those
people are influenced by what
their friends

11:19.779 --> 11:21.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and family members are saying.

11:21.681 --> 11:25.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you're targeting those
voters with a variety
of different techniques to try
to move your

11:26.019 --> 11:28.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
message in these last 102 hours.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matthew Dowd, so,
you're running
one of these campaigns.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are you thinking?

11:33.893 --> 11:36.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DOWD, Former Bush
Campaign Strategist:
Well, I think, when you look at
it, just objectively,

11:36.963 --> 11:39.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right now, the race leans in
Hillary's direction.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think there's two
different strategies
in play.

11:41.768 --> 11:44.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, if the election were
held today,
he would win the presidency.

11:44.370 --> 11:48.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think, first, she -- it's
the sort of
the political Hippocratic oath.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She wants to do no harm.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She wants to make sure there's
no mistakes
are made.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I agree with Jim.

11:53.279 --> 11:57.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want to employ and engage
their strategy
that is going to be the last 72
or 90 hours

11:57.817 --> 12:01.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this race and turn out the
vote, because,
if she does that, she wins this
race.

12:01.621 --> 12:05.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Donald Trump, he's probably
going to have
to take a few chances if he's
going to be

12:05.892 --> 12:09.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to overcome that small
hurdle that exists
in this race, though a sturdy
hurdle that

12:09.996 --> 12:14.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exists in this race, and he has
to hope something
breaks in the course of this
race, then he

12:14.734 --> 12:18.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can immediately take advantage
of it in the
next 28 or 48 hours.

12:18.838 --> 12:23.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a much more difficult
situation for Donald
Trump today than it is for
Hillary Clinton.

12:23.176 --> 12:27.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Jim Messina,
for something
to break in the last -- we have
already seen

12:27.347 --> 12:32.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
breaks over the course of the
last few weeks,
but what would it take to change
the course

12:32.518 --> 12:33.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of this election at this point?

12:33.720 --> 12:35.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JIM MESSINA: Well, I think a
couple things.

12:35.822 --> 12:37.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One, as we talked earlier,
turnout matters.

12:37.890 --> 12:46.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we have historic turnout
in white precincts,
like Matthew helped President
Bush do in 2004,

12:46.366 --> 12:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that could change the race.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There could be -- people make
mistakes.

12:49.936 --> 12:50.903 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Things happen.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
World events happen.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right before the Brexit vote,
there was an
internal terrorism incident in
the U.K. that

12:56.876 --> 12:58.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fundamentally changed the race.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you're not sure what's going
to happen.

13:00.847 --> 13:04.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you have got to be ready for
whatever
is going to happen, but, more
importantly,

13:04.951 --> 13:06.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stick to your message.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Matthew's right.

13:07.754 --> 13:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's got to turn her vote out
and she's got
stay very, very disciplined.

13:11.290 --> 13:14.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think she's running the
right kind of
campaign to do that.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump is running a much
different campaign.

13:16.863 --> 13:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I don't think the word
discipline has ever
come to mind when you think of
him.

13:20.933 --> 13:24.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's at his best when he
kind of goes
straight at it.

13:24.103 --> 13:27.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think he's going to try
to cause
a little stir and push hard
here.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you saw him yesterday go
right after it.

13:30.977 --> 13:34.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's going to be a
wild and woolly
final four days here.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matthew Dowd, is
that what
you expect, that something --
that there is

13:37.583 --> 13:41.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be -- something is
going to be said
by Donald Trump or that's going
to come out

13:41.621 --> 13:47.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of someplace we don't expect
that could change
the trajectory at this point?

13:47.126 --> 13:52.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MATTHEW DOWD: Well, we
definitely know Donald
Trump will say things in this
that, as Jim

13:53.032 --> 13:57.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says, that are undisciplined
that would normally
rock any other campaign which he
has done

13:57.637 --> 14:00.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
probably a hundred times in the
last 200 days.

14:00.907 --> 14:02.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think it's going to be
that.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's something we have
no idea about.

14:04.911 --> 14:09.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's usually what happens, the
Comey letter
or the Comey report that
happened a week or

14:09.215 --> 14:13.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so ago, which adjusted this race
to Hillary
Clinton's disadvantage by about
two points,

14:13.953 --> 14:17.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
though she still has a solid,
but small lead
in this.

14:17.123 --> 14:21.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, I think, in the end, it is
going to come
down to employing the strategy
you need.

14:21.527 --> 14:25.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think anything is going
to fundamentally
adjust this race.

14:25.164 --> 14:30.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the interesting things,
Judy, in this,
if Hillary Clinton wins this
race, she will

14:30.236 --> 14:36.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
win it with the most diverse
coalition that
anybody's ever been elected by
in presidential

14:36.809 --> 14:38.611 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

14:38.644 --> 14:41.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She will have the most diverse
coalition that
anybody's ever -- even more
diverse actually

14:41.481 --> 14:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than Barack Obama in 2012 and
2008.

14:43.816 --> 14:47.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jim Messina, you
wrote a column
for The New York Times yesterday
in which

14:47.386 --> 14:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you said you really dislike
national polls,
and you referred to something
you call the

14:52.825 --> 14:57.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
golden report that you trusted
when Barack
Obama last won an election.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What exactly was that?

14:59.365 --> 15:02.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM MESSINA: Well, Judy, just to
correct you,
I said I hate public polls.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.403 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

15:04.437 --> 15:06.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM MESSINA: And I think they're
the worst
things in the world, because
most of them

15:06.405 --> 15:08.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are absolutely wrong.

15:08.174 --> 15:13.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the Obama 2012 campaign
and to this
day, we do 62,000 computer
simulations of

15:13.479 --> 15:20.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the election, to simulate every
possible variance,
turnout numbers, economy,
incidents that Matthew

15:20.353 --> 15:22.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was talking about, all of those
things.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we really follow that much
more than public
polls.

15:25.658 --> 15:30.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had a rule in the Obama
campaign: If you
looked at public polls, I would
fire you,

15:30.396 --> 15:32.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because it was a silly waste of
time.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People have got to stay focused.

15:34.333 --> 15:38.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what the golden report
allows you to do
is look at the voters who really
mattered

15:38.171 --> 15:42.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and which of these states really
are up for
grabs, because, Judy, this is
not a national

15:42.408 --> 15:44.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
race right now.

15:44.210 --> 15:47.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Matt knows, we're in eight to
10 states
that are really going to decide
this election.

15:47.246 --> 15:50.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you have 102 hours to affect
the outcome.

15:50.683 --> 15:53.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the one thing you can't
go get more
of is time.

15:53.920 --> 15:57.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so each campaign has got to
be very structured
and disciplined in what they do.

15:57.890 --> 16:02.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, again using his
non-disciplined
campaign, doesn't believe in
data, hasn't

16:02.295 --> 16:04.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
done any of those things.

16:04.096 --> 16:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's just kind of making an
argument to the
country, whereas you see the
Clinton campaign

16:07.567 --> 16:10.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be very strategic in how they're
spending
their time.

16:10.102 --> 16:13.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly, Jim
Messina,
does Hillary Clinton have
something like that

16:13.406 --> 16:14.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now?

16:14.407 --> 16:15.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JIM MESSINA: I think she's got a
better version.

16:15.942 --> 16:18.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think her campaign manager,
Robby Mook,
has done a good job building it.

16:18.878 --> 16:22.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Matthew
Dowd, does Donald
Trump have anything close?

16:22.381 --> 16:27.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DOWD: No, I don't -- the
huge advantage
in the Election Day is Hillary
Clinton's in

16:27.954 --> 16:29.088 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

16:29.121 --> 16:30.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just one thing I will slightly
disagree with
Jim on.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm agnostic about public polls.

16:32.592 --> 16:36.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the campaign that I did in
2004, George
Bush called me up on election
morning and

16:37.029 --> 16:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asked me what was going to
happen, and I said
he would win by two to three
points.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He won by 2.5 points in that
race.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was based on all the things
Jim just
said.

16:45.371 --> 16:48.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for viewers out there who
have not -- who
don't have access to the stuff
that we have

16:48.641 --> 16:51.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
access in a campaign, here is
what I would
counsel.

16:51.077 --> 16:55.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would counsel, look at a broad
average of
the national polls, and that
really tells

16:55.448 --> 16:57.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you what's going on yesterday.

16:57.283 --> 16:58.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Don't worry about the state
polls.

16:58.918 --> 17:02.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The state polls are lagging
indicators of
where this race is.

17:02.221 --> 17:04.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we're
hearing it
from both of you.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we are going to go back and
talk to you
again after the election.

17:07.226 --> 17:09.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matthew Dowd, Jim Messina, great
to see both
of you.

17:09.629 --> 17:10.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DOWD: Sounds great.

17:10.630 --> 17:11.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JIM MESSINA: Thanks.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DOWD: Thanks, Judy.

17:13.499 --> 17:17.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meantime,
allegations of widespread
voter fraud are nothing new, but
they have

17:17.103 --> 17:19.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taken on a renewed intensity in
this campaign.

17:19.338 --> 17:24.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While there's virtually no
evidence for the
claims, Donald Trump and his
supporters insist

17:24.076 --> 17:26.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the voting process is rigged.

17:26.312 --> 17:30.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our William Brangham takes a
look at those
accusations and how they're
being heard by

17:30.082 --> 17:33.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the accused in the battleground
state of Pennsylvania.

17:33.085 --> 17:41.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This past
weekend in Allentown,
Pennsylvania, a group of Donald
Trump's supporters

17:41.193 --> 17:43.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
staged a rally at a busy
intersection.

17:43.296 --> 17:46.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: We're not going to take
it anymore!

17:46.265 --> 17:50.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARROLL HAAS, Trump Supporter:
I'm here to
support Trump, and pray that
Hillary goes

17:50.369 --> 17:53.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to prison for all that she has
done.

17:53.039 --> 17:57.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: These voters
argue Trump
is exactly what the country
needs right now,

17:57.310 --> 18:01.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they think the media isn't
treating him
fairly and is overlooking
Hillary Clinton's

18:01.781 --> 18:03.616 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
flaws.

18:03.649 --> 18:07.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many are also deeply suspicious
that the election
is somehow going to be stolen
from them.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LARRY NAUSBAUM, Trump Supporter:
I think the
machines are rigged.

18:09.889 --> 18:17.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I watched on YouTube how they
rig the machines,
where you vote Republican, and
it turns up

18:17.863 --> 18:19.498 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Democrat.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Trump has made
this same
charge repeatedly over several
months.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We're in a rigged system, folks.

18:23.002 --> 18:25.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're in a rigged system.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're going to watch
Pennsylvania.

18:26.872 --> 18:31.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Go down to certain areas and
watch and study
and make sure other people don't
come in and

18:31.811 --> 18:33.579 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vote five times.

18:33.612 --> 18:37.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There's no
evidence for
the kind of widespread
fraudulent voting that

18:37.183 --> 18:39.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump says is going on right
now.

18:39.251 --> 18:46.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But his supporters, people like
Tom Carroll,
say if you don't believe rigged
voting occurs,

18:46.392 --> 18:47.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just look at Philadelphia.

18:47.660 --> 18:48.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM CARROLL, Trump Supporter: It
is absolutely
rigged.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Philadelphia is a perfect
example.

18:50.129 --> 18:56.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You had wards in 2012 that had
more than 100
percent turnout-

18:56.902 --> 19:03.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY NAUSBAUM: In Philadelphia,
there were
17 districts where there were
100 percent

19:03.242 --> 19:06.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obama votes, which is
statistically impossible.

19:06.445 --> 19:09.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is
exhibit A for their
case.

19:09.582 --> 19:14.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the 2012 presidential
election between
President Obama and Governor
Romney, Obama

19:14.153 --> 19:19.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won Pennsylvania, getting almost
three million
votes, compared to Romney's 2.6
million.

19:19.558 --> 19:26.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in Philadelphia, in these 59
divisions,
known as precincts in most
places, not one

19:26.165 --> 19:30.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
single vote was recorded for
Mitt Romney,
not one.

19:30.436 --> 19:33.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama received 100 percent of
the presidential
votes.

19:33.239 --> 19:35.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AL SCHMIDT, Philadelphia
Election Commissioner:
I was struck the same way that
anyone else

19:35.474 --> 19:39.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was in wondering, how could this
possibly
occur?

19:39.145 --> 19:42.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is the voting system
that we have
in Philadelphia.

19:42.381 --> 19:47.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Al Schmidt is
on the commission
that runs and oversees elections
in Philadelphia.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the only Republican on the
three-person
panel.

19:50.589 --> 19:55.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
After that election, he
investigated: Was
it possible that no one in those
divisions

19:55.628 --> 19:57.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
voted for Mitt Romney?

19:57.463 --> 20:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AL SCHMIDT: I ran around the
city to all these
different precincts to look at,
how could

20:01.434 --> 20:03.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this possibly occur?

20:03.235 --> 20:08.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were chasing down members of
the minority
party and asking, did you in
fact cast your

20:08.441 --> 20:09.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
vote this way or that way?

20:09.675 --> 20:12.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't have to tell us, but
we're looking
into this.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we didn't find a single one.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, you went
around those
areas trying to find Romney
voters, and you

20:16.749 --> 20:17.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
couldn't find any?

20:17.750 --> 20:19.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AL SCHMIDT: Correct.

20:19.618 --> 20:22.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Schmidt says
these particular
precincts are very small,
they're almost all

20:22.888 --> 20:26.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
black, and President Obama
remains hugely
popular.

20:26.592 --> 20:32.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, John McCain back in the
2008 presidential
race got less than 1 percent of
the vote in

20:32.498 --> 20:34.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these same areas.

20:34.333 --> 20:38.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you feel confident that the
fact that
there were no Romney votes
registered in those

20:38.471 --> 20:43.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particular areas is not evidence
that someone
somewhere was taking Romney
votes and throwing

20:43.609 --> 20:44.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them in the trash?

20:44.610 --> 20:46.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AL SCHMIDT: Correct.

20:46.445 --> 20:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even if you set aside
everything I just
said about the fact that you
couldn't find

20:50.516 --> 20:54.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anyone who voted for him, that
the precincts
are very small, so the voting --
the electorate

20:54.487 --> 20:58.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is very similar, you can't
subtract
votes from our voting machines,
period.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You just can't
do it?

21:00.493 --> 21:02.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AL SCHMIDT: You can't.

21:02.294 --> 21:06.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN HANNITY, FOX News: In
inner-city Philadelphia,
Mitt Romney did not get a single
vote.

21:06.866 --> 21:11.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But, still,
that's not how
the story is perceived among
Trump's supporters

21:11.804 --> 21:13.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and certain parts of the media.

21:13.639 --> 21:19.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FOX News has cited
Philadelphia's 2012 results
as clear evidence of fraud
numerous times,

21:19.845 --> 21:25.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
same with other popular
conservative Web sites
like Breitbart, Infowars, The
Blaze.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They all imply votes were
stolen.

21:27.853 --> 21:30.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDREY STREIN, Trump Supporter:
Hopefully,
he can count on your vote this
November.

21:30.089 --> 21:34.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Trump
supporter Audrey Strein
is one of those concerned about
fraud.

21:34.493 --> 21:39.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One poll showed that 49 percent
of Trump supporters
are not confident the vote will
be counted

21:39.798 --> 21:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accurately, compared to just 18
percent of
Clinton supporters.

21:43.369 --> 21:50.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDREY STREIN: If we outnumber
and get people,
everybody to come out and vote,
we can overcome

21:50.242 --> 21:52.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any of the anticipated voter
fraud.

21:52.077 --> 21:55.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: When she's not
running her
roofing company, this mother of
three, wearing

21:55.981 --> 22:02.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her "Adorable Deplorable"
T-shirt, tries to
persuade undecided voters.

22:02.454 --> 22:07.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says voting fraud won't be a
problem in
her small town of Jamison,
Pennsylvania, but

22:07.793 --> 22:11.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she's suspicious about urban
areas like Philadelphia.

22:11.263 --> 22:15.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDREY STREIN: In the cities,
you are going
to have more Democrat majority.

22:15.701 --> 22:21.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you have a dominant
party, there's
no one watching the henhouse.

22:21.106 --> 22:28.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: To understand
how accusations
of possible fraud are being
heard, we talked

22:28.547 --> 22:33.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with voters in West
Philadelphia, the same
place where Romney received zero
votes four

22:33.185 --> 22:34.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
years ago.

22:34.753 --> 22:37.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many saw these accusations as an
attempt at
voter suppression.

22:37.856 --> 22:42.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MANUEL GLENN, Philadelphia:
There is an individual
in this race who wants to make
the process

22:42.728 --> 22:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so dirty, that wants to turn
people off from
the process, that they won't
come out and

22:46.999 --> 22:48.767 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vote.

22:48.801 --> 22:51.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he feels that that's his
path to victory,
because his voters are so fired
up, they're

22:51.537 --> 22:55.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to come out regardless,
rain, sleet,
snow, hell, hell or high water,
return of

22:55.374 --> 22:57.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jesus, they're going to vote.

22:57.176 --> 23:01.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFRED HAZLY, Philadelphia: It
goes back to
World War II, and Joseph
Goebbels, and Hitler

23:01.780 --> 23:08.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the '30s: Tell the biggest
lie you can,
as loud as you can, for as long
as you can,

23:08.554 --> 23:10.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, eventually, someone will
start to believe
it.

23:10.556 --> 23:14.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Greg Spearman
is the Democratic
ward leader for this area.

23:14.093 --> 23:17.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was here in 2012, and he will
be here again
next week on Election Day.

23:18.030 --> 23:21.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I asked him about the racial
undertones of
these accusations.

23:21.967 --> 23:27.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's usually white Republicans
saying this
about minority voting districts.

23:27.373 --> 23:28.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG SPEARMAN, West Philadelphia
Ward Leader:
Sure.

23:28.807 --> 23:30.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think
race has anything
to do with the...

23:30.676 --> 23:32.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GREG SPEARMAN: Sure.

23:32.077 --> 23:35.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Race has something to do with
most things
in America.

23:35.281 --> 23:38.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that's the fire that
Trump is stoking.

23:38.284 --> 23:41.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His buzzwords are targeted for
that mind-set.

23:41.086 --> 23:46.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: David
Thornburgh is president
and CEO of the Committee of
Seventy, a group

23:46.358 --> 23:49.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Philadelphia dedicated to
ensuring clean
and fair elections.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID THORNBURGH, President and
CEO, Committee
of Seventy: And what we really
have in terms

23:51.664 --> 23:56.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of our sense of election fraud
is a series
of anecdotes.

23:56.935 --> 24:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You add all those up, and it
doesn't constitute
the same kind of massive,
systemic fraud that

24:04.977 --> 24:07.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Trump campaign is asserting
is out there.

24:08.013 --> 24:13.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Philadelphia
Elections Commissioner
and Republican Al Schmidt says
he has documented

24:13.185 --> 24:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
isolated cases of voter fraud.

24:15.621 --> 24:20.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wrote this report on examples
from the
2012 primary election.

24:20.526 --> 24:24.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Philadelphia indicted 10 people
for voter
fraud since the report was
published.

24:24.263 --> 24:28.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They amounted to a dozen votes
being improperly
cast across the city.

24:28.367 --> 24:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AL SCHMIDT: It's important to
recognize the
distinction between individual
cases of voter

24:33.772 --> 24:40.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fraud and allegations of
widespread, systematic
vote-rigging, and no one finding
out about

24:40.245 --> 24:43.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it, despite it changing the
outcome of the
presidential election.

24:43.048 --> 24:44.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's pretty far-fetched.

24:44.950 --> 24:48.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Clinton
and Trump campaigns
say they will do everything to
ensure the

24:48.087 --> 24:53.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legitimacy of this election,
both nationwide
and in this critical
battleground state.

24:53.525 --> 24:59.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lawyers and poll monitors from
both parties
will be out in full force next
Tuesday.

24:59.198 --> 25:04.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for black voters here in
Philadelphia,
the accusation that they have
committed fraud

25:04.603 --> 25:07.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and will do so again is
painfully familiar.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE FLETCHER, Philadelphia:
Being a minority,
you expect it.

25:09.408 --> 25:16.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is just what comes -- it just
comes with
skin color and where you live,
so that's just

25:16.982 --> 25:18.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what it is.

25:18.884 --> 25:27.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For the "PBS
NewsHour,"
I'm William Brangham in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

25:27.760 --> 25:38.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The fate of the
Affordable
Care Act is at stake in
Tuesday's election.

25:38.837 --> 25:43.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 20 million people have
gained coverage
through the health insurance
reform law.

25:43.342 --> 25:48.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as special correspondent
Sarah Varney
reports, large gaps still exist.

25:48.046 --> 25:53.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Our story, produced in
collaboration with
our partner Kaiser Health News,
begins in

25:53.152 --> 25:58.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Grundy, Virginia, at a clinic
run by a nonprofit
called Remote Area Medical.

25:58.724 --> 26:03.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a program that's still
surprisingly necessary
in 2016.

26:03.262 --> 26:08.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Sandra Cook got in
line midday
on a recent Friday for dental
care that she

26:08.600 --> 26:11.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wouldn't receive until the next
morning.

26:11.804 --> 26:17.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds more like her showed up
at Riverview
Elementary and Middle School in
Grundy, Virginia,

26:17.409 --> 26:24.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just as volunteers were arriving
by the hundreds
to turn the school into a
makeshift clinic.

26:25.017 --> 26:30.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Many people here in this
southwestern corner
of Virginia struggle to pay for
everyday needs.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that includes basic health
care.

26:31.890 --> 26:36.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDRA COOK, Virginia: There's a
lot of poverty
in this area, and the coal
mines, they went

26:36.061 --> 26:38.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down, and the jobs have gotten
really bad.

26:38.363 --> 26:39.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT KEENE, Virginia: A lot of
people ain't
got no insurance or no income,
and this is

26:39.465 --> 26:42.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the only place they can come to.

26:42.334 --> 26:48.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Just next to the
line, Trey
Justice and his girlfriend set
up a tent,

26:48.140 --> 26:50.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after walking for five hours to
get here.

26:50.576 --> 26:54.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TREY JUSTICE, Virginia: My teeth
and my eyes
are really bad.

26:55.013 --> 26:57.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I got ran over about four year
ago.

26:58.016 --> 27:00.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Don't have no doctors, no
insurance.

27:00.252 --> 27:04.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Six years after
the passage
of the Affordable Care Act, and
despite 20

27:04.990 --> 27:09.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
million more Americans gaining
health insurance,
considerable gaps in health care
remain.

27:09.461 --> 27:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The decision by states like
Virginia not to
expand Medicaid and the lack of
dental and

27:14.366 --> 27:18.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vision coverage even for those
with insurance
has meant that scenes like this
are still

27:18.837 --> 27:20.472 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
playing out.

27:20.506 --> 27:21.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAN BROCK, Founder, Remote Area
Medical:
If you're here to see the
dentist, please

27:21.907 --> 27:23.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
raise your hand.

27:23.709 --> 27:27.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The next morning,
the sun had
yet to rise when Stan Brock
called out the

27:27.579 --> 27:29.314 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
first numbers.

27:29.348 --> 27:32.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAN BROCK: We're going to bring
you in 20
at a time and there's no reason
to rush, OK?

27:32.551 --> 27:34.386 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Plenty of time.

27:34.419 --> 27:38.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Brock founded
Remote Area Medical
in 1985 to bring health care to
people in

27:38.991 --> 27:40.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
developing countries.

27:40.759 --> 27:46.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he expanded the project to
the U.S. when
he realized the depth of the
need here.

27:46.398 --> 27:52.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the weekend, nearly 1,000
teeth will
be pulled, some 400 pairs of
eyeglasses made,

27:52.504 --> 27:59.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and more than one million
dollars in health
care services delivered.

27:59.511 --> 28:03.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gary Owens was one of those
workers laid off
from the coal mines.

28:03.048 --> 28:05.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
At 55, he's uninsured.

28:05.150 --> 28:09.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He tells the volunteer doctor
that his hands
feel numb, his feet burn and old
job injuries

28:10.022 --> 28:10.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
plague him.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GARY OWENS, Virginia: I hurt.

28:12.090 --> 28:13.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I mean, I hurt.

28:13.091 --> 28:14.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's like somebody with my body.

28:14.726 --> 28:16.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It don't feel right, or maybe
it's not right.

28:16.995 --> 28:20.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Owens has paid out
of pocket
in the past for health care, but
he's been

28:20.532 --> 28:24.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unable to afford the blood tests
to figure
out what's wrong with him.

28:24.503 --> 28:30.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The doctors here worry the
reason he recently
lost 25 pounds is that he might
have cancer.

28:30.709 --> 28:36.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Owens lived just 15 miles
away, in Kentucky
or West Virginia, he'd be
covered.

28:36.481 --> 28:41.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State lines are now often the
difference between
poor adults having health
insurance or not.

28:41.553 --> 28:46.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After Kentucky expanded Medicaid
under the
Affordable Care Act, the
percentage of uninsured

28:46.391 --> 28:51.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poor adults dropped from 40
percent to 23
percent in one year.

28:51.430 --> 28:56.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in Virginia, which hasn't
expanded Medicaid,
many low-income adults are still
left to rely

28:56.468 --> 29:02.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on charity care, with Remote
Area Medical
being the most visible and
dramatic.

29:02.608 --> 29:05.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Studies have found that people
in Medicaid
expansion states are more likely
to have a

29:06.011 --> 29:10.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regular doctor, get vaccinated
and receive
treatment for chronic diseases.

29:10.682 --> 29:15.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in states like Virginia,
uninsured poor
adults often must turn to the
emergency room

29:15.287 --> 29:17.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when they need help.

29:17.255 --> 29:21.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back at the school, volunteer
nurse Doreen
Facey-Biggs says the choices
people face seem

29:21.960 --> 29:24.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at odds with America's standing
in the world.

29:24.129 --> 29:25.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOREEN FACEY-BIGGS, Volunteer
Nurse: I'm from
Jamaica.

29:25.964 --> 29:31.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been in this country a
long time, but
I'm still amazed at the
differences and the

29:31.570 --> 29:39.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disparities in health care
services, that,
in this rich country, this First
World country,

29:39.678 --> 29:41.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so many people have no
insurance.

29:41.913 --> 29:46.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: That's the case
for James Love.

29:46.518 --> 29:52.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He lives along a mountain road
with his wife,
tending to his animals and
working multiple

29:52.157 --> 29:53.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
jobs to pay the bills.

29:53.892 --> 29:56.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one in the family has health
coverage.

29:56.194 --> 30:00.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they rely on the Remote Area
Medical events
each year for nearly all of
their dental and

30:00.832 --> 30:02.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vision care.

30:02.401 --> 30:05.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Love has to make tough choices
when it comes
to paying for medications.

30:05.337 --> 30:08.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES LOVE, Virginia: You choose
what you
can afford.

30:08.640 --> 30:16.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you not only have to do it
for you, your
wife, your children, sometimes
your grandparents,

30:16.715 --> 30:18.016 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your parents.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The dismal health
conditions
here are widespread.

30:20.318 --> 30:26.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Diabetes, heart disease and
stroke are endemic,
and smoking and cancer deaths
far exceed national

30:26.124 --> 30:27.259 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
levels.

30:27.292 --> 30:30.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the most common complaint is
painful,
rotting teeth.

30:30.462 --> 30:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Matt Keene had six teeth pulled
at last year's
free clinic, and he's back to
have another

30:34.833 --> 30:36.134 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dozen removed.

30:36.168 --> 30:43.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At 24 years old, he feels a
sharp pain when
he eats or drinks.

30:43.608 --> 30:47.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stan Brock says his pop-up
clinics around
the country continue to overflow
because the

30:47.846 --> 30:51.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Affordable Care Act and public
insurance programs
don't cover dentistry.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STAN BROCK: They need to fix
that.

30:53.585 --> 30:58.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a step in the right
direction, but
it missed out on the thing that
really leads

30:58.390 --> 30:59.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to a lot of problems.

30:59.925 --> 31:04.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Heart disease, diabetes, and so
on all emanate
from things like bad teeth.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: But it's not just
insurance.

31:06.531 --> 31:11.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Poor health habits and poverty
are big factors,
too, says Dr. Terry Dickinson,
head of the

31:11.803 --> 31:14.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Virginia Dental Association and
a longtime
volunteer.

31:14.740 --> 31:16.508 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

31:16.541 --> 31:17.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERRY DICKINSON, Executive
Director, Virginia
Dental Association: The most
product that

31:17.509 --> 31:19.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they can buy is usually the
worse for you.

31:19.878 --> 31:22.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's the highly processed foods.

31:22.514 --> 31:24.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the highly sugared
drinks.

31:24.149 --> 31:28.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of those things are not good
for you either
health-wise or dental-wise.

31:28.453 --> 31:35.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So it's this kind of
conglomeration of things
that are going around in their
lives, that

31:35.193 --> 31:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it makes it very difficult to
break into that
cycle, because it's economic,
it's culture,

31:42.067 --> 31:43.835 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's everything.

31:43.869 --> 31:49.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Young people like
Jesse Charles
are an example of why that cycle
is hard to

31:49.474 --> 31:50.442 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
break.

31:50.475 --> 31:52.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He has no job, no health
insurance.

31:52.477 --> 31:56.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He went to elementary school
here and started
smoking when he was 11.

31:56.281 --> 32:01.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's 21 now and fairly healthy,
but he's taking
part in a rite of passage,
getting his tooth

32:01.186 --> 32:07.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pulled at a Remote Area Medical
event.

32:07.292 --> 32:11.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The dentist warned him that
smoking after
dental surgery is dangerous,
but, on the way

32:11.563 --> 32:13.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
home, he quickly reaches for a
cigarette.

32:13.665 --> 32:16.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSE CHARLES, Virginia: Yes,
it's starting
to hurt a little bit.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They said -- it's smoking.

32:18.436 --> 32:22.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Back at his aunt's
house, Charles
is worn down after the long day.

32:22.240 --> 32:26.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His family has been roiled by
the recent deaths
of his mother and uncle, and he
wishes he

32:26.745 --> 32:28.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had followed their advice.

32:28.146 --> 32:31.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSE CHARLES: They told me to
take care of
my teeth.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's one thing I didn't take
care of.

32:33.585 --> 32:35.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I never did listen.

32:35.487 --> 32:40.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: With few jobs
available in Grundy,
he's thought about moving to a
larger town

32:40.125 --> 32:44.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
60 miles away, where he might
have more control
over his future.

32:44.763 --> 32:48.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Terry Dickinson says stories
like this haunt
him, that somehow the whole
weekend is just

32:48.967 --> 32:49.935 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a stop gap.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.169 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERRY DICKINSON: I think about
that a lot
on the way home.

32:52.504 --> 32:55.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm thinking, so what did we do?

32:55.140 --> 33:01.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because our goal is to stop the
cycle, is
to do something that's
sustainable.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But we're the Band-Aid.

33:02.347 --> 33:04.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're the safety net until that
happens.

33:04.850 --> 33:08.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: When the
volunteers leave town
on Sunday, it's up to free
clinics like the

33:08.887 --> 33:13.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Health Wagon in nearby Wise,
Virginia, to
try to scrape together follow-up
care.

33:13.225 --> 33:14.960 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

33:14.993 --> 33:15.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULA HILL MEADE, Clinical
Director, Health
Wagon: Now, if you will take a
deep breath

33:15.560 --> 33:16.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
every time I touch you.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.129 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: OK.

33:18.163 --> 33:19.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Paula Hill Meade,
a nurse practitioner,
is the Health Wagon's clinical
director.

33:20.031 --> 33:21.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

33:21.833 --> 33:25.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULA HILL MEADE: No one cares
that people
like me are here begging and
saying, I need

33:25.203 --> 33:26.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
somebody to see this patient.

33:26.204 --> 33:27.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Will you please see her?

33:27.205 --> 33:28.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She needs a breast biopsy.

33:28.807 --> 33:29.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can I get her seen?

33:29.808 --> 33:30.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A lot of times, it's just, no.

33:30.809 --> 33:31.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Can she pay this much up front?

33:32.010 --> 33:33.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Well, no, she can't.

33:33.411 --> 33:36.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: She's angry that
health care
has become so political.

33:36.047 --> 33:37.849 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

33:37.883 --> 33:39.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULA HILL MEADE: It really
makes you mad
and it makes you infuriated to
see that they're

33:39.317 --> 33:41.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
up here using this as a
political game.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's sickening to think that
you're dealing
with people's lives like that.

33:45.056 --> 33:49.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: But the bleak
truth in Central
Appalachia is that many here
people are used

33:49.060 --> 33:53.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to waiting, and they expect
little to change
before the Remote Area Medical
event comes

33:53.231 --> 33:58.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back to town next year, once
again bringing
its caravan of volunteers and
promises of

33:58.703 --> 34:00.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
momentary relief.

34:00.505 --> 34:10.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" and
Kaiser Health News,
I'm Sarah Varney in Grundy,
Virginia.

34:10.315 --> 34:18.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the
analysis of Shields
and Brooks.

34:18.890 --> 34:23.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

34:23.228 --> 34:26.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, gentlemen, this is the last
time I get
to ask you this on a Friday.

34:26.464 --> 34:28.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mark, how does this race look?

34:28.700 --> 34:29.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It looks terrific.

34:29.901 --> 34:31.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, it really is.

34:31.536 --> 34:32.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I just want it to keep
going.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't want it to end.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:35.240 --> 34:36.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I wish it was like
baseball.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We could go into extra innings.

34:38.043 --> 34:42.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, I don't think there is any
question the
whole temperature, the whole
atmosphere of

34:42.180 --> 34:47.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the race changed over the last
eight days,
since last we were together,
when -- with

34:47.218 --> 34:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Comey announcement of the
FBI investigation.

34:50.989 --> 34:59.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what had been sort of an
assumed Clinton
victory, and Democrats taking
over the Senate,

34:59.464 --> 35:02.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it was stopped in its
tracks.

35:02.367 --> 35:08.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while I still think she is
the favorite,
and is the favorite, there is
certainly a

35:08.807 --> 35:10.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lot more doubt about the Senate
today.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David.

35:11.176 --> 35:12.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I think
she's the favorite.

35:13.011 --> 35:17.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have a sense that it would
have happened
anyway and that, at the end of
the day, people

35:17.849 --> 35:19.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were going to come home to who
they were.

35:19.617 --> 35:23.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And what's depressed me,
frankly, most about
this race is, we went into this
country a

35:23.121 --> 35:28.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
divided nation, and now the
chasms are just
solidified, so divided along
race, divided

35:28.960 --> 35:32.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
along gender, urban/rural,
college-educated/non-college-edu
cated.

35:32.864 --> 35:35.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can go down the list.

35:35.233 --> 35:39.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, basically, less educated or
high school-educated
whites are going to Trump.

35:39.104 --> 35:40.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It doesn't matter what the guy
does.

35:41.006 --> 35:43.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And college-educated going to
Clinton.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everyone is dividing based on
demographic
categories.

35:45.710 --> 35:49.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, sometimes, you get the
sense that the
campaign barely matters.

35:49.147 --> 35:52.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People are just going with their
gene pool
and whatever it is.

35:52.617 --> 35:56.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is one of the more
depressing aspects
of this race for me.

35:56.755 --> 36:00.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and you say
it almost
doesn't matter what they say.

36:00.558 --> 36:05.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they're going out, Mark, on
-- with some
pretty rough language.

36:06.031 --> 36:10.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She continues to say he's
unacceptable, he
doesn't have the character to be
president.

36:10.101 --> 36:12.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is saying -- continues saying
she needs
to be in prison.

36:12.771 --> 36:17.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Somebody at one of his rallies
today said,
"Execute her."

36:17.042 --> 36:20.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're watching as low as it can
get, aren't
we?

36:21.012 --> 36:22.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

36:22.447 --> 36:27.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Well, I think there's no
question Clinton
-- I'm not sure David's right.

36:27.619 --> 36:30.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's 97 percent right about 48
percent of
the time.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:32.190 --> 36:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: But, no -- but on
whether it
would have narrowed.

36:34.359 --> 36:40.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there was a sense that
she had the
possibility of a decisive
victory.

36:40.632 --> 36:46.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think she, at that point,
wanted, the
Clinton campaign wanted to end
it on upbeat

36:46.838 --> 36:48.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and more positive.

36:48.673 --> 36:52.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is, you have two
candidates, Judy,
we have said time and again, are
personally

36:52.811 --> 36:54.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unfavorable.

36:54.179 --> 36:58.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the spotlight is unkind to
each, whoever's
in that spotlight.

36:58.750 --> 37:03.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when Donald Trump was in the
spotlight,
losing three debates to Hillary
Clinton, and

37:03.555 --> 37:07.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the "Access Hollywood" tape, it
hurt him and
helped her.

37:07.692 --> 37:11.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what happened is, that
changed and sort
of changed her strategy.

37:11.296 --> 37:15.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was trying to shift the
spotlight back
to him, I think inelegantly and
ineffectively,

37:15.900 --> 37:22.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quite frankly, in the last week
by bringing
out the former Miss Universe and
trying to

37:22.707 --> 37:24.042 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do that.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The best closer, quite honestly,
is Barack
Obama.

37:26.978 --> 37:30.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the best closer since
Dennis Eckersley
or Mariano Rivera.

37:30.482 --> 37:31.716 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:31.749 --> 37:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He's just a -- he
really knows
how to close.

37:34.152 --> 37:37.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you want to see somebody do
it well, just
watch Barack Obama.

37:37.889 --> 37:41.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He makes a far better case for
her than she
makes for herself.

37:41.693 --> 37:46.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is sounding the
same theme he
has sounded since May or June of
2015.

37:46.798 --> 37:48.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

37:48.133 --> 37:50.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, well, it's a campaign of
hate.

37:50.635 --> 37:53.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama is a campaign of at least
hope.

37:53.671 --> 37:55.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
At least his first campaign was.

37:55.073 --> 37:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is just a campaign of hate.

37:57.142 --> 37:59.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, people who don't
like Trump
really don't like Trump.

37:59.844 --> 38:01.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I guess I'm among them.

38:01.279 --> 38:04.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we just saw in our report
about the Trump
voters in Pennsylvania.

38:04.616 --> 38:08.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did you see -- when they were
shouting on
the road, did you see anything
nice about

38:08.052 --> 38:09.020 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump?

38:09.053 --> 38:10.021 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

38:10.054 --> 38:11.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Send Clinton to jail.

38:11.055 --> 38:12.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so it's just -- what was it?

38:12.724 --> 38:15.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a Burt Lancaster movie
where he
had love and hate tattooed on
his hands.

38:15.727 --> 38:20.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's just a -- we're in a
psychosis
of what they call negative
polarization, where

38:20.632 --> 38:23.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nobody likes their side, but
they really hate
the other side.

38:23.568 --> 38:25.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it feels like it's just
building and building.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so we have got this cycle.

38:27.438 --> 38:28.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't know if it pops on
Election Day.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I hope so.

38:30.608 --> 38:35.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the idea that Clinton is
finishing this
campaign bringing Miss America
or the Miss

38:35.213 --> 38:38.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Universe to the rallies just
seems wrong to
me.

38:39.017 --> 38:43.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think she should have
pivoted and say,
I am change, I am change,
because people do

38:43.888 --> 38:45.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want some change.

38:45.723 --> 38:48.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to end on this negative
note, I think
especially for her -- he has no
choice -- that's

38:48.693 --> 38:50.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his whole repertoire.

38:50.195 --> 38:52.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, for her, I think it's a
very questionable
way to end the campaign.

38:52.630 --> 38:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Mark,
doesn't that say
that her campaign is really
concerned here?

38:56.034 --> 38:57.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Sure.

38:57.702 --> 39:02.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Judy, Hillary Clinton is in
Detroit,
Michigan, the Friday before the
election.

39:02.807 --> 39:07.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michigan is one of the 18 states
and the District
of Columbia that are the blue
wall, that have

39:07.579 --> 39:13.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
voted Democratic for six
consecutive presidential
elections that are constituting
the 242 of

39:13.818 --> 39:17.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 270 electoral votes that the
Democrats
start with.

39:17.522 --> 39:19.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, no, there's a concern.

39:19.591 --> 39:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can tell more from than
polls -- from
polls -- by the candidates'
schedules, and

39:25.096 --> 39:27.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where they're spending time and
resources.

39:27.298 --> 39:32.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, no, I think there is a real,
real concern.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

39:33.905 --> 39:36.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That sort of goes back to my
point about demographics.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why is she in Michigan?

39:38.109 --> 39:40.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because Michigan was -- we all
thought it
would be Florida, South
Carolina, Nevada,

39:40.979 --> 39:43.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the -- New Hampshire, the
states we have
been talking about.

39:43.681 --> 39:46.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are a lot of white
people in Wisconsin
and Michigan.

39:46.417 --> 39:51.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there's another route
that he has in
ways we didn't expect, because
of the way

39:51.656 --> 39:56.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the demographics are just
driving this election
much more than ideology was in
years past.

39:56.861 --> 40:02.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I hear people
saying, don't
the American people deserve a
better election

40:02.667 --> 40:04.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than this?

40:04.402 --> 40:09.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Couldn't somebody have found a
way, Mark,
for the candidates to talk about
something

40:09.874 --> 40:13.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
uplifting, or was it always
going to come
down to this?

40:13.177 --> 40:15.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Boy, I don't know.

40:15.146 --> 40:19.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you have two candidates
who were highly
unfavorable.

40:19.450 --> 40:25.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the idea of somehow
convincing people
that their perceptions, in some
cases long-held,

40:25.990 --> 40:34.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were inaccurate or incomplete,
the more appealing
route, quite frankly, in the
campaign was

40:34.098 --> 40:37.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to try and hit the other fellow
over the head.

40:37.135 --> 40:38.102 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
David is right.

40:38.136 --> 40:39.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It would be a negative mandate.

40:39.971 --> 40:43.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one other point David makes
that is a
good one, and it's good to
recall historically,

40:43.808 --> 40:49.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Theodore White wrote that
America is Republican
until 5:00 or 6:00 at night.

40:49.747 --> 40:55.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's when working people
and their families
got off work, had supper, and if
America is

40:55.253 --> 40:59.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to vote -- be Democratic,
it's going
to happen between 5:30 and 8:00
at night.

40:59.891 --> 41:03.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That has been totally turned on
its ear.

41:03.561 --> 41:10.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The working-class, blue-collar,
non-college-educated
base of the Democratic Party is
the base of

41:10.968 --> 41:13.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump's campaign this
year.

41:13.705 --> 41:16.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the Democrats are now an
upscale party.

41:16.407 --> 41:20.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, each party, just its message
is totally
out of kilter.

41:20.078 --> 41:25.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democrats have an economic
message that
is directed at people at the
lower end.

41:25.550 --> 41:27.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That has been their cornerstone.

41:27.418 --> 41:30.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Republicans has been more
upscale.

41:30.088 --> 41:35.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now the Republicans have a very
low-scale,
by economic standards, base.

41:35.960 --> 41:36.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump has.

41:36.961 --> 41:39.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's just total conflict,
Judy.

41:39.130 --> 41:43.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it became easier,
quite frankly,
just to hit the guy over the
head than to

41:43.067 --> 41:45.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
try and make the positive case.

41:45.069 --> 41:47.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I would say some
of it was contingent
on Donald Trump being Donald
Trump and changing

41:47.805 --> 41:48.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the rules of the way we talk to
each other.

41:49.006 --> 41:49.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

41:50.007 --> 41:51.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Some of that was
contingent.

41:51.209 --> 41:53.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But a lot of it is baked
structurally into
our society.

41:53.845 --> 41:57.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we had a lot of good
things over the
years that were really good for
America.

41:57.782 --> 41:59.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think globalization has been
really good
for America.

41:59.817 --> 42:02.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the influx of immigrants
has been
really good for America.

42:02.220 --> 42:04.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Feminism has been really good
for America.

42:04.889 --> 42:08.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are a lot of people
who used to
be up in society, because of
those three good

42:08.526 --> 42:12.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things, are now down, a lot of
high school-educated
white guys.

42:12.830 --> 42:14.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they have been displaced.

42:15.032 --> 42:18.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And shame on us for not paying
attention to
that and helping them out.

42:18.703 --> 42:24.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, therefore, as a result,
what happened
was, they were alienated, they
got super cynical,

42:24.308 --> 42:27.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because they really were being
shafted.

42:27.578 --> 42:29.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so they react in an angry
way.

42:29.113 --> 42:32.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, that's not a shock, given
the last 30
or 50 years of American history.

42:32.750 --> 42:37.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, for us going forward,
it's to not
reverse the dynamism of American
society and

42:37.255 --> 42:39.056 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the diversity.

42:39.090 --> 42:43.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's to pay attention to the
people who are
being ruined by it, and so this
doesn't happen

42:43.161 --> 42:44.929 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

42:44.962 --> 42:47.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it means
there is a lot
of sorting out to do after this
election.

42:47.198 --> 42:49.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to ask you both about the
Supreme Court.

42:49.867 --> 42:54.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mark, we have heard from
Republican senators
in the last few weeks that
they're, no matter

42:54.038 --> 42:57.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- if Hillary Clinton is elected
-- this is
an if -- no matter who she puts
forward, they're

42:57.875 --> 43:03.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to make sure that she
doesn't get to
fill that last -- that ninth
seat on the court.

43:03.314 --> 43:06.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How are we to think about the
Supreme Court
anymore?

43:06.184 --> 43:11.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have now gone the better part
of this year,
since Justice Scalia's death,
President Obama's

43:11.689 --> 43:13.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nominee can't get through.

43:13.991 --> 43:18.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Has this become a litmus test of
the litmus
test?

43:18.129 --> 43:26.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, in a year of
irresponsibility,
this is a new depth of
irresponsibility.

43:26.170 --> 43:32.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To say that the constitutional
mandate of
a national election, where
millions of Americans

43:32.944 --> 43:39.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote and pick a new president,
that that president
is -- what that president does,
and under

43:39.183 --> 43:45.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Constitution, of nominating
judges and
justices, is somehow moot, and
I'm not going

43:45.690 --> 43:49.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to pay any attention to it,
that's unacceptable.

43:49.160 --> 43:50.127 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It really is.

43:50.161 --> 43:52.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's beyond irresponsible.

43:52.363 --> 43:53.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's beyond reckless.

43:53.564 --> 43:56.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is really -- I think it's
criminal.

43:56.734 --> 43:58.569 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I basically do.

43:58.603 --> 44:04.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And anybody who holds that
position, I think
it's self-disqualifying for any
public office.

44:04.909 --> 44:06.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We heard it from
John McCain.

44:06.711 --> 44:10.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I guess, this week, there
was a comment
from Richard Burr, the senator
from North

44:10.147 --> 44:11.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Carolina, and others.

44:11.983 --> 44:15.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think Senator
Cruz has put
on -- I think Senator McCain did
walk it back,

44:15.920 --> 44:16.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but you're right.

44:16.921 --> 44:18.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He did say it on radio.

44:18.322 --> 44:22.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: My views about
this are like
Mark's, only stronger.

44:22.126 --> 44:23.160 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:23.194 --> 44:26.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think it's in
the Constitution.

44:26.731 --> 44:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we not only have rules in
the Constitution
the way it should work.

44:29.233 --> 44:31.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president should be able to
nominate justices.

44:31.102 --> 44:33.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we have an etiquette around
the Constitution.

44:33.204 --> 44:36.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what's happened in America
is, that etiquette
has been acidified away.

44:36.641 --> 44:39.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hate the nuclear option of
going for
50 votes in the Senate.

44:39.877 --> 44:43.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if they behave this way,
then I think
the Democrats might be justified
and go to

44:43.981 --> 44:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the nuclear option, because we
actually have
to have a government.

44:46.317 --> 44:49.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to have people confirmed
and put into
office.

44:49.720 --> 44:53.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And -- but it's the degradation
of the way
our government is supposed to
run.

44:53.090 --> 44:55.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I didn't give you
all any warning
about this, but I want to ask it
in the last

44:55.960 --> 44:57.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
minute or so that we have left.

44:57.762 --> 45:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you say to the American
people at
this point about the choice
they're making,

45:01.599 --> 45:03.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about how much difference it
makes?

45:03.200 --> 45:05.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, it does.

45:05.336 --> 45:07.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We know presidents make choices.

45:07.138 --> 45:12.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know -- we have no idea
what's going to
come up on a crisis over the
next four years,

45:12.910 --> 45:17.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unexpected, internationally,
domestically.

45:17.515 --> 45:24.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And who that president is, the
judgment, the
intelligence, the confidence
that that president

45:24.789 --> 45:31.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has can very well determine
whether we survive,
let alone prosper, as a people.

45:31.462 --> 45:32.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

45:32.663 --> 45:34.398 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a job.

45:34.432 --> 45:36.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a job that involves some
patience, a
tolerance for boredom, the
ability to work

45:36.834 --> 45:40.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
friendly with other people, to
herd majorities.

45:40.471 --> 45:42.173 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a job.

45:42.206 --> 45:47.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can't say who I'm going to
vote for,
but one person is clearly
disqualified for

45:47.044 --> 45:48.012 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that job.

45:48.045 --> 45:49.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I can't mention his name.

45:49.480 --> 45:51.115 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:51.148 --> 45:53.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks,
Mark Shields,
we will see you on election
night.

45:53.851 --> 45:58.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by the way, Mark and David
will be back
here, along with other guests,
on election

45:58.756 --> 46:00.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
night for our special coverage.

46:00.391 --> 46:10.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It starts at 8:00 p.m. Eastern,
and we want
you to join us, too.

46:10.801 --> 46:22.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally tonight: A new movie
opening this
weekend is being widely hailed
for its nuanced

46:22.747 --> 46:27.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
storytelling about sexual
identity, race and
upbringing.

46:27.151 --> 46:31.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown spoke with the
filmmakers of
"Moonlight."

46:31.188 --> 46:40.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a life we
don't often
see portrayed in commercial
films, a coming-of-age

46:40.097 --> 46:46.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tale of love and anguish, a
movie that's garnered
critical acclaim for the story
it tells and

46:46.270 --> 46:48.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the beauty and power of its
telling.

46:48.639 --> 46:56.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In "Moonlight," we watch Chiron
growing up
in the Liberty City neighborhood
of Miami

46:56.514 --> 47:00.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the crack epidemic is taking
hold in the
1980s.

47:00.084 --> 47:09.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is young, poor, black, and
coming to terms
with being gay, quietly and
painfully wrestling

47:09.960 --> 47:11.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with these identities.

47:11.829 --> 47:18.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The story is based on the life
of Tarell Alvin
McCraney, who first wrote it as
a play and

47:18.069 --> 47:20.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then the screenplay for the new
film.

47:20.371 --> 47:24.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TARELL ALVIN MCCRANEY,
Screenwriter, "Moonlight":
It's a story that I still feel
like I have

47:24.442 --> 47:26.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to tell, but also that I have to
explore and
to understand.

47:26.777 --> 47:33.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it's a story rooted in
events in my
own life that I'm trying to make
sense of

47:33.217 --> 47:36.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and make sense of the world out
of.

47:36.620 --> 47:41.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, for me, I always am
interested
in trying to get a group of
people to have

47:41.358 --> 47:43.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the same conversation.

47:43.060 --> 47:44.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BARRY JENKINS, Director,
"Moonlight": So,
Tarell and I grew up blocks from
one another.

47:44.862 --> 47:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Director Barry
Jenkins, who
also grew up poor in Liberty
City at the same

47:49.433 --> 47:54.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, and with a mother fighting
addiction,
presents the story in three
separate acts,

47:54.605 --> 47:57.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
using three different actors to
play Chiron.

47:57.708 --> 48:03.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the new Museum of African
American History
and Culture, where the film was
recently screened,

48:03.514 --> 48:07.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he told me he purposely kept the
actors from
watching one another.

48:07.118 --> 48:11.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY JENKINS: One of the themes
of the film
for me is about the way society
is shaping

48:11.422 --> 48:15.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
these young men from our
communities, through
positive reinforcement, negative
reinforcement.

48:15.693 --> 48:17.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is what masculinity looks
like.

48:17.061 --> 48:18.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is what it sounds like.

48:18.829 --> 48:22.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so much time passes between
each story
that I feel like the world has
shaped this

48:22.133 --> 48:24.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
character into a different
person.

48:24.135 --> 48:29.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I wanted to cast different
people to play
the same person, and I wanted
them to be different.

48:29.039 --> 48:33.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We watch Chiron
grow through
high school, tormented by
bullies and his

48:33.611 --> 48:39.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own insecurities, living with a
mother, played
by Naomie Harris, who sinks more
and more

48:39.283 --> 48:40.317 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into addiction.

48:40.351 --> 48:44.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NAOMIE HARRIS, Actress: What's
wrong?

48:44.388 --> 48:46.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ACTOR: Nothing.

48:46.223 --> 48:52.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is a young
man who speaks
more loudly in his looks and
silences than

48:52.129 --> 48:53.764 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in words.

48:53.798 --> 48:56.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY JENKINS: The power of
cinema is that
we get to watch people, you
know?

48:56.200 --> 48:58.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we get to watch people,
like, in close-up.

48:58.836 --> 49:03.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, if there's a scene on
the stage, the
audience can't get right in an
actor's eyes.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But in cinema, they can.

49:05.643 --> 49:09.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, because of that,
because of the
power of the feeling in a
person's eyes, you

49:09.313 --> 49:10.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, they can be doing --
active.

49:10.881 --> 49:13.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can be less active, and yet
revealing
so much more.

49:13.851 --> 49:15.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think of "Moonlight," it's
like an iceberg
film.

49:15.886 --> 49:19.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know the Hemingway phrase,
you know, 10
percent is above water, and 90
percent is

49:19.523 --> 49:20.491 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
below?

49:20.524 --> 49:22.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We flip it upside-down.

49:22.359 --> 49:25.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we want to show you
that 90 percent
below water, but it's moving
very, very slow.

49:25.496 --> 49:27.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know, it's a patient film.

49:27.298 --> 49:31.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the character is revealing
himself by
these terms and his expressions.

49:31.502 --> 49:36.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TREVANTE RHODES, Actor: What you
looking at
me like that for?

49:36.907 --> 49:38.342 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR: What, man?

49:38.375 --> 49:41.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Come on, you just drove down
here?

49:41.812 --> 49:43.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TREVANTE RHODES: Yes.

49:43.614 --> 49:48.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The adult Chiron
is played
by Trevante Rhodes, a one-time
track and field

49:48.819 --> 49:54.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
star at the University of Texas
who only found
his way into acting his senior
year.

49:54.225 --> 49:59.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVANTE RHODES: I think the
beauty of that
scene was Chiron, he didn't
know.

49:59.663 --> 50:04.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: An outgoing and
gregarious
man, he told me how he
approached playing

50:04.201 --> 50:05.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a character so different.

50:06.003 --> 50:10.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVANTE RHODES: So, for me, it
was really
just about walking around L.A.
with the three

50:10.574 --> 50:15.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weeks I had prior to filming
feeling as if
-- feeling as if I had a secret
to hide from

50:15.713 --> 50:17.248 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everyone?

50:17.281 --> 50:19.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You were walking
around feeling
and getting into the character.

50:19.550 --> 50:20.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVANTE RHODES: Walking around
L.A., getting
in the character, walking
around, feeling

50:20.918 --> 50:24.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as if I had this secret, feeling
as if I connected
with someone.

50:24.855 --> 50:26.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They would be able to see
through me.

50:26.557 --> 50:28.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They would be able to see my
insecurities.

50:28.125 --> 50:30.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They would be able to see this
mask that I
was putting up.

50:30.194 --> 50:34.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would be able to see all of
these things,
and they would take the power
away from me,

50:34.331 --> 50:38.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feeling as if I couldn't love
myself, because
Chiron had this self-hate.

50:38.702 --> 50:40.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And because of that, he couldn't
love others.

50:40.504 --> 50:46.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I feel that all of us really
relate to
Chiron in the sense that we all,
at some point,

50:46.043 --> 50:49.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are insecure about something in
our life,
you know?

50:49.213 --> 50:56.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm someone who I try to
make sense of
everything, and I feel like
Chiron tends to

50:56.287 --> 50:58.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do the same thing, just in a
different way.

50:58.222 --> 50:59.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The context is a bit different.

50:59.590 --> 51:01.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NAOMIE HARRIS: And who is you?

51:01.425 --> 51:03.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAHERSHALA ALI, Actor: Nobody.

51:03.227 --> 51:08.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another
compelling character
is Juan, played by Mahershala
Ali, a drug

51:08.198 --> 51:11.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dealer stepping in as a father
figure to the
young Chiron.

51:11.302 --> 51:14.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAHERSHALA ALI: Some boys chased
him in the
cut.

51:15.005 --> 51:16.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's scared more than anything.

51:16.307 --> 51:19.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Juan was based on
someone McCraney
knew as a child.

51:19.710 --> 51:24.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TARELL ALVIN MCCRANEY: It often
pains me to
know that people sort of see
him, and go,

51:24.882 --> 51:26.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
oh, that's unusual.

51:26.650 --> 51:29.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I think -- when I think
back over my
life, I think, oh, but there
have been many

51:29.787 --> 51:35.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
times I have run into many
people like him
who are reflections of him in my
mind.

51:35.626 --> 51:38.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hear other people go, no,
I had a person
in my life like that, too.

51:38.796 --> 51:41.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I keep thinking, well, what
are we doing?

51:41.765 --> 51:43.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why are we silencing that story?

51:43.400 --> 51:47.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why -- what is happening to us
that we're
not seeing him more often?

51:47.137 --> 51:51.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you feel this
is a film
that could have been made five
years ago,

51:51.542 --> 51:53.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
10 years ago?

51:53.344 --> 51:55.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY JENKINS: I mean, the one
thing I can
stand up on is, I couldn't have
made it five

51:55.646 --> 51:57.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
years ago or 10 years ago.

51:57.181 --> 51:59.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I don't think I was
intellectually or emotionally
capable at that point.

51:59.917 --> 52:01.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, he had written the
piece.

52:01.285 --> 52:03.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don't know how many people
you had shared
it with.

TARELL ALVIN MCCRANEY: I'm
shaking my head
because I had it 10 years ago,
and it didn't

52:06.290 --> 52:08.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get made.

52:08.058 --> 52:10.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY JENKINS: I do think that,
right now,
there's a time in this country
when I think

52:10.627 --> 52:14.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, they want to see beyond
the barriers
of their own experience, you
know?

52:14.565 --> 52:19.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that this country is
a place where
many voices are being sought.

52:19.570 --> 52:22.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the voice of this
character is one
in particular that people
haven't heard very

52:22.973 --> 52:23.941 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
often.

52:23.974 --> 52:25.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they're curious.

52:25.776 --> 52:28.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they go and they see
the film, and
they go, that voice is kind of
similar to

52:28.112 --> 52:29.913 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mine.

52:29.947 --> 52:32.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I kind of relate to this guy,
even though
I don't want to sit next to him
on the subway.

52:32.383 --> 52:34.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Maybe I will next time.

52:34.218 --> 52:38.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TARELL ALVIN MCCRANEY: And now I
think we're
in a moment where everyone has
to understand

52:38.188 --> 52:43.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that authenticity is key,
because, when you
come to the table truthfully,
then we can

52:43.927 --> 52:47.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of -- we see that there's
actually -- we
illuminate that there's actually
more room

52:47.631 --> 52:51.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for voices, rather than that
just one voice
that we heard previous.

Week": a roundtable discussion,

53:20.597 --> 53:21.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.
