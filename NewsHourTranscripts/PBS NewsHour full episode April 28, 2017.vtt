security issue

00:10.577 --> 00:13.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

President Trump warns of a

of art.

00:47.680 --> 00:50.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM LOWE, Factum Arte: The idea
is that you
can get someone to understand
the complexity

00:50.950 --> 00:55.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of an object, and you can get
them to read
it in many ways through
encountering facsimile.

00:55.889 --> 01:04.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more

ballistic missile.

01:17.343 --> 01:21.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Korea's military says it
happened early
Saturday, local time.

01:21.281 --> 01:26.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A U.S. government source told
Reuters that
initial indications suggest the
test was a

01:26.119 --> 01:27.854 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
failure.

01:27.954 --> 01:32.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It comes as the U.S. warns that
the North's
nuclear and missile programs are
a growing

01:32.826 --> 01:34.260 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
threat.

01:34.360 --> 01:38.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will return to the North
Korea story right
after the news summary.

01:38.231 --> 01:42.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

01:52.278 --> 01:56.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

continuing resolution is never
anyone's first

02:00.453 --> 02:02.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
choice for funding the
government.

02:02.622 --> 02:05.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
However, this is our best path
forward.

02:05.592 --> 02:11.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This C.R. is very short-term,
very limited
scope and will help us complete
our important

02:11.231 --> 02:12.132 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

02:12.232 --> 02:13.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

shouldn't be
in this situation.

02:15.468 --> 02:19.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We shouldn't have allowed
partisan politics
to once again turn a looming
deadline into

02:19.973 --> 02:27.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a political standoff with,
really, a manufactured
crisis.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Next week,

finish a package to fund the
government through

02:32.085 --> 02:36.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
September 30, the end of the
federal fiscal
year.

02:36.356 --> 02:41.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two U.S. Army Rangers killed in
Afghanistan
this week may have been victims
of friendly

02:41.928 --> 02:43.563 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fire.

02:43.663 --> 02:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were taking part in a raid
on Islamic
State forces in an eastern
province.

02:47.200 --> 02:52.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pentagon said today it is
not clear whether
they were fired on by Afghan
commandos or

02:52.505 --> 02:54.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other American troops.

02:54.707 --> 02:59.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

announced
a major shift in surveillance
policy.

02:59.512 --> 03:04.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It will no longer collect
e-mails or text
messages simply because they
mention a foreign

03:05.051 --> 03:06.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
intelligence target.

03:06.619 --> 03:11.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, only those sent to or
from a target
will be collected.

03:11.157 --> 03:14.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Privacy advocates had pushed for
the change.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump vowed today to
defend gun
rights as he addressed the
National Rifle

03:18.965 --> 03:21.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Association in Atlanta.

03:21.201 --> 03:25.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His appearance at the group's
annual convention
was the first by a sitting
president since

03:25.972 --> 03:28.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ronald Reagan, 34 years ago.

03:28.775 --> 03:34.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump painted a stark
contrast between
his priorities and those of the
Obama administration.

03:34.847 --> 03:39.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
The eight-year assault on your
Second Amendment

03:39.152 --> 03:42.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
freedoms has come to a crashing
end.

03:42.789 --> 03:47.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have a true friend and
champion in the
White House.

03:47.460 --> 03:53.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No longer will federal agencies
be coming
after law-abiding gun owners.

03:53.233 --> 03:59.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The NRA is now
pushing for
federal legislation to make any
state's concealed-carry

03:59.672 --> 04:02.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
permit valid anywhere in the
country.

04:02.942 --> 04:08.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On another issue, the president
served notice
to South Korea today that he
wants to renegotiate

04:08.748 --> 04:12.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
or terminate a free trade
agreement between
the two countries.

04:12.218 --> 04:18.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an interview with Reuters, he
called the
five-year-old deal horrible and
unacceptable.

this month.

death last night
for a murder in 1999.

04:30.470 --> 04:35.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A witness said that Williams
convulsed as
he was administered the first
drug, a sedative.

04:35.575 --> 04:41.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The governor said that
involuntary motions
are a widely-known side effect.

04:41.481 --> 04:45.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former President George H.W.
Bush is back
home tonight from a Houston
hospital.

04:45.818 --> 04:51.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was released after two weeks
of treatment
for pneumonia and then
bronchitis.

04:51.424 --> 04:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The 41st president is 92 years
old.

04:55.094 --> 05:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks edged
lower after
first-quarter growth in the U.S.
turned out

05:00.400 --> 05:02.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be the weakest in three
years.

05:02.635 --> 05:07.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 40 points

The Nasdaq fell one point, and
the S&amp;P 500

05:12.345 --> 05:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, all three indexes
rose 1.5 percent
to 2 percent.

05:18.217 --> 05:22.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the secretary
of state calls for a global
crackdown on North

05:22.755 --> 05:30.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Korea; the pope visits Egypt,
reaching out
to both Christians and Muslims;
laughter in

05:30.530 --> 05:44.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Supreme Court; and much
more.

05:44.143 --> 05:49.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The news that North Korea has
carried out
another missile test is sure to
add to rising

05:49.248 --> 05:54.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tensions with the U.S. Observers
also say
that the country appears to be
preparing to

05:54.420 --> 05:56.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
conduct a nuclear test as well.

05:56.689 --> 06:01.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, for the past two
months, the U.S.
and South Koreans have been
conducting another

06:01.994 --> 06:04.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
large-scale military exercise.

06:04.330 --> 06:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The United Nations took up the
issue today.

06:07.133 --> 06:10.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: For
too long the international
community has been

06:10.436 --> 06:13.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reactive in addressing North
Korea.

06:14.073 --> 06:15.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those days must come to an end.

06:15.975 --> 06:20.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The warning from
Secretary
of State Rex Tillerson came at
the U.N. Security

06:20.480 --> 06:22.315 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Council.

06:22.415 --> 06:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said it is time for painful
new sanctions
to make North Korea give up its
nuclear and

06:26.953 --> 06:28.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
missile programs.

06:28.955 --> 06:32.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: Failing to act
now on the most
pressing security issue in the
world may bring

06:32.592 --> 06:34.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
catastrophic consequences.

06:34.360 --> 06:39.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
has pressed
China to help rein in the North,
tweeting

06:39.399 --> 06:44.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just last week, "If they want to
solve the
North Korean problem, they
will."

06:44.670 --> 06:49.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Tillerson said yesterday
that China may
impose its own sanctions.

06:49.308 --> 06:52.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Beijing wouldn't confirm that
today.

06:52.512 --> 06:57.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, Foreign Minister Wang
Yi urged a
return to multination peace
talks.

06:57.683 --> 06:59.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WANG YI, Chinese Foreign
Minister (through
translator) (through
translator): China is

06:59.819 --> 07:02.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not a focal point of the problem
on the peninsula.

07:02.488 --> 07:06.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the key to solving the
nuclear issue there
doesn't lie in the hands of
China.

07:06.225 --> 07:11.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tillerson had
said in an interview
yesterday that the U.S. would be
open to direct

07:11.664 --> 07:15.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talks with North Korea, a shift
in American
policy.

07:15.635 --> 07:19.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Today, he clarified the
conditions necessary
for that to take place.

07:19.906 --> 07:23.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: North Korea must
understand
North Korea must take concrete
steps to reduce

07:23.376 --> 07:29.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the threat that its illegal
weapons programs
pose to the United States and
our allies before

07:29.682 --> 07:31.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we can even consider talks.

07:31.617 --> 07:36.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Earlier this
week, President
Trump's top advisers said the
administration's

07:36.522 --> 07:38.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
first course is diplomacy.

07:38.391 --> 07:44.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a Reuters interview the
president said
he'd love to solve things
diplomatically.

07:44.330 --> 07:48.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he also said it's very
difficult, and
added his own warning that:

07:48.501 --> 07:55.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: There is a chance
that we could
end up having a major, major
conflict with

07:55.475 --> 07:57.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
North Korea.

07:57.410 --> 08:01.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. has
already sent an
aircraft carrier group to the
Korean Peninsula

08:01.881 --> 08:05.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a show of force against the
North and its
leader.

08:05.885 --> 08:11.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Pentagon said today that
a U.S. missile
defense system, known as THAAD,
that it recently

08:12.058 --> 08:15.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sent to South Korea will be
operational soon.

08:15.728 --> 08:18.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
China, in turn, said it still
objects.

08:18.831 --> 08:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WANG YI (through translator): I
want to reiterate
China's firm opposition against
U.S. deployment

08:23.803 --> 08:27.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a THAAD anti-missile system
in the Republic
of Korea.

08:27.206 --> 08:31.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a move that seriously
undermines the
strategic security of China and
other countries

08:31.244 --> 08:33.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the region.

08:33.145 --> 08:36.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
also suggested
in his interview that South
Korea should pay

08:37.049 --> 08:40.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the system, an estimated $1
billion.

08:40.953 --> 08:47.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
South Korean officials
responded, saying,
the United States will bear the
cost.

08:47.393 --> 08:49.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For more on all of this, we get
two views.

08:49.862 --> 08:56.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Merrill had a 27-year
career at the State
Department, where, from 2001 to
2014, he was

08:56.536 --> 09:01.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the chief of the Northeast Asia
Division of
the Bureau of Intelligence and
Research.

09:01.307 --> 09:05.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now a visiting fellow at
Johns Hopkins
University.

09:05.144 --> 09:10.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Balbina Hwang served in the
State Department
during the George W. Bush
administration.

09:10.449 --> 09:14.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She is now a visiting professor
at Georgetown
University.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

09:16.289 --> 09:20.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were planning to have this
discussion before
we learned just within the hour,
Balbina Hwang,

09:20.326 --> 09:22.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about this latest missile test.

09:22.962 --> 09:25.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But widen it out for us.

09:25.131 --> 09:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the state of U.S.-North
Korean relations
right now?

09:28.801 --> 09:30.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What track are we on?

09:30.770 --> 09:32.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO-BALBINA HWANG, Senior
Policy Analyst,
Heritage Foundation: I actually
don't think

09:32.138 --> 09:34.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it's nearly as tense as
everybody is making
it out to be.

09:34.540 --> 09:38.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I understand why President
Trump is saying
that there is a potential for a
major, major

09:38.844 --> 09:40.646 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
conflict.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have to remember there's
always been
that potential since 1953, when
the Korean

09:43.916 --> 09:45.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
War ended essentially in
armistice.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, are we
overplaying this,
John Merrill?

09:48.754 --> 09:53.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MERRILL, Johns Hopkins
University: There
might be an element of that, of
Mao-Maoing

09:53.192 --> 09:55.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
(ph), if you could call it that.

09:55.194 --> 10:04.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think he's trying to
Chinese more energized
and he's trying to convey a
sense of imminent

10:04.236 --> 10:13.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
possible threat to the North
Koreans that
there is a military option if
all else fails.

10:13.746 --> 10:16.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's brinkmanship on all
sides.

10:16.749 --> 10:20.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that a wise
course to be
pursuing right now?

10:20.353 --> 10:23.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BALBINA HWANG: Well, again, I
think it's understandable
why.

10:23.255 --> 10:27.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I agree with John certainly
that it's
partially brinkmanship and about
signaling.

10:27.927 --> 10:31.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I worry about right now is
not conflict
with North Korea.

10:31.130 --> 10:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I actually think that there is
going to be
trouble with South Korea.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think we have to focus on
this.

10:36.302 --> 10:42.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And really the solution has got
to include
and has to have the leadership
and input of

10:42.274 --> 10:45.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Koreas on the resolution
of the North
Korean nuclear issue.

10:45.378 --> 10:49.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How is the
relationship with
the South more of a worry, a
threat?

10:50.082 --> 10:54.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BALBINA HWANG: Well, because I
think part
of this brinkmanship is exactly
as John said.

10:54.553 --> 10:59.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It is indeed to try to
essentially make the
North Koreans understand that
the U.S. is

10:59.592 --> 11:03.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very serious this time, as we
have been for
20 years.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's also to get China to
listen.

11:05.998 --> 11:11.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But China -- and I think, John,
China's reaction
to the deployment of THAAD in
South Korea

11:12.004 --> 11:13.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is indicative of this.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think South Korea is
stuck in the
middle.

11:15.708 --> 11:21.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And given that,
with South
Korea stuck in the middle, John
Merrill, how

11:21.447 --> 11:25.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does the U.S. -- how do you see
the U.S. maneuvering
from here, from this point
forward?

11:26.052 --> 11:28.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because the North has been
making provocative
statements.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump administration has
been making provocative
statements.

11:32.091 --> 11:38.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MERRILL: I think people
should try to
cool the situation to the extent
possible.

11:38.497 --> 11:43.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There's going to be a new
government in Seoul
think on the 9th of next month.

11:43.903 --> 11:44.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They have an
election coming
up.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN MERRILL: Yes.

11:46.138 --> 11:48.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the president will be
installed immediately.

11:48.708 --> 11:53.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's a little unseemly
to rush a THAAD
battery in, in the dead of
night.

11:53.746 --> 11:56.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is the
missile defense
system.

11:56.515 --> 11:57.383 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

11:57.483 --> 11:58.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN MERRILL: Yes.

11:58.484 --> 11:59.385 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

11:59.485 --> 12:00.386 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

12:00.486 --> 12:01.754 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

12:01.854 --> 12:03.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's serious questions
about whether
the thing works.

12:03.789 --> 12:05.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And certainly the new government
would like
to probably have a chance to
review the system

12:05.391 --> 12:06.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before it commits to it.

12:06.826 --> 12:08.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that?

12:08.627 --> 12:12.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BALBINA HWANG: I'm far less
concerned about
-- I don't think it's
surreptitious.

12:12.698 --> 12:14.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think these plans were already
in place.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What concerns me is that, on the
one hand,
we're trying to send the message
to China

12:18.204 --> 12:20.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and to North Korea that we're
serious.

12:20.806 --> 12:24.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, at the same
time this is
all happening, and Secretary
Tillerson and

12:24.677 --> 12:29.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump are emphasizing
the strength
of the alliance as the last
defense against

12:29.915 --> 12:35.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a major conflict with North
Korea, then, unfortunately,
President Trump also announces
that South

12:35.321 --> 12:38.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Korea should be responsible for
paying up
to $1 billion for it.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that's what sends
the mixed signals,
and that's what worries me.

12:41.894 --> 12:46.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me turn you,
John Merrill,
to what we have heard from
Secretary Tillerson.

12:46.766 --> 12:52.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said in the interview, an
interview yesterday
with NPR, it appeared that he
was saying that

12:52.805 --> 12:57.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.S., this administration is
open to direct
talks with North Korea.

12:57.409 --> 13:02.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then he went on to say that
the North
would have to have the right
policy, so to

13:02.481 --> 13:03.382 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
speak.

13:03.482 --> 13:04.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Today, he hardened that.

13:05.017 --> 13:08.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It sounded like he was saying
there had to
be preconditions in place.

13:08.654 --> 13:14.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How important is that discussion
about whether
there will or won't be direct
talks with the

13:14.160 --> 13:15.427 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
U.S.?

13:15.528 --> 13:17.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MERRILL: I think, if there
are direct
talks, it's huge.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a major development.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before this, we have always said
that we're
only going to talk to them in
the context

13:24.036 --> 13:25.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the six-party talks process.

13:26.071 --> 13:32.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if that's really by the
boards, if we're
prepared for direct
negotiations, that's great.

13:32.311 --> 13:36.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I liked what he said yesterday
better than
what he said today.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why?

13:37.349 --> 13:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN MERRILL: For the reasons
that you mentioned.

13:39.685 --> 13:45.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because he said
-- it sounded
more clear that he was open to
direct...

13:45.157 --> 13:46.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN MERRILL: Yes, exactly.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To direct talks.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.994 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What about this?

13:49.094 --> 13:51.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BALBINA HWANG: I think this
whole debate about
engagement, not engagement, is
it right or

13:51.897 --> 13:56.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wrong, do we need preconditions
or no preconditions,
I think is a little bit of a red
herring.

13:56.402 --> 13:59.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think what's actually very
critical is this.

13:59.171 --> 14:03.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the U.S. presidents have at
some point
understood that they will try to
negotiate

14:03.976 --> 14:05.144 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with North Korea.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, negotiations take more
than one party.

14:07.880 --> 14:11.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just as it takes two to tango,
it takes two
to negotiate.

14:11.217 --> 14:17.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And North Korea very
specifically denied every
overture by President Obama for
eight years

14:17.556 --> 14:20.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to enter into any kind of talks,
number one.

14:20.492 --> 14:24.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number two, the six-party talks
were actually
very critical.

14:24.630 --> 14:30.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Ambassador Christopher Hill,
as you know,
who led the talks, his point was
that it established

14:30.436 --> 14:36.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that multilateral negotiations
are the key,
and that every regional player
has to be involved,

14:36.475 --> 14:38.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and most importantly South
Korea.

14:38.510 --> 14:43.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think now what's happening
is, this
idea of direct talks basically
precludes the

14:44.083 --> 14:45.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
role of South Korea.

14:45.985 --> 14:50.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John Merrill,
are we talking
about a solution here that could
lead to the

14:50.990 --> 14:55.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North eventually getting rid of
their nuclear
weapons, which is what the
administration

14:55.628 --> 14:56.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
says is their goal?

14:56.996 --> 14:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MERRILL: That is going a
very difficult
hill to claim.

14:59.999 --> 15:06.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the moment, I think the most
we can hope
for is perhaps a freeze on
testing, a freeze

15:06.739 --> 15:09.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on deployment of new systems.

15:09.375 --> 15:16.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would just remind Balbina that
the United
States is responsible for this
whole issue.

15:16.982 --> 15:22.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At one time, we had 700 or so
tactical nuclear
weapons in South Korea down at
Kunsan and

15:22.721 --> 15:24.490 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up along the DMZ.

15:24.590 --> 15:28.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the chickens kind of are
coming home to
roost now.

15:28.227 --> 15:30.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's
certainly gotten
all of our attention.

15:30.829 --> 15:31.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN MERRILL: That's for sure.

15:31.997 --> 15:33.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We thank both of
you coming
in.

15:33.899 --> 15:37.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know we're going to be to
continuing
to report on it, and you're
going to continue

15:37.102 --> 15:38.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to watch it.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Merrill, Balbina Hwang,
thank you.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BALBINA HWANG: Thank you.

15:41.540 --> 15:49.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN MERRILL: Thank you, Judy.

15:49.915 --> 16:01.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is the first
papal trip
to Egypt since Pope John Paul II
in 2000.

16:01.994 --> 16:07.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pope Francis' visit to Cairo
today comes at
a time when Egypt's Christians
are under attack,

16:07.333 --> 16:10.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the so-called Islamic State
is emboldened.

16:10.936 --> 16:12.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has our story.

16:12.938 --> 16:17.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Pope Francis
received a
red carpet welcome, but security
was on high

16:17.710 --> 16:19.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
alert across the Egyptian
capital.

16:19.645 --> 16:24.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, he insisted on driving to
the presidential
palace in a simple unarmored
blue Fiat.

16:24.717 --> 16:29.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: He is trying to prove to
the world
that Egypt is still safe, no
matter what terrorism

16:29.588 --> 16:31.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is trying to do in our country.

16:31.924 --> 16:36.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Just three
weeks ago, 45
people died when the Islamic
State bombed

16:36.161 --> 16:39.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Christian churches in two
Egyptian cities
on Palm Sunday.

16:39.565 --> 16:45.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, in December, an ISIS
suicide bomber killed
25 people at Cairo's main Coptic
Christian

16:45.237 --> 16:46.805 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cathedral.

16:46.905 --> 16:49.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a video message before his
arrival, Francis
called for unity and tolerance.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through
translator): I hope that this
visit will be

16:53.412 --> 16:58.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an embrace of consolation and of
encouragement
to all Christians in the Middle
East, a message

16:58.851 --> 17:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of fraternity and reconciliation
to all children
of Abraham, particularly in the
Islamic world.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The pontiff's
first stop
was a meeting with Egyptian
President Abdel

17:08.027 --> 17:09.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Fattah El-Sisi.

17:09.895 --> 17:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The former general came to power
after a 2013
coup that ousted Mohammed Morsi
and banned

17:14.700 --> 17:16.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Muslim Brotherhood.

17:16.502 --> 17:20.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Francis also took part in a
peace conference
to bring Muslims and Christians
together.

17:20.472 --> 17:25.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
POPE FRANCIS (through
translator): To counter
effectively the barbarity of
those who foment

17:25.511 --> 17:30.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hatred and violence, we need to
accompany
young people, respond to the
incendiary logic

17:31.050 --> 17:34.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of evil by patiently working for
the growth
of goodness.

17:34.153 --> 17:39.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The day
concluded with a
meeting with the leader of
Egypt's Coptic

17:39.425 --> 17:41.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Christians.

17:41.493 --> 17:44.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on what these leaders
hope to achieve
together, I'm joined by Tarek
Masoud, a professor

17:45.030 --> 17:47.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government.

17:47.199 --> 17:51.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Mr. Masoud, let's start
with this recent
violence that we have been
seeing against

17:51.270 --> 17:52.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Coptic Christians.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this something new or is this
something
that Christians in Egypt have
had to deal

17:54.740 --> 17:56.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with forever?

17:56.575 --> 17:57.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TAREK MASOUD, Assistant
Professor of Public
Policy, Harvard University: Hi,
Hari.

17:57.342 --> 17:59.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think it's the latter.

17:59.211 --> 18:03.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's something that has really
plagued the
Christian community in Egypt for
a very long

18:03.715 --> 18:05.451 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

18:05.551 --> 18:08.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Under Hosni Mubarak, the
president who was
overthrown in 2011, there had
been violence

18:08.887 --> 18:10.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against Christians.

18:10.722 --> 18:14.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the military took over in
Egypt in 2011,
there was violence against
Christians.

18:14.159 --> 18:18.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the Muslim Brotherhood was
in charge
for a brief moment in Egypt,
there was violence

18:18.163 --> 18:19.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against Christians.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that violence against
Christians in Egypt
continues today under the
government of Abdel

18:23.168 --> 18:24.937 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Fattah El-Sisi.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Just to put it
in a little
context, what's the standing of
Christians

18:28.006 --> 18:29.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in society, or how much does it
matter?

18:29.942 --> 18:32.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAREK MASOUD: Oh, it matters a
great deal.

18:32.644 --> 18:37.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, Hari, the word for --
most Egyptian
Christians are called Coptic
Christians.

18:37.816 --> 18:42.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the word Copt has the same
etymological
root as the word Egypt.

18:42.621 --> 18:47.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, Copt -- the Coptic
Church is the
world's oldest Christian church.

18:47.826 --> 18:51.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Coptic Christians are
indigenous to
Egypt.

18:51.830 --> 18:58.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm a Muslim, but I'm clearly
descended from
people who converted from
Christianity around

18:58.804 --> 19:00.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the 11th century.

19:00.472 --> 19:06.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So Christians are really an
inextricable part
of the fabric of Egyptian life.

19:06.578 --> 19:12.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is, particularly
since the 1970s,
that society has become
increasingly Islamized,

19:12.651 --> 19:17.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Christians have been seen
as the other,
and there have been a lot of
attempts to delegitimize

19:17.422 --> 19:18.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them, discriminate against them.

19:19.057 --> 19:21.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now we're seeing acts of
violence against
them.

19:21.627 --> 19:25.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what's the
strategic
value for ISIS to carry out
these acts of

19:25.697 --> 19:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violence against this small
minority?

19:27.933 --> 19:33.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TAREK MASOUD: Well, so
Christians in Egypt
are between 5 and 15 percent of
the Egyptian

19:33.438 --> 19:35.307 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
population.

19:35.407 --> 19:38.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the fact that we don't know
how much of
the population they are is in
itself a problem.

19:39.044 --> 19:43.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what ISIS wants to do by
attacking Christians
and Christian churches is two
things.

19:43.916 --> 19:47.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, they want to delegitimize
the Egyptian
regime.

19:47.586 --> 19:50.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After all, President Sisi came
to power promising
stability.

19:50.956 --> 19:55.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so these kinds of
spectacular acts of
violence merely underscore his
inability to

19:55.527 --> 19:57.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
provide that stability.

19:57.429 --> 20:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing they want to do
is, they want
to paint the government as
somehow not just

20:01.934 --> 20:03.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
non-Islamic, but anti-Islamic.

20:04.036 --> 20:08.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when they attack Christians,
and the government,
as it should, does things to
defend the Christian

20:09.041 --> 20:13.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community, such as putting armed
guards around
churches or the president making
statements

20:13.312 --> 20:17.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about how the government -- the
people should
-- there should be no
discrimination against

20:17.849 --> 20:22.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Copts and no violence against
Copts, it makes
it possible for Islamic radicals
to point

20:23.021 --> 20:27.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the government and say to
Egyptians, look
at these guys, they're on the
side of Christians,

20:27.159 --> 20:31.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they care more about Christians
than they
do about the average Muslim
Egyptian.

20:31.296 --> 20:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, is it part
of a larger
strategy for ISIS then in the
region?

20:34.967 --> 20:37.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAREK MASOUD: It may be.

20:37.302 --> 20:42.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, everywhere that ISIS
operates, they
try to polarize societies,
foment sectarian

20:42.774 --> 20:44.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and religious dissension.

20:44.610 --> 20:49.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing to note, though,
again that
the problem of violence and
discrimination

20:49.147 --> 20:55.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Copts in Egypt far predates
ISIS and
far predates the government of
President Sisi.

20:55.354 --> 20:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's not just a reflection
of ISIS strategy.

20:57.789 --> 21:00.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's a reflection of deep
dysfunctions in
Egyptian society.

21:00.525 --> 21:03.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, I
want to ask about
this image that is circulating
today.

21:03.996 --> 21:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is of the pope embracing an
imam there
in Egypt.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It almost seems like there's a
marketing challenge.

21:12.004 --> 21:16.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will an image like that travel
as far and
as fast as some of these ISIS
videos make

21:16.174 --> 21:17.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it throughout the Muslim world?

21:17.542 --> 21:19.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAREK MASOUD: One really hopes
so.

21:19.378 --> 21:24.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing that's really been
remarkable about
Pope Francis is that he really
isn't just

21:24.182 --> 21:26.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the pope of the world's
Catholics.

21:26.218 --> 21:31.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He really seems to be the pope
of all peoples,
and particularly the world's
downtrodden and

21:31.990 --> 21:33.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disadvantaged.

21:33.825 --> 21:37.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think one thing that's
worth noting
is that, in his statement, the
pope called

21:37.729 --> 21:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the Egyptian government to do
more to respect
human rights.

21:41.667 --> 21:45.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he wasn't just talking about
the human
rights of Egypt's Christians,
but he was talking

21:45.337 --> 21:47.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the human rights of all
Egyptians.

21:47.205 --> 21:51.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one hopes that those kinds
of messages
will diffuse throughout the
Muslim world.

21:51.276 --> 21:53.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Tarek Masoud
from Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government,

21:53.945 --> 21:55.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thanks so much.

21:55.547 --> 22:02.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAREK MASOUD: Thank you, Hari.

22:02.888 --> 22:10.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:10.162 --> 22:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields
and David Brooks analyze the
first 100 days

22:14.166 --> 22:21.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Trump administration;
preserving culture
and history using exact
replicas; self-made

22:21.840 --> 22:25.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
myth -- a millionaire reflects
on the help
he got that goes unacknowledged.

22:26.044 --> 22:32.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: The U.S. Supreme
Court's final
case this term was expected to
be a highly

22:33.085 --> 22:38.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
technical argument on
immigration law, but
it wound up pulling back the
curtain a little

22:38.523 --> 22:42.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the justices' personalities,
and how they
interact with each other.

22:42.661 --> 22:46.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Yang has the details of
listening in
on court arguments.

22:46.164 --> 22:50.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Here to walk us
through some of
the key moments during
Wednesday's oral arguments

22:50.736 --> 22:52.304 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is Robert Barnes.

22:52.404 --> 22:56.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has covered the Supreme Court
for The Washington
Post for more than a decade.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he also had the misfortune
of being my
editor at The Post.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.444 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:59.544 --> 23:00.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But, Bob, thanks for
coming in.

23:00.912 --> 23:02.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT BARNES, The Washington
Post: It's good
to be here.

23:02.247 --> 23:04.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In a nutshell, Bob,
what was this
case about?

23:04.182 --> 23:09.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT BARNES: Well, this is a
case about
a woman from Bosnia who claimed
persecution,

23:09.688 --> 23:14.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was admitted to this country,
became a naturalized
citizen.

23:14.693 --> 23:18.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then it turned out she had
lied on some
of her applications.

23:18.163 --> 23:22.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Specifically, she had said that
her husband
was trying to avoid military
service.

23:23.001 --> 23:30.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It turned out he had been in a
Bosnian militia
unit that had been charged with
some war crimes.

23:30.275 --> 23:35.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And the woman's
attorney went first,
since she's the petitioner in
this case.

23:35.447 --> 23:37.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How did that argument go?

23:37.349 --> 23:41.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT BARNES: The real fact
here was, does
it matter if something you lie
about on your

23:41.987 --> 23:46.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
application is material to the
fact that you
got citizenship?

23:46.992 --> 23:49.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the law is not specific
about that.

23:49.227 --> 23:51.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It doesn't say that it has to be
relevant.

23:52.063 --> 23:54.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It says that you can't lie.

23:54.332 --> 24:00.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the government had taken
the position
that any lie would be reason for
it to move

24:00.138 --> 24:04.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against someone to take away
their citizenship
if they want.

24:04.309 --> 24:08.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the lower courts agreed,
said that, no,
the federal government doesn't
have to prove

24:09.014 --> 24:12.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it was relevant to her
getting it, just
that she had lied.

24:12.584 --> 24:16.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the question for the
court was, is
that the right thing or not?

24:17.088 --> 24:19.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that the right standard?

24:19.191 --> 24:22.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And then, as you
wrote in The Washington
Post, things got really
interesting when they

24:22.627 --> 24:25.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turned to the government's
attorney, Robert
Parker.

24:25.864 --> 24:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chief Justice John Roberts made
a personal
confession.

24:28.467 --> 24:32.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN ROBERTS, Chief Justice of
the U.S. Supreme
Court: Some time ago, outside
the statute

24:32.471 --> 24:35.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of limitations, I drove 60 miles
an hour in
a 55-mile-an-hour zone.

24:35.607 --> 24:37.008 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

24:37.108 --> 24:39.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ROBERT PARKER, Justice
Department Attorney:
I'm sorry to hear that.

24:39.811 --> 24:44.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN ROBERTS: I wasn't arrested.

24:44.282 --> 24:51.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, you say if that I answer
that question
no, 20 years after I was
naturalized as a

24:51.122 --> 24:54.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizen, you can knock on my
door and say,
guess what, you're not an
American citizen

24:54.226 --> 24:56.061 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
after all.

24:56.161 --> 25:00.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT BARNES: Well, the chief
justice wasn't
comparing speeding to a war
crime, but what

25:00.665 --> 25:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was saying is, what's the
logical extension
of this?

25:03.668 --> 25:09.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the government says that
someone can lose
their citizenship for lying
about anything,

25:09.808 --> 25:12.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
then how far does that go?

25:12.444 --> 25:17.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does it go to even something as
mundane as
speeding which you didn't fess
up?

25:17.883 --> 25:23.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And he had not said
anything in
the arguments with the woman's
attorney; is

25:23.255 --> 25:24.155 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that right?

25:24.256 --> 25:25.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT BARNES: That's right.

25:25.991 --> 25:28.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Sometimes, when the chief
justice is quiet
during one part of the argument,
if you're

25:28.793 --> 25:33.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the lawyer getting up, you need
to be worried,
because it means that he may
agree with that

25:34.032 --> 25:36.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
side and he's ready to pounce on
you.

25:36.635 --> 25:39.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's pretty much what the
chief justice
did to this poor government
lawyer.

25:39.971 --> 25:44.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And then on that
point of what's
relevant and what's not
relevant, there was

25:44.109 --> 25:47.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an exchange involving Justice
Elena Kagan.

25:47.779 --> 25:49.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, let's take a listen to that.

25:49.214 --> 25:53.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT PARKER: I mean, you could
lie about
your weight, let's say.

25:54.052 --> 25:58.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're embarrassed that you
weigh 170 pounds,
and so you claim that you weigh
150.

25:58.189 --> 26:02.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, remember, this has to be a
lie under
oath after you have sworn to
tell the truth,

26:02.794 --> 26:05.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and you're deliberately lying
about something.

26:05.697 --> 26:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It calls into question the
veracity of your
other answers.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is very important in
the naturalization
process.

26:11.036 --> 26:11.937 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

26:12.037 --> 26:12.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT PARKER: I'm sorry.

26:13.038 --> 26:14.873 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Go ahead.

26:14.973 --> 26:15.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELENA KAGAN, Associate Justice,
U.S. Supreme
Court: You will be glad to know
I don't have

26:15.874 --> 26:17.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
another of these questions for
you.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.311 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:19.411 --> 26:22.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELENA KAGAN: Although I am a
little bit horrified
to know that every time I lie
about my weight,

26:22.380 --> 26:23.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it has those kinds of
consequences.

26:24.049 --> 26:24.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:25.050 --> 26:27.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT PARKER: Only under oath.

26:27.519 --> 26:29.321 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ELENA KAGAN: Yes.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We should point out
that Parker
wasn't referring specifically to
Justice Kagan.

26:32.857 --> 26:33.758 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

26:33.858 --> 26:35.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBERT BARNES: That's right,
exactly right.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No, again, it was the same
point.

26:37.929 --> 26:42.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what justices like to do is,
they keep
spinning these ideas out.

26:42.467 --> 26:45.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What about this, what about
this, what about
this?

26:45.437 --> 26:50.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if it's the lawyer in a
position where
they have got to defend
something -- you know,

26:50.208 --> 26:54.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we should point out too, this is
a long-held
government view.

26:54.112 --> 27:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not one that has come up
just recently,
but one that has come up a long
time ago.

27:00.552 --> 27:02.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just that this case got to
the court
now.

27:02.487 --> 27:07.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And then, later in
the arguments,
Justice Anthony Kennedy pressed
Parker about

27:07.859 --> 27:09.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the meaning of citizenship.

27:09.728 --> 27:16.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT PARKER: All I can say is,
I don't think
that the statute says anything
that would

27:16.134 --> 27:19.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
necessarily prevent
denaturalization from
occurring.

27:19.904 --> 27:21.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But there are a number of...

27:21.906 --> 27:22.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY KENNEDY, Associate
Justice, U.S. Supreme
Court: It seems to me that your
argument is

27:22.941 --> 27:27.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
demeaning the priceless value of
citizenship.

27:27.345 --> 27:34.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To say, oh, he would just be
restored to his
-- or she to her former status,
that's not

27:34.119 --> 27:35.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what our cases say.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not what citizenship
means.

27:37.355 --> 27:42.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You're arguing for the
government of the United
States, talking about what
citizenship is

27:42.260 --> 27:44.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and ought to mean.

27:44.129 --> 27:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Now you say that
that's a very
characteristic question from
Justice Kennedy.

27:48.466 --> 27:50.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT BARNES: Yes.

27:50.435 --> 27:54.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's bad for your side if
Justice Kennedy
starts talking about something
that the government

27:54.939 --> 28:00.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does as being demeaning or
affecting the dignity
of an individual, because that's
something

28:00.845 --> 28:03.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's very important to him.

28:03.181 --> 28:07.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those are words that no
lawyer really
wants to hear coming from
Justice Kennedy.

28:07.719 --> 28:10.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Very unusual tone, it
seemed, in
this argument.

28:11.089 --> 28:13.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How usual or unusual is that?

28:13.158 --> 28:17.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT BARNES: This was a very
lively back
and forth among the justices.

28:17.762 --> 28:21.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It was a very sort of
entertaining argument
to be at.

28:21.132 --> 28:24.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was also their last argument
of the term.

28:25.003 --> 28:31.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After this, the justices start
writing their
opinions in all the cases they
have heard

28:31.309 --> 28:32.644 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
since October.

28:32.744 --> 28:37.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, in a way, it was sort of
the end of
the school day for them.

28:37.682 --> 28:41.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it was a very interesting
and lively
conversation.

28:41.986 --> 28:46.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Bob Barnes, thanks
for taking us
behind the scenes a little bit
at the Supreme

28:46.791 --> 28:48.393 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Court.

28:48.493 --> 28:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT BARNES: My pleasure.

28:55.133 --> 29:00.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the
analysis of Shields
and Brooks.

29:01.072 --> 29:05.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields,
and New York Times columnist
David Brooks.

29:05.543 --> 29:07.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

29:07.412 --> 29:12.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're just one day away,
David, from the
100-day mark of the new
administration.

29:12.684 --> 29:14.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are we thinking right now?

29:14.252 --> 29:16.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: A hundred days is
a stupid marker
-- 99 days, much better.

29:16.788 --> 29:17.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:17.789 --> 29:20.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: No, it's not a
success.

29:20.458 --> 29:23.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think what's striking, he
has had the
obvious failures, the health
care and all

29:23.962 --> 29:25.930 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the rest.

29:26.030 --> 29:30.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what's striking and
makes me remain
curious about the next four
years is the change.

29:30.201 --> 29:32.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, it's just rapid change.

29:32.203 --> 29:35.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have never seen a president
change this
much from being a populist to
being a corporatist,

29:35.940 --> 29:42.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from being the Bannon dark
knight to shifting
to putting pretty straight, at
least people

29:42.180 --> 29:45.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are -- putting a process
around him.

29:45.383 --> 29:47.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I would say there's been
some improvements.

29:48.086 --> 29:49.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's never going to be a deep
thinker.

29:50.054 --> 29:55.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's never going to have an
overall strategy,
but the level of flexibility is
to me actually

29:55.360 --> 29:59.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the more striking and
maybe hopeful
that he can learn from failure.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some improvement,
Mark.

30:00.598 --> 30:03.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, there's an
old formula
in Washington.

30:03.368 --> 30:08.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When someone changes and moves
in your direction,
politically or philosophically,
that person

30:08.106 --> 30:09.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has grown.

30:09.874 --> 30:13.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when he moves in the other
direction,
of course, he's Benedict Arnold.

30:14.078 --> 30:15.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's a Judas Iscariot.

30:15.847 --> 30:17.081 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's a traitor.

30:17.182 --> 30:20.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump has one loyal
constituency.

30:20.718 --> 30:25.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to listen to David -- and I
think his
point is right -- he has
changed.

30:25.723 --> 30:28.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's turned his back on that
constituency.

30:28.793 --> 30:33.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Three out of four Americans
approve of one
thing Donald Trump has done.

30:33.531 --> 30:38.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is forcing companies to
keep jobs
in the United States.

30:38.436 --> 30:40.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That was the populist theme.

30:40.572 --> 30:44.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was something that no other
president
has won the White House on.

30:45.076 --> 30:50.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he, under the pressure of
the 100-day
deadline, which he kept
disdaining and then

30:50.782 --> 30:57.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
genuflecting before and
feverishly pursuing,
Donald Trump came up with a
one-page tax plan

30:57.722 --> 31:03.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that turned his back totally on
the people
who elected him.

31:03.428 --> 31:09.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And his secretary of the
treasury could not
even tell you what a family
making $70,000

31:09.300 --> 31:15.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a year with four -- two
children, whether
they would pay more or less in
taxes.

31:15.173 --> 31:19.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he could tell you one thing,
that Donald
Trump's Cabinet would pay and
Donald Trump

31:19.310 --> 31:22.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in that plan would may
measurably less.

31:22.614 --> 31:25.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a plan designed for the
deserving rich.

31:25.316 --> 31:29.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're saying
they did
put out a plan, a one-page plan.

31:29.520 --> 31:31.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

31:31.422 --> 31:33.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it doesn't
tell us much
more, David, about what they
really will do.

31:33.892 --> 31:34.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, two things.

31:34.893 --> 31:35.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
First, which way is he moving?

31:35.894 --> 31:37.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's not moving toward people
like me.

31:37.195 --> 31:38.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not part of the corporate
elite.

31:38.496 --> 31:39.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, I know that.

31:39.597 --> 31:41.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I am flattered by
the reference.

31:41.299 --> 31:43.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:43.167 --> 31:47.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: He's now moving
from a version
of populism to a version of
corporatism.

31:47.205 --> 31:50.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if there was a good version
of populism,
where he would really help the
people who

31:50.775 --> 31:52.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voted for him, that would be
great.

31:52.977 --> 31:54.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That wasn't something he was
going to be capable
of doing.

31:54.846 --> 31:58.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had an ethnic populism can
which as most
an ugly version of populism.

31:58.149 --> 32:02.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, second, by the way, there's
no constituency
for populism of the good sort in
the United

32:02.954 --> 32:03.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
States Congress.

32:03.955 --> 32:05.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that was never going to
happen.

32:05.623 --> 32:08.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he has moved toward something
which does
help his friends in big
business.

32:08.493 --> 32:09.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no question about that.

32:09.894 --> 32:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I happen to think that's a less
dangerous
mode of change.

32:15.033 --> 32:17.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's more conventional anyway
than being a
populist.

32:17.235 --> 32:21.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he tried to being an American
Le Pen, an
American Putin, that was the
truly dangerous

32:22.073 --> 32:22.974 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
thing.

32:23.074 --> 32:24.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that part, he's rejected.

32:24.842 --> 32:28.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think at least we have
avoided a really
ugly version of the White House,
at least

32:28.980 --> 32:30.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now.

32:30.448 --> 32:33.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second thing about the tax
plan, he's
never going to be deep.

32:33.851 --> 32:35.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's never going to be
substantive.

32:35.453 --> 32:37.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He wants things, the tax plan
right away.

32:37.689 --> 32:40.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Treasury Department has no
time to actually
put anything together.

32:40.191 --> 32:43.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they gave him a page which
they think
will please him, which is right.

32:43.494 --> 32:44.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It wasn't a tax plan.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was just 100 words off the
top of their
head.

32:47.598 --> 32:50.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why I thing he will
little mark
with this tax plan.

32:50.501 --> 32:53.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That thing is sure to fail, at
least in its
present form.

32:53.705 --> 32:58.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he just floats across the
surface without
really causing any change, just
a lot of ruffling.

32:58.343 --> 33:01.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Whatever it is,
Mark, I mean,
David's point is that it's
better than what

33:01.546 --> 33:04.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it sounded like it was going to
be during
the campaign.

33:04.282 --> 33:06.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I don't
know.

33:06.851 --> 33:09.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He did -- he turned his back on
the people
who elected him.

33:09.620 --> 33:14.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Donald Trump did that no
Republican had
done since Ronald Reagan was to
break through

33:14.726 --> 33:19.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
among blue-collar white voters,
working-class
voters in this country, who
Democrats had

33:19.630 --> 33:24.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of assumed were part of
their constituency,
had taken for granted, and who
had paid the

33:25.069 --> 33:32.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
price of globalization, whose
own fortunes
had suffered, the shrinking of
the middle

33:32.410 --> 33:37.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
class, established once again
this week by
Pew in its research in this
country.

33:37.648 --> 33:40.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Donald Trump said, I
recognize you, I'm
with you.

33:40.918 --> 33:46.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whatever else has happened,
I mean, the
virtue of Donald Trump as a
candidate was,

33:46.691 --> 33:48.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he says what he means.

33:48.159 --> 33:50.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it turns out, he didn't mean
what he said.

33:50.895 --> 33:56.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Judy, you cannot talk about
Donald Trump
without talking about the
Republicans.

33:56.501 --> 34:00.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the tax thing is one thing,
because that's
just a piece of paper.

34:00.638 --> 34:08.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the health care thing is
failure, a total
philosophical, political and
courageous failure

34:08.312 --> 34:10.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a political party, as well as
the president.

34:10.815 --> 34:13.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because they
talked about it
for so long.

34:13.184 --> 34:14.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: They won four
elections.

34:14.519 --> 34:17.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They won four elections in a row
for the Congress
on it, Judy.

34:17.255 --> 34:20.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And let's just get one thing
straight, one
thing straight.

34:20.258 --> 34:23.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Democrats passed a bill in
2010.

34:23.394 --> 34:27.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they had 179 witnesses
appear before Congress.

34:27.932 --> 34:30.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They had 78 separate hearings in
Congress.

34:30.768 --> 34:33.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have had 230 amendments
they considered.

34:33.704 --> 34:36.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They passed -- they accepted 121
of them.

34:36.340 --> 34:38.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a two-year ordeal.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And these people have invested
nothing.

34:40.945 --> 34:43.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They can't even come up with a
repeal bill.

34:43.381 --> 34:48.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is just -- now all they're
trying to pass
in the House is what -- the
legislative equivalent

34:48.386 --> 34:49.654 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a dead fish.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just want to get it out of
them across
to the Senate.

34:51.989 --> 34:55.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that on the
president, David,
or is that on the Republicans in
the Congress?

34:55.393 --> 34:56.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It's on both.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president came in with no
plan, with no
strategy, with no people.

34:59.397 --> 35:03.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, he is just a guy with words
and tweets.

35:03.134 --> 35:06.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a bit on the Congress, but
it's also
just a bit on the party.

35:06.304 --> 35:10.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no plan that could pass
with all
the Republican votes, because
every time you

35:10.274 --> 35:11.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get the Freedom Caucus, you lose
the moderates.

35:12.009 --> 35:13.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's just the iron rule.

35:13.945 --> 35:17.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so if you wanted to do the
kind of government
I think Mark and I would
probably find some

35:17.582 --> 35:21.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
favor with, he would have come
in, Trump would
have said, I'm going to help my
people.

35:21.619 --> 35:26.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm going to do first a big
infrastructure
spending bill, then maybe a
payroll tax cut,

35:26.224 --> 35:30.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then moving things, some
education things,
just everything at that group.

35:31.062 --> 35:34.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to get something like that
passed would
have required breaking down the
polarization

35:34.866 --> 35:38.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of our politics, and getting
some Democrats
and some Republicans.

35:38.402 --> 35:40.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that would have been great.

35:40.371 --> 35:44.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it would have required such
legislative
skill and experience that was
completely beyond

35:44.509 --> 35:46.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the capacities of this White
House.

35:46.377 --> 35:52.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about just
the style of
this president, Mark, the fact
that he made

35:52.350 --> 35:57.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just an offhand statement this
week, tweeted,
we're going to do away with
NAFTA, I'm going

35:57.555 --> 35:59.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to terminate it?

35:59.423 --> 36:02.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, within 24 hours, he
was saying,
well, I heard from the
presidents of Mexico

36:02.460 --> 36:07.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Canada -- the prime minister
of Canada
-- and I'm going to negotiate
it.

36:08.099 --> 36:11.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we have been talking
tonight about
North Korea, the tough language,
the tough

36:11.802 --> 36:16.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rhetoric back and forth about
whether we're
going to be tough.

36:16.807 --> 36:19.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Has this proven effective?

36:19.577 --> 36:20.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you see it?

36:20.678 --> 36:22.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Picky, picky,
picky.

36:22.813 --> 36:23.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You just want to find fault.

36:23.981 --> 36:25.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No, of course it hasn't, Judy.

36:25.816 --> 36:26.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's been a failure.

36:26.817 --> 36:28.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, he had no honeymoon.

36:28.686 --> 36:31.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was a shorter honeymoon
than Liza Minnelli's.

36:31.522 --> 36:34.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This thing was over in 24 hours.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And he ended it.

36:36.360 --> 36:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He now -- think about this, how
inept this
president has been.

36:43.167 --> 36:48.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His popular act a was
proportional, in most
people's judgment, response to
the outrage

36:48.940 --> 36:55.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and international offense of the
Syrian government,
poison gas on its own people,
all right?

36:55.713 --> 37:00.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a plurality of Americans, in
spite of
the economic news you presented
earlier this

37:00.418 --> 37:03.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
evening, see the economy getting
better.

37:03.654 --> 37:09.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with those things going for
him, his own
favorable rating fell in the
polls.

37:09.427 --> 37:13.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, so, no, I mean, there's
total -- there's
dissatisfaction with him.

37:14.098 --> 37:19.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's going to be Typhoid Mary
politically
heading into 2018 on this chaos.

37:19.770 --> 37:23.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David,
you're saying that
he's learned something, that
he's grown in

37:23.641 --> 37:24.542 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
office.

37:24.642 --> 37:25.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, are we
talking about the
same....

37:27.178 --> 37:28.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Listen, his 100
days are not
a success.

37:28.212 --> 37:29.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not FDR we're talking
about here.

37:30.014 --> 37:30.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a failure.

37:31.048 --> 37:33.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I'm looking for
opportunities for growth.

37:33.184 --> 37:36.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's like when you have a
student who gets
an F, you go, oh, you got a
D-minus.

37:37.088 --> 37:37.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's so much better.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.156 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:39.257 --> 37:40.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: So, I'm looking on
the bright
side.

37:40.725 --> 37:42.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you go from dangerous to
fickle, I
think that's a good move.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:44.562 --> 37:47.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so -- and then
the final
thing I will say, I'm really
struck by Bob

37:47.265 --> 37:49.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Costa.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our colleague from "Washington
Week did a
great -- with Ashley Parker, a
great piece

37:50.635 --> 37:52.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on his television watching
habits.

37:52.536 --> 37:56.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he had this interview with
AP where he
talked about how hard it was to
rip himself

37:56.107 --> 38:00.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away from the habit of watching
every single
TV show about himself.

38:00.478 --> 38:04.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you see a guy sort of
transparently
and naively struggling certainly
with maybe

38:04.849 --> 38:07.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
narcissism, but certainly the TV
obsession.

38:07.518 --> 38:11.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the lack of attention span
is what causes
all this fickleness.

38:11.922 --> 38:15.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whoever saw him last gets the
policy for the
day.

38:15.359 --> 38:18.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And will that settle down, or
will we just
sort of get a weather vane for
the next four

38:18.896 --> 38:20.197 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years?

38:20.298 --> 38:21.432 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

38:21.532 --> 38:25.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do think that the first 30
days was
unsustainable.

38:25.202 --> 38:27.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was crashing every hour.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's calmed down a little.

38:28.372 --> 38:30.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I stand in awe of
David's optimism.

38:30.875 --> 38:31.776 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I do.

38:31.876 --> 38:32.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I really do.

38:32.943 --> 38:33.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fickle better
than dangerous.

38:33.878 --> 38:35.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: And, no, I
appreciate it.

38:35.780 --> 38:38.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Judy, two things have
occurred under
Donald Trump, and Donald Trump
deserves credit

38:38.582 --> 38:40.318 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

38:40.418 --> 38:44.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the first time since it
passed in 2010,
the Affordable Care Act,
Obamacare, is now

38:44.822 --> 38:48.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more popular than it's ever been
before, a
majority of Americans.

38:48.492 --> 38:52.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's more popular than Donald
Trump, if you
want to do it just on a
comparative.

38:53.030 --> 38:58.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other thing is that
Americans who
had been on a Tea Party tear for
smaller government

38:58.502 --> 39:02.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now government, according to a
Wall Street
Journal/NBC poll, to do more.

39:02.773 --> 39:06.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want it more -- to do more
in their lives
and to be more active.

39:07.078 --> 39:14.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this just goes completely
antithetical
to the Republican ideology of a
smaller, leaner,

39:14.985 --> 39:17.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cheaper government withdrawing.

39:17.121 --> 39:19.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, no, I think there's
great change in
the air.

39:19.657 --> 39:23.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know where it comes
down, but it's
hard for me to see that there's
any hand on

39:23.728 --> 39:25.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the rudder of the ship of state.

39:25.663 --> 39:29.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But his
supporters -- and we
keep saying this in the polls,
and the reporters

39:29.533 --> 39:33.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are going around the country
talking to
people who voted for Donald
Trump, David.

39:33.304 --> 39:34.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They still like what he's doing.

39:34.305 --> 39:35.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

39:35.306 --> 39:36.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No, they do.

39:36.307 --> 39:37.208 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
People are solid.

39:37.308 --> 39:38.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People are mostly driven by
partisanship.

39:38.743 --> 39:41.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The prism through which they see
reality is
their partisan identity.

39:41.679 --> 39:43.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so that will take some time
to shake off.

39:43.581 --> 39:45.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I do think it can be shaken off.

39:45.349 --> 39:48.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems very, very likely to me
this tax
reform is not going to go
anywhere, at least

39:49.053 --> 39:50.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
anything like its current form.

39:50.154 --> 39:51.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so how does he react to
that?

39:52.022 --> 39:55.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At what point does the economy
take a dip
and maybe people say, hey, what
exactly are

39:55.926 --> 39:57.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you doing for me now?

39:57.261 --> 39:59.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I do think that will be a
while.

39:59.363 --> 40:04.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Partisan identity right now is
so strong that
if you ask people how is the
economy doing,

40:04.135 --> 40:05.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it doesn't matter how the
economy is doing.

40:05.903 --> 40:08.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It happens -- it's whether their
guy is in
power is how they see it.

40:09.006 --> 40:10.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that loyalty will stay there
for a little
while.

40:11.041 --> 40:12.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Just one thing,
Judy.

40:13.010 --> 40:19.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And before Democrats start
popping the champagne,
67 percent of Americans feel
Democrats, the

40:19.483 --> 40:24.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic Party, is out of
touch with what's
going on in their lives, more
than -- a lot

40:24.755 --> 40:27.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than they feel that about
Donald Trump.

40:27.191 --> 40:34.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if anything, yes, 96 to 98
percent of
the people who voted for him are
with him

40:34.131 --> 40:35.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and would do so again.

40:35.766 --> 40:40.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, I mean, the Democrats have
to be a lot
more than just, we're not Trump.

40:40.805 --> 40:42.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is not the answer to their
problems.

40:42.406 --> 40:45.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's not yet the
makings of
a comeback.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MARK SHIELDS: No.

40:47.378 --> 40:50.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
David Brooks,
we hope both of you come back.

40:50.681 --> 40:53.050 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

40:53.150 --> 40:57.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Oh, wow.

40:58.088 --> 40:59.857 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:59.957 --> 41:06.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Every day,
priceless cultural
objects around the world are
threatened by

41:06.430 --> 41:10.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
war, looting, the impact of
humans and the
passage of time.

41:10.668 --> 41:16.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one organization in Spain is
taking an
innovative approach to
understanding and preserving

41:16.507 --> 41:19.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that heritage, by copying it.

41:19.543 --> 41:20.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has that story.

41:20.845 --> 41:24.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our ongoing series
Culture at
Risk.

41:24.548 --> 41:31.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The tomb of Seti
I, ancient
Egyptian pharaoh, we watched it
being milled,

41:31.322 --> 41:33.858 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
printed, and set.

41:33.958 --> 41:40.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we're not in Egypt's Valley
of the Kings,
and certainly not in the 13th
century B.C.

41:40.197 --> 41:46.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a workshop called Factum
Arte in an
eastern suburb of Madrid, Spain,
filled with

41:46.270 --> 41:51.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
art and historical works of all
kinds, with
one unusual thing in common.

41:51.876 --> 41:55.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Everything in this large
warehouse is a reproduction,
a copy.

41:55.646 --> 42:00.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the work that goes on here
raises profound
questions about just what is
real, and what

42:01.018 --> 42:02.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it means to preserve an object.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM LOWE, Factum Arte: We're
making copies
of copies.

42:05.222 --> 42:09.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The man who leads
Factum, with
evangelical fervor, is British
artist Adam

42:09.793 --> 42:11.529 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Lowe.

42:11.629 --> 42:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM LOWE: The state of the art
is that we
can make something that is
identical to the

42:16.000 --> 42:17.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
original, under normal viewing
conditions.

42:18.035 --> 42:22.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, is the idea
that you're
creating something that is, at
least for the

42:22.773 --> 42:26.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
viewing experience, as real as
the original?

42:26.410 --> 42:31.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM LOWE: The idea is that you
can get someone
to understand the complexity of
an object,

42:31.382 --> 42:35.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you can get them to read it
in many ways
through encountering facsimile,
yes.

42:35.586 --> 42:39.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Facsimile, an
exact copy or
reproduction.

42:40.057 --> 42:45.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Factum calls its work digital
mediation, and
it operates as a kind of
renaissance workshop

42:45.262 --> 42:51.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of people with different skills:
software
designers, technicians,
conservators, architects,

42:51.535 --> 42:53.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
artists, artisans.

42:53.537 --> 42:59.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Together, they make copies with
a cause, not
to mislead, but to understand
and help preserve.

43:00.010 --> 43:04.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One prominent example, this copy
of a winged
lion from Nimrud.

43:04.315 --> 43:09.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was cast from sculptures now
in European
museums that were taken from the
site in Iraq

43:09.420 --> 43:11.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the 19 century.

43:11.589 --> 43:15.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, ISIS destroyed much
of what's left
at Nimrud itself.

43:15.159 --> 43:21.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM LOWE: So, in that strange
twist of fate,
everything that was removed in
the 19th century

43:21.332 --> 43:23.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is the only evidence that's
left.

43:23.701 --> 43:29.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we would love to be able to
send facsimiles,
like this, back to Nimrud to
take up their

43:29.873 --> 43:33.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
place again on the site, so that
you still
keep that connection between...

43:34.011 --> 43:36.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I mean, that
wouldn't make
up for the destruction, right?

43:36.680 --> 43:38.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADAM LOWE: Nothing makes up for
destruction.

43:38.716 --> 43:44.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Factum first
attracted international
attention in 2007 by creating a
replica of

43:44.755 --> 43:51.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a huge painting by Paolo
Veronese from 1563,
The Wedding at Cana.

43:51.128 --> 43:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The original painting now hangs
in the Louvre
museum in Paris, but it got
there as a gift

43:56.300 --> 44:01.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Napoleon, whose forces ripped
it from its
original home, a church in
Venice.

44:01.905 --> 44:07.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Factum's experts studied,
scanned, slowly
recreated it, and finally put
it, the copy,

44:07.845 --> 44:09.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that is, into its old home.

44:09.747 --> 44:14.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM LOWE: Many people started
to question
about whether the experience of
seeing it

44:14.818 --> 44:20.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in its correct setting, with the
correct light,
in dialogue with this building
that it was

44:20.190 --> 44:25.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
painted for, is actually more
authentic than
the experience of seeing the
original in the

44:25.396 --> 44:27.164 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Louvre.

44:27.264 --> 44:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Lowe had another
major win
in his recreation of King Tut's
tomb in the

44:29.900 --> 44:33.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Valley of the Kings, built next
to the original
site.

44:33.270 --> 44:37.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM LOWE: It's a test between
one scanning
system.

44:37.274 --> 44:41.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In Madrid, we got
a tour of
some key parts of the process,
which begins

44:41.879 --> 44:46.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
far away from this building,
with the scanning
of the actual objects in the
field.

44:46.684 --> 44:52.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That team is led by architect
Carlos Bayod,
using a laser scanner developed
at Factum

44:52.723 --> 44:54.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
known as the Lucida.

44:54.525 --> 44:57.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO-CARLOS BAYOD, Factum
Arte: We are
capable now of recording the
surface of a

44:57.261 --> 45:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
painting, for example, and
obtaining data
that are very close, that has
very close correspondence

45:03.500 --> 45:04.401 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to reality.

45:04.501 --> 45:06.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: How close?

45:06.537 --> 45:09.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO-CARLOS BAYOD: Well, in
terms of resolution,
we are talking about 100
microns, so one point

45:09.973 --> 45:11.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of information every 10th of a
millimeter.

45:12.009 --> 45:16.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The data about
the surface,
even of something we think of as
being flat,

45:16.914 --> 45:22.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is used to create a detailed
relief map of
the object, without ever
touching and potentially

45:22.419 --> 45:27.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
harming it, to understand how
any intervention
or restoration might play out.

45:27.658 --> 45:31.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO-CARLOS BAYOD: We believe
this information
should be very useful for
conservators, people

45:31.695 --> 45:34.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who have the duty of taking care
of the works
of art.

45:34.965 --> 45:39.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: To go further and
build a facsimile
of the work, in this case the
tomb of Seti

45:39.903 --> 45:46.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I, the data is crunched and fed
into milling
machines, computer numeric code
routers, or

45:46.343 --> 45:48.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
3-D printers to create the
relief.

45:48.645 --> 45:54.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In another room, using a
Factum-built printer
run by Rafa Rachewsky, the
photographed image

45:54.551 --> 45:57.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is etched onto a custom-created
surface known
as a skin.

45:58.055 --> 46:06.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAFA RACHEWSKY, Factum Arte: And
it's very
thin, as you can see.

46:06.697 --> 46:13.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It stretches enough so you can
lay it onto
the relief, and then you can
place exactly

46:13.470 --> 46:15.105 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
where you want.

46:15.205 --> 46:19.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Rachewsky
carefully aligns
the printed skin with the
relief, and using

46:19.376 --> 46:20.677 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
contact glue:

46:20.778 --> 46:22.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAFA RACHEWSKY: You want to be
sure that you
get everywhere.

46:22.513 --> 46:25.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because you want
it to hold
for several thousand years,
right?

46:25.816 --> 46:26.717 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:26.817 --> 46:27.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RAFA RACHEWSKY: Exactly.

46:27.818 --> 46:29.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's then
vacuum-sealed.

46:29.453 --> 46:35.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAFA RACHEWSKY: As the air is
coming out,
these two are joining together.

46:35.959 --> 46:39.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, now it's
really fusing
into one.

46:39.596 --> 46:41.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RAFA RACHEWSKY: Exactly.

46:41.398 --> 46:46.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The result, a
test panel of
the tomb of Seti I, representing
less than

46:46.403 --> 46:51.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1 percent of what will be a
full-scale replica,
to eventually go on display next
to the original

46:51.942 --> 46:53.377 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Luxor.

46:53.477 --> 46:55.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And why build a replica of the
tomb?

46:55.712 --> 47:01.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because, says Adam Lowe, mass
tourism, our
own need to see the original in
a place never

47:01.718 --> 47:05.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
designed for our biological
presence, has
its consequences.

47:05.122 --> 47:12.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM LOWE: But what we're really
asking the
visitors to do is to enter into
a new contract

47:12.162 --> 47:17.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for preserving things for the
future, because
by going to see something that
was designed

47:17.134 --> 47:21.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to last for eternity, but never
to be visited,
you're contributing to its
destruction.

47:22.072 --> 47:26.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is expensive
work, developing
new tools and techniques to take
on whatever

47:27.077 --> 47:31.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
challenges the world of
conservation throws
at it.

47:31.415 --> 47:35.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To finance it, Factum builds
custom pieces
for contemporary artists, like
this piece

47:35.819 --> 47:40.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for Saudi Arabian artist
Abdulnasser Gharem,
which combines the dome of a
mosque with a

47:40.991 --> 47:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
soldier's helmet, and will be
installed at
the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art.

47:46.797 --> 47:51.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Factum is full of wonders, not
the least of
which was getting into a
contraption built

47:51.468 --> 48:01.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here called a Veronica scanner,
12 cameras
taking 96 high-resolution photos
of all angles

48:01.345 --> 48:04.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of my head in four seconds.

48:04.248 --> 48:08.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After an hour-and-a-half of 3-D
printing,
my very own small bust.

48:08.919 --> 48:10.821 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Oh, my goodness.

48:10.921 --> 48:16.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As technology advances and laser
scans are
increasingly replaced by this
kind of photogrammetry,

48:16.927 --> 48:21.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not hard to imagine a world
in which
anyone can photograph an object
and render

48:21.531 --> 48:23.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their own model in 3-D.

48:23.367 --> 48:27.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM LOWE: But I can imagine
many things,
so I can imagine I can take a
photograph,

48:27.604 --> 48:31.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as we're doing, and I could
recreate something
from a photograph.

48:31.208 --> 48:36.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can imagine other people might
do it for
less noble reasons or for
straightforward

48:36.613 --> 48:39.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
commercial reasons, but that's
not a reason
for not doing it.

48:39.549 --> 48:44.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The recording critical, because
unless you
record it, you don't know how
it's changing,

48:44.488 --> 48:49.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you don't know what people's
presence is going
to it, you don't know the
effects of time

48:49.593 --> 48:51.428 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the surface.

48:51.528 --> 48:55.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: While Adam Lowe
is most focused
now on pushing conservation
techniques, he's

48:55.299 --> 49:00.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also challenging how we think
about copies
and their relationship to
originals, the very

49:00.437 --> 49:02.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
idea of originality.

49:02.973 --> 49:07.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The classical sculptures we
know, he points
out, are almost all copies of an
original.

49:07.978 --> 49:10.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And all those masterpiece
paintings we love?

49:10.747 --> 49:14.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ADAM LOWE: You go to the
National Gallery
in London, you go to the
National Gallery

49:14.851 --> 49:18.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Washington, and every single
one of those
paintings has a complex history.

49:19.022 --> 49:20.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's probably restored once or
twice.

49:21.091 --> 49:26.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's probably had more than that
by certain
dubious dealers who've tarted it
up to sell

49:26.363 --> 49:28.098 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

49:28.198 --> 49:30.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there's a whole history of
what happens
on a painting that's constantly
changing.

49:30.634 --> 49:34.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: There's no
original when it
comes to a work of art, you're
suggesting.

49:34.271 --> 49:39.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM LOWE: No, I'm suggesting
there is seldom
a very clear notion of
conception.

49:39.276 --> 49:43.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The way we see and understand
cultural heritage
changes over time.

49:43.347 --> 49:45.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It always has, and it always
will.

49:45.782 --> 49:50.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the way we value it, the way
we look at
it, the way we appreciate it,
the way we display

49:50.554 --> 49:55.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, the way we collect it, all
of these things
are constantly subject to
change.

49:55.993 --> 50:02.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A change at
Factum Arte's workshop
happening before our eyes.

50:02.332 --> 50:13.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown
in Madrid, Spain.

50:13.543 --> 50:26.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the core
tenets of the
American dream is the belief
that any individual,

50:26.690 --> 50:30.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regardless of their background,
can make it
big.

50:30.160 --> 50:35.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Millionaire tech entrepreneur
Jason Ford has
done just that, but he believes
that he and

50:35.132 --> 50:39.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other successful people get a
lot of help
they don't often acknowledge.

50:39.703 --> 50:43.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He explains in tonight's edition
of In My
Humble Opinion.

50:43.140 --> 50:46.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JASON FORD, Entrepreneur:
Everyone loves a
good success story.

50:46.977 --> 50:51.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the American dream, working
your way
up from nothing, armed only with
your wits

50:51.782 --> 50:53.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and a strong work ethic.

50:53.817 --> 50:57.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for those who make it, it
feels great
to think you got there all on
your own.

50:57.788 --> 51:03.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I should know: I'm a
millionaire, the first
in my family, one of those tech
entrepreneurs

51:03.593 --> 51:06.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who built a software business
and sold it
for a fortune.

51:06.596 --> 51:07.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I didn't inherit my wealth.

51:08.065 --> 51:09.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I created it.

51:09.900 --> 51:15.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But look a little deeper, and it
turns out
that version of my success story
is a lie.

51:15.705 --> 51:18.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, my family background is
rather humble.

51:18.909 --> 51:20.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Both of my parents were
teachers.

51:20.110 --> 51:22.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I grew up in hand-me-down
clothes from our
neighbors.

51:22.813 --> 51:28.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, before I was born, my
parents got help
from their parents to buy a
house in a safe

51:29.052 --> 51:31.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
neighborhood with good schools.

51:31.721 --> 51:36.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When my grandmother passed, she
left each
of her grandkids some money, not
a fortune,

51:36.493 --> 51:39.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but enough that I made it
through college
without school debt.

51:39.496 --> 51:41.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My wife's nana was a school
teacher as well.

51:42.099 --> 51:47.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She and her husband saved their
humble income
and bought land decades ago.

51:47.137 --> 51:52.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I started my business,
she believed
in me enough to sell her land
and invest the

51:52.209 --> 51:53.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
money in my start-up.

51:53.477 --> 51:57.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we can blow up the myth that
I'm a self-made
success.

51:57.447 --> 52:02.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sure, I had something to do with
it, but I
also had some serious help.

52:02.452 --> 52:08.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, one way to interpret this
story is that
the generations before me worked
hard to provide

52:08.492 --> 52:11.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the best possible future for
their kids and
grandkids.

52:11.194 --> 52:18.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that interpretation is true,
but it leaves
out some harsh realities rooted
in history.

52:18.235 --> 52:23.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see, if my ancestors had not
been white,
it is almost certain that I
wouldn't be where

52:23.406 --> 52:25.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I am today.

52:25.275 --> 52:28.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My grandfather would have found
it nearly
impossible to climb to the top
of the corporate

52:28.445 --> 52:30.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ladder like he did.

52:30.313 --> 52:35.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was the mid-'70s, when
almost every executive
in a role like his was a white
man.

52:35.152 --> 52:39.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a result, my parents likely
wouldn't have
bought the House They did, with
the good schools

52:39.723 --> 52:41.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that prepared me for college.

52:41.691 --> 52:46.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And two generations ago, lending
discrimination
would have made it similarly
impossible for

52:46.696 --> 52:52.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nana to buy that land that ended
up funding
my business.

52:52.169 --> 52:56.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Just as not everyone is
qualified to be an
astronaut, it takes a special
kind of person

52:56.406 --> 52:57.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be an entrepreneur.

52:57.707 --> 53:01.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You need discipline,
intelligence, extreme
dedication.

53:01.778 --> 53:07.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the best astronaut in the
world can't
fly to the moon unless someone
gives them

53:07.317 --> 53:09.052 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the rocket.

53:09.152 --> 53:13.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's time for more entrepreneurs
like me to
stop telling stories about how
they climbed

53:13.390 --> 53:18.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their way to the top, to stop
taking credit
for flying to the moon all by
themselves,

53:18.395 --> 53:23.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as if the entire support
structure they were
born into had nothing to do with
it.

53:23.700 --> 53:29.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's time for all of us to
find more ways
to empower the world's
highest-potential entrepreneurs

53:29.472 --> 53:33.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with their own rockets, so they
can show us
the stars.

53:33.543 --> 53:36.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Something to
think about.

ROBERT COSTA: Well, with 100
days in the rear-view
mirror, President Trump admits
he thought

53:45.422 --> 53:47.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being president would be easier.

53:47.424 --> 53:52.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will take a closer look at
the steady drip

And that is the "NewsHour" for
