JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
a search for answers after an
EgyptAir flight

00:11.845 --> 00:15.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crashes in the Mediterranean
with 66 people
on board.

00:15.949 --> 00:20.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Thursday:
Bernie Sanders intensifies the
fight with

00:20.220 --> 00:25.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Democratic Party, but will
his decision
to stay hurt the party's chance
for unification?

00:25.459 --> 00:31.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And former
executives get a
chance to reboot their careers
by solving

00:31.131 --> 00:34.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the world's biggest
problems, thanks
to a Harvard fellowship.

00:34.334 --> 00:38.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSABETH MOSS KANTER, Harvard
Business School:
We said, hey, here is a
leadership force,

00:38.672 --> 00:44.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and if we could only deploy them
to work on
these pressing problems of
water, and climate,

00:44.378 --> 00:46.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and health, maybe that's a
perfect match.

00:46.780 --> 00:54.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

(BREAK)

00:56.990 --> 01:07.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: An airliner is
lost with 66
people on board, setting off a
frantic hunt

01:07.634 --> 01:09.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for clues.

01:09.569 --> 01:13.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the day ended in the Eastern
Mediterranean
Sea, the fate of a missing
Egyptian Air passenger

01:13.807 --> 01:19.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plane was anything but clear.
And there was
the suggestion of a terrorist
connection.

01:19.546 --> 01:21.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:21.448 --> 01:27.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There was heavy
security at Charles
de Gaulle Airport outside Paris,
where EgyptAir

01:27.854 --> 01:34.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flight 804 took off last night
headed for
Cairo, where today families of
those on board

01:34.194 --> 01:38.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
left the airport in a daze.

01:38.065 --> 01:41.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): They
don't have
any information. They don't have
specific

01:41.234 --> 01:43.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information.

01:43.036 --> 01:45.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Greek defense
minister said
all seemed normal as the plane
flew through

01:45.906 --> 01:49.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his nation's airspace before
vanishing from
radar.

01:49.543 --> 01:55.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PANOS KAMMENOS, Greek Defense
Minister (through
translator): At 3:37, the plane,
which was

01:55.048 --> 02:00.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10 to 15 miles inside Egyptian
airspace, at
37,000 feet, made a 90-degree
turn to the

02:01.021 --> 02:07.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
left, and then a 360-degree turn
towards the
right, descending from 37,000
feet to 15,000

02:07.661 --> 02:11.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feet. The picture we had was
lost at 10,000
feet.

02:11.398 --> 02:16.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Debris was spotted in
the Mediterranean
near the Greek island of
Karpathos, although

02:16.069 --> 02:19.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it wasn't clear if it was from
Flight 804.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Egypt's aviation minister
pointed to terrorism.

02:22.376 --> 02:27.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERIF FATHY, Egyptian Aviation
Minister:
If you analyze the situation
properly, the

02:27.347 --> 02:33.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
possibility of having a
different action or
having a terror attack is higher
than the

02:33.420 --> 02:35.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
possibility of having a
technical...

02:35.789 --> 02:41.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This is only the
latest in a series
of incidents involving Egyptian
aviation.

02:41.128 --> 02:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In March, a man wearing a fake
suicide belt
hijacked EgyptAir Flight 181 to
Cyprus. And

02:47.501 --> 02:52.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last October, a Russian airliner
exploded
over the Sinai Desert after
taking off from

02:52.472 --> 02:59.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sharm el-Sheikh. All 224 people
aboard died
in what Egyptian officials said
was a terrorist

02:59.813 --> 03:01.548 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
attack.

03:01.581 --> 03:07.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past two days, the plane
lost today
flew round-trips between Cairo
and Eritrea

03:07.154 --> 03:13.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Cairo and Tunis. Egyptian
President Abdel
Fattah El-Sisi convened an
emergency meeting

03:13.727 --> 03:17.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of advisers. So did French
President Francois
Hollande.

03:17.297 --> 03:21.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Brussels, Secretary of State
John Kerry
expressed U.S. condolences.

03:21.168 --> 03:25.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: The United
States is providing assistance
in the search

03:25.839 --> 03:32.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effort, and relevant authorities
are doing
everything they can to try to
find out what

03:32.179 --> 03:35.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the facts are of what happened
today.

03:35.082 --> 03:41.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: The U.S. Navy
deployed a P-3 Orion
reconnaissance aircraft to help
in the search

03:41.621 --> 03:47.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the wreckage, which could
hold vital clues
to what brought down Flight 804.

03:47.594 --> 03:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:50.764 --> 03:55.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight, an
Egyptian Air official
said that no debris from the
missing airplane

03:55.769 --> 03:58.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been found, correcting an
earlier statement.

03:58.672 --> 04:03.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
The Senate approved a bipartisan
plan to fight

04:03.243 --> 04:08.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Zika virus totaling $1.1
billion. It came
after Republicans in the House
passed a separate

04:08.081 --> 04:13.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bill last night that costs $622
million. The
White House says President Obama
can accept

04:13.420 --> 04:17.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Senate compromise, but would
veto the
House measure because it doesn't
provide enough

04:17.958 --> 04:19.759 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
money.

04:19.793 --> 04:23.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The House of
Representatives
did battle today over gay
rights. Democrats

04:23.063 --> 04:28.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offered an amendment to protect
lesbians,
gays, bisexual, and transgender
employees

04:28.535 --> 04:33.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from discrimination by federal
contractors.
It failed by one vote.

04:33.373 --> 04:38.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The floor erupted with boos and
shouts of
shame, as Democrats accused
Republicans of

04:39.012 --> 04:43.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prolonging the process until
enough members
switched their yes votes to no.

04:43.450 --> 04:48.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. STENY HOYER (D-MD), House
Minority Whip:
The changing of those seven
votes resulted

04:48.722 --> 04:57.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this House saying to the
president of the
United States, you cannot tell
contractors

04:57.230 --> 04:59.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that they cannot discriminate.

04:59.132 --> 05:04.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PETE SESSIONS (R), Texas:
It is not unusual
to have people who vote and do
change their

05:04.371 --> 05:09.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote. I have done that also. But
the rules
were followed.

05:09.242 --> 05:15.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democrats say a
provision in
a defense policy bill that
passed last night

05:15.182 --> 05:21.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would overturn a presidential
order that barred
LGBT bias. Republicans say the
provision simply

05:21.855 --> 05:24.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
restates existing religious
liberties.

05:24.491 --> 05:29.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Oklahoma
State Senate
voted today to make it a felony
for any doctor

05:29.629 --> 05:35.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to perform an abortion at any
stage of pregnancy.
It would be the first such law
anywhere in

05:35.202 --> 05:39.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country. The bill goes now
to Governor
Mary Fallin, an anti-abortion
Republican.

05:39.773 --> 05:44.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's so far withheld comment.
If she signs
it, abortion rights groups are
expected to

05:44.144 --> 05:45.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
challenge the law in court.

05:45.946 --> 05:51.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: NATO has formally
invited the
small Balkan country of
Montenegro to become

05:51.051 --> 05:57.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its 29th member. The move today
came over
Russia's strong objections.
Moscow opposes

05:57.123 --> 06:02.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the alliance expanding into
Eastern Europe.
A signing ceremony marked the
occasion at

06:02.729 --> 06:08.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATO headquarters in Brussels.
The U.S. and
other member states still have
to approve

06:08.235 --> 06:10.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
individually.

06:10.136 --> 06:14.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At least 220
families are
still missing in Sri Lanka after
deadly landslides

06:14.641 --> 06:20.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that buried three villages
there. Rescuers
spent another day digging into
the mud. The

06:20.480 --> 06:26.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
head of the operation said
conditions and
continued rain are making it a
slow and painstaking

06:26.553 --> 06:28.288 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
search.

06:28.321 --> 06:31.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAJ. GEN. SUDANTHA RANASINGHE,
Sri Lanka:
It is completely covered in
thick mud. And

06:31.424 --> 06:38.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just the area is completely
boggy. The soldiers
are working there with mud up
above their

06:38.898 --> 06:44.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
knees. In some places, it's
going even up
to their waist level.

06:44.037 --> 06:48.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Only 18 bodies
have been
recovered so far. More than
1,500 residents

06:48.708 --> 06:50.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the hardest-hit areas are now
in shelters.

06:50.910 --> 06:56.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, California
is relaxing its grip on water
use, as a five-year

06:56.416 --> 07:02.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drought eases just a bit. The
state water
control board voted Wednesday to
lift a mandatory

07:02.422 --> 07:08.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conservation order. Instead,
local water districts
will set their own standards.
Parts of California

07:08.261 --> 07:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
received near-average rain and
snow over the
winter.

07:11.564 --> 07:16.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: California
lawmakers are
making another run at tougher
gun control.

07:16.770 --> 07:21.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state Senate pushed through
nearly a dozen
new restrictions today. One bans
the sale

07:21.541 --> 07:26.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of assault-style weapons with
easily detachable
magazines. Another says owners
must turn in

07:26.646 --> 07:31.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
magazines that hold more than 10
rounds. The
legislation now goes to the
state assembly.

07:31.217 --> 07:36.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A Colorado movie
theater will
not be held liable for a mass
shooting in

07:36.990 --> 07:43.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2012 that killed 12 people.
Families of the
dead and survivors sued
Cinemark, saying that

07:43.863 --> 07:49.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its security was lax. But a
state court jury
sided with the company today.
The shooter,

07:49.936 --> 07:55.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
James Holmes, opened fire during
a midnight
premiere of a Batman movie in
Aurora. He's

07:55.975 --> 07:58.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now serving a life sentence in
prison.

07:58.311 --> 08:04.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On Wall
Street, rising expectations
of an interest rate hike pushed
stocks lower.

08:04.150 --> 08:09.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 91 points
to close at 17435. The Nasdaq
fell 26 points,

08:09.389 --> 08:11.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the S&amp;P 500 slipped seven.

08:11.925 --> 08:18.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a fixture of
American journalism,
"60 Minutes" veteran Morley
Safer, died today

08:18.298 --> 08:24.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at his home in New York. He'd
retired just
last week. Safer spent more than
half-a-century

08:24.304 --> 08:31.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at CBS News, including 46 years
on "60 Minutes,"
longer than anyone else. His
career took off

08:31.578 --> 08:33.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the tumult of the 1960s.

08:33.413 --> 08:38.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MORLEY SAFER, CBS News: The
Marines are burning
this old couple's cottage.

08:38.418 --> 08:45.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was this
groundbreaking
reporting in Vietnam in 1965 by
a young Morley

08:45.358 --> 08:52.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Safer that launched a storied
career at CBS
News. His coverage of the
military's conduct

08:52.265 --> 08:54.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stunned viewers.

08:54.334 --> 09:00.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Lyndon Johnson
suggested that Safer
had communist ties. In 2000, the
"NewsHour"

09:00.974 --> 09:03.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asked Safer if he expected that
kind of impact.

09:03.877 --> 09:10.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MORLEY SAFER: When I started
getting reaction
from the Marines in Vietnam
itself, in Da

09:10.116 --> 09:18.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Nang and other places, I
realized that this
was more than just another quite
brutal search-and-destroy

09:18.625 --> 09:19.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
operation.

09:19.492 --> 09:20.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE WALLACE, CBS News: I'm Mike
Wallace.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORLEY SAFER: I'm Morley Safer.

09:22.162 --> 09:28.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Safer joined 60
Minutes in
1970 and became known as an
intrepid storyteller.

09:28.835 --> 09:36.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He filed more than 900 stories,
his last this
past March. His droll touch and
breadth of

09:36.409 --> 09:42.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interests distinguished his
work, from playing
pool with Jackie Gleason and
interviewing

09:42.415 --> 09:48.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dolly Parton, to traveling the
Orient Express,
while still staying true to his
investigative

09:49.022 --> 09:50.757 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
roots.

09:50.790 --> 09:56.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His 1983 story about an
African-American man
named Lenell Geter serving life
for armed

09:56.830 --> 10:03.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
robbery in Texas would become
one of the program's
most honored. Geter's conviction
was overturned

10:03.503 --> 10:08.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
10 days after Safer's report
exposed a faulty
prosecution.

10:08.942 --> 10:15.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeff Fager, chairman of CBS News
and executive
producer of "60 Minutes," was a
longtime friend.

10:15.215 --> 10:19.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF FAGER, CBS News: His life
at "60 Minutes,"
his life at CBS News had such an
impact on

10:19.719 --> 10:25.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of us and how we cover
stories and the
kinds of stories he covered and
the most incredible

10:25.258 --> 10:26.626 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
body of work.

10:26.659 --> 10:30.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Morley Safer is
survived by
his wife and daughter.

10:30.930 --> 10:34.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Morley Safer was 84 years
old. He was
such a giant, Hari.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes. What a
career.

10:36.569 --> 10:41.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
more on the
security concerns surrounding
the EgyptAir

10:41.474 --> 10:46.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flight; what Bernie Sanders and
Hillary Clinton
could do to bridge the growing
Democratic

10:46.613 --> 10:51.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
divide; a Harvard program that
teaches baby
boomers to solve social
problems; and much

10:51.951 --> 11:03.730 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

11:03.763 --> 11:08.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We return to EgyptAir Flight 804
and what
could have happened to it.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Deborah Hersman served as
chairman of the
National Transportation Safety
Board from

11:11.538 --> 11:17.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
2009 to 2014 and is now
president of the National
Safety Council, a nonprofit
organization devoted

11:17.744 --> 11:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to reducing preventable deaths
and injuries.
And Juan Zarate was deputy
national security

11:22.815 --> 11:28.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adviser for combating terrorism
during the
President George W. Bush
administration. He's

11:28.555 --> 11:32.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
currently the chairman of the
Financial Integrity
Network, a consulting firm.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Deborah Hersman, I want to start
with you.

11:34.060 --> 11:37.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At this stage, what are
investigators thinking
about? What are they looking
for?

11:37.664 --> 11:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBORAH HERSMAN, Chairwoman,
National Transportation
Safety Board: Really, the first
24 hours,

11:40.800 --> 11:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're focused on response,
recovery and
search for the aircraft, and so
you can see

11:46.205 --> 11:49.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clearly that's something that
was a focus
in this investigation.

11:49.475 --> 11:54.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you want to gather any
perishable evidence
that might exist. You want to
make sure you

11:54.180 --> 12:00.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
know who needs to be
interviewed, that you're
able to connect all of the dots
very early

12:00.186 --> 12:04.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the investigation and grab
any of that
information.

12:04.357 --> 12:09.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Analyzing the radar data is
going to be important,
because what they need to do now
is pinpoint

12:09.228 --> 12:15.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where that aircraft is, so they
can identify
not just the aircraft, the parts
and take

12:15.268 --> 12:20.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care of the humans, but also get
those black
boxes, which are really
important to the investigation.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Juan Zarate,
given what
little evidence has come out so
far, what

12:23.509 --> 12:25.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are the signs that point to fowl
play?

12:25.545 --> 12:28.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN ZARATE, Former Deputy
National Security
Adviser: Well, there aren't many
signs.

12:28.581 --> 12:32.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And part of the reason you want
to gather
as much data and forensics as
possible early

12:32.919 --> 12:37.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on is try to give you clues. But
authorities
are indicating there weren't
signs in terms

12:37.857 --> 12:43.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of intelligence that a threat
was pending
or threatening this particular
airline or

12:43.730 --> 12:45.465 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this route.

12:45.498 --> 12:50.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There has been no claim of
responsibility
yet, and certainly we don't have
any evidence

12:50.069 --> 12:54.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we have seen physically
that would demonstrate
this is terrorism. But we know
terrorists

12:54.140 --> 12:59.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have historically targeted
aircraft. It has
psychological, human and
economic impact.

12:59.479 --> 13:05.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that al-Qaida and ISIS
have been perfecting
technologies and trying to hit
us on aircraft

13:05.618 --> 13:10.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the years, whether it's the
underwear
bomb plot out of Yemen, the shoe
and liquid

13:10.390 --> 13:15.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bomb plots out of the U.K., or
even the downing
of the Metrojet, the Russian
airliner out

13:15.161 --> 13:16.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Sinai by ISIS.

13:16.963 --> 13:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been trying to do
this. And they
have had expert bomb-makers
trying to figure

13:20.400 --> 13:25.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out ways of evading the security
technology
that we have, Ibrahim al-Asiri,
the master

13:25.271 --> 13:29.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bomb-maker in Yemen who has been
training
individuals for years, as well
as the Khorasan

13:29.876 --> 13:35.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
group, a senior group of
al-Qaida figures
in Syria that up to 2014 were
trying to perfect

13:35.848 --> 13:39.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
non-metallic devices that could
get on aircraft.

13:39.352 --> 13:43.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Deborah
Hersman, given the
laundry list that Juan Zarate
just went through,

13:43.656 --> 13:47.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the fact that this is an
aircraft that
has a pretty good safety record,
that both

13:47.226 --> 13:52.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the pilots that were in the
cockpit have experience
flying this aircraft, does that
lead you to

13:52.632 --> 13:55.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think that maybe this wouldn't
be a mechanical
issue?

13:55.435 --> 14:00.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBORAH HERSMAN: You know, it's
so early in
the investigation, we really
don't have that

14:00.573 --> 14:04.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much factual information that is
specific
to this event.

14:04.877 --> 14:10.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it is, you know, really
speculation
at this point if anyone tries to
identify

14:10.316 --> 14:16.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what the cause is. There may be
people who
have deeper information within
the intelligence

14:16.155 --> 14:22.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community, but the information
that's been
released publicly -- in the
U.S., we investigate

14:22.595 --> 14:28.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as if it's an accident until we
find evidence
of criminal intent, and then
it's turned over

14:28.234 --> 14:30.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the authorities and the FBI.

14:30.336 --> 14:35.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in this investigation,
there's not much
to go on, at least that's been
publicly shared

14:35.108 --> 14:36.809 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at this point.

14:36.843 --> 14:39.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Juan Zarate,
what about
those -- looking at the
different links in

14:39.412 --> 14:43.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the chain? Where are the
vulnerabilities?
Is it at the airport, is it in
transit, is

14:43.216 --> 14:45.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it the cargo holds?

14:45.051 --> 14:48.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just recently, France got even
tighter about
airport security, which you
would think that

14:48.387 --> 14:54.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this would be less likely that
an attack was
somehow planned or planted
inside France.

14:54.360 --> 14:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN ZARATE: You are right,
there are weak
links in the global airline
industry and system,

14:59.932 --> 15:01.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in terms of security.

15:01.768 --> 15:04.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, no system is
perfect. And so
if you have terrorist actors
constantly trying

15:04.904 --> 15:10.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to probe defenses and innovate,
they're likely
to get through once in a while,
so that's

15:10.309 --> 15:12.044 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the reality.

15:12.078 --> 15:15.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you also have to rely on
airport security
in third countries. It's part of
the reason

15:15.381 --> 15:20.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why the Department of Homeland
Security has
tried to forward-deploy some of
their assessments

15:20.720 --> 15:27.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and their security protocols,
vetting individuals
and cargo before it heads to the
United States.

15:27.059 --> 15:31.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you have to rely on foreign
partners,
and capacity-building is
important. You also

15:31.397 --> 15:35.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have the insider threat problem.
You referred
to the French. The French had
revoked the

15:35.368 --> 15:40.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security clearance of about 50
individuals
at Charles de Gaulle last year
precisely because

15:40.673 --> 15:42.375 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of concerns.

15:42.408 --> 15:46.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those are concerns that were
manifest
in the Sinai downing, as well as
the Mogadishu

15:46.412 --> 15:50.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airline attack which didn't
result in the
downing of the aircraft, but was
certainly

15:50.283 --> 15:56.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was an insider job. And,
finally, the new
technologies themselves. These
are very smart

15:56.489 --> 15:59.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
individuals who have time and
space to operate.

15:59.125 --> 16:03.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I worry about, even
though we can't
-- we shouldn't speculate and we
can't definitively

16:03.696 --> 16:08.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say what has happened, is, you
have had a
quickening of the threats and
capabilities

16:08.067 --> 16:13.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from groups like ISIS, and
certainly an intent
to hit aircraft. And that's what
I think worries

16:13.339 --> 16:16.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
individuals, especially when
France and Egypt
are involved.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are prime targets for
jihadi groups.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Deborah
Hersman, it seems
that the terrorists are
deploying technology

16:22.448 --> 16:26.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
faster than the aviation
industry is. And
what about the sort of global
web of satellites

16:26.919 --> 16:31.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and sensors that could tell us
where every
given aircraft is at any given
time, especially

16:31.490 --> 16:33.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after the Malaysian Air
disappearance?

16:33.292 --> 16:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBORAH HERSMAN: Yes, this
really started
back after Air France 447 in
2009.

16:40.499 --> 16:49.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That recovery operation took two
years and
cost $40 million. With Malaysia
in 2014, 370,

16:49.141 --> 16:53.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cost about that much in the
first month, and
so the real question that we
should be asking

16:53.746 --> 16:58.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, why do we not have better
technology to
locate any aircraft where they
are?

16:58.851 --> 17:03.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can locate my kids with their
iPhones anywhere
that they are. We need to have
need better

17:03.789 --> 17:11.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
technology on aircraft. And NTSB
has recommended
that we not only have more
frequent sending

17:11.230 --> 17:16.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of location. They want it to be
sent once
every minute, so that we can
pinpoint location

17:16.435 --> 17:20.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
better. They want those
recorders to last
not 30 days, but 90 days.

17:20.640 --> 17:26.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they also have recommended
that an important
package of information, small
bit, small package

17:26.612 --> 17:31.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of data be sent that's
triggered, if there
is some event where you see a
deviation from

17:31.417 --> 17:36.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expected parameters, that you
would send some
information from the flight data
recorder,

17:36.756 --> 17:41.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that you don't have to pull
that recorder
up from the bottom of the ocean
to know what's

17:41.294 --> 17:43.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going on.

17:43.062 --> 17:47.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's a lot of technology,
including
cockpit video recorders, that
hasn't been

17:47.800 --> 17:50.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taken advantage of that we could
do more with.

17:50.636 --> 17:55.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Deborah Hersman,
Juan Zarate, thank you both.

17:55.408 --> 17:59.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUAN ZARATE: Thank you.

17:59.879 --> 18:04.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEBORAH HERSMAN: Thank you.

18:04.450 --> 18:08.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the race
for the White
House.

18:08.788 --> 18:13.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic front-runner Hillary
Clinton didn't
mince words about the
presumptive Republican

18:13.059 --> 18:18.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominee today. In an interview
with CNN, Clinton
said that Donald Trump is not
qualified to

18:18.864 --> 18:20.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be president.

18:20.566 --> 18:25.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump drew still other criticism
after he
responded early this morning to
the EgyptAir

18:25.338 --> 18:30.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crash with this tweet -- quote
-- "Looks like
yet another terrorist attack.
Airplane departed

18:30.476 --> 18:37.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Paris. When will we get
tough, smart,
and vigilant? Great hate and
sickness!"

18:37.717 --> 18:42.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Clinton responded in the
interview, calling
Trump's comments reckless and
dangerous.

18:42.922 --> 18:47.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When asked about her Democratic
rival, Senator
Bernie Sanders, Clinton declared
the race

18:47.226 --> 18:49.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the party's nomination over.

18:49.161 --> 18:53.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I will be the nominee for my
party, Chris.

18:53.099 --> 18:57.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's already done, in effect.
There's no
way that I won't be.

18:57.503 --> 19:02.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Bernie
Sanders has declared
that he will keep up the fight
on through

19:02.375 --> 19:06.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the last primaries and bring his
message to
the convention in Philadelphia.

19:06.112 --> 19:09.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what does that mean for the
Democrats'
chance in the fall?

19:09.982 --> 19:14.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm joined by longtime
Democratic strategist
and professor of politics at
University of

19:14.487 --> 19:17.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Southern California Bob Shrum.

19:17.223 --> 19:19.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bob Shrum, thank you very much
for being with
us.

19:19.925 --> 19:24.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After Hillary Clinton said that
today, I want
to read to you just a portion of
what the

19:24.230 --> 19:29.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders camp put out within the
last hour.
They said: "We expect voters in
the remaining

19:29.568 --> 19:35.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contests will disagree, as we
do, with what
she said." He said -- they say
that: "Senator

19:35.674 --> 19:40.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders is doing much better
than Hillary
Clinton against Donald Trump in
national and

19:40.646 --> 19:45.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state polls. It is clear that
millions of
Americans have growing doubts
about the Clinton

19:45.918 --> 19:47.153 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign."

19:47.186 --> 19:51.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you make of what is
going on in the
Sanders camp?

19:51.290 --> 19:53.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BOB SHRUM, Democratic
Strategist: Well, it's
not just the Sanders camp.

19:53.859 --> 19:58.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a kind of natural
back-and-forth that
goes on at the end of these
primary periods,

19:59.031 --> 20:04.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when someone who is behind wants
to keep making
the case. We went through it in
2008. And

20:04.270 --> 20:08.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of what Hillary Clinton
said was pretty
tough. Some of what Barack Obama
said was

20:08.441 --> 20:12.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pretty tough, but they managed
to put things
together afterwards.

20:12.111 --> 20:16.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there is a basis for
doing that
here. I think we will get to
that point. But

20:16.449 --> 20:21.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to expect someone who is still
running in
these primaries, who is trying
to win a number

20:21.754 --> 20:26.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them, and who has a chance to
win some
of them, to say, oh, yes, I sort
of agree

20:26.892 --> 20:29.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with all of this, is a false
expectation.

20:30.029 --> 20:33.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton didn't do it.
Bernie Sanders
won't do it, but, in the end, I
think they

20:33.466 --> 20:35.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will get together.

20:35.201 --> 20:38.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it the right
thing for her
to do to say right now, I am the
nominee?

20:38.471 --> 20:43.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BOB SHRUM: Well, she is
mathematically the
nominee. And the way she was
asked that question,

20:43.175 --> 20:47.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think she could have
given any other
answer.

20:47.313 --> 20:52.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the interesting things
is, I saw her
interview characterized as a
warning to Sanders.

20:52.551 --> 20:57.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought it was an invitation.
She was saying,
I will do my part to unify the
party, he has

20:57.456 --> 20:59.191 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do his part.

20:59.225 --> 21:02.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by the way, he's doing her
a couple of
favors right now. One of the
biggest ones

21:02.828 --> 21:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, he's not on television in
California.
She's ahead here. If he went on
television

21:07.766 --> 21:11.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- I think he has the money to
do it -- he
would threaten that in a serious
way, and

21:11.704 --> 21:14.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she would have to spend a lot of
money to
try to counter it.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean not on
television
in terms of paid advertising.

21:16.809 --> 21:20.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BOB SHRUM: Yes, not on
television in terms
of paid advertising.

21:20.146 --> 21:25.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The weakness of my old
consulting background,
you say go on TV, you mean buy
TV ads.

21:25.818 --> 21:29.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bob Shrum, you
have watched
politics for a long time. What
do you think

21:29.688 --> 21:31.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bernie Sanders wants as this
point?

21:31.724 --> 21:36.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB SHRUM: Well, I think he
probably still
wants the nomination. I don't
think that's

21:36.395 --> 21:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to happen. He wants to
influence the
party's platform.

21:40.699 --> 21:45.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there's a basis for
the two of
them to agree on things like the
minimum wage,

21:45.371 --> 21:50.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on debt-free college, if not
free college
for everybody. And I think he
probably wants

21:50.476 --> 21:52.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some reforms in the nominating
process.

21:52.811 --> 21:57.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, when he says open the
party up and let
the people in, I think what he
means is independents

21:57.583 --> 22:02.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should be able to vote in all
primaries. I
suspect he would also like to
get rid of -- get

22:02.621 --> 22:04.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rid of or modify the
superdelegate system.

22:05.024 --> 22:09.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, frankly, that shouldn't be
a problem
for Secretary Clinton. She won't
need those

22:10.029 --> 22:12.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
superdelegates in 2020 to get
renominated.

22:12.565 --> 22:18.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I saw a
poll today, somebody
quoting a poll saying that,
right now, something

22:18.671 --> 22:25.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like 60 percent of Bernie
Sanders supporters
have an unfavorable view of
Hillary Clinton.

22:25.544 --> 22:30.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To what extent is what he's
doing potentially
going to hurt her campaign in
the fall, if

22:30.616 --> 22:32.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
she's the nominee?

22:32.418 --> 22:38.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB SHRUM: Well, at this point,
I don't see
the kind of sulfurous criticism
of her that

22:38.324 --> 22:42.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would hurt in the fall.

22:42.194 --> 22:46.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, as I said, there was a
lot of back-and-forth
at the end of 2008. There was a
group called

22:46.832 --> 22:52.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the PUMAs who said -- women who
said they'd
never vote for Barack Obama.
Almost all of

22:52.338 --> 22:54.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them did.

22:54.173 --> 22:58.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think the heat of passion
at the moment
cools off. I think that Hillary
Clinton will

22:58.477 --> 23:02.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want Bernie Sanders to have a
role at the
convention, and to help bring
the Sanders

23:02.448 --> 23:04.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people along, and I think that
will happen.

23:04.984 --> 23:09.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Sanders is conscious
that he's
brought so many new people into
the process,

23:09.922 --> 23:13.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they're going to be around
for a long
time, and that they're going to
have real

23:13.525 --> 23:18.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
influence. That's part of his
legacy. He doesn't
want his legacy to be, I'm
pretty sure, that

23:18.430 --> 23:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he helped elect Donald Trump.

23:20.299 --> 23:23.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You don't think
then -- I heard
what you said about you don't
hear the kind

23:24.003 --> 23:25.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of sulfurous language.

23:25.838 --> 23:29.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in looking again at the
Sanders campaign
statement this afternoon, they
said it's clear

23:29.241 --> 23:33.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
millions of Americans have
growing doubts
about the Clinton campaign.

23:33.846 --> 23:38.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB SHRUM: Well, that's the kind
of thing
you say at the end of the
process when you're

23:38.250 --> 23:40.052 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
behind.

23:40.085 --> 23:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Hillary Clinton made an
argument in
2008 that she would be a much
stronger general

23:43.622 --> 23:50.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election candidate than Barack
Obama would
be, and that he might very well
lose to John

23:50.129 --> 23:51.864 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
McCain.

23:51.897 --> 23:56.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just think it's kind of
natural. I think
we're intrigued by it, in part
because she

23:56.402 --> 24:02.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has won the nomination, in part
because he
has mounted such a vigorous
challenge, and

24:02.107 --> 24:06.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in part because the Republican
process is
over, and all the attention is
shifted to

24:06.445 --> 24:08.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Democrats.

24:08.280 --> 24:12.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I will bet that, at the end
of the day,
we have a convention where we
may have a roll

24:12.885 --> 24:17.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
call, and at some point in the
roll call,
Bernie Sanders will stand up and
move to nominate

24:17.856 --> 24:19.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton by acclamation.

24:19.825 --> 24:24.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bob Shrum,
joining us from
California, somebody who has
been watching

24:24.763 --> 24:26.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American politics for a long
time, we thank
you very much.

24:26.799 --> 24:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOB SHRUM: Thanks. Thanks, Judy.

24:27.566 --> 24:39.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

24:39.078 --> 24:44.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
modern-day echoes
of Stalin-era deportations; the
future of

24:44.983 --> 24:50.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
genetics, for better and for
worse; and a
hip-hop artist on why he doesn't
cater to

24:50.689 --> 24:54.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the whims of the music industry.

24:54.460 --> 24:59.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: business leaders
launching second
careers to address social
problems like poor

24:59.765 --> 25:02.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nutrition and food waste.

25:02.634 --> 25:07.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman looks
at a program at Harvard
University teaching

25:07.206 --> 25:09.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
former executives how to do
good.

25:10.008 --> 25:15.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of our weekly Making
Sense report,
which airs every Thursday on the
"NewsHour."

25:15.247 --> 25:21.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: At Daily Table in
food desert
Dorchester, Massachusetts,
apples for just

25:21.587 --> 25:28.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
69 cents a pound, fresh salmon
for less than
$3, top-flight food at
rock-bottom prices.

25:28.127 --> 25:31.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUG RAUCH, Founder, Daily
Table: We have
got massive amounts of wasted
food, and, at

25:31.497 --> 25:36.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same time, we have got 49
million Americans
that can't afford to eat
properly.

25:36.135 --> 25:41.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Doug Rauch opened
this nonprofit
store after 30 years at Trader
Joe's, the

25:41.540 --> 25:43.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
last 14 as president.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, is this food all rejects,
seconds?

25:46.178 --> 25:51.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUG RAUCH: Every single product
in the store
is a quality product that was
either excess

25:51.550 --> 25:57.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inventory, a shorter code, so we
don't sell
anything past its code date, or
it's something

25:57.923 --> 26:02.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we made at a special buy on,
something that
is maybe the product has been
discontinued

26:02.060 --> 26:05.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or the label has changed, these
sorts of deals.

26:05.097 --> 26:11.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Americans waste
some 133 billion
pounds of food a year.
Supermarket chains

26:11.603 --> 26:16.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
play a role by tossing products
within 30
days of the sell-by date if they
can't ship

26:16.975 --> 26:18.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them to stores quickly enough.

26:18.744 --> 26:25.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUG RAUCH: Here's an item from
Stonyfield
that is April 19. So, that still
has 12 days

26:25.184 --> 26:25.818 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on it from now.

26:25.851 --> 26:27.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Right.

26:27.619 --> 26:30.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUG RAUCH: And yet we're
selling this for
99 cents for a six-pack. This
gives people

26:30.722 --> 26:34.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the community a chance to
provide their
family with yogurt that they
never would have

26:34.793 --> 26:36.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been able to afford.

26:36.762 --> 26:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Daily Table wants
to appeal to
members of this community who
may be too embarrassed

26:40.599 --> 26:44.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to take handouts from food banks
or soup kitchens.

26:44.069 --> 26:48.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUG RAUCH: There's something
inherent in
a donor-recipient relationship
which is a

26:48.173 --> 26:53.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
power differential. Here, we
have flipped
it. Because they get to be
customers, we got

26:53.111 --> 26:57.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to earn their patronage, and
they come to
experience that in a
neighborhood where they

26:57.216 --> 27:01.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get to feel better when they
walk out instead
of in any way slightly lessened.

27:01.854 --> 27:08.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Retired at age 57,
this is Rauch's
second act, thanks to a quirky
fellowship

27:08.427 --> 27:10.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at the Harvard Business School.

27:10.229 --> 27:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSABETH MOSS KANTER, Harvard
Business School:
It actually took him a while to
hone in on

27:14.967 --> 27:16.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the concept.

27:16.735 --> 27:21.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Rosabeth Moss
Kanter runs the
Advanced Leadership Initiative
for ex-execs

27:21.306 --> 27:23.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
intent on solving social
problems.

27:23.542 --> 27:28.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSABETH MOSS KANTER: He was
interested in
food waste, he was interested in
hunger, he

27:28.747 --> 27:33.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was interested all over the
place. And we
gave him contacts, we gave him
ideas, we gave

27:33.619 --> 27:36.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him feedback. You don't do it
instantly.

27:36.421 --> 27:41.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Kanter envisioned
the potential
eight years ago: millions of
high-powered

27:41.326 --> 27:44.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
baby boomers like Rauch nearing
retirement
age.

27:44.663 --> 27:48.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSABETH MOSS KANTER: We said,
hey, here is
a leadership force, and if we
could only deploy

27:49.001 --> 27:55.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them to work on these pressing
problems of
water, and climate, and health,
and education,

27:55.407 --> 28:01.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and conflict, and rights, maybe
that's a perfect
match, because these baby
boomers were going

28:01.079 --> 28:08.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to live 20 to 30 more years, be
productive,
be healthy, and most
institutions had never

28:08.654 --> 28:10.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
taken that into account.

28:10.589 --> 28:16.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: This year, 47
retirees have returned
to school with lofty resumes,
and ambitions

28:16.962 --> 28:18.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to match.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUNEEL KAMLANI, Advanced
Leadership Initiative
Fellow: I'm interested in
establishing what

28:20.098 --> 28:22.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm going to call the Acela
Corridor Infrastructure
Bank.

28:22.834 --> 28:28.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Suneel Kamlani,
former chief
operating officer at investment
bank UBS,

28:28.574 --> 28:32.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plans to hook up building
projects with cash-heavy
funders.

28:32.077 --> 28:37.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUNEEL KAMLANI: The country's
infrastructure
is crumbling. Conversely, the
private sector

28:37.182 --> 28:39.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has a significant amount of
capital.

28:39.184 --> 28:43.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Biotech
entrepreneur Ken Kelley
wondered why there was no
vaccine for the

28:44.022 --> 28:45.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deadly Ebola virus.

28:45.857 --> 28:49.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN KELLEY, Advanced Leadership
Initiative
Fellow: It became almost an
intellectual itch

28:49.628 --> 28:51.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inside my brain that I had to
address.

28:51.597 --> 28:56.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It turned out many
diseases just
aren't big enough to attract
industry or government

28:56.234 --> 29:03.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
funding. So Kelley is developing
a public-private
partnership and a global
investment fund.

29:03.041 --> 29:07.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN KELLEY: To have vaccines and
drugs available
for neglected tropical diseases
before they

29:07.379 --> 29:09.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
become pandemic threats.

29:09.214 --> 29:13.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROSABETH MOSS KANTER: We
encourage the fellows
to think really big, bigger than
they thought

29:13.385 --> 29:15.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they could when they came in.

29:15.554 --> 29:20.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Don't just think outside of the
box. You know,
be creative. Think outside the
building.

29:20.359 --> 29:25.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It's the job of the
program to
help fellows figure out how to
put their ideas

29:25.197 --> 29:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into action. There are seminars.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSABETH MOSS KANTER: The whole
point of this
year is that you have been asked
to stand

29:30.836 --> 29:35.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back and reflect and not just
repeat what
you have been doing.

29:35.841 --> 29:38.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Instead, fellows
network, collaborate.

29:38.577 --> 29:42.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Why don't your other
cohorts agree
with your position?

29:42.714 --> 29:49.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And go to class.
Carol Hallquist
is working on an online hub
connecting schools

29:49.454 --> 29:51.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with retiree helpers.

29:51.223 --> 29:56.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Larry, Pat and I have
been meeting
about our projects on urban
education. And

29:56.395 --> 30:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're thinking about how we
finance our projects
differently, especially because
of the two

30:01.166 --> 30:02.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
case studies.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROSABETH MOSS KANTER: Pat,
you're nodding.

30:03.869 --> 30:08.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I am. Just having worked
with Carol
and Larry and the team, it's
fascinating how

30:08.840 --> 30:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ideas generate through our
dialogue.

30:10.709 --> 30:12.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And then there's
the homework.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNNE WINES, Advanced Leadership
Initiative
Fellow: It's been quite a few
years since

30:14.780 --> 30:18.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have had to write a term
paper, and I, on
spring break, had to write a
term paper.

30:18.383 --> 30:23.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Former banker Lynne
Wines wants
to help adults with cognitive
disabilities

30:23.121 --> 30:24.856 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
find jobs.

30:24.890 --> 30:28.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNNE WINES: Somebody with
dyslexia may not
be able to take a written test
or submit a

30:28.694 --> 30:32.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
written application, but they
may be the best
employee that they ever had.

30:32.831 --> 30:39.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The upshot of this
program? Turn
ideas into viable ventures, like
Doug Rauch's

30:39.337 --> 30:41.106 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Daily Table.

30:41.139 --> 30:45.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUG RAUCH: We put in a kitchen
because people
need to be able to grab
ready-to-eat meals

30:45.711 --> 30:50.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they can take home and
serve to their
family. What they told us was,
they don't

30:50.682 --> 30:54.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have any time. So we provide
them meals that
in three to five minutes they
can heat up

30:54.219 --> 30:56.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that are delicious, nutritious,
and affordable.

30:56.621 --> 31:03.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They get to see food being
produced. They
get to watch product being made
right there

31:03.095 --> 31:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by people in their community.
And it removes
any question, like, where did
this come from

31:07.766 --> 31:09.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and how can you have it so
cheap?

31:09.601 --> 31:15.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: To start, Daily
Table has relied
on donations, but Rauch thinks
ventures like

31:15.240 --> 31:17.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this need to pay for themselves.

31:17.442 --> 31:22.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUG RAUCH: We hope, and we're
starting to
prove, that you can get to a
break-even spot

31:22.314 --> 31:27.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where then a store can keep
going without
additional philanthropic
support. If this

31:27.686 --> 31:31.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is true and we can actually show
this to work,
then it becomes scalable.

31:31.823 --> 31:37.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Rauch is already
scouting a second
Boston location and plans to
take Daily Table

31:37.395 --> 31:43.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a new city next year, just
one of more
than 200 graduates of the
Harvard Advanced

31:43.235 --> 31:49.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Leadership Program embarking on
an encore
career, and please forgive the
cliche, trying

31:50.008 --> 31:52.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make the world a better
place.

31:52.177 --> 31:58.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
economics
correspondent Paul Solman in
Boston, Massachusetts.

31:58.416 --> 32:03.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Advanced
Leadership Initiative
fellows pay a fee to participate
in the program

32:03.989 --> 32:09.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
, though some financial fee is
available.
Harvard University wouldn't
disclose the exact

32:09.661 --> 32:16.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
amount, but reports put the fee
at more than
$50,000.

32:16.334 --> 32:28.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's been more
than two
years since Russia invaded the
Ukrainian territory

32:28.747 --> 32:33.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Crimea, home to a Muslim
population that
has suffered greatly through the
centuries.

32:33.418 --> 32:37.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since the invasion, they are
under pressure
once more.

32:37.355 --> 32:41.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Kiev, special correspondent
Kira Kay
reports, our story produced in
partnership

32:41.993 --> 32:44.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the Bureau for
International Reporting.

32:44.930 --> 32:52.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRA KAY: Here in the main
mosque of Ukraine's
capital, Kiev, Imam Seram Arifov
leads Friday

32:52.103 --> 32:58.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prayers for the city's Muslims,
but he is
more than 500 miles from his
home in Simferopol,

32:58.276 --> 33:00.111 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Crimea.

33:00.145 --> 33:03.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IMAM SERAM ARIFOV, Ukraine
(through translator):
I was a teacher. We had a
private school.

33:03.148 --> 33:09.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were teaching the Islamic
religious sciences.
We also taught the Koran. I had
to leave my

33:09.621 --> 33:17.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
homeland to continue my job in
more acceptable
conditions. We could not work in
Crimea anymore.

33:17.429 --> 33:20.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They didn't let the school
operate. They didn't
renew our license.

33:20.699 --> 33:27.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KIRA KAY: "They" are the
Russians, who invaded
and annexed Crimea in march
2014. The imam

33:27.772 --> 33:33.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and about 100 members of the
congregation
are Crimean Tatars, a small
Muslim community

33:33.245 --> 33:36.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with centuries of history in the
region.

33:36.181 --> 33:40.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But many found themselves on the
wrong side
of the new authorities, and now
they have,

33:40.852 --> 33:46.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in effect, become refugees in
their own country.
This young mother is one of
them.

33:46.892 --> 33:51.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): I
had to quit
my studies. I was studying there
in high school,

33:51.363 --> 33:56.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but I had to grab my documents
and come here.
All our loved ones are still in
Crimea. We

33:56.134 --> 34:00.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are far away from our parents.
And it's difficult
to be away from our homeland.

34:00.705 --> 34:06.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRA KAY: Protests in Ukraine
led to the ouster
of pro-Russian President Viktor
Yanukovych

34:06.711 --> 34:13.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in early 2014, but Russia,
unhappy with the
loss of Yanukovych, took
advantage of the

34:13.218 --> 34:16.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turmoil, reclaiming territory it
considered
its own.

34:16.755 --> 34:24.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A referendum was held in March
2014. Russian
authorities say 96 percent of
Crimean voters

34:24.663 --> 34:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
supported the annexation.

34:28.300 --> 34:32.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But Refat Chubarov, the
political leader of
the Crimean Tatars, believes
many Crimean

34:32.804 --> 34:37.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
residents were too intimidated
by the heavy
presence of Russian troops to
express their

34:37.776 --> 34:39.577 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
true feelings.

34:39.611 --> 34:41.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REFAT CHUBAROV, Chairman, The
Mejlis of the
Crimean Tatar People (through
translator):

34:41.413 --> 34:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only ones who spoke out
openly against
such a fake referendum were
Crimean Tatars.

34:45.717 --> 34:51.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We understood that Crimea faced
a new problem,
a terrible one. Moscow never
came to Crimea

34:51.256 --> 34:53.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with good intentions.

34:53.091 --> 34:58.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRA KAY: The Crimean Tatars
already had a
long history of conflict with
Russia, going

34:58.596 --> 35:05.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back even before the Soviet
Union. Then, during
World War II, nearly the entire
population

35:05.236 --> 35:11.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was forcefully deported
thousands of miles
away by communist dictator
Joseph Stalin.

35:11.509 --> 35:17.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ukraine says more than 100,000
people died
in what it considers a genocide.

35:17.916 --> 35:22.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That history resurfaced
dramatically last
week, when a Ukrainian woman of
Crimean Tatar

35:22.654 --> 35:30.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
descent won a Pan-European sing
contest watched
by tens of millions. Her winning
song memorialized

35:30.161 --> 35:38.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 1944 deportation of the
Tatars. Only after
the Soviet Union dissolved in
the 1990s and

35:38.603 --> 35:43.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ukraine became its own country
did the bulk
of Crimea's Tatars return, with
the hopes

35:43.241 --> 35:46.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of starting over.

35:46.177 --> 35:51.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gulnara Izetovna's family
resettled and had
just finished building their new
house. But

35:51.349 --> 35:56.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after the referendum, Gulnara
was stopped
by authorities when returning
from a trip.

35:56.421 --> 36:01.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GULNARA IZETOVNA, Ukraine
(through translator):
They asked about my nationality.
I was accused

36:01.593 --> 36:04.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of separatism and they
interrogated me.

36:04.462 --> 36:10.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIRA KAY: Izetovna fled, as have
an estimated
30,000 other Crimean Tatars.

36:10.035 --> 36:15.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GULNARA IZETOVNA (through
translator): Living
now in the 21st century, I never
thought that

36:15.340 --> 36:20.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this could happen again. What my
parents felt
during World War II is the same
thing I feel

36:20.545 --> 36:22.347 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

36:22.380 --> 36:27.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KIRA KAY: Ukraine is an
overwhelmingly Christian
country. The Orthodox Church
plays a strong

36:27.118 --> 36:32.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
role in life here. But the
annexation of Crimea,
and the Russian support of
separatists in

36:32.791 --> 36:38.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the east of the country, has
created a shared
enemy and made Ukraine more
welcoming of thousands

36:38.430 --> 36:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Muslim refugees than some
other parts of
Europe.

36:42.033 --> 36:46.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, it has been a difficult
process, says
aid worker Enver Bekirov.

36:46.671 --> 36:52.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ENVER BEKIROV, Aid Worker
(through translator):
There were many large families
of Crimean

36:52.677 --> 36:58.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tatars, families with sick
people, disabled
people. We just decided to take
the responsibility.

36:58.349 --> 37:03.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRA KAY: Bekirov ensures the
displaced have
proper clothing and food, and
helps them find

37:03.655 --> 37:07.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
housing that various refugee
agencies also
pay for.

37:07.926 --> 37:13.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Lenie Bilial fled Crimea,
she was pregnant
with her sixth child. She and
her husband,

37:13.731 --> 37:17.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mustafa, had wanted to stay in
Crimea, but
felt repressed because of their
faith.

37:17.702 --> 37:21.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MUSTAFA BILIAL, Ukraine (through
translator):
We are Muslims, and this is very
important

37:21.139 --> 37:25.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to us. What is happening in
Russia, we see
that Muslims are being
persecuted. They come

37:25.677 --> 37:30.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and break into these educational
establishments.
They include certain literature
on the blacklist.

37:30.415 --> 37:34.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I worry, for example, the Koran
or other books
might end up on the list.

37:34.252 --> 37:41.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRA KAY: Today, they feel
welcomed by their
new neighbors, but also not
fully at home.

37:41.126 --> 37:45.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Back in Crimea, Russian
authorities are now
intensifying their crackdown on
the Tatars,

37:45.897 --> 37:51.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
arresting activists and
community leaders
by using anti-extremist laws.
Others have

37:51.603 --> 37:56.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been abducted, including this
man, who was
filmed being taken by a
pro-Russian militia

37:56.608 --> 38:00.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and was later found dead with
signs of torture.

38:00.478 --> 38:06.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Crimean Tatars' governing
body, the Mejlis,
has been banned. They are now
functioning

38:06.317 --> 38:14.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in exile. Leader Refat Chubarov
has himself
been indicted by Crimean
prosecutors for violating

38:14.259 --> 38:18.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia's territorial integrity
by continuing
to insist Crimea is part of
Ukraine.

38:18.997 --> 38:23.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEOFFREY PYATT, U.S. Ambassador
to Ukraine:
This is a moderate Muslim
community that was

38:23.468 --> 38:29.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
victimized once before under
Stalin and is
now being victimized under the
Russian occupation

38:29.174 --> 38:31.042 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Crimea.

38:31.075 --> 38:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRA KAY: Geoffrey Pyatt is the
American ambassador
to Ukraine. The U.S. has
sanctions against

38:35.246 --> 38:40.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia because of the Crimean
annexation.
Pyatt says that amidst the
diplomatic pressure

38:40.552 --> 38:43.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and war of words, Crimea's
Tatars shouldn't
be overshadowed.

38:44.022 --> 38:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEOFFREY PYATT: Crimea is not
going to be
returned to Ukrainian
sovereignty over the

38:48.960 --> 38:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
short-term. And the Tatar
community understands
that. To have a community like
the Tatars,

38:55.433 --> 39:00.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is notably tolerant,
notably inclusive,
makes it even more important
that we not allow

39:00.471 --> 39:02.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their story to be forgotten.

39:02.874 --> 39:09.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRA KAY: Recently, Crimean
Tatars have taken
dramatic steps to make sure they
aren't forgotten.

39:09.681 --> 39:14.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, they created a
blockade of the
roads leading from Ukraine into
Crimea, jamming

39:14.919 --> 39:17.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an economic lifeline.

39:17.322 --> 39:22.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And activists believed to
include Crimean
Tatars blew up the power lines
still serving

39:22.961 --> 39:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Crimea, plunging the peninsula
into darkness
for weeks. But most Crimean
Tatars acknowledge

39:29.000 --> 39:35.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they won't be going home any
time soon, including
journalist Osman Pashayev, who
had been detained

39:35.373 --> 39:39.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
while covering commemorations of
the historic
deportation.

39:39.177 --> 39:45.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he and his entire news staff
also went
into exile. Their small
operation keeps the

39:45.783 --> 39:50.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flow of free information, both
for the community
in exile and those back home.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OSMAN PASHAYEV, Editor, ATR
Television (through
translator): We're looking
something to keep

39:53.625 --> 39:58.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that connection. We have to be
relevant to
our audience, and we must avoid
that the annexation

39:58.930 --> 40:00.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
becomes permanent.

40:00.632 --> 40:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRA KAY: But with every passing
day, that
connection may become harder to
keep.

40:06.271 --> 40:15.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is Kira Kay for "PBS
NewsHour" in Kiev,
Ukraine.

40:15.680 --> 40:26.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It seems as if
there are important
breakthroughs each year in the
field of genetics

40:26.224 --> 40:31.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and medicine. In many ways, we
indeed could
be on the verge of historical
changes in how

40:31.529 --> 40:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we use DNA and how we edit our
biological
code.

40:35.933 --> 40:41.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the moment can be deceptive.
The history
of genetics is long and
complicated, dating

40:41.239 --> 40:46.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back to the mid-19th century.
It's full of
exciting discoveries, endless
mysteries and

40:46.911 --> 40:48.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
even nefarious intent.

40:48.713 --> 40:54.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the ambitious scope of a
new book,
"The Gene: An Intimate History."
Its author

40:54.452 --> 40:59.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee, a
cancer physician
and an assistant professor of
medicine at

40:59.991 --> 41:05.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Columbia University. He's the
author of the
Pulitzer Prize-winning "The
Emperor of All

41:05.697 --> 41:08.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Maladies: A Biography of
Cancer."

41:08.299 --> 41:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee,
welcome to the "NewsHour"
again.

41:10.368 --> 41:11.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SIDDHARTHA MUKHERJEE,
Author, "The Gene:
An Intimate History": Pleasure
to be here.

41:11.969 --> 41:13.805 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

41:13.838 --> 41:17.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, an intimate
history within
what? Just a short time after
you have come

41:17.642 --> 41:23.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out with this award-winning book
on cancer,
you tackle an arguably more
complicated subject,

41:23.915 --> 41:27.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the gene, and there is a
personal connection.
Explain that.

41:27.618 --> 41:29.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SIDDHARTHA MUKHERJEE: Well,
this book
took actually a long time to
write. It was

41:29.620 --> 41:32.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- it took six years to write
this book.

41:32.657 --> 41:38.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the book gets intimate right
from the
first page. The story opens
really with an

41:38.730 --> 41:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exploration that was in the back
of my mind
where I -- as I was growing up.
It was about

41:42.433 --> 41:48.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my family's mental illness, two
uncles consumed
by schizophrenia and bipolar
disease, and

41:48.106 --> 41:53.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then, one generation later,
another, so, on
the same side of the family,
also diagnosed

41:53.077 --> 41:57.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with schizophrenia and
institutionalized,
and the growing realization in
my mind as

41:57.749 --> 42:03.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a child that this wasn't --
there was some
heredity lurking, that genes
were lurking

42:03.821 --> 42:07.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
behind mental illness, and that
coming to
fullness as I started to study
medicine and

42:07.525 --> 42:11.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
realize that there was a genetic
core to all
of this.

42:11.396 --> 42:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You sense, in
reading this
book, that there is an urgency
to this, that

42:15.833 --> 42:18.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you felt it was important to get
this done
now. Why?

42:18.436 --> 42:21.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SIDDHARTHA MUKHERJEE: It's
important to
get this done now because we are
at the -- on

42:21.739 --> 42:27.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the verge of unveiling or
discovering and
inventing astonishing new
technologies that

42:27.378 --> 42:30.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allow us to read and write human
genomes.

42:30.448 --> 42:35.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let me explain what I mean.
By read, I
mean we can now begin to scan
the human genome,

42:35.319 --> 42:40.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your genome, mine, all the genes
that you
and I have, and ask questions
about what it

42:40.158 --> 42:42.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
predicts for us in the future.

42:42.260 --> 42:46.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The technology is far from
accurate, but,
for instance, the risk of breast
cancer may

42:46.931 --> 42:52.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be present in a variation in
your genome.
And by write, I mean something
even more strange,

42:52.770 --> 42:56.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is that, lately -- and
this has been
widely covered, but, lately, we
have been

42:56.441 --> 43:01.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to -- scientists have been
able to go
into the human genome and make
intentional

43:01.078 --> 43:06.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alterations, erase genes, change
genes, change
their content, et cetera.

43:06.250 --> 43:12.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a surprising thing to do
and portends
a very, very complex landscape
for the future.

43:12.423 --> 43:15.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you do get to
some of these
very tough questions.

43:15.126 --> 43:18.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you also -- you really go
back through
the history of genetics, all the
way back

43:18.896 --> 43:24.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Aristotle and even before
that, I guess,
Pythagoras, move ahead to
Charles Darwin.

43:24.068 --> 43:27.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a number of figures
along the way
you spend time on.

43:27.772 --> 43:29.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is one of them more important
than all the
others?

43:29.640 --> 43:32.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SIDDHARTHA MUKHERJEE: Well,
they're all
important. This is a story
knitted together

43:32.310 --> 43:34.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with other stories.

43:34.712 --> 43:40.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I wanted to keep things
simple enough,
so that all readers could get --
you know,

43:40.151 --> 43:46.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the average reader, I could
understand what
the lineage of inventions and
discoveries

43:46.324 --> 43:48.226 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
was.

43:48.259 --> 43:52.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the most important
figures, of course,
is Gregor Mendel, a monk who
sort of persisted

43:52.630 --> 43:58.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with his experiments on pea
flowers and pea
plants, and just using those
very, very simple

43:58.503 --> 44:04.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experiments really brought out
what was at
that time a revolutionary
understanding that

44:04.375 --> 44:10.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
units of carrying hereditary
traits or features
were moving between parents and
their children.

44:10.114 --> 44:17.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That was a striking -- a
striking and original
observation, so striking, so
original, Judy,

44:17.054 --> 44:21.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he -- that it was lost, the
paper was
lost. No one even remembered it
for 40 years.

44:21.926 --> 44:25.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And his story is
so personal.
You write about all the
disappointments he

44:25.696 --> 44:28.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had. He was trying to pass an
exam, never
passed it.

44:28.099 --> 44:29.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. SIDDHARTHA MUKHERJEE: Twice,
failed twice.

44:29.767 --> 44:31.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Twice, twice,
which I think
may be a lesson for a lot of
people.

44:31.936 --> 44:32.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. SIDDHARTHA MUKHERJEE: I
know.

44:32.336 --> 44:33.771 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:33.804 --> 44:35.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Young people
today worrying
about passing their exams.

44:35.606 --> 44:41.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You also of course -- and we
suggested this
a moment ago -- get into the
darker side of

44:41.112 --> 44:51.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
genetics, the movement or
efforts along the
way to tailor and fix the human
progress in

44:51.255 --> 44:54.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a way that's negative and
dangerous.

44:54.559 --> 45:00.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why do you think that effort
didn't -- it
was bad enough, but why do you
think it got

45:00.364 --> 45:02.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as far as it did?

45:02.199 --> 45:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SIDDHARTHA MUKHERJEE: Well,
the road to
that particular hell is paved
with -- actually

45:06.270 --> 45:08.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was paved with progressive
intentions.

45:08.105 --> 45:11.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, that's what's
interesting about the
story. We forget it. We have
forgotten that,

45:11.142 --> 45:16.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that when the idea of eugenics
was invented,
the idea that you could improve
the human

45:16.247 --> 45:21.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race by better breeding, when it
was invented,
it was actually invented in
England by Francis

45:21.519 --> 45:23.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Galton, Darwin's cousin.

45:23.821 --> 45:28.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of progressives, not
all, but a
lot of progressives signed on to
it and thought

45:28.526 --> 45:33.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it was really great to
improve the human
race by selective breeding.

45:33.297 --> 45:40.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, what is amazing about is
that that idea
metastasizes to America, to our
shores, and

45:40.204 --> 45:44.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
becomes, you know -- that
selective human
breeding becomes selective human
sterilization,

45:44.141 --> 45:45.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Carrie Buck, a woman...

45:45.676 --> 45:48.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To whom you
dedicate the book,
along with your grandmother.

45:48.646 --> 45:50.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SIDDHARTHA MUKHERJEE: To
whom I dedicate
the book, along with my
grandmother.

45:50.514 --> 45:55.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carrie Buck was sterilized for
eugenic reasons.
Oliver Wendell Holmes, the great
judicial

45:55.186 --> 46:00.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moderate, said three generations
of imbeciles
is enough. So, we were allowed
-- the state

46:00.358 --> 46:05.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was allowed to sterilize Carrie
Buck on that
pretext.

46:05.129 --> 46:09.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then it metastasizes again
to Nazi Germany,
where it takes on the most
macabre form, moving

46:10.001 --> 46:15.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from breeding, to sterilization,
to ultimately
to extermination. Of course, we
remember the

46:16.007 --> 46:20.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nazi Germany, but we forget that
this was
our problem, too. This was not
only their

46:20.878 --> 46:24.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem. This is something that
arose out
of a very particularly moment in
American

46:24.682 --> 46:26.517 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

46:26.550 --> 46:30.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You write -- you
take genetics,
Siddhartha Mukherjee , all the
way to today,

46:30.855 --> 46:34.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
practically, and the inventions
that are coming
and the discoveries that are
coming almost

46:35.026 --> 46:40.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at rate, a daily pace, and yet
you do signal
the limits of this.

46:40.531 --> 46:44.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It feels as if, just a few years
ago, people
were thinking, oh, we're going
to solve all

46:44.402 --> 46:49.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our medical mysteries with the
genome. But
it isn't that simple, is it?

46:49.674 --> 46:51.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. SIDDHARTHA MUKHERJEE: It is
not that simple.

46:51.442 --> 46:54.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very important to remember
what parts
are simple and not. Otherwise,
we need this

46:54.879 --> 47:00.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vocabulary. This is a vast
public debate,
and it cannot be had within the
laboratory

47:00.384 --> 47:06.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or in tissue culture rooms or in
medical boardrooms.
It has to had in a wide public
place as possible.

47:06.757 --> 47:13.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But things are more complicated,
because your
genes predict the future, but
not in an absolute

47:13.898 --> 47:19.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sense, not in a one-to-one
sense. In other
words, there is still a striking
role of chance,

47:19.737 --> 47:25.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a striking role of the
environment. It's chance,
plus genes, plus environments,
and these interactions

47:25.676 --> 47:27.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between them that make you and
me.

47:27.978 --> 47:32.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the gene predict a little
bit in some
cases, a lot in other cases. And
we need to

47:32.416 --> 47:37.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
figure out what I what. We need
to appropriately
match where genes are useful and
where genes

47:37.088 --> 47:38.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can be misleading.

47:38.956 --> 47:42.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what -- how
should we think
about genetics right now Should
we think that

47:42.993 --> 47:47.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is still so much more to
be discovered
that can make a huge difference,
or that we're

47:47.565 --> 47:50.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coming closer to the end of what
there is
to be known?

47:50.634 --> 47:53.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SIDDHARTHA MUKHERJEE: I
think both of
these things can be true at the
same time.

47:53.137 --> 47:58.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a vast cosmos yet to be
discovered.
How do genes manage to make, you
know, a human

47:58.776 --> 48:00.544 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
being?

48:00.578 --> 48:04.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet there are things that we
already know
that are very important. We know
that we can

48:04.081 --> 48:09.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
predict with certain levels of
fidelity whether
you will have a heightened risk
for certain

48:09.286 --> 48:14.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
illnesses, cancer, potentially
Alzheimer's
disease, potentially other
diseases. We can

48:14.759 --> 48:16.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
begin to predict that risk.

48:16.560 --> 48:21.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the question is -- it's a
very uneasy
time, because, simultaneously,
we're being

48:21.165 --> 48:26.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to, as I said before, read
and write
the genome with a limited
capacity, but also

48:26.704 --> 48:31.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
projecting forward into the
future, understanding
that there's a whole new
landscape that needs

48:31.442 --> 48:33.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be figured out.

48:33.244 --> 48:37.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it was only
a short time
from the book on cancer to the
book on the

48:37.481 --> 48:39.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gene. So I'm assuming you have
already started
on the next one.

48:39.750 --> 48:40.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. SIDDHARTHA MUKHERJEE: Oh, I
have not.

48:40.785 --> 48:41.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:41.719 --> 48:43.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Siddhartha
Mukherjee.

48:43.454 --> 48:45.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The book is "The Gene: An
Intimate History."

48:45.656 --> 48:50.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

48:50.261 --> 48:59.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. SIDDHARTHA MUKHERJEE: Thank
you for having
me.

48:59.436 --> 49:05.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally,
another installment
in our Brief But Spectacular
series, where

49:05.643 --> 49:08.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we ask interesting people to
describe their
passions.

49:08.345 --> 49:13.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from hip-hop
artist Jared
Pellerin, who's better known by
his stage

49:13.350 --> 49:18.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
name, Pell, on how beauty can be
born of hardship
and what he discovers making
music he calls

49:18.956 --> 49:20.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
experimental soul.

49:20.791 --> 49:24.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED PELLERIN, Musician:
Sometimes, I feel
like a true masterpiece is made
from making

49:24.895 --> 49:27.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a mistake beautiful.

49:28.032 --> 49:37.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I first started making music
when I was around
16 in Jackson, Mississippi,
because I was

49:37.942 --> 49:41.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forced to move there after
Hurricane Katrina
with my brother and mother.

49:41.946 --> 49:46.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember making friends by
making music
because, being in a new social
situation,

49:46.717 --> 49:52.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's always a good thing to be
able to identify
yourself with something, and I
identified

49:52.323 --> 49:54.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
myself as an artist.

49:54.124 --> 49:59.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have a lot of musical
influences, Kanye
West, Pharrell William, Frank
Ocean, Stevie

49:59.430 --> 50:05.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wonder. I listen to Stevie when
I feel like
I'm in love or I feel like I
want to do better

50:05.135 --> 50:07.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the world, because there's a
lot of positivity
in his music.

50:07.771 --> 50:13.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would describe my music as
experimental
soul. And some of the best music
to me is

50:13.644 --> 50:18.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that that comes out of accident.
Maybe that
one drum hit that didn't sound
right, if left

50:18.983 --> 50:24.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in there and mixed the perfect
way, can provide
the ear candy for a classic.

50:24.755 --> 50:29.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Runaway" is one of my favorite
tracks, because
it deals with having to leave
something that

50:29.793 --> 50:37.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know and chasing your own
path and dream.
That's how you get the message.

50:37.201 --> 50:39.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"That's how you get the message,
when I no
longer can text you. Hear our
past on every

50:39.370 --> 50:42.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
record because it's way too hard
forgetting.
All the teachings in the world
can't force

50:42.673 --> 50:46.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another lesson, that it's better
you're a
ghost within my presence. But I
still remember

50:46.076 --> 50:52.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you just as a blessing, I'm
confessing."

50:52.616 --> 50:58.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Being in the music industry, you
are confronted
with a bunch of challenges
creatively, because

50:58.822 --> 51:02.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you will have people telling you
what you
should be talking about, when
the goal of

51:02.593 --> 51:04.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an artist is to tell their
story.

51:04.328 --> 51:08.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I should try to challenge myself
to bring
something new to the culture,
because that's

51:08.332 --> 51:13.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how it keeps pushing forward.
The way music
streaming is now and the trends
that it's

51:13.437 --> 51:19.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
starting to show in our
listeners' attention,
I feel that people are more
receptive to singles

51:19.476 --> 51:21.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and not listening to albums as
much.

51:21.345 --> 51:24.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you drop an album, you're
not dropping
a bunch of loose singles. You're
dropping

51:24.481 --> 51:29.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a cohesive story or a cohesive
body of work
sonically that you want somebody
to be able

51:29.420 --> 51:34.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to digest, sit with, maybe play
a few times.
It takes a lot to make an album.
You're putting

51:34.825 --> 51:41.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your whole soul into a body of
work that is
something that needs to be
enjoyed in its

51:41.932 --> 51:43.934 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
completeness.

51:43.968 --> 51:48.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you take away that
aspect and you
want to, you know, pitch this
single or this

51:48.238 --> 51:53.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
single, and not really have
anybody focus
on the album, you take away from
what the

51:53.877 --> 51:56.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
point of the music is, you know?

51:56.380 --> 52:01.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's up? My name is Jared
Pellerin, AKA
Pell. And this is my Brief But
Spectacular

52:01.485 --> 52:03.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
take on experimental soul.

52:03.787 --> 52:08.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
