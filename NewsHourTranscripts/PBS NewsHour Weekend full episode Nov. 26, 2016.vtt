15:21.220 --> 15:22.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

15:31.664 --> 15:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN

15:33.166 --> 15:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM MOST AMERICAN LEADERS.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

15:35.668 --> 15:37.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE END, REPRESENTED IN HIS

15:37.670 --> 15:38.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIFE?

15:38.337 --> 15:39.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IF YOU

15:39.405 --> 15:42.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUGHT ABOUT IT, CUBA A VERY

15:42.742 --> 15:44.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SMALL COUNTRY, AND IT DOESN'T

15:44.777 --> 15:46.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRODUCE ANY STRATEGIC MATERIALS

15:46.546 --> 15:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ANYONE WOULD REALLY CARE

15:47.713 --> 15:49.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT IT, BUT IT WAS 90 MILES

15:49.549 --> 15:50.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWAY FROM THE UNITED STATES WITH

15:50.449 --> 15:52.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIDEL CASTRO, AND IT WAS IN THE

15:52.652 --> 15:53.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIDST OF THE COLD WAR THAT HE

15:53.953 --> 15:55.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAME TO POWER.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HIS ABILITY TO SORT OF

15:56.222 --> 15:56.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANIPULATE THAT RELATIONSHIP,

15:56.989 --> 15:58.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE WAS SUCH A SORT OF ROCK

15:58.591 --> 16:00.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STAR IN THE WAY THAT HE DID IT,

16:00.359 --> 16:02.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT WAS ALWAYS THIS SORT OF

16:02.995 --> 16:04.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYMBOLISM OF CHALLENGING

16:04.263 --> 16:05.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICAN IMPERIALISM AND BEING

16:05.198 --> 16:05.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE FACE OF THE UNITED

16:05.965 --> 16:06.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE WAS THAT WAY UNTIL THE

16:07.733 --> 16:08.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY END.

16:08.701 --> 16:11.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT WAS SORT OF THE ROCK STAR

16:11.504 --> 16:12.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIDEL, EVEN THOUGH AT HOME HE

16:12.772 --> 16:14.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS PRETTY MUCH A THUG.

16:14.740 --> 16:18.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: THE ROCK STAR.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN WILLIAM LEOGRANDE, HE TALKED

16:20.213 --> 16:21.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE POWER OF PROPAGANDA.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT DO WE BEEN THE FACTS?

16:23.216 --> 16:24.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHEN HE TOOK POWER IN 1959,

16:24.984 --> 16:27.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAD TWO OBJECTIVES-- ONE WAS

16:27.353 --> 16:30.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO TOTALLY REFORM CUBA'S CORRUPT

16:30.556 --> 16:32.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND UNEQUAL SOCIAL ORDER AND THE

16:32.558 --> 16:34.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER WAS TO GAIN INDEPENDENCE

16:34.227 --> 16:34.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE UNITED STATES.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE EARLY YEARS HE MADE A LOT

16:36.028 --> 16:38.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF PROGRESS ON BOTH OF THESE.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE KICKED THE AMERICANS OUT AND

16:40.533 --> 16:42.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOLISHED CAPITALISM IN CUBA

16:42.335 --> 16:44.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPLACING IT WITH SOVIET-STYLE

16:44.337 --> 16:45.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNISM.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE REALITY IS OVER TIME

16:46.372 --> 16:48.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE GOALS BEGAN TO ACTUALLY

16:48.407 --> 16:49.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERODE.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE SEE NOW THAT HIS BROTHER,

16:50.476 --> 16:52.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAUL CASTRO, IS MOVING TOWARDS

16:52.745 --> 16:54.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE OF A MARKET SOCIALISM ON

16:54.013 --> 16:55.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ORDER OF CHINA OR VIETNAM.

16:55.882 --> 16:58.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE OLD-STYLE SOVIET MODEL

16:58.885 --> 16:59.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST DIDN'T WORK.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SINCE DECEMBER 2014, CUBA

17:01.721 --> 17:03.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN

17:03.522 --> 17:05.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RE-ENGAGING WITH ONE ANOTHER.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. VISITORS ARE GOING DOWN

17:06.259 --> 17:07.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE BY THE THOUSANDS AND U.S.

17:07.927 --> 17:09.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESSES ARE JUST CHOMPING AT

17:09.028 --> 17:10.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BIT TO GET INTO CUBA.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: HOW DID FIDEL

17:11.564 --> 17:12.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASTRO DO THIS?

17:12.431 --> 17:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S BEEN MANY DECK EPIDEMICS

17:13.966 --> 17:15.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SINCE CUBAN PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED

17:15.735 --> 17:16.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM ECONOMIC DISTRESS AND

17:16.669 --> 17:17.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL REPRESSION?

17:17.436 --> 17:19.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S FASCINATING.

17:19.272 --> 17:20.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN YOU THINK THAT THE WALL

17:20.473 --> 17:22.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FELL IN '89, THAT THE SOVIET

17:22.775 --> 17:24.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNION UNRAVELED 25 YEARS AGO,

17:24.310 --> 17:26.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE CUBANS WENT THROUGH A

17:26.012 --> 17:27.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY TOUGH TIME, THAT SPECIAL

17:27.780 --> 17:29.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERIOD WHEN THEY DIDN'T HAVE

17:29.482 --> 17:32.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT FINANCIAL SUPPORT THAT KEPT

17:32.885 --> 17:34.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASTRO IN POWER FOR A VERY LONG

17:34.520 --> 17:35.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME.

17:35.187 --> 17:36.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DID THEY DO IT?

17:36.689 --> 17:37.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S AN ISLAND.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY COULD CONTROL AN ENORMOUS

17:39.358 --> 17:40.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMOUNT BECAUSE IT WAS AN ISLAND.

17:40.626 --> 17:41.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THE POWER OF HIS

17:41.794 --> 17:42.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSONALITY WAS A BIG PART OF

17:42.595 --> 17:43.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT.

17:43.262 --> 17:46.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT AS BILL SAID, ALSO, THEY DID

17:46.232 --> 17:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAKE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

17:47.566 --> 17:49.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGES SOCIALLY SO THERE WERE A

17:49.035 --> 17:51.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF TRUE BELIEVERS THERE FOR

17:51.237 --> 17:51.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LONG TIME.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WILL TELL YOU THE LAST TIME I

17:53.105 --> 17:54.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS THERE, WHICH WAS THE LAST

17:54.373 --> 17:56.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME THEY LET ME IN, WHICH WAS

17:56.242 --> 17:57.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MID-90s, THERE WAS AN

17:57.243 --> 17:58.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN

17:58.945 --> 18:00.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELIEVERS IN THE REVOLUTION WHO

18:00.246 --> 18:01.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINALLY SAID, "ENOUGH WAS

18:01.781 --> 18:02.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENOUGH."

18:02.448 --> 18:04.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD I HAVE PREDICTED 20 YEARS

18:04.050 --> 18:05.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HENCE THAT THEY WOULD STILL BE

18:05.318 --> 18:05.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN POWER?

18:05.985 --> 18:07.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS PRETTY SURPRISING.

18:07.453 --> 18:08.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: BILL, WHAT

18:08.688 --> 18:09.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THAT.

18:09.488 --> 18:10.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT DO WE KNOW WHAT THE CUBAN

18:10.890 --> 18:11.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE THINK RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE

1960s AND EVEN IN THE 70s,

18:20.099 --> 18:21.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ENTHUSIASM FOR THE REVOLUTION

18:22.368 --> 18:23.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ISLAND BY OUTSIDERS, THAT

18:33.379 --> 18:34.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERATION IS STILL SUPPORTIVE.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE YOUNGER GENERATION IS

18:36.682 --> 18:37.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BADLY DISAFFECTED.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO GREW UP IN

18:39.118 --> 18:40.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SPECIAL PERIOD WHEN THE

18:40.286 --> 18:41.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMY WAS A DISASTER.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FOR THEM, THE REVOLUTION

18:43.622 --> 18:44.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEANS PRIVATION.

18:44.423 --> 18:45.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND A LOT OF THEM DON'T SEE A

18:45.791 --> 18:47.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES IN

18:47.159 --> 18:48.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

KNOW, IT'S REMARKABLE TO ME,

18:51.664 --> 18:53.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WAS A MAN WHO WAS THE

18:53.799 --> 18:56.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONGEST IN POWER OF ANY 20th

18:56.335 --> 18:57.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

REPRESSION CAN DO FOR YOU.

19:02.241 --> 19:03.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: AND I THINK MY

19:03.109 --> 19:04.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION TO YOU IS THEN, WHAT DO

19:04.643 --> 19:06.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU THINK HIS LEGACY MAY BE NOW,

19:06.579 --> 19:08.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEYOND HIS ABILITY TO STAY IN

19:08.147 --> 19:08.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POWER?

19:08.814 --> 19:11.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SAID IN APRIL IN HIS FAREWELL

19:11.617 --> 19:13.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADDRESS THAT, "CUBAN COMMUNISM'S

19:13.986 --> 19:15.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGACY WILL LIVE ON."

19:15.254 --> 19:16.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, AND IS

19:16.856 --> 19:17.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE SUCH A THING?

19:17.523 --> 19:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THAT'S SORT OF

19:19.358 --> 19:20.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DELUSIONAL.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVENTUALLY, IT WILL UNRAVEL.

19:21.527 --> 19:23.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, IN THE WORLD OF THE

19:23.162 --> 19:24.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERNET, EVEN BEING AN ISLAND,

19:24.163 --> 19:25.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CANNOT BE THAT SEPARATED.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AS BILL SAID, THIS

19:27.633 --> 19:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERATION, THEY WANT OUT.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WANT IT TO BE OVER WITH.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DON'T WANT THAT LEVEL OF

19:31.203 --> 19:31.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRIVATION.

19:31.871 --> 19:32.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO

19:32.838 --> 19:34.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE CUT OFF FROM THE REST OF THE

19:34.240 --> 19:35.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORLD THERE.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, THERE WERE CHANGES

19:37.410 --> 19:39.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT TOOK PLACE-- EDUCATIONAL

19:39.078 --> 19:39.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGES, HEALTH CARE CHANGES--

19:39.945 --> 19:42.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, IT'S A DIFFERENT

19:42.048 --> 19:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY, CERTAINLY, THAN IT WAS

19:43.783 --> 19:44.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDER BATISTA.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE JOKE WENT ON FOR TOO

19:45.751 --> 19:46.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FOREVER?

19:48.254 --> 19:49.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT.

YOU, BILL, IS NOW HOW DO YOU

19:51.991 --> 19:53.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THIS WILL CHANGE THINGS?

19:53.692 --> 19:55.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES THE DEATH OF FIDEL CASTRO

CUBA?

19:57.763 --> 20:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, FIDEL CASTRO WAS SUCH A

20:00.466 --> 20:02.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYMBOL, I THINK HIS PASSING

20:02.435 --> 20:04.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL, ON THE U.S.-CUBA RELATIONS

20:04.437 --> 20:05.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIDE, TAKE SOME OF THE HEAT OUT

20:05.571 --> 20:08.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE ANIMOSITY, PARTICULARLY

AMONG SOME OF THE HARD LINERS IN

MIAMI FOR WHOM FIDEL PERSONALLY

20:12.011 --> 20:13.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS JUST AN OBJECT OF ABJECT

20:13.913 --> 20:14.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HATRED.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE ISLAND ITSELF, I THINK

20:16.182 --> 20:18.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS ENDURING LEGACY IS THAT HE

20:18.284 --> 20:19.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE CUBA A FULLY INDEPENDENT

20:19.852 --> 20:21.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
