WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:09.977
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff. Gwen Ifill is on
assignment.

00:09.977 --> 00:15.449
On the "NewsHour" tonight: A
historic flood leaves much of
South Carolina underwater.

00:15.449 --> 00:21.755
Then, this Politics Monday,
Hillary Clinton weighs in to the
debate over gun control,

00:21.755 --> 00:26.526
and, in Congress, a fight over
who will be the next speaker of
the House.

00:26.526 --> 00:32.332
Plus, an investigation into the
nation's silent mass disaster,
when people go missing and

00:32.332 --> 00:35.269
their families are
left in the dark.

00:35.269 --> 00:40.374
ALICE ALMENDAREZ, Daughter: You
can't celebrate a holiday when
there's somebody missing from

00:40.374 --> 00:44.845
the room. I actually was
supposed to get married an, I
didn't get married, because I
couldn't

00:44.845 --> 00:46.613
get married without my dad.

00:46.613 --> 00:49.549
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:49.549 --> 00:55.355
(BREAK)

00:55.355 --> 01:08.702
JUDY WOODRUFF: South Carolina
lay stricken today, with cities,
towns and roads inundated

01:08.702 --> 01:14.942
by the worst flooding on record.
Days of nonstop rain have killed
nine people, driven hundreds

01:14.942 --> 01:20.013
into shelters, and left
thousands more without power or
drinkable water.

01:20.013 --> 01:24.351
Some of the worst was in the
state's capital, as William
Brangham reports.

01:24.351 --> 01:30.324
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Parts of
Columbia, South Carolina, were
simply swallowed up today by

01:30.324 --> 01:34.928
the rising waters. It was
chest-high and higher in some
parts of the city. And, even as
the

01:34.928 --> 01:38.098
rain began finally tapering
off, there were new warnings.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.634
GOV. NIKKI HALEY (R), South
Carolina: This is not over. Just
because the rain stops doesn't

01:40.634 --> 01:43.503
mean that we are
out of the woods.

01:43.503 --> 01:45.906
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In a briefing
today, Governor Nikki Haley
appealed to people not to take

01:45.906 --> 01:47.674
chances.

01:47.674 --> 01:51.845
GOV. NIKKI HALEY: I do want to
see that -- say that we have had
word that there are people

01:51.845 --> 01:55.315
who are taking their boats to
the Lake Murray Dam to take
pictures of all the water that

01:55.315 --> 02:00.387
we're trying to release. That is
extremely dangerous and this is
-- I can't stress enough

02:00.387 --> 02:04.191
that this is not a fun event.

02:04.191 --> 02:07.961
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All that water
is the result of a slow-moving
storm system that lingered

02:07.961 --> 02:14.234
over the Southeast and sucked in
moisture from Hurricane Joaquin
spinning out in the

02:14.234 --> 02:19.473
Atlantic. On Sunday alone, more
than 16 inches of rain fell on
the Gills Creek area near

02:19.473 --> 02:22.709
Columbia. That's one of the
largest totals on one day
anywhere in the United States in

02:22.709 --> 02:26.380
15 years.

02:26.380 --> 02:34.121
Hundreds of people also had to
be rescued around Columbia. This
video captured one dramatic

02:34.121 --> 02:38.525
moment, as a Coast Guard team
aboard a helicopter pulled a
mother and her small child to
safety.

02:38.525 --> 02:45.298
The flooding also shut down some
550 roads and bridges across the
state and 75 miles

02:45.298 --> 02:49.369
of Interstate 95, and officials
warned it could take weeks to
reopen everything.

02:49.369 --> 02:51.772
State Adjutant General
Bob Livingston Jr.:

02:51.772 --> 02:54.307
MAJ. GEN. BOB LIVINGSTON JR.,
South Carolina Adjutant General:
The roads are still unsafe.

02:54.307 --> 02:59.980
A lot of them have been
undermined by the flooding. And
so the road may look perfect

02:59.980 --> 03:05.519
on top, but if you drive across
it, it could collapse. We have
had that happen to our rescue

03:05.519 --> 03:09.489
crews. And we're having to do
engineering evaluations on
those, so, again, don't get

03:09.489 --> 03:12.392
out unless you have to.

03:12.392 --> 03:16.563
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Elsewhere,
cemeteries, like this one in
Springfield, were so saturated

03:16.563 --> 03:20.934
that coffins were coming out of
the ground. And on the coast,
Charleston reported its

03:20.934 --> 03:26.006
worst flooding since Hurricane
Hugo roared through back in
1989.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.775
Not far away, in Summerville,
drone footage showed entire
neighborhoods submerged around

03:28.775 --> 03:31.678
Cane Bay.

03:31.678 --> 03:34.281
Governor Haley warned recovery
will be slow, as the surging
waters continue following their

03:34.281 --> 03:36.716
paths to the ocean.

03:36.716 --> 03:40.353
GOV. NIKKI HALEY: This is going
to be a process. It is going to
be one where we have to
prioritize

03:40.353 --> 03:43.957
and we have to stay on it. It's
going to be one where we're
going to be OK, but we are

03:43.957 --> 03:46.693
really going to have to
take it one step at a time.

03:46.693 --> 03:49.863
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Meanwhile,
Columbia and two of its
surrounding counties are under

03:49.863 --> 03:54.301
a nighttime curfew, and some
375,000 people have been warned
to boil their tapwater to

03:54.301 --> 03:56.036
make it drinkable.

03:56.036 --> 03:59.439
I'm William Brangham for
the "PBS NewsHour."

03:59.439 --> 04:03.543
JUDY WOODRUFF: As the storm
slowly moved on today, more rain
fell in the low-lying
northeastern

04:03.543 --> 04:06.646
part of the state.

04:06.646 --> 04:11.751
In the day's other news, a cargo
ship that was caught in the path
of Hurricane Joaquin

04:11.751 --> 04:17.224
has sunk with 33 people on
board. The Coast Guard said
today it's found a body and
debris

04:17.224 --> 04:21.895
near the Bahamas, where the
El Faro was last heard from.

04:21.895 --> 04:25.365
A Coast Guard officer leading
the search from Jacksonville,
Florida, said the chances that

04:25.365 --> 04:28.301
anyone survived are slim.

04:28.301 --> 04:32.439
CAPT. MARK FEDOR, U.S. Coast
Guard: If the vessel did sink on
Thursday and that crew

04:32.439 --> 04:37.911
was able to abandon ship, they
would have been abandoning ship
into a Category 4 hurricane.

04:37.911 --> 04:44.684
So, you are talking up to
140-mile-an-hour winds, seas
upwards of 50 feet, visibility

04:44.684 --> 04:50.590
basically at zero. Those are
challenging conditions to
survive in.

04:50.590 --> 04:54.861
JUDY WOODRUFF: The ship's owner
says the vessel's captain had
planned to sail out of harm's

04:54.861 --> 04:59.566
way, but the main
engines failed.

04:59.566 --> 05:03.937
Tensions over the Russian air
campaign in Syria escalated
today after a Russian fighter

05:03.937 --> 05:10.210
jet crossed into Turkey over the
weekend. Moscow said it was an
unintentional violation,

05:10.210 --> 05:16.616
as its planes targeted the
Islamic State, or ISIL, but NATO
member Turkey protested.

05:16.616 --> 05:19.986
In Brussels, the head of NATO
met with Turkey's foreign
minister and called the
violation

05:19.986 --> 05:21.888
unacceptable.

05:21.888 --> 05:26.226
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO
Secretary-General: I call on
Russia to fully respect NATO
airspace,

05:26.226 --> 05:31.798
and to avoid escalating tensions
with the alliance. I urge Russia
to take the necessary

05:31.798 --> 05:36.002
steps to align its efforts with
those of the international
community in the fight against

05:36.002 --> 05:37.771
ISIL.

05:37.771 --> 05:43.109
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. and NATO
have charged the Russian
airstrikes are also targeting

05:43.109 --> 05:48.348
the Western-backed rebels in
Syria. Meanwhile, The New York
Times reports that the U.S. will

05:48.348 --> 05:52.852
back a major offensive by rebel
factions and Kurdish fighters
against ISIL fighters in

05:52.852 --> 05:55.388
Northeast Syria.

05:55.388 --> 06:01.728
In Iraq, at least 56 people were
killed today in a string of car
bombings that bore the

06:01.728 --> 06:07.634
Islamic State hallmark. The
worst attack hit in a Shiite
town in Eastern Iraq, followed

06:07.634 --> 06:12.405
by a blast in Baghdad and
another outside Basra in the
south. The Sunni militants of

06:12.405 --> 06:17.611
ISIL have frequently targeted
Shiites across Iraq.

06:17.611 --> 06:21.948
Elsewhere in the Middle East,
street clashes flared in the
West Bank, and Israeli troops

06:21.948 --> 06:28.488
shot and killed two Palestinian
teens. It was the latest in a
growing series of violent

06:28.488 --> 06:34.628
incidents. In Bethlehem,
Palestinians threw rocks and
firebombs near Rachel's Tomb,
where

06:34.628 --> 06:38.999
Israel's separation barrier juts
into the city. The Israeli army
said soldiers initially

06:38.999 --> 06:44.738
used tear gas, and then
switched to live rounds.

06:44.738 --> 06:50.210
Three scientists will share this
year's Nobel Prize for Medicine
for critical advances against

06:50.210 --> 06:57.717
parasitic diseases. Irish-born
William Campbell and Japan's
Satoshi Omura share half the
prize

06:57.717 --> 07:04.124
for discovering a drug to treat
river blindness and
elephantiasis. And Tu Youyou of
China

07:04.124 --> 07:09.863
was honored for developing a
powerful anti-malaria drug from
traditional herbal medicine.

07:09.863 --> 07:13.199
Colleagues praised her
steadfast approach.

07:13.199 --> 07:19.439
MAN (through translator): Over
200 prescriptions and dozens of
kinds of traditional Chinese

07:19.439 --> 07:23.743
medicine were used. Her research
started based on this. Then it
took a long time and many

07:23.743 --> 07:28.148
repeated failures. Her team
finally succeeded after trying
around 300 times.

07:28.148 --> 07:33.219
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tu is China's
first Nobel laureate in
medicine.

07:33.219 --> 07:38.091
There's word that German
officials have almost doubled
the number of asylum seekers
they're

07:38.091 --> 07:43.697
expecting this year to 1.5
million. The Bild newspaper
reports the number comes from an

07:43.697 --> 08:01.281
internal government forecast.
The earlier estimate was
800,000.

08:01.281 --> 08:22.469
w and the Gulf states lead to
real relief for people and the
citizens and the businesses

08:22.469 --> 08:23.370
of the Gulf. (ph)

08:23.370 --> 08:24.804
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S.
Attorney General: (ph)

08:24.804 --> 08:29.809
JUDY WOODRUFF: The spill stained
more than 1,300 miles of
coastline and was the largest

08:29.809 --> 08:34.748
environmental disaster in U.S.
history. The settlement includes
Alabama, Florida, Louisiana,

08:34.748 --> 08:37.951
Mississippi and Texas.

08:37.951 --> 08:44.791
The U.S. Homeland Security
Department is reopening a probe
into Secret Service efforts to
discredit

08:44.791 --> 08:50.163
Congressman Jason Chaffetz. It
happened in March, as the Utah
Republican was investigating

08:50.163 --> 08:58.271
agency misconduct. Dozens of
agents looked at his failed 2003
job application, and someone

08:58.271 --> 09:02.542
leaked details. The renewed
investigation comes after the
Secret Service director changed

09:02.542 --> 09:06.746
his version of the incident.

09:06.746 --> 09:12.252
And Wall Street had a bullish
Monday on hopes that the Federal
Reserve will delay raising

09:12.252 --> 09:16.856
interest rates. The Dow Jones
industrial average gained more
than 300 points to close near

09:16.856 --> 09:23.763
16780. The Nasdaq rose 73
points. And the S&P 500 added
35.

09:23.763 --> 09:29.502
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a major trade deal is reached
with Asia; fallout from the

09:29.502 --> 09:34.574
airstrike in Afghanistan that
hit a hospital; an investigation
into the nation's silent

09:34.574 --> 09:53.760
mass disaster, when people
go missing, and much more.

09:53.760 --> 09:58.598
After nearly a decade of
negotiations and five nights of
round-the-clock talks this

09:58.598 --> 10:04.103
past week, the U.S. and 11 other
Pacific Rim nations announced
the largest trade deal in

10:04.103 --> 10:08.107
a generation today.
The stakes are big.

10:08.107 --> 10:14.581
Together, the countries shown
here, and which include Japan,
Canada, Mexico, Australia,

10:14.581 --> 10:21.588
and Vietnam, make up more than
35 percent of world trade,
totaling some $28 trillion.

10:21.588 --> 10:27.060
But there's substantial
opposition to the accord, called
the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

10:27.060 --> 10:31.297
Jeffrey Brown looks at the deal,
at the compromises and at the
road ahead.

10:31.297 --> 10:34.567
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a
wide-ranging accord that seeks
to lower trade barriers and
expand

10:34.567 --> 10:37.604
agricultural markets.

10:37.604 --> 10:42.408
Among other things, it sets new
rules for labor and
environmental standards, reduces

10:42.408 --> 10:47.647
and phases out thousands of
tariffs on American producers,
provides between five and eight

10:47.647 --> 10:52.752
years of intellectual property
rights for biologic drugs made
here, and makes it easier

10:52.752 --> 10:57.857
for the U.S. to sell dairy
products in countries like
Canada and Japan.

10:57.857 --> 11:03.329
But many provisions are the
subject of deep skepticism and
outright opposition from voices

11:03.329 --> 11:06.533
across the spectrum. And getting
it approved by Congress during
an election year is no

11:06.533 --> 11:09.235
small matter.

11:09.235 --> 11:12.539
Greg Ip is chief economics
commentator for The Wall Street
Journal and the author of

11:12.539 --> 11:15.308
the forthcoming book
"Foolproof," and joins us now.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.209
Welcome back, Greg.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.478
GREG IP, The Wall Street
Journal: Thanks, Jeff.

11:18.478 --> 11:23.550
JEFFREY BROWN: First, an
overview, huge dollar amounts,
right, wide range of areas
covered,

11:23.550 --> 11:26.719
and enormous economic
stakes. It's a big deal.

11:26.719 --> 11:29.889
GREG IP: It's a very big deal.
It's the biggest trade deal that
has been negotiated since

11:29.889 --> 11:34.227
the Uruguay agreement of the
World Trade organization, which
was some 20 years ago.

11:34.227 --> 11:37.363
It's also the first trade
agreement to be negotiated by
the United States under the

11:37.363 --> 11:43.102
Obama presidency. The scope is
very large, roughly 40 percent
of world GDP. It covers

11:43.102 --> 11:46.673
areas that have heretofore not
been covered in agreements of
this size, like services,

11:46.673 --> 11:49.409
like intellectual property.

11:49.409 --> 11:53.580
It's important in geostrategic
terms because it's as important
for the countries that are

11:53.580 --> 11:56.249
in it as the countries that are
not, more importantly China.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.918
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, we
will get to that afterwards.

11:58.918 --> 12:04.023
But in strictly economic terms
first, the Obama administration
and supporters point

12:04.023 --> 12:07.393
to what they see as benefits.
Give us a couple of examples
that they're pointing to that's

12:07.393 --> 12:09.162
in this deal.

12:09.162 --> 12:13.266
GREG IP: Well, there are
specific areas where the United
States is very competitive that

12:13.266 --> 12:15.468
it has had trouble getting to
other countries' markets,
agriculture, for example.

12:15.468 --> 12:21.040
Under the agreement, countries
like Japan and Canada, which
have highly protected dairy

12:21.040 --> 12:25.111
sectors, will have to open up
more to the United States. Then
there are newer industries

12:25.111 --> 12:29.949
where the U.S. is very advanced
like drugs, intellectual
property, high-end services like

12:29.949 --> 12:34.187
accounting and engineering. When
those services are exported to
other countries, signatories

12:34.187 --> 12:38.558
to this agreement can no longer
discriminate against American
companies.

12:38.558 --> 12:41.127
And there will be mechanisms
that American companies that
feel they have been
discriminated

12:41.127 --> 12:44.897
against can challenge countries
in their own courts.

12:44.897 --> 12:48.534
JEFFREY BROWN: You mentioned
intellectual property. That's an
important one and often

12:48.534 --> 12:51.971
has not been part of trade
agreements and was very
difficult to negotiate.

12:51.971 --> 12:54.240
GREG IP: Absolutely.

12:54.240 --> 12:58.011
Well, for example, the United
States has a lot of
research-intensive
pharmaceutical companies.

12:58.011 --> 13:03.549
And it was important to them
that the most advanced drugs
that are called biologics have

13:03.549 --> 13:06.452
12-year patent protection in
other countries, like they do
here.

13:06.452 --> 13:10.723
Now, they didn't get that. They
had a compromise. They will get
like five to eight years of

13:10.723 --> 13:13.960
protection. That's great for the
American pharmaceutical
companies, but perhaps not

13:13.960 --> 13:16.229
so much for some of the
buyers of those drugs.

13:16.229 --> 13:19.899
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, as we have
said, a lot of opposition has
been throughout and will

13:19.899 --> 13:25.605
continue. Point to some of the
particular areas where the
opposition is.

13:25.605 --> 13:30.309
GREG IP: Well, one is the
pharmaceutical biologic
agreement, because people who
worry about

13:30.309 --> 13:35.081
the access by poorer countries
to the most advanced drugs are
afraid that they will be

13:35.081 --> 13:39.452
forced to pay extremely high
prices, because they can no
longer purchase generics on
account

13:39.452 --> 13:43.990
of the longer patent
protection this law provides.

13:43.990 --> 13:49.395
Auto companies may not be happy
that Japan will have more access
to the U.S. automobile

13:49.395 --> 13:53.933
market at a time when American
companies have always struggled
to penetrate the Japanese

13:53.933 --> 13:57.070
market. And at a much larger
level, the criticism of people
like Bernie Sanders,

13:57.070 --> 14:02.442
who is running for president, is
that free trade agreements
always seem to benefit companies

14:02.442 --> 14:06.512
and rich and wealthy people more
than it does the average working
person.

14:06.512 --> 14:10.149
JEFFREY BROWN: Traditional
group, labor -- labor will be --
has already said they're against

14:10.149 --> 14:12.452
many of the parts of this.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.655
GREG IP: That's correct. That's
probably where you're going to
hear the stiffest criticisms.

14:15.655 --> 14:19.292
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, go
back to the geopolitics now,
right, OK, because a lot of this
is in

14:19.292 --> 14:22.195
the context of China, rising
China. Right? China is not part
of this deal.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.464
GREG IP: Correct.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.600
And China couldn't really be
part of this deal because many
of the things the United

14:27.600 --> 14:32.505
States wanted -- for example,
governments may not allow
government-owned companies to

14:32.505 --> 14:35.775
have special privileges -- is
simply not compatible with the
way the Chinese economy is
today,

14:35.775 --> 14:39.912
which remains dominated by
state-owned enterprises.

14:39.912 --> 14:44.050
And so the United States was
adamant that we create a
framework that favors its more

14:44.050 --> 14:48.387
liberal vision of trade. China
is welcome to join, but it is
going to be a while before

14:48.387 --> 14:53.292
China is politically and
economically ready to do that.
And this in the meantime is a

14:53.292 --> 14:56.963
sign of U.S. leadership, at a
time when there's a lot of
uneasiness about the fact that
China's

14:56.963 --> 15:00.600
economy is growing so much and
that it has managed to persuade
other countries to sign

15:00.600 --> 15:01.501
up for its vision of
multilateralism, like the Asian
infrastructure...

15:01.501 --> 15:03.069
(CROSSTALK)

15:03.069 --> 15:06.806
JEFFREY BROWN: It's interesting.
They're not there, but of course
they're very much there.

15:06.806 --> 15:09.876
So, this is seen as, as you say,
MDNM an act of leadership, but
also perhaps a model

15:09.876 --> 15:11.778
for future -- some kind of deal?

15:11.778 --> 15:14.413
GREG IP: Possibly.

15:14.413 --> 15:18.684
But I think, at the same time,
is that one of the big selling
points you will hear from

15:18.684 --> 15:23.022
Barack Obama is that
irrespective of what you think
of the economic pluses and
minuses

15:23.022 --> 15:28.161
of the deal, China is out there
and there is a contest in some
sense between the United

15:28.161 --> 15:30.897
States and China for
economic leadership.

15:30.897 --> 15:33.766
And if the United States doesn't
step forward to write the rules,
China will, and those

15:33.766 --> 15:36.435
rules will not be as friendly
to Americans as U.S. rules.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.438
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, now,
just in our last minute, you
mentioned Bernie Sanders

15:39.438 --> 15:43.242
and you could go through the
list of politicians, right,
because it's a campaign year.

15:43.242 --> 15:48.080
This is going to spin out over
the next couple of months, play
out inevitably in the political

15:48.080 --> 15:50.650
-- in the presidential campaign.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.619
GREG IP: Well, first, we have to
get the text of the agreement.
That will be at least another

15:53.619 --> 15:58.124
month, and then Congress will
probably be asked to vote on it
some time early next year.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.727
They have already voted for
something called trade promotion
authority, which basically

16:01.727 --> 16:07.133
means we will vote yea or nay on
this agreement, but we cannot
amend it. And that vote passed

16:07.133 --> 16:10.203
very, very narrowly. And most
Democrats voted against it. You
shouldn't take for granted

16:10.203 --> 16:12.605
that this will pass.

16:12.605 --> 16:17.143
That said, Republicans, who now
control both houses of Congress,
by and large support free

16:17.143 --> 16:20.580
trade, and so I think they have
a lot to lose by not letting the
president on this one matter

16:20.580 --> 16:22.048
get what he wants.

16:22.048 --> 16:27.954
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Greg Ip, thank you so much.

16:27.954 --> 16:34.861
GREG IP: Thank you, Jeff.

16:34.861 --> 16:42.068
JUDY WOODRUFF: The fallout over
a U.S. airstrike on a medical
facility in Afghanistan
continued

16:42.068 --> 16:46.272
today. The incident, which is
being called a war crime by
Doctors Without Borders, took

16:46.272 --> 16:49.342
center stage at the
Pentagon this morning.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.945
GEN. JOHN CAMPBELL, U.S. Army:
If errors were committed, we
will acknowledge them. We will

16:52.945 --> 16:56.249
hold those responsible
accountable, and we will take
steps to ensure mistakes are not

16:56.249 --> 16:58.184
repeated.

16:58.184 --> 17:04.523
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was General
John Campbell, U.S. commander of
coalition forces in Afghanistan,

17:04.523 --> 17:11.631
pledging the facts will come out
about Friday's deadly attack.
The airstrike killed 22 people

17:11.631 --> 17:16.235
at a Doctors Without Borders
hospital in Kunduz, amid heavy
fighting between the Taliban and

17:16.235 --> 17:21.574
Afghan forces.

17:21.574 --> 17:27.313
Some Afghan officials say
Taliban fighters were firing
from inside the hospital, a
charge

17:27.313 --> 17:33.653
that Doctors Without Borders
denies. Initially, the Pentagon
said U.S. troops called in the

17:33.653 --> 17:37.056
airstrikes, but Campbell
changed that account today.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.726
GEN. JOHN CAMPBELL: We have now
learned that on October 3,
Afghan forces advised that they

17:40.726 --> 17:46.465
were taking fire from enemy
positions and asked for air
support from U.S. forces. An

17:46.465 --> 17:48.267
airstrike was then called to
eliminate the Taliban threat,
and several civilians were

17:48.267 --> 17:50.937
accidentally struck.

17:50.937 --> 17:55.741
JUDY WOODRUFF: The general
repeatedly declined to answer
questions about exactly who
authorized

17:55.741 --> 17:57.076
the bombardment.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.645
GEN. JOHN CAMPBELL: That will
come out in the investigation.

17:59.645 --> 18:02.949
I don't want to go into those
great details yet until we get
the investigation, and I

18:02.949 --> 18:07.586
don't want to cover the rules of
engagement in this format at
this point in time.

18:07.586 --> 18:12.558
JUDY WOODRUFF: Campbell also
didn't say if the hospital was
hit by mistake, or if U.S.

18:12.558 --> 18:18.464
air crews verified the
target before firing.

18:18.464 --> 18:24.136
Doctors Without Borders has said
it provided GPS coordinates of
the site to coalition forces

18:24.136 --> 18:29.809
and notified them during the
airstrikes, but to little avail.

18:29.809 --> 18:34.580
Today, the group's general
director, Christopher Stokes,
rejected the latest U.S. version
of

18:34.580 --> 18:36.449
events.

18:36.449 --> 18:41.620
In a statement, he said -- quote
-- "Their description of the
attack keeps changing,

18:41.620 --> 18:47.259
from collateral damage to a
tragic incident to now
attempting to pass
responsibility to

18:47.259 --> 18:51.864
the Afghanistan government. The
need for a full, transparent,
independent investigation

18:51.864 --> 18:55.534
is ever more critical."

18:55.534 --> 19:01.807
As to that, General Campbell
said today the U.S. military,
NATO and Afghanistan are already

19:01.807 --> 19:03.409
investigating.

19:03.409 --> 19:05.644
GEN. JOHN CAMPBELL: If there's
other investigations out there
that need to go on, we will make

19:05.644 --> 19:09.248
sure we coordinate those as
well, but I won't go into those
details here.

19:09.248 --> 19:15.788
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in Kunduz,
fighting continues on the city
outskirts, with Afghan security

19:15.788 --> 19:21.861
forces trying to drive out any
remaining Taliban. And senior
White House officials tell The

19:21.861 --> 19:28.734
Washington Post that President
Obama is now considering keeping
5,000 troops in Afghanistan

19:28.734 --> 19:36.575
beyond 2016, which had been
the deadline for withdrawal.

19:36.575 --> 19:47.820
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

19:47.820 --> 19:52.625
Coming up on the "NewsHour": an
investigation into what happens
when someone goes missing

19:52.625 --> 19:59.565
in the U.S.; and a look ahead to
this year's docket on the
Supreme Court.

19:59.565 --> 20:03.769
But first, Gwen gets the latest
on the race for the White House.
She recorded this conversation

20:03.769 --> 20:07.173
earlier today before
leaving on assignment.

20:07.173 --> 20:13.145
GWEN IFILL: From gun control, to
the e-mail dispute that won't go
away, to a fresh leadership

20:13.145 --> 20:18.217
fight on Capitol Hill,
congressional politics and
presidential politics overlap
this week.

20:18.217 --> 20:22.822
So, we turn to Amy Walter of The
Cook Political Report and Tamara
Keith of NPR reporting tonight

20:22.822 --> 20:27.593
from New Hampshire for our
weekly Monday night look at
what's happening behind the
scenes.

20:27.593 --> 20:32.198
Hillary Clinton today got on the
gun control bandwagon very
forcefully with her own plan.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.934
We want to hear a little
about what she had to say.

20:34.934 --> 20:38.404
And, Tamara, you were in the
room. I want to hear how it went
over.

20:38.404 --> 20:43.309
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: We need
to go back and, with all of our
hearts,

20:43.309 --> 20:49.014
working not just in Washington,
but from the grassroots up,
demand that we have universal

20:49.014 --> 20:56.522
background checks. Forty percent
of guns are sold gun shows,
online sales. We need to close

20:56.522 --> 20:59.391
that loophole, so that when we
have a universal background
check...

20:59.391 --> 21:01.727
(APPLAUSE)

21:01.727 --> 21:08.968
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: ... it
will cover everybody. We have
got to keep guns out of

21:08.968 --> 21:13.305
the hands of people who
shouldn't have them, domestic
abusers, people with serious
mental

21:13.305 --> 21:15.441
health problems.

21:15.441 --> 21:20.513
GWEN IFILL: Now, of course, this
is a result to what happened in
Oregon last week, the

21:20.513 --> 21:24.016
mass shooting at a community
college, and the president's
very strong words about gun

21:24.016 --> 21:26.719
control and about how we had to
do more than just talk about it.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.821
Tamara, is that what
she was doing as well?

21:28.821 --> 21:31.757
TAMARA KEITH, National
Public Radio: Yes.

21:31.757 --> 21:36.295
And Hillary Clinton has actually
spoken about gun control pretty
forcefully in the last

21:36.295 --> 21:41.700
few months following other mass
shootings, but this time she has
put out a plan, she

21:41.700 --> 21:47.273
has several bullet points that
she's calling for, different
items that she wants.

21:47.273 --> 21:51.510
In the room, this was very
different from many other
Clinton town halls that I have

21:51.510 --> 21:57.850
been to. It was more emotional.
The crowd was almost more into
it, you could say, than

21:57.850 --> 22:02.154
many of her other town halls,
many standing ovations, people
really enthusiastic about

22:02.154 --> 22:05.257
what she's saying and
what she's proposing.

22:05.257 --> 22:10.095
In particular, there was one
moment where Hillary Clinton, as
she was finishing her

22:10.095 --> 22:16.135
remarks, asked a mother to come
up on stage. This is a Sandy
Hook mom whose son, her
6-year-old

22:16.135 --> 22:19.638
son was killed in the
shooting at Sandy Hook.

22:19.638 --> 22:25.578
And as Hillary Clinton talked
about that mom's experience,
Hillary Clinton's voice choked

22:25.578 --> 22:30.716
up a little bit, and it was a
very emotional moment in the
room.

22:30.716 --> 22:34.453
GWEN IFILL: It's interesting,
because, as you know, Amy, we
have had this conversation

22:34.453 --> 22:39.091
many times, and, in fact, the
last time the president came
out, he was accused of sounding

22:39.091 --> 22:42.561
as if he had just given up on
being able to do anything. And
we heard some of that from

22:42.561 --> 22:46.465
Jeb Bush as well. Is there
anything different in this gun
control argument this time?

22:46.465 --> 22:49.602
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: I don't think very much
has changed at all.

22:49.602 --> 22:54.106
And, in fact, I think this has
become something that we see the
two parties just going back

22:54.106 --> 22:59.845
into their predictable lanes,
Democrats talking about more gun
control, Republicans talking

22:59.845 --> 23:03.549
about how they have to defend
the rights of gun owners. And
this is coming at a time,

23:03.549 --> 23:08.554
also, of a very competitive
primary fight very specifically
on the Republican, but on

23:08.554 --> 23:14.193
the Democratic side as well,
where both sides trying to speak
to their base.

23:14.193 --> 23:19.531
The Democratic base, this is an
issue that's very important to
them, the idea of gun control.

23:19.531 --> 23:23.035
On the Republican side, they are
more concerned with gun rights.
And so you're seeing both

23:23.035 --> 23:25.738
camps just lining up
pretty predictably.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.940
GWEN IFILL: OK. Let's
try something unusual.

23:27.940 --> 23:33.345
You are in New England tonight,
Tamara, where Bernie Sanders had
a big rally in Boston this

23:33.345 --> 23:38.584
weekend. He got 20,000 people
there, yet he doesn't come down
on the same side of the

23:38.584 --> 23:43.756
argument as Hillary Clinton does
on guns. Does that hurt him at
all with his base?

23:43.756 --> 23:47.259
TAMARA KEITH: This is
a fascinating thing.

23:47.259 --> 23:53.432
Bernie Sanders is to the left of
the Democratic field on
absolutely everything, except
for

23:53.432 --> 23:58.070
guns. And when it comes to guns,
he's more moderate. In the '90s,
he voted against the

23:58.070 --> 24:05.110
Brady Bill. In 2005, he voted
for a bill that became law that
shields gun manufacturers

24:05.110 --> 24:07.846
from lawsuits.

24:07.846 --> 24:12.751
Hillary Clinton is trying to
make a big issue out of this.
One of her proposals is to
repeal

24:12.751 --> 24:17.723
that law that Bernie Sanders
voted for and she voted against.
I think that Clinton and

24:17.723 --> 24:23.062
her supporters see this as an
opportunity, and also Martin
O'Malley, the Maryland governor,

24:23.062 --> 24:29.902
sees it, too, to show
differences and, for once, show
that Bernie Sanders is not the

24:29.902 --> 24:33.739
purest candidate on the
left on at least one topic.

24:33.739 --> 24:37.042
AMY WALTER: Yes, and it also
speaks to the demographics of
the issue of guns.

24:37.042 --> 24:41.246
If you look -- and this is
Gallup who did this study. You
look at the kinds of people

24:41.246 --> 24:46.719
who own guns in this country,
they're overwhelmingly white,
many of them are Southern,
they're

24:46.719 --> 24:50.389
male. People who do not own guns
or the lowest rate of gun
ownership, minorities and single

24:50.389 --> 24:52.091
women.

24:52.091 --> 24:58.530
If you want to understand the
politics of the gun debate, who
speaks to overwhelmingly

24:58.530 --> 25:03.702
white Southerners? Republicans.
And for Bernie Sanders, he lives
in an overwhelmingly white

25:03.702 --> 25:07.840
state, older state of Vermont.
This is an issue that plays very
differently in Vermont

25:07.840 --> 25:10.042
than it does in Brooklyn.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.978
GWEN IFILL: Which we can expect
Hillary Clinton to try to
exploit.

25:12.978 --> 25:16.014
But let's talk about something
else she has -- not choosing to
exploit. As we know, she's

25:16.014 --> 25:20.052
been struggling with this e-mail
controversy for some time. And,
somehow, Republicans are

25:20.052 --> 25:22.287
helping her.

25:22.287 --> 25:26.125
Kevin McCarthy, who is in line
to be the speaker of the House,
gave an interview on FOX in

25:26.125 --> 25:30.195
which he said this: "Everybody
thought Hillary Clinton was
unbeatable, right? But we put

25:30.195 --> 25:35.667
together a Benghazi special
committee, a select committee.
What are her numbers today? Her

25:35.667 --> 25:39.371
numbers are dropping. Why?
Because she is untrustable. But
no one would any of that

25:39.371 --> 25:41.940
had that happened."

25:41.940 --> 25:46.311
Well, today, in New Hampshire,
Hillary Clinton pushed back and
said, ah, the horror of this,

25:46.311 --> 25:48.814
it's pure politics and it
proves the point I was making.

25:48.814 --> 25:51.350
So, this was kind of an
opportunity for her today, Tam.

25:51.350 --> 25:54.420
TAMARA KEITH: Absolutely.

25:54.420 --> 26:00.859
And she came out pretty angrily.
This was on "The Today Show."
She was more angry than

26:00.859 --> 26:05.731
I think I have seen her about
the Benghazi committee and about
the controversy over the

26:05.731 --> 26:09.668
e-mails, really saying: Kevin
McCarthy proves my point that
Republicans are just trying

26:09.668 --> 26:12.638
to politicize this.

26:12.638 --> 26:17.676
Now, many of Hillary Clinton
supporters would agree with that
assessment. Others are concerned

26:17.676 --> 26:22.748
about the e-mail issue and it
gets wrapped up in the idea of
trust.

26:22.748 --> 26:26.585
GWEN IFILL: Well, the other
problem, of course, is that just
-- this is -- and Capitol Hill

26:26.585 --> 26:31.924
politics -- this provided an
opportunity for somewhat be to
challenge Kevin McCarthy.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.760
Jason Chaffetz, let's listen to
what he had to say today to some
reporters.

26:34.760 --> 26:38.964
REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), Utah: I
think I bring a skill set that's
maybe a little bit more

26:38.964 --> 26:42.201
different, the communications
side of it, making sure you have
got a speaker who's out

26:42.201 --> 26:46.905
there speaking and driving home
the communications side of it.
Internally, I think I have
earned

26:46.905 --> 26:52.711
a reputation of being a fair,
honest broker that can bring
both sides or all sides of

26:52.711 --> 26:56.482
the political spectrum together.
There is some internal strife
and divide that needs

26:56.482 --> 26:58.951
to be bridged.

26:58.951 --> 27:02.054
GWEN IFILL: Now, he was talking
to Lisa Desjardins, our
political director, in that
interview.

27:02.054 --> 27:04.189
Clearly, he's saying, I can
communicate better than this
other guy.

27:04.189 --> 27:05.824
AMY WALTER: Yes.

27:05.824 --> 27:09.962
You notice that he said the word
communication there. He said the
word communication in a

27:09.962 --> 27:14.299
letter he wrote to his
colleagues this weekend, talking
a lot about, if you put me on
national

27:14.299 --> 27:17.970
television, I won't make
these same kind of mistakes.

27:17.970 --> 27:25.010
And, look, what that Benghazi
gaffe revealed for the
Republicans in the House is a
divide

27:25.010 --> 27:30.782
that was always there and a
concern that's always been there
that the new team coming

27:30.782 --> 27:35.954
in is going to have the same
problems as the old team that's
going out. They cannot figure

27:35.954 --> 27:41.426
out how to bring the Republicans
together and they can't figure
out a way for the Republicans

27:41.426 --> 27:49.067
to push a message that looks
like it can bring in a broader
group of voters.

27:49.067 --> 27:53.805
And so now we have had a real
fight for the speakership. This
was supposed to be Kevin

27:53.805 --> 27:59.011
McCarthy's. This was supposed to
be very easy. And talking to
folks on Capitol Hill today,

27:59.011 --> 28:03.515
there's a sense that you know
what? I don't know if anybody
can get to 218 votes right

28:03.515 --> 28:06.251
now, which is the vote
to be the speaker.

28:06.251 --> 28:11.290
GWEN IFILL: And, Tamara, of
course, it's really not so much
about who might be speaker in

28:11.290 --> 28:14.426
the end. Even if Kevin McCarthy
has more votes than Jason
Chaffetz, you still have -- the

28:14.426 --> 28:17.329
fight then begins for
the number two jobs.

28:17.329 --> 28:21.133
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, and that
fight has actually been delayed
a little bit until later in the

28:21.133 --> 28:23.835
month.

28:23.835 --> 28:29.908
The sort of more conservative
hard-line members of the
Republican Caucus are sort of
balking

28:29.908 --> 28:33.946
and saying, wait, you want all
of these people that are
basically allied with John
Boehner?

28:33.946 --> 28:37.683
The whole point of this for them
was to get rid of John Boehner
and to get rid of the

28:37.683 --> 28:42.788
people who sort of represent his
-- he would call it a more
practical viewpoint about what

28:42.788 --> 28:44.723
Republicans in
Congress can get done.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.925
GWEN IFILL: It all becomes parts
of the same loop-de-loop.

28:46.925 --> 28:54.433
Amy, Tamara, thank
you both very much.

28:54.433 --> 29:06.478
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a story from
our partners at the Center for
Investigative Reporting's

29:06.478 --> 29:12.884
podcast Reveal about Jane and
John Does, America's nameless
dead.

29:12.884 --> 29:18.390
Last month, a baby girl found on
the shore near Boston was
finally identified as Bella

29:18.390 --> 29:23.762
Bond. But there are still
thousands of unknown bodies
waiting for their own
identification

29:23.762 --> 29:27.866
in city morgues and public
cemeteries across the nation.

29:27.866 --> 29:31.970
Reveal's Michael
Schiller has the story.

29:31.970 --> 29:37.342
MICHAEL SCHILLER: Alice
Almendarez and her four sisters
knew something was wrong when

29:37.342 --> 29:40.145
a week went by without
hearing from their father.

29:40.145 --> 29:48.020
ALICE ALMENDAREZ, Daughter: My
dad was a softie. He had five
girls and, I mean, he adored us.

29:48.020 --> 29:51.757
MICHAEL SCHILLER: When Alice
tried to report him missing, she
says the Houston police didn't

29:51.757 --> 29:56.495
take her concerns seriously. She
says that because he had a
criminal record and no permanent

29:56.495 --> 30:00.098
address, the police assumed he
had intentionally left his
family.

30:00.098 --> 30:05.137
ALICE ALMENDAREZ: They told me
that maybe my father didn't want
to be found. Maybe he

30:05.137 --> 30:08.707
was tired of having a family. It
was hard, because you felt like
you were fighting them

30:08.707 --> 30:10.909
to do their job.

30:10.909 --> 30:13.979
MICHAEL SCHILLER: She didn't
learn his fate for 12 years.

30:13.979 --> 30:19.084
ALICE ALMENDAREZ: You can't
celebrate a holiday when there's
somebody missing from the room.

30:19.084 --> 30:22.721
I actually was supposed to get
married, and I didn't get
married because I couldn't get

30:22.721 --> 30:26.692
married without my dad.

30:26.692 --> 30:31.263
MICHAEL SCHILLER: The FBI
estimates that there are some
80,000 reported missing people
on

30:31.263 --> 30:36.702
any given day in the United
States. At the same time, there
are over 10,000 unidentified

30:36.702 --> 30:41.606
bodies. There is no national law
requiring agencies to share this
information, leaving

30:41.606 --> 30:45.877
many families in the dark
about their loved one's fate.

30:45.877 --> 30:49.581
The U.S. Justice Department
calls it the nation's silent
mass disaster.

30:49.581 --> 30:54.152
MICHAEL MURPHY, Clark County
Coroner: Sooner or later, we
have to address this problem.

30:54.152 --> 30:59.424
MICHAEL SCHILLER: After 13 years
as Las Vegas coroner, Michael
Murphy says that, because

30:59.424 --> 31:02.828
there is no unified approach to
reporting Jane and John Does,
bodies go unidentified

31:02.828 --> 31:05.130
far too long.

31:05.130 --> 31:09.367
MICHAEL MURPHY: You could have a
body that was on one side of a
county line, and the

31:09.367 --> 31:12.137
next county could have that
individual reported as missing,
and no one may have talked to

31:12.137 --> 31:14.539
each other.

31:14.539 --> 31:19.077
MICHAEL SCHILLER: In Alice's
case, it happened within the
same Texas county. After 12
years

31:19.077 --> 31:22.547
of searching for her father, she
learned that authorities had
found his body only a few

31:22.547 --> 31:26.284
miles from where she lived, just
weeks after their last visit.

31:26.284 --> 31:29.988
ALICE ALMENDAREZ: If I would
have known the whole time that
my dad was already dead, I

31:29.988 --> 31:34.025
would have had some kind of
peace, knowing that my dad
wasn't starving, wasn't hungry,

31:34.025 --> 31:36.228
wasn't being hurt.

31:36.228 --> 31:39.231
TODD MATTHEWS, Director of Case
Management, NamUs: You know, a
traditional funeral, three

31:39.231 --> 31:42.834
days, you're buried, and then
you find ways to adapt to your
new life. In a missing persons

31:42.834 --> 31:46.471
case, it's like a funeral
that goes on for years.

31:46.471 --> 31:50.642
MICHAEL SCHILLER: Todd Matthews
started out as part of a network
of volunteer sleuths

31:50.642 --> 31:55.847
working on cold cases involving
nameless victims. It's become a
full-time job.

31:55.847 --> 31:59.951
TODD MATTHEWS: My day job is
finding the missing among the
dead.

31:59.951 --> 32:04.322
MICHAEL SCHILLER: After Matthews
identified a body from a 1960s
murder case, the Department

32:04.322 --> 32:08.693
of Justice called on him to help
create a database, the National
Missing and Unidentified

32:08.693 --> 32:14.399
Persons System, or NamUs, the
first ever federal catalogue
that made it possible for anyone

32:14.399 --> 32:19.471
to search official missing
persons and unsolved John and
Jane Doe cases.

32:19.471 --> 32:25.710
He is now the director of
communications and case
management for the NamUs
program. Today,

32:25.710 --> 32:31.283
Matthews is exhuming a body
that's been unidentified for 45
years. The skeletal remains are
believed

32:31.283 --> 32:34.653
to be those of a young woman who
was found dead off a remote
trail in Eastern Kentucky

32:34.653 --> 32:38.890
in 1969, murdered with
stab wounds to the chest.

32:38.890 --> 32:41.092
TODD MATTHEWS: Somebody's
getting away with it. The
criminal aspect of it is,
somebody's

32:41.092 --> 32:43.695
getting away with murder.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.364
MICHAEL SCHILLER: Even with no
formal training in forensics,
Matthews is regarded as an
expert

32:46.364 --> 32:49.267
in identifying human remains.

32:49.267 --> 32:53.538
TODD MATTHEWS: It's just a
matter of having to sit down and
just go through these cases

32:53.538 --> 32:57.776
and find what you're looking
for. The answers are in the
system for a lot of these cases.

32:57.776 --> 33:01.112
MICHAEL SCHILLER: The NamUs
system allows authorities to
automatically perform
cross-matching

33:01.112 --> 33:05.016
comparisons between databases,
searching for similarities.

33:05.016 --> 33:09.421
TODD MATTHEWS: I'm good. We're
at an exhumation in Kentucky
from a 1969 Jane Doe case. So,

33:09.421 --> 33:11.623
I have got some bones.

33:11.623 --> 33:15.493
MICHAEL SCHILLER: The main lab
that the NamUs database relies
on is at the University of

33:15.493 --> 33:20.232
North Texas, where scientists
extract and analyze DNA from
unidentified remains. But,

33:20.232 --> 33:25.570
by itself, this DNA
is not enough.

33:25.570 --> 33:30.709
To make an I.D., there needs to
be a matching source of DNA.
That's why loved ones of missing

33:30.709 --> 33:35.080
persons have gathered in
Houston, Texas, for Family Day,
where volunteer groups and
officials

33:35.080 --> 33:38.283
managing the NamUs database have
gathered along with law
enforcement to get more families

33:38.283 --> 33:41.186
to put their DNA
into the system.

33:41.186 --> 33:46.191
GLORIA ESPARZA, Mother: My son
is missing. His name is Ryan
Jacob Esparza. He's missing

33:46.191 --> 33:52.564
out of Pasadena, Texas. This is
the park that supposedly he was
last seen at.

33:52.564 --> 33:56.735
MICHAEL SCHILLER: Gloria Esparza
brought her family so that their
cheeks could be swabbed.

33:56.735 --> 34:00.272
Their DNA will be compared to
likely matches to see whether
any of the recorded John Does

34:00.272 --> 34:03.174
are Gloria's son.

34:03.174 --> 34:08.013
GLORIA ESPARZA: My world has
been turned upside-down, up and
down, and I want off. I want off
of

34:08.013 --> 34:11.449
this roller coaster.

34:11.449 --> 34:16.755
MICHAEL SCHILLER: Coroner
Michael Murphy in Las Vegas
thinks that connecting the
missing

34:16.755 --> 34:20.292
and the unidentified in one
database is a big step in the
right direction, but there

34:20.292 --> 34:22.427
is still more to do.

34:22.427 --> 34:28.800
MICHAEL MURPHY: There is not a
national requirement or any law
that I'm aware of that says that

34:28.800 --> 34:34.272
coroner medical examiner
offices, law enforcement
agencies or whomever will report
to a database

34:34.272 --> 34:40.178
about unidentified remains.
Connecting this information is
vital to the success of
identifying

34:40.178 --> 34:42.280
the unidentified persons.

34:42.280 --> 34:45.517
SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D),
Connecticut: That is why I am
here to urge my friends to join
us

34:45.517 --> 34:49.587
in supporting Billy's Law,
legislation that will begin
correcting these problems that

34:49.587 --> 34:52.524
plague our nation's
missing persons system.

34:52.524 --> 34:56.661
MICHAEL SCHILLER: In 2010,
then-Representative Chris Murphy
introduced a bill that would

34:56.661 --> 35:01.333
establish standards for
reporting missing and
unidentified persons. But that
effort

35:01.333 --> 35:05.370
and two following ones failed to
gain broad support. Recently,
now-Senator Murphy sponsored

35:05.370 --> 35:07.806
the bill for a fourth time.

35:07.806 --> 35:12.510
TODD MATTHEWS: I can say there
are agencies, medical examiners,
coroners, law enforcement

35:12.510 --> 35:18.350
that still today don't know
about NamUs. So much as we have
done to get the word out,

35:18.350 --> 35:24.255
free tools, free science, and
still, there are still people
who don't know about it.

35:24.255 --> 35:28.693
MICHAEL SCHILLER: Late last
year, the NamUs program
surpassed more than 10,000
unidentified

35:28.693 --> 35:31.896
bodies in their database, a grim
milestone, but one that
increases the odds that the
missing

35:31.896 --> 35:35.333
will be found.

35:35.333 --> 35:40.572
Alice's father used to be one of
those cases, until 2014, when
Alice submitted her DNA for

35:40.572 --> 35:44.409
comparison. Just a few months
later, there was a match.

35:44.409 --> 35:47.212
ALICE ALMENDAREZ: If everybody
was entered into that database,
then a lot of people would

35:47.212 --> 35:53.351
have the closure, not that they
wanted, but they needed in order
to be able to live again.

35:53.351 --> 35:57.222
MICHAEL SCHILLER: Alice's father
remains buried at the Harris
County Cemetery, where he's

35:57.222 --> 36:03.361
been for 10 years, marked as
an unknown Hispanic male.

36:03.361 --> 36:08.933
Today, Alice is waiting to
exhume his body so she can bury
him in their family cemetery,

36:08.933 --> 36:11.870
using a gravestone
with his real name.

36:11.870 --> 36:15.940
ALICE ALMENDAREZ: No matter what
somebody does, I don't think
they deserve to be buried

36:15.940 --> 36:19.411
as John Doe. My dad had a name.

36:19.411 --> 36:22.981
MICHAEL SCHILLER: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Michael Schiller
from Reveal in Houston,

36:22.981 --> 36:25.550
Texas.

36:25.550 --> 36:31.356
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Reveal has
launched a searchable database
to facilitate matches between
missing

36:31.356 --> 36:37.295
people and identified bodies.
You can find that online at
lostandfound.revealnews.org.

36:37.295 --> 36:56.815
It's the first Monday in
October, and that means the
Supreme Court kicks off its new

36:56.815 --> 37:00.351
term. The court will deal with
several political issues, among
them, affirmative action, voting

37:00.351 --> 37:03.688
rights and labor unions.

37:03.688 --> 37:06.558
For what to look for in the
months ahead, we are joined, as
always, by Marcia Coyle

37:06.558 --> 37:07.892
of "The National Law Journal."

37:07.892 --> 37:09.961
Welcome back to the
program, Marcia.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.196
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal": Thanks, Judy. It's
good to be back.

37:11.196 --> 37:13.865
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, it is
developing into a pretty big
term.

37:13.865 --> 37:18.636
MARCIA COYLE: It is, and not
only the cases that the court
has already agreed to hear,

37:18.636 --> 37:22.307
but there are some big ones
waiting in the wings that the
justices are likely to add

37:22.307 --> 37:24.642
to this term's docket.

37:24.642 --> 37:27.879
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, you were
just telling me that there's a
lot of conversations, before

37:27.879 --> 37:31.082
we get into some of the
specifics, that this -- a lot of
conversation about how this
could

37:31.082 --> 37:33.284
turn out to be a more
conservative term than the last
one.

37:33.284 --> 37:35.687
What did you mean by that?

37:35.687 --> 37:41.159
MARCIA COYLE: Well, so much of a
term's character depends on the
nature of the cases that the

37:41.159 --> 37:48.366
justices take, but it also
depends on if those cases are
controversial and the court is
likely

37:48.366 --> 37:54.272
to split ideologically, Justice
Kennedy is in the middle. He's
the swing vote. And he

37:54.272 --> 38:01.946
tends to vote conservative more
than he does to the left on
certain issues.

38:01.946 --> 38:06.684
And those certain issues are on
the docket, as you mentioned,
affirmative action, voting,

38:06.684 --> 38:08.753
First Amendment, unions.

38:08.753 --> 38:11.489
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's
tackle a few of those, and let's
start with affirmative action.

38:11.489 --> 38:13.191
This is Fisher vs. the
University of Texas.

38:13.191 --> 38:15.226
MARCIA COYLE: Right.

38:15.226 --> 38:23.334
The University of Texas uses
race as one of something like 17
different factors in its

38:23.334 --> 38:29.774
admissions policies. Its goal is
to achieve broader diversity.
This is the second time

38:29.774 --> 38:34.345
this case has come to the
courts. But, several terms ago,
the court sent it back to the
lower

38:34.345 --> 38:38.650
courts because it believed that
the lower courts hadn't applied
strict scrutiny, that

38:38.650 --> 38:43.121
is, that it hadn't found -- it
hadn't first looked at whether
race-neutral alternatives

38:43.121 --> 38:47.825
were used by the university
before using race.

38:47.825 --> 38:53.331
Went back to the lower court.
The lower court once again said,
this program passes
constitutional

38:53.331 --> 38:58.503
muster. Comes back up to the
Supreme Court. And, apparently,
there are four justices,

38:58.503 --> 39:02.674
because you only need the votes
of four, who still want to look
at the use of race to achieve

39:02.674 --> 39:05.076
diversity in higher education.

39:05.076 --> 39:08.947
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, as you say,
the second time before the
court.

39:08.947 --> 39:13.351
Another Texas case, Marcia, this
one on political redistricting,
one person, one vote.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.986
MARCIA COYLE: Right.

39:14.986 --> 39:20.091
And it's hard to believe that
the principle of one person, one
vote is now before the

39:20.091 --> 39:26.397
Supreme Court in a very basic
way. How should you count people
in order to get to one person,

39:26.397 --> 39:30.935
one vote in legislative
districts?

39:30.935 --> 39:36.874
The state of Texas, in fact,
just about every single state
counts total population in order

39:36.874 --> 39:42.447
to get to that. But the
challengers in this case say,
no, you really should count
voting

39:42.447 --> 39:48.453
population, eligible voters. And
the reason it has politically
high stakes is if you go

39:48.453 --> 39:55.627
with voting population, that
tends to benefit rural areas,
where people do vote more and

39:55.627 --> 39:59.197
they tend -- trend
to vote Republican.

39:59.197 --> 40:04.802
If you do it on total
population, which includes not
only voters, but non-citizens,
they tend

40:04.802 --> 40:07.672
to trend Democratic in voting.

40:07.672 --> 40:09.540
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you're going
to capture a bigger group,
including...

40:09.540 --> 40:10.875
MARCIA COYLE: Right. Exactly.

40:10.875 --> 40:13.544
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it raises
probably some questions about...

40:13.544 --> 40:14.479
(CROSSTALK)

40:14.479 --> 40:16.714
MARCIA COYLE: Favored
cities, yes.

40:16.714 --> 40:22.220
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, another case
that we know is coming up has to
do with public sector

40:22.220 --> 40:28.593
labor unions and individuals who
are not paying members,
dues-paying members of these
unions,

40:28.593 --> 40:30.995
but who may receive benefits.

40:30.995 --> 40:36.301
MARCIA COYLE: Well, back in
1977, the Supreme Court decided
a case in which it had to strike

40:36.301 --> 40:44.042
a balance between the First
Amendment rights of non-union
members, as well as unions'
rights.

40:44.042 --> 40:48.246
When they engage in collective
bargaining, the benefits of
collective bargaining also

40:48.246 --> 40:53.651
go to the non-union members
in the public sector.

40:53.651 --> 40:58.556
And the unions look at that as
free-riding. And so the Supreme
Court says the First Amendment

40:58.556 --> 41:03.928
rights of non-union members
really aren't hindered if they
contribute to the cost of

41:03.928 --> 41:08.833
collective bargaining, but they
don't have to pay for the
unions' non-collective
bargaining

41:08.833 --> 41:14.539
activities, like political
lobbying, speech, things like
that.

41:14.539 --> 41:18.576
But in the case before the
Supreme Court, the court is
being asked to overrule that

41:18.576 --> 41:26.484
1977 decision and eliminate the
fees that non-union members pay
to unions. So, the stakes

41:26.484 --> 41:31.856
are very high for public sector
unions, which remain the largest
unions in the country.

41:31.856 --> 41:34.425
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the other
thing, Marcia, as you have told
us, there are a couple of

41:34.425 --> 41:39.530
cases that are, in your words,
in the wings, potentially really
controversial cases.

41:39.530 --> 41:41.799
MARCIA COYLE: Yes.

41:41.799 --> 41:47.171
Yes, there are two petitions
pending, two cases pending right
now involving abortion

41:47.171 --> 41:54.879
clinics and restrictions on how
those clinics operate. This goes
to the sort of art of the

41:54.879 --> 42:01.853
abortion right. How do you
determine what is an undue
burden on a woman's right to
abortion?

42:01.853 --> 42:08.426
Do these restrictions or
regulations, are they an undue
burden and, thus,
unconstitutional?

42:08.426 --> 42:12.730
And in the second group of
cases, there are seven right now
and there probably will be

42:12.730 --> 42:18.102
more, come from religious
nonprofits who are objecting to
how the government accommodate

42:18.102 --> 42:21.672
their objections to
contraceptive health insurance.

42:21.672 --> 42:24.475
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's enough
to keep you very, very busy this
term.

42:24.475 --> 42:27.445
MARCIA COYLE: Potentially
a very big term, Judy.

42:27.445 --> 42:33.317
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marcia Coyle,
thank you. We look forward to
seeing you again soon.

42:33.317 --> 42:40.391
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure.

42:40.391 --> 42:48.065
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: the latest
addition to the "NewsHour"
Bookshelf.

42:48.065 --> 42:53.838
In the early 1960s, it was a
city that stood on the threshold
of unlimited possibilities,

42:53.838 --> 42:59.143
but it wasn't to be. Today, some
two years after Detroit declared
bankruptcy, it is slowly

42:59.143 --> 43:02.914
recovering from
decades of decline.

43:02.914 --> 43:08.319
Washington Post editor and
Detroit native David Maraniss
looks at the Motor City of

43:08.319 --> 43:14.192
50 years ago in his new book,
"Once in a Great City: A Detroit
Story."

43:14.192 --> 43:18.262
Jeffrey Brown talked to him
recently at the National Book
Festival here in Washington.

43:18.262 --> 43:23.868
JEFFREY BROWN: So, "Once in a
Great City," you are taking us
back to a great moment,

43:23.868 --> 43:25.770
right, maybe like the
heights, right, of...

43:25.770 --> 43:28.239
DAVID MARANISS, Author, "Once in
a Great City: A Detroit Story":
Well, it's a moment -- the

43:28.239 --> 43:35.079
book takes place between 1962
and 1964, when Motown was
booming, when the Mustang was
being

43:35.079 --> 43:38.850
conceived, when cars were
selling more than ever before,
when Walter Reuther and the
labor

43:38.850 --> 43:42.119
movement were at their peak.

43:42.119 --> 43:46.958
The working people of Detroit
were reaching the middle class.
There was so much luminescence

43:46.958 --> 43:52.396
about the city then, but it was
a luminescence that was also a
dying light.

43:52.396 --> 43:57.101
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, before you
get to the dying light, the
luminescence, what was Detroit

43:57.101 --> 44:02.440
at that moment? Because it's so
easy to forget when you -- given
what we look at now.

44:02.440 --> 44:08.980
DAVID MARANISS: It had 1.7
million people. Now it's down to
700,000.

44:08.980 --> 44:16.153
It had -- the Big Three was
building more cars than ever
before. It had a creative
spirit.

44:16.153 --> 44:23.261
The book -- one of the threads
of the book is creation,
creativity, destruction, decay.

44:23.261 --> 44:27.064
And you see them sort of
intertwined. And it was very
creative at that point. You
could

44:27.064 --> 44:30.001
invent yourself in
Detroit 50 years ago.

44:30.001 --> 44:32.970
JEFFREY BROWN: And, of course,
Motown famously invented itself
and then many wonderful and

44:32.970 --> 44:34.705
famous musicians.

44:34.705 --> 44:36.240
DAVID MARANISS: Totally, yes,
which is one of the key threads
of the book, Berry Gordy

44:36.240 --> 44:38.376
and his family.

44:38.376 --> 44:44.115
I give a lot of due to his
sisters actually. The whole
Gordy family created Motown. And

44:44.115 --> 44:49.854
all of this local talent, it's
just stunning to think about
Smokey Robinson Stevie Wonder,

44:49.854 --> 44:56.160
The Temptations, the Supremes,
Martha Reeves, Mary Wells. All
these great musicians grew

44:56.160 --> 44:59.163
up near each other, and Aretha
Franklin, who wasn't Motown, but
was there.

44:59.163 --> 45:02.500
JEFFREY BROWN: So you have all
the personalities on the
creative side and then you have
personalities

45:02.500 --> 45:06.404
on the business side,
particularly in the auto
industry.

45:06.404 --> 45:12.176
DAVID MARANISS: Yes, Henry Ford
II, the Deuce, HF2, an
incredibly colorful character,
and

45:12.176 --> 45:15.646
then his sometimes enemy,
sometimes ally Walter Reuther of
the UAW, which was at its
powerful

45:15.646 --> 45:16.847
peak then.

45:16.847 --> 45:18.049
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, another very
large personality, right? Yes.

45:18.049 --> 45:20.017
DAVID MARANISS: Yes.

45:20.017 --> 45:22.453
JEFFREY BROWN: You're writing
saying that the seeds of the
problems to come were already

45:22.453 --> 45:24.255
there.

45:24.255 --> 45:28.059
DAVID MARANISS: One of the
important things to understand
is, when people think about

45:28.059 --> 45:33.698
the decay of Detroit, a lot of
people tend to blame it on three
things, the riots in

45:33.698 --> 45:41.272
1967, the municipal corruption
that followed, and the pension
problems that ensued.

45:41.272 --> 45:47.878
But you could see the structural
problems before that. In 1963,
some great sociologists

45:47.878 --> 45:51.849
at Wayne State predicted exactly
what was going to happen.
Productive people are going

45:51.849 --> 46:00.558
to leave the city. It was a
perfect storm of racial
problems, housing unfairness,
urban

46:00.558 --> 46:05.830
renewal, and the structural
problem of a one-company town.
And all of that together just
created

46:05.830 --> 46:08.532
this problem that
could see in 1963.

46:08.532 --> 46:12.169
JEFFREY BROWN: Did
it happen quickly?

46:12.169 --> 46:19.977
DAVID MARANISS: No, it didn't.
It happened over a decade, more
people leaving every year,

46:19.977 --> 46:24.315
the city's structure changing,
obviously, the auto industry
expanding all over the world

46:24.315 --> 46:28.019
and leaving Detroit behind.

46:28.019 --> 46:33.391
Some very crucial decisions were
happening then, but it took
decades for the full decay

46:33.391 --> 46:37.328
of Detroit and now finally
perhaps its renaissance.

46:37.328 --> 46:39.864
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, before I
ask you about that, I want to
ask you about the creativity

46:39.864 --> 46:40.197
part.

46:40.197 --> 46:42.333
DAVID MARANISS: Yes.

46:42.333 --> 46:46.904
JEFFREY BROWN: Because if the
creativity was all there in
1962-'4, and it was, what
happened

46:46.904 --> 46:47.805
to that?

46:47.805 --> 46:48.939
DAVID MARANISS:
Right. Right. Yes.

46:48.939 --> 46:51.509
JEFFREY BROWN: Because one can
sort of see the structural
problems.

46:51.509 --> 46:54.578
DAVID MARANISS: Well, let me
give you one example of the
creativity that meant the most.

46:54.578 --> 46:59.717
I was trying to figure out, why
did Motown happen? Now, part of
it is Berry Gordy's individual

46:59.717 --> 47:06.057
genius. Another part is it was
that it was a huge geographic
city with single-family

47:06.057 --> 47:12.063
homes and a great piano company
that could get pianos into those
working-class homes.

47:12.063 --> 47:16.333
The people there could afford
the pianos because they had
jobs. And Detroit had great
public

47:16.333 --> 47:20.204
school teachers, music teachers.
They had music at every school.

47:20.204 --> 47:24.542
So, every Motown person I
interviewed, whether it was
Martha Reeves to the Funk
Brothers'

47:24.542 --> 47:27.044
people, would say, I remember
my elementary schoolteacher.

47:27.044 --> 47:29.246
JEFFREY BROWN: And
the piano at home.

47:29.246 --> 47:31.048
DAVID MARANISS: And
the piano at home.

47:31.048 --> 47:32.349
JEFFREY BROWN: Because that used
to be the ideal of a
middle-class existence, right?

47:32.349 --> 47:34.485
DAVID MARANISS: Yes, exactly.

47:34.485 --> 47:40.391
So, all of that -- as the jobs
leave, as the school system
shrinks, as music gets pushed

47:40.391 --> 47:41.559
out of the schools, that
created too many...

47:41.559 --> 47:41.959
(CROSSTALK)

47:41.959 --> 47:44.228
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

47:44.228 --> 47:48.733
Now, I read that, speaking of
music, Eminem somehow inspired
the book. Explain.

47:48.733 --> 47:51.368
DAVID MARANISS: Yes,
it's a very odd thing.

47:51.368 --> 47:53.104
I was born in Detroit, because
I'm a Green Bay Packers fan
because I have spent most

47:53.104 --> 47:55.606
of my time in Wisconsin.

47:55.606 --> 47:59.076
JEFFREY BROWN: OK. I'm not sure
I will ask you to explain that,
how that worked.

47:59.076 --> 48:00.911
DAVID MARANISS: The 2011 Super
Bowl, Packers are playing, I'm
watching the game in New

48:00.911 --> 48:04.014
York City at a bar.

48:04.014 --> 48:08.919
And, at halftime, I'm not paying
too much attention, until on the
screen I see a commercial

48:08.919 --> 48:14.625
that has the Detroit Freeway
sign, and then this hypnotic
beat starts, and you see Diego

48:14.625 --> 48:19.263
Rivera Detroit industry mural
and the Joe Louis Fist, and
Eminem getting out of the

48:19.263 --> 48:22.666
car, walking into the Fox
Theatre, and say, this is the
Motor City. This is what we do.

48:22.666 --> 48:24.535
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

48:24.535 --> 48:29.406
DAVID MARANISS: I teared up.
Why? It's just a commercial. As
my wife told me very clearly,

48:29.406 --> 48:33.277
you know, Detroit is dying,
they're selling cars, and you're
getting emotional.

48:33.277 --> 48:38.449
But that struck a chord with me
about Detroit in a very powerful
way. Made me think, I don't

48:38.449 --> 48:41.986
want to buy a Chrysler, but I do
want to write about the city
from which I came, the city

48:41.986 --> 48:45.256
of my birth, and what
it gave America.

48:45.256 --> 48:48.893
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, you used
earlier this R-word,
renaissance. But is renaissance
fair

48:48.893 --> 48:51.128
enough? Do you see -- what
do you see happening now?

48:51.128 --> 48:53.430
DAVID MARANISS: Well,
it's bifurcated.

48:53.430 --> 48:58.302
Yes, in one sense, about young
-- it's a great place to go if
you're young and want to create.

48:58.302 --> 49:05.876
There's vast swathes of
emptiness, of those 28 miles of
Detroit, you know, and you can

49:05.876 --> 49:11.382
go through miles of it where
three out of every 10 houses are
gone, too of them are

49:11.382 --> 49:15.920
abandoned, that very strong
working class, white and black.
There's a much harder time

49:15.920 --> 49:18.322
coming back.

49:18.322 --> 49:24.528
So, in one sense, you do see it
reinventing itself. But it's a
different Detroit. And

49:24.528 --> 49:28.966
until it deals with those real
structural problems of the
people who were there 50 years

49:28.966 --> 49:32.403
ago building America, then you
can never truly call it a full
renaissance.

49:32.403 --> 49:33.170
JEFFREY BROWN: Are you
hopeful, though, after...

49:33.170 --> 49:34.138
(CROSSTALK)

49:34.138 --> 49:35.239
DAVID MARANISS: I'm
always hopeful, yes.

49:35.239 --> 49:36.874
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. All right.

49:36.874 --> 49:39.877
"Once in a Great City: A Detroit
Story" by David Maraniss.

49:39.877 --> 49:41.145
Thank you very much.

49:41.145 --> 49:44.515
DAVID MARANISS:
Thank you, Jeffrey.

49:44.515 --> 49:49.153
JEFFREY BROWN: Nice
to talk to you.

49:49.153 --> 49:53.090
DAVID MARANISS: You, too.

49:53.090 --> 49:59.263
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another
installment in our Brief But
Spectacular series.

49:59.263 --> 50:04.034
Tonight, Republican political
consultant Fred Davis, who has
created some of the most
memorable

50:04.034 --> 50:09.773
television campaign commercials
over the years, gives us his
take on what makes an ad stick.

50:09.773 --> 50:16.313
FRED DAVIS, Advertising
Consultant: If I adore somebody,
I hope I can make you adore
them.

50:16.313 --> 50:25.990
When I get asked who our clients
are, I try to start from one
part of the country and

50:25.990 --> 50:31.161
move, so I can get them in a
row, Arnold Schwarzenegger,
Carly Fiorina, John McCain, John
Cornyn, Bob

50:31.161 --> 50:35.633
Corker, Lamar Alexander, David
Perdue. And I know I'm leaving
some out, and it isn't

50:35.633 --> 50:39.436
because I don't love you. I
just -- that's a lot of names.

50:39.436 --> 50:45.209
The ad that you probably would
know, much to my dismay, one
picked up the nickname demon

50:45.209 --> 50:50.347
sheep. Probably Carly Fiorina's
demon sheep ad, that could have
been well been a normal

50:50.347 --> 50:56.453
ad about this gentleman, who I
will not name, who was running
against her, who we felt was

50:56.453 --> 51:00.591
not as conservative in reality
as he was saying he was. In
other words, he is a wolf in
sheep's

51:00.591 --> 51:02.826
clothing.

51:02.826 --> 51:07.097
When you're the candidate or
you're in a campaign team, you
don't want to hear that your
best

51:07.097 --> 51:13.804
bet is putting some poor guy in
a fake sheep's outfit. And you
don't want to tell John McCain

51:13.804 --> 51:19.476
that his best bet for winning in
2008 was comparing him to Paris
Hilton.

51:19.476 --> 51:24.915
NARRATOR: He's the biggest
celebrity in the world.

51:24.915 --> 51:29.753
FRED DAVIS: That's not an easy
sell, but those both worked
fabulously.

51:29.753 --> 51:34.158
And here's the problem with most
of the advertising you see. Over
the course of the day, you will

51:34.158 --> 51:41.231
see, what, 500 ads. And you get
home at night, how many of those
do you remember? Probably

51:41.231 --> 51:44.802
this many.

51:44.802 --> 51:51.041
And so my job, I think, it
should be the job of any ad guy,
is to make that one ad that

51:51.041 --> 51:56.647
your client spent so much
hard-earned -- so much tough
time raising money to pay for
that

51:56.647 --> 51:59.817
ad to make it be something
they talked about.

51:59.817 --> 52:04.254
When I was a kid, I was the guy
in the neighborhood who put on
the plays. I would build the
little

52:04.254 --> 52:07.691
control panel. I would have the
lights. I would do all this
excitement stuff. And my

52:07.691 --> 52:12.129
poor little brothers and sister
always had -- and the neighbors
had to be in my plays.

52:12.129 --> 52:16.133
That is not very different
from what I do today.

52:16.133 --> 52:22.673
I'm Fred Davis, and this is my
Brief But Spectacular take on
political advertising.

52:22.673 --> 52:27.544
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings
us to our "NewsHour" Shares of
the day, something that caught
our

52:27.544 --> 52:30.948
eye which might be of
interest to you, too.

52:30.948 --> 52:36.620
Tonight, something not for the
faint of heart. China's first
high-altitude glass-bottomed

52:36.620 --> 52:41.892
suspension bridge has opened to
tourists. The pedestrian
walkway, known in English as

52:41.892 --> 52:49.266
the Brave Man's Bridge is nearly
the length of three football
fields. It spans two cliffs

52:49.266 --> 52:55.239
in Shiniuzhai National
Geological Park in Central
China. Visitors daring enough to
walk

52:55.239 --> 52:59.309
on the attraction's one-inch
thick glass get vertigo-inducing
views of the valley floor

52:59.309 --> 53:03.814
600 feet below.

53:03.814 --> 53:07.584
Another case of, it's good
somebody else is there to do it.

53:07.584 --> 53:13.190
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: a closer look at three
winners of the Nobel Prize in

53:13.190 --> 53:17.828
Medicine, including a
traditional herbal medicine
