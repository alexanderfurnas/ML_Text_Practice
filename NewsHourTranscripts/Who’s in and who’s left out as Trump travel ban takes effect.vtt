JUDY WOODRUFF: After months
of legal and political
wrangling, President
Trump's executive order

00:04.666 --> 00:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
banning entry into the U.S. from
six Muslim-majority countries
goes into effect tonight.

00:11.666 --> 00:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier this week, the Supreme
Court gave a partial green
light to get started, ordering

00:18.266 --> 00:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those with what it called bona
fide family or business ties
to the U.S. be granted entry.

00:22.900 --> 00:26.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Last night, the Trump
administration laid out
which connections count.

00:26.800 --> 00:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And joining us to discuss these
guidelines is Yeganeh Torbati.

00:30.366 --> 00:32.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She covers the State
Department for Reuters.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yeganeh, welcome
back to the program.

00:34.833 --> 00:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So what is the administration
saying now about who is
permitted in and who isn't?

00:38.966 --> 00:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI, Reuters: Right.

00:41.033 --> 00:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From these six countries, and
individuals who have certain
family connections, so spouses,

00:47.100 --> 00:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mothers, fathers, children,
siblings, even step-siblings,
they can be allowed in.

00:52.100 --> 00:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The State Department is counting
that as a bona fide connection.

00:54.833 --> 00:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you are the grandparents
of a U.S. citizen, for
instance, or the grandchild,

00:59.466 --> 01:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you are trying to get in
and you're a citizen from one
of these six countries, that

01:02.766 --> 01:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't count in the State
Department, in the U.S.
administration's view.

01:05.733 --> 01:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there
was also a definition of
business relationship.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
YEGANEH TORBATI: Right.

01:11.533 --> 01:15.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, if you are a student
that has been accepted
into a U.S. university,
someone with an offer

01:17.366 --> 01:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of employment from an American
company, or even a lecturer
coming in to lecture at a

01:22.433 --> 01:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conference, for instance,
or university, you
can be allowed in.

01:24.666 --> 01:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if are you someone who has
just booked a hotel room or a
tour or something like that,

01:29.200 --> 01:31.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that does not count.

01:31.233 --> 01:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about
those people who were in the
process of trying to get a

01:34.066 --> 01:36.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
visa to come here?

01:36.166 --> 01:38.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YEGANEH TORBATI: So, any
individual who has been
granted a visa, those
visas are not going

01:38.466 --> 01:40.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be revoked.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are still valid and
they will still be able to
come into the United States.

01:42.633 --> 01:46.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But there's thousands
potentially of people
who had applied for
visas, they were waiting

01:46.500 --> 01:48.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to hear back.

01:48.166 --> 01:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Those individuals,
we're not exactly sure.

01:50.633 --> 01:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think that is going to
be something that now consulate
officers will have to take

01:55.100 --> 01:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into account these guidelines
when they are assessing, are
they actually going to give

01:58.766 --> 02:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that visa to that person or not?

02:00.933 --> 02:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Yeganeh, did
the administration explain how
it made this dividing line when

02:06.300 --> 02:08.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it comes to family
relationships?

02:08.233 --> 02:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI: It seemed
a little bit arbitrary
from the outside.

02:10.266 --> 02:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What the administration said
today to reporters is that they
looked at guidelines that they

02:14.633 --> 02:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have from the Immigration
Nationality Act, which is the
main U.S. law that governs U.S.

02:19.633 --> 02:21.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immigration.

02:21.700 --> 02:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they said that that is how
they are going to assess which
family relationships count

02:24.333 --> 02:26.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and which don't.

02:26.900 --> 02:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Critics, of course, say
that they're still hewing
this line very narrowly,
they're interpreting

02:30.166 --> 02:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Supreme Court ban narrowly,
the Supreme Court ruling
narrowly, so that they can let

02:34.666 --> 02:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in as few people as possible.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So we know this
has been subject to litigation.

02:38.666 --> 02:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it expected there are
going to be more lawsuits
or does this settle it?

02:41.533 --> 02:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI: We haven't
seen people, and refugee groups
or institutions like the ACLU

02:46.066 --> 02:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running yet saying that they
are going to be suing over
this or filing new complaints.

02:50.900 --> 02:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is certainly a possibility.

02:53.533 --> 02:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One other thing to mention
is that the administration
seems to be very narrowly
interpreting which

02:57.033 --> 02:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
refugees it's going to let in.

02:59.066 --> 03:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is saying that just having a
relationship to a resettlement
agency is not enough, and

03:03.400 --> 03:07.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
therefore any additional
refugees that will be
coming in this year
will have to have some

03:07.600 --> 03:09.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
family relationship
in the United States.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The refugee groups are
very upset about that.

03:11.933 --> 03:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They think that that violates
the spirit, if not the letter
of the Supreme Court's order.

03:18.966 --> 03:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is something that
we're going to see if there
is going to be litigation or

03:19.833 --> 03:21.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
not.

03:21.533 --> 03:23.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It doesn't seem like
as of yet there's been
any complaints filed.

03:23.566 --> 03:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
Yeganeh Torbati with
Reuters, thanks very much.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This goes into effect
tonight at 8:00 Eastern.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
YEGANEH TORBATI: Yes.

03:29.166 --> 03:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We thank you.

03:30.166 --> 03:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI: Thank you.
