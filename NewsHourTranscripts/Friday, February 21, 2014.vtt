LITTLE BIT DESTABILIZING.       

14:29.325 --> 14:31.448

LITTLE BIT DESTABILIZING.       
BUT I THINK THERE'S KIND OF A   

14:31.451 --> 14:36.200
LITTLE BIT DESTABILIZING.       
BUT I THINK THERE'S KIND OF A   
MATURITY THAT IS PRESENT THERE.

14:48.029 --> 14:50.983
CON BE GONE, EXCON SINCE HE     
SERVED PRISON AS A YOUNG MAN.   
THE NEW CHANCE IS DEATH TO THE

SERVED PRISON AS A YOUNG MAN.   
THE NEW CHANCE IS DEATH TO THE  
PRISONER.                       

14:51.350 --> 14:54.041
THE NEW CHANCE IS DEATH TO THE  
PRISONER.
