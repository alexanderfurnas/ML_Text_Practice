00:18.585 --> 00:20.287

00:41.808 --> 00:42.843

00:42.843 --> 00:43.944
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.212
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN

00:45.212 --> 00:46.480
NETANYAHU SAID TODAY THAT ISRAEL

00:46.480 --> 00:47.848
HAS ACCOMPLISHED MANY OF ITS

00:47.848 --> 00:49.216
GOALS DURING ITS NEARLY FOUR-

00:49.216 --> 00:51.051
WEEK-LONG CONFLICT WITH HAMAS.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.886
AND ISRAELI TROOPS AND TANKS

00:52.886 --> 00:53.954
BEGAN TO PULL BACK FROM PARTS OF

00:53.954 --> 00:55.656
GAZA.

00:55.656 --> 00:56.924
NETANYAHU SIGNALED THAT A WIDER

00:56.924 --> 00:58.392
PULLBACK COULD BE COMING AFTER

00:58.392 --> 00:59.660
THE LAST OF THE HAMAS TUNNELS

00:59.660 --> 01:00.761
LEADING INTO ISRAEL FROM GAZA

01:00.761 --> 01:02.930
ARE DESTROYED.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.531
>> (translated): THE MILITARY

01:04.531 --> 01:06.066
WILL PREPARE FOR CONTINUING

01:06.066 --> 01:07.467
ACTION IN ACCORDING TO OUR

01:07.467 --> 01:08.635
SECURITY NEEDS AND ONLY

01:08.635 --> 01:10.003
ACCORDING TO OUR SECURITY NEEDS.

01:10.003 --> 01:11.638
UNTIL WE OBTAIN THE OBJECTIVE OF

01:11.638 --> 01:12.873
RETURNING SECURITY TO YOU THE

01:12.873 --> 01:14.741
CITIZENS OF ISRAEL.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.209
>> Sreenivasan: AN ESTIMATED

01:16.209 --> 01:17.978
1,650 PALESTINIANS AND 66

01:17.978 --> 01:19.246
ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN KILLED DURING

01:19.246 --> 01:20.948
THE FIGHTING.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.416
MEANWHILE, THE EGYPTIAN LEADER,

01:22.416 --> 01:23.750
ABDEL FATTAH AL-SISI, IS HOSTING

01:23.750 --> 01:25.218
A MEETING IN CAIRO WITH

01:25.218 --> 01:26.820
PALESTINIAN OFFICIALS TO TRY TO

01:26.820 --> 01:28.221
BROKER A NEW, MORE LASTING CEASE

01:28.221 --> 01:29.856
FIRE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS.

01:29.856 --> 01:31.458
AN EARLIER CEASE FIRE ARRANGED

01:31.458 --> 01:32.759
BY EGYPT BROKE DOWN AFTER ONLY

01:32.759 --> 01:35.195
HOURS YESTERDAY.

01:35.195 --> 01:36.463
EARLIER TODAY, WE SPOKE VIA

01:36.463 --> 01:37.664
SKYPE FROM JERUSALEM WITH JODI

01:37.664 --> 01:39.299
RUDOREN OF THE "NEW YORK TIMES."

01:39.299 --> 01:40.400
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE

01:40.400 --> 01:41.935
PLANNED NEGOTIATIONS IN EGYPT?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.270
>> WELL TWO, THINGS.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.805
I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL, THESE

01:44.805 --> 01:46.940
NEGOTIATIONS ARE PART OF A PLAN

01:46.940 --> 01:48.875
THAT SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN

01:48.875 --> 01:50.911
KERRY AND HEAD OF THE UNITED

01:50.911 --> 01:52.512
NATIONS ARRANGED, TO HAVE A 72

01:52.512 --> 01:54.815
HOUR CEASE-FIRE DURING WHICH,

01:54.815 --> 01:56.283
THE MORE SUBSTANTIVE AGREEMENT

01:56.283 --> 01:59.753
TO END THE FIGHTING.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.755
THAT FELL APART, AS YOU

02:01.755 --> 02:03.957
MENTIONED YESTERDAY, WHEN ISRAEL

02:03.957 --> 02:05.926
RENEWED THE ATTACK AFTER BEING

02:05.926 --> 02:07.861
CONFRONTED BY MILITANTS WHO CAME

02:07.861 --> 02:09.563
OUT OF A TUNNEL, THEY KILLED TWO

02:09.563 --> 02:10.764
SOLDIERS AND SEEMED TO HAVE

02:10.764 --> 02:12.466
CAPTURED AN OFFICER.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.067
SO, THAT WHOLE THING FEEL APART,

02:14.067 --> 02:15.802
THE PALESTINIANS DECIDED TO GO

02:15.802 --> 02:17.838
AHEAD AND GO TO CAIRO, BUT THE

02:17.838 --> 02:20.240
ISRAELIS HAVE NOT DEFINITELY

02:20.240 --> 02:21.808
SAID THEY ARE NOT GOING BUT IT

02:21.808 --> 02:23.844
APPEARS IT SEEMS THEY ARE NOT.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.812
BUT LONGER TERM, IF THERE IS

02:25.812 --> 02:28.281
GOING TO BE ANY RESOLUTION

02:28.281 --> 02:30.384
BEYOND JUST THEM JUST TIRING

02:30.384 --> 02:31.818
THEMSELVES OUT, IS GOING TO

02:31.818 --> 02:33.253
HAPPEN IN TALKS IN CAIRO.

02:33.253 --> 02:34.955
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.423
HAS THE INTENSITY ON THE GROUND,

02:36.423 --> 02:38.091
OR THE ISRAELI RESPONSE CHANGED

02:38.091 --> 02:41.261
AFTER THIS MISSING SOLDIER?

02:41.261 --> 02:43.363
>> YES, SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE

02:43.363 --> 02:45.132
SOUTHERN BORDER TOWN OF RAFAH,

02:45.132 --> 02:46.767
WHICH IS WHERE THE TUNNEL WAS,

02:46.767 --> 02:48.368
THERE HAS BEEN A VERY AGGRESSIVE

02:48.368 --> 02:49.803
ASSAULT, MAYBE THE MOST

02:49.803 --> 02:51.104
AGGRESSIVE OF THE WHOLE

02:51.104 --> 02:52.539
CAMPAIGN.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.274
MY COLLEAGUE WAS ON THE GROUND

02:54.274 --> 02:55.842
TODAY IN THE WESTERN SIDE OF

02:55.842 --> 02:57.377
TOWN, WHICH IS THE KIND OF

02:57.377 --> 02:59.513
OPPOSITE SIDE OF TOWN FROM WHERE

02:59.513 --> 03:01.248
THE ACTION WAS, ALL SORTS OF

03:01.248 --> 03:03.717
PEOPLE HAVE EVACUATED THERE.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.685
THE HOSPITAL IN THE EAST SIDE OF

03:05.685 --> 03:07.454
TOWN HAD BEEN HIT, THERE WAS NO

03:07.454 --> 03:09.089
HOSPITAL FUNCTIONING IN RAFAH,

03:09.089 --> 03:10.690
PEOPLE WERE GETTING TREATED AT

03:10.690 --> 03:12.325
CLINICS, HE SAID THERE WERE A

03:12.325 --> 03:13.527
LOT OF BODIES THAT WERE BEING

03:13.527 --> 03:14.828
PRESERVED IN, LIKE, KITCHEN TYPE

03:14.828 --> 03:16.563
FREEZERS, BECAUSE THERE WAS NO

03:16.563 --> 03:17.998
ROOM IN ANY MORGUE.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.366
HE SAID IT WAS A VERY DESPERATE

03:19.366 --> 03:21.334
SITUATION THERE, AND THAT THEY

03:21.334 --> 03:23.336
HAVE BEEN UNDER INTENSE AIR AND

03:23.336 --> 03:25.038
ARTILLERY SHELLING OVERNIGHT AND

03:25.038 --> 03:27.074
I THINK IN THROUGH SOME OF

03:27.074 --> 03:28.775
TODAY, I THINK QUIETER DURING

03:28.775 --> 03:30.710
THE DAYLIGHT.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.079
IN OTHER PARTS OF GAZA, THE

03:32.079 --> 03:32.946
OPERATIONS SEEMED TO HAVE COOLED

03:32.946 --> 03:34.481
DOWN SOME.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.316
THE MILITARY INFORMED RESIDENTS

03:36.316 --> 03:37.617
OF THE NORTHERN TOWN OF, BEIT

03:37.617 --> 03:38.852
LAHIYA, THEY COULD GO BACK TO

03:38.852 --> 03:39.386
THEIR HOMES AND IT WOULD BE

03:39.386 --> 03:40.587
SAFE.

03:40.587 --> 03:41.655
SO THEY MAY BE DONE OPERATING

03:41.655 --> 03:42.856
IN THE NORTH, SO IT IS NOT AN

03:42.856 --> 03:44.758
OVERALL PICTURE INCREASE.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.326
>> Sreenivasan: THERE SEEMS TO

03:46.326 --> 03:47.627
BE SOME BACK AND FORTH ON WHO

03:47.627 --> 03:49.563
HAS BEEN KILLED, ISRAEL CAME OUT

03:49.563 --> 03:51.865
TODAY AND SAID 47% OF THOSE

03:51.865 --> 03:53.733
KILLED IN GAZA MAY BE TERRORISTS

03:53.733 --> 03:56.169
OR WOULD BE TERRORISTS, GAZANS

03:56.169 --> 03:57.904
HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP SAY 80% OF

03:57.904 --> 03:59.239
THOSE KILLED ARE CIVILIANS.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.941
>> YES.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.409
I THINK IT IS NOT DEFINITIVE AND

04:02.409 --> 04:04.077
CERTAINLY IT IS HARD TO TELL IN

04:04.077 --> 04:05.779
THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.481
I AM NOT SURE WE WILL EVER KNOW

04:07.481 --> 04:09.516
FOR SURE PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE

04:09.516 --> 04:11.051
DEFINITION OF WHAT A MILITANT IS

04:11.051 --> 04:12.986
IN GAZA IS A LITTLE BIT FLUID,

04:12.986 --> 04:14.855
IT IS NOT LIKE YOU ENLIST AND IN

04:14.855 --> 04:16.223
THE MILITARY AND GET A UNIFORM

04:16.223 --> 04:17.491
AND A BADGE NUMBER.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.025
THEY DO HAVE, YOU KNOW, MILITARY

04:19.025 --> 04:20.360
TRAINING AND UNIFORMS AND RANKS

04:20.360 --> 04:22.762
AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT A LOT

04:22.762 --> 04:24.264
OF PEOPLE WHO THE ISRAELIS MAY

04:24.264 --> 04:25.799
CONSIDER PART OF THE MILITIA AND

04:25.799 --> 04:27.667
THE PALESTINIANS MIGHT NOT.

04:27.667 --> 04:28.969
SO I THINK THESE ARE IMPERFECT

04:28.969 --> 04:29.736
ANALOGIES AT BEST.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.004
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.506
JODI RUDOREN OF "THE NEW YORK

04:32.506 --> 04:33.507
TIMES" JOINING US VIA SKYPE IN

JERUSALEM.

04:34.107 --> 04:34.407

04:34.407 --> 04:36.243
>> THANK YOU.

04:36.243 --> 04:37.544

04:37.544 --> 04:38.879
TONIGHT, A PLEA FOR HELP TO THE

04:38.879 --> 04:39.813
U.S. GOVERNMENT FROM TWO

04:39.813 --> 04:40.580
AMERICAN TOURISTS BEING HELD

04:40.580 --> 04:41.781
THERE.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.383
56-YEAR-OLD JEFFREY EDWARD FOWLE

04:43.383 --> 04:44.918
AND 24-YEAR-OLD MATTHEW TODD

04:44.918 --> 04:46.620
MILLER TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

04:46.620 --> 04:48.388
THEY ARE BEING WELL-TREATED BUT

04:48.388 --> 04:49.756
EXPECT TO BE PUT ON TRIAL SOON

04:49.756 --> 04:52.192
FOR "ANTI-STATE CRIMES."

04:52.192 --> 04:53.426
FOWLE IS SUSPECTED OF LEAVING A

04:53.426 --> 04:55.862
BIBLE IN A NIGHTCLUB.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.130
A THIRD AMERICAN, KENNETH BAY,

04:57.130 --> 04:57.964
HAS BEEN HELD THERE FOR NEARLY

04:57.964 --> 04:59.432
21 MONTHS.

04:59.432 --> 05:00.867
BACK IN THIS COUNTRY, KENT

05:00.867 --> 05:02.369
BRANTLY, A 33-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN

05:02.369 --> 05:04.004
DOCTOR WHO CONTRACTED EBOLA

05:04.004 --> 05:05.605
AFTER GOING TO WEST AFRICA TO

05:05.605 --> 05:07.541
TREAT IT, WAS FLOWN TO A

05:07.541 --> 05:08.975
MILITARY BASE NEAR ATLANTA TODAY

05:08.975 --> 05:10.076
ON A SPECIALLY EQUIPPED

05:10.076 --> 05:11.845
CHARTERED AIRPLANE.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.246
HE WAS THEN TRANSPORTED BY

05:13.246 --> 05:14.014
AMBULANCE TO EMORY UNIVERSITY

05:14.014 --> 05:15.448
HOSPITAL.

05:15.448 --> 05:16.983
HE NEEDED ASSISTANCE BUT WAS

05:16.983 --> 05:18.885
ABLE TO WALK OUT OF THE VEHICLE.

05:18.885 --> 05:19.419
BRANTLEY WILL BE TREATED IN AN

05:19.419 --> 05:21.488
ISOLATION WARD.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.256
THE HEAD OF THE ISOLATION UNIT

05:23.256 --> 05:24.558
THERE SAID-- QUOTING NOW-- "NO

05:24.558 --> 05:26.760
ONE IS IN ANY WAY AT RISK."

05:26.760 --> 05:28.261
ITâ€™S THE FIRST TIME ANYONE

05:28.261 --> 05:29.629
INFECTED WITH EBOLA HAS BEEN

05:29.629 --> 05:31.331
BROUGHT TO THE UNITED STATES.

05:31.331 --> 05:31.765
THE OUTBREAK IN AFRICA HAS

05:31.765 --> 05:33.867
KILLED MORE THAN 700 PEOPLE.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.435
THE FATE OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

05:35.435 --> 05:37.204
PEOPLE, MANY OF THEM CHILDREN,

05:37.204 --> 05:38.471
WHO ENTERED THE UNITED STATES

05:38.471 --> 05:39.306
ILLEGALLY, REMAINS UNRESOLVED

05:39.306 --> 05:41.208
TONIGHT.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.776
BEFORE ADJOURNING LATE LAST

05:42.776 --> 05:44.511
NIGHT, THE REPUBLICAN-LED HOUSE

05:44.511 --> 05:46.079
OF REPRESENTATIVES PASSED A

05:46.079 --> 05:46.947
MEASURE THAT WOULD SPEED

05:46.947 --> 05:48.315
DEPORTATIONS.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.482
BUT THE DEMOCRAT-LED SENATE DID

05:49.482 --> 05:50.617
NOT TAKE UP THE BILL BEFORE

05:50.617 --> 05:51.885
LEAVING FOR THE SUMMER RECESS

05:51.885 --> 05:53.153
AND THE HOUSE MEASURE HAS LITTLE

05:53.153 --> 05:54.588
CHANCE OF SUCCESS THERE.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.689
WHAT COMES NEXT?

05:55.689 --> 05:57.057
FOR MORE, WE ARE JOINED TONIGHT

05:57.057 --> 05:57.891
FROM WASHINGTON BY CHRISTINA

05:57.891 --> 05:59.259
BELLANTONI.

05:59.259 --> 05:59.960
SHE IS THE EDITOR IN CHIEF AT

05:59.960 --> 06:00.760
"ROLL CALL."

06:00.760 --> 06:01.795
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

06:01.795 --> 06:03.163
FOR THE NEXT FIVE WEEKS, AS

06:03.163 --> 06:04.431
CONGRESS IS IN RECESS, DO ALL OF

06:04.431 --> 06:05.332
THESE PEOPLE IN THE DETENTION

06:05.332 --> 06:09.102
CENTERS NOW JUST STAY THERE?

06:09.102 --> 06:10.704
>> NO, THERE IS NOT A LIMBO.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.305
THE PRESIDENT HAD A NEWS

06:12.305 --> 06:13.873
CONFERENCE YESTERDAY WHERE HE

06:13.873 --> 06:15.308
SAID HE WOULD BE FORCED TO TAKE

06:15.308 --> 06:16.243
MATTERS INTO HIS OWN HANDS EVEN

06:16.243 --> 06:17.577
THOUGH CONGRESS HAS BEEN

06:17.577 --> 06:18.612
CRITICAL OF HIM DOING SO ON

06:18.612 --> 06:19.479
OTHER MATTERS, INCLUDING

06:19.479 --> 06:21.081
IMMIGRATION.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.716
SO THE WHITE HOUSE TOLD ME THIS

06:22.716 --> 06:24.484
MORNING AND THE ADMINISTRATION

06:24.484 --> 06:27.020
OFFICIAL SAID THEY ARE GOING TO

06:27.020 --> 06:27.954
TAKE $405 MILLION, THAT IS MUCH,

06:27.954 --> 06:29.656
MUCH LESS THAN THE HOUSE

06:29.656 --> 06:31.091
APPROVED AND LESS THAN THE

06:31.091 --> 06:32.125
PRESIDENT HAD INITIALLY ASKED

06:32.125 --> 06:33.827
FOR.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.328
AND THEY WANTED TO TRANSFER THAT

06:35.328 --> 06:37.030
DOWN TO HELP EASE EITHER

06:37.030 --> 06:38.798
DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS OR HAVE

06:38.798 --> 06:41.001
FACILITIES DOWN AT THE BORDER

06:41.001 --> 06:42.736
FOR HOUSING THESE CHILD MIGRANTS

06:42.736 --> 06:44.938
OR WAYS THEY CAN SPEED UP SOME

06:44.938 --> 06:46.506
OF THE PROCESSES THEY ARE MAKING

06:46.506 --> 06:48.174
A LITTLE MORE SMOOTHLY, BUT THAT

06:48.174 --> 06:49.509
MONEY IS COMING FROM OTHER

06:49.509 --> 06:51.311
PLACES, THEY ARE TAKING THE

06:51.311 --> 06:53.046
MAJORITY OF IT, $270 MILLION

06:53.046 --> 06:54.514
FROM FEDERAL EMERGENCY

06:54.514 --> 06:56.316
MANAGEMENT FUNDS THAT WOULD DEAL

06:56.316 --> 06:57.417
WITH ANY SORT OF DISASTER

06:57.417 --> 06:58.785
RELIEF.

06:58.785 --> 07:00.720
AND YOU MAY RECALL THAT WHEN THE

07:00.720 --> 07:02.289
PRESIDENT FIRST ASKED CONGRESS

07:02.289 --> 07:04.190
FOR THIS EMERGENCY SPENDING,

07:04.190 --> 07:05.959
MORE THAN A MONTH AGO, HE

07:05.959 --> 07:07.827
ACTUALLY INCLUDED A LOT OF MONEY

07:07.827 --> 07:09.796
FOR WILDFIRE RELIEF AND SO IN

07:09.796 --> 07:11.064
ADDITION TO NOT HAVING THAT

07:11.064 --> 07:12.232
FUNDING PUT IN PLACE, THEY ARE

07:12.232 --> 07:13.767
TAKING MONEY FROM OTHER

07:13.767 --> 07:14.901
DISASTERS.

07:14.901 --> 07:16.336
>> Sreenivasan: SO THIS BECOMES

07:16.336 --> 07:17.604
A SOURCE OF CONTENTION FOR

07:17.604 --> 07:18.538
STATES THAT MIGHT BE SAY, FOR

07:18.538 --> 07:20.307
EXAMPLE, IN HURRICANE ALLEY,

07:20.307 --> 07:22.275
SAYING SOME OF OUR FUNDS ARE

07:22.275 --> 07:23.877
DIVERTED TO THE BORDER STATES IN

07:23.877 --> 07:25.345
THE SOUTH.

07:25.345 --> 07:26.579
>> SURE, OR TORNADOES, OR

07:26.579 --> 07:27.447
DROUGHT, WHICH IS A BIG ISSUE IN

07:27.447 --> 07:28.915
TEXAS.

07:28.915 --> 07:31.117
SO IT ALLOWS FOR SOME MONEY TO

07:31.117 --> 07:32.719
GO DOWN TO HELP TEXAS NATIONAL

07:32.719 --> 07:33.787
GUARD TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE

07:33.787 --> 07:35.422
ISSUES.

07:35.422 --> 07:37.123
IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT

07:37.123 --> 07:38.325
OUT THAT SOME OF THE NUMBERS

07:38.325 --> 07:39.559
THAT WE ARE SEEING COMING ACROSS

07:39.559 --> 07:41.061
THE BORDER, WE GET A LITTLE BIT

07:41.061 --> 07:40.960
OF A DELAY IN THAT REPORTING AND

07:40.960 --> 07:42.195
THE CROSSING BY CHILD MIGRANTS

07:42.195 --> 07:43.330
IN ACTUALLY DOWN, BECUASE IT

07:43.330 --> 07:44.331
IS THAT HOT SUMMER MONTHS, SO

07:44.331 --> 07:45.365
WE ARE SEEING FEWER AND FEWER

07:45.365 --> 07:46.466
COMING ACROSS THE BOARDER, THE

07:46.466 --> 07:47.567
NUMBERS ARE STILL FAR UP FROM

07:47.567 --> 07:48.601
PREVIOUS YEARS, BUT THEY ARE

07:48.601 --> 07:50.470
DOWN OVER RECENT MONTHS.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.705
BUT THAT DOESNâ€™T MEAN THE

07:51.705 --> 07:53.406
PROBLEM IS GOING TO GO AWAY AND

07:53.406 --> 07:54.874
WHEN THE CONGRESS COMES BACK IN

07:54.874 --> 07:56.242
SEPTEMBER, THE SENATE PROBABLY

07:56.242 --> 07:57.944
WILL EASILY DISPATCH THE HOUSEâ€™S

07:57.944 --> 07:59.446
BILL, WE DONâ€™T KNOW FOR SURE HOW

07:59.446 --> 08:00.647
THAT WILL PLAY OUT, THEY MAY

08:00.647 --> 08:02.549
COME UP WITH SOME COMPROMISE

08:02.549 --> 08:03.750
MIDDLE GROUND, AND THE PRESIDENT

08:03.750 --> 08:05.418
WILL ALREADY HAVE TRANSFERRED

08:05.418 --> 08:07.087
THAT MONEY SO THEY COULD END UP

08:07.087 --> 08:08.755
FUNDING IT CLOSER TO THE LEVEL

08:08.755 --> 08:05.418
THAN HE INITIALLY

08:05.418 --> 08:12.692
ASKED FOR.

08:12.692 --> 08:13.960
>> Sreenivasan: AND HOW MUCH OF

08:13.960 --> 08:15.195
THIS PLAYS INTO THE REELECTION

08:15.195 --> 08:16.629
CAMPAIGNS OF SOME OF THESE

08:16.629 --> 08:17.764
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THAT ARE

08:17.764 --> 08:18.965
HEADING BACK, JUST TO GET THIS

08:18.965 --> 08:20.300
PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION

08:20.300 --> 08:21.501
THROUGH WHERE IT IS NOW?

08:21.501 --> 08:22.635
>> THAT IS A CENTRAL QUESTION

08:22.635 --> 08:23.803
THAT OUR JOURNALIST AT ROLL CALL

08:23.803 --> 08:25.405
ARE LOOKING INTO.

08:25.405 --> 08:26.740
AND TALKING TO MEMBERS BACK HOME

08:26.740 --> 08:27.974
IN THEIR DISTRICT, WHAT ARE THEY

08:27.974 --> 08:28.808
HEARING FROM THEIR CONSTITUENTS?

08:28.808 --> 08:29.309
ARE THEY PAYING ATTENTION TO

08:29.309 --> 08:29.876
THIS ISSUE?

08:29.876 --> 08:30.977
DO THEY CARE?

08:30.977 --> 08:32.846
MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE A LOT OF

08:32.846 --> 08:34.080
FOREIGN POLICY CRISES THAT ARE

08:34.080 --> 08:35.648
ALSO GENERATING A LOT OF

08:35.648 --> 08:36.883
ATTENTION AND CONCERN AMONG

08:36.883 --> 08:38.118
AMERICANS, IT IS LESS THAN 100

08:38.118 --> 08:39.986
DAYS FROM THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.354
BUT THE OTHER ELEMENT THAT IS

08:41.354 --> 08:42.956
PLAYING OUT HERE IS, IMMIGRATION

08:42.956 --> 08:45.325
ADVOCATES ARE REALLY STEPPING UP

08:45.325 --> 08:47.360
PRESSURE ON THE WHITE HOUSE,

08:47.360 --> 08:49.496
URGING THEM TO TAKE EVEN BROADER

08:49.496 --> 08:51.297
ACTION WHEN IT COMES TO DEFERRED

08:51.297 --> 08:53.233
ACTION FOR SO-CALLED DREAMERS,

08:53.233 --> 08:55.268
AND SO THE PRESIDENT HAS HELPED

08:55.268 --> 08:56.970
THE MEETINGS, THESE IMMIGRATION

08:56.970 --> 08:58.405
ADVOCATES HAVE SAID IT SOUNDS AS

08:58.405 --> 08:59.839
THOUGH HE MAY BE WILLING TO

08:59.839 --> 09:01.174
EXPAND WHAT HE DID IN 2012

09:01.174 --> 09:02.642
THROUGH EXECUTIVE ACTION.

09:02.642 --> 09:03.977
SO THOSE ISSUES ARE PLAYING OUT

09:03.977 --> 09:05.512
AT THE EXACT SAME TIME.

09:05.512 --> 09:06.946
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT.

09:06.946 --> 09:07.580
CHRISTINA BELLANTONI, JOINING US

09:07.580 --> 09:08.148
FROM ROLL CALL, THANK YOU SO

09:08.148 --> 09:08.782
MUCH.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.450
>> THANK YOU.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.551
>> Sreenivasan: AN ESTIMATED

09:11.551 --> 09:13.253
400,000 PEOPLE IN AND AROUND

09:13.253 --> 09:14.754
TOLEDO, OHIO, ARE HAVING TO RELY

09:14.754 --> 09:16.156
ON BOTTLED WATER AFTER TOXINS--

09:16.156 --> 09:17.424
POSSIBLY FROM ALGAE ON LAKE

09:17.424 --> 09:18.024
ERIE-- POLLUTED THE CITYâ€™S WATER

09:18.024 --> 09:20.560
SUPPLY.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.594
OFFICIALS SAID BOILING THE WATER

09:21.594 --> 09:22.262
MIGHT ONLY MAKE THE PROBLEM

09:22.262 --> 09:23.696
WORSE.

09:23.696 --> 09:25.165
GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH DECLARED A

09:25.165 --> 09:26.699
STATE EMERGENCY AND SAID WATER

09:26.699 --> 09:27.801
IS BEING SHIPPED TO TOLEDO FROM

09:27.801 --> 09:29.202
OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.104
CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON

09:31.104 --> 09:32.772
OFFICIALS HAVE ISSUED NEW

09:32.772 --> 09:34.407
POLICIES LIMITING THE USE OF

09:34.407 --> 09:36.042
FORCE ON MENTALLY ILL PRISONERS.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.444
THIS AFTER GRAPHIC IMAGES

09:37.444 --> 09:38.978
EMERGED OF INMATES, SOME

09:38.978 --> 09:40.613
DESCRIBED AS SCREAMING AND

09:40.613 --> 09:41.714
DELIRIOUS, BEING PEPPER SPRAYED

09:41.714 --> 09:43.316
IN THEIR CELLS.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.717
IN ONE INSTANCE, A MENTALLY ILL

09:44.717 --> 09:45.852
INMATE WAS FOUND DEAD IN HIS

09:45.852 --> 09:46.853
CELL LAST YEAR AFTER BEING

09:46.853 --> 09:48.588
PEPPER SPRAYED.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.923
THE STATE ESTIMATES THAT 33,000

09:49.923 --> 09:50.790
PRISONERS THERE ARE MENTALLY

09:50.790 --> 09:52.125
ILL.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.493
HERE IN NEW YORK CITY,

09:53.493 --> 09:54.861
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER SAID A 43-

09:54.861 --> 09:56.296
YEAR-OLD MAN WHO APPEARED TO

09:56.296 --> 09:57.330
HAVE BEEN PLACED IN A CHOKEHOLD

09:57.330 --> 09:58.331
BY POLICE WAS THE VICTIM OF A

09:58.331 --> 09:59.599
HOMICIDE.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.800
THE OFFICERS HAD ARRESTED ERIC

10:00.800 --> 10:02.335
GARNER FOR ALLEGEDLY SELLING

10:02.335 --> 10:03.503
BOOTLEG CIGARETTES ON THE

10:03.503 --> 10:04.804
STREET.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.139
AN AUTOPSY FOUND THAT GARNERâ€™S

10:06.139 --> 10:07.407
POOR OVERALL HEALTH CONTRIBUTED

10:07.407 --> 10:08.741
TO HIS DEATH BUT WAS NOT THE

10:08.741 --> 10:10.043
PRIMARY CAUSE.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.344
THE OFFICER INVOLVED WAS

10:11.344 --> 10:12.745
STRIPPED OF HIS GUN AND TAKEN

10:12.745 --> 10:14.113
OFF OF STREET DUTY BUT HAS NOT

10:14.113 --> 10:27.594
BEEN CRIMINALLY CHARGED.

10:27.594 --> 10:28.361
>> Sreenivasan: IN THE COMING

10:28.361 --> 10:30.096
DAYS, THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE

10:30.096 --> 10:31.531
COMMITTEE WILL RELEASE A

10:31.531 --> 10:33.066
DECLASSIFIED VERSION OF A 6,000-

10:33.066 --> 10:34.601
PAGE REPORT EXAMINING THE

10:34.601 --> 10:36.402
C.I.A.â€™S RENDITION, DETENTION

10:36.402 --> 10:38.271
AND INTERROGATION PROGRAM.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.973
YESTERDAY, ANTICIPATING THE

10:39.973 --> 10:41.474
REPORT, THE PRESIDENT SAID,

10:41.474 --> 10:42.575
QUOTING NOW: "WE TORTURED SOME

10:42.575 --> 10:43.710
FOLKS.

10:43.710 --> 10:44.944
WE DID SOME THINGS THAT WERE

10:44.944 --> 10:46.412
CONTRARY TO OUR VALUES."

10:46.412 --> 10:47.747
FOR MORE, WE ARE JOINED TONIGHT

10:47.747 --> 10:48.615
FROM WASHINGTON BY SIOBHAN

10:48.615 --> 10:49.949
GORMAN.

10:49.949 --> 10:50.884
SHE IS THE INTELLIGENCE

10:50.884 --> 10:51.417
CORRESPONDENT FOR THE "WALL

10:51.417 --> 10:52.385
STREET JOURNAL."

10:52.385 --> 10:53.620
SO WHAT IS LIKELY TO BE IN

10:53.620 --> 10:54.721
THIS REPORT THAT THE PRESIDENT

10:54.721 --> 10:55.221
IS TRYING TO PREPARE COUNTRY

10:55.221 --> 10:56.856
FOR?

10:56.856 --> 10:58.892
>> WELL, WE HAVE REPORTED ON THE

10:58.892 --> 11:00.960
BROAD OUTLINES OF IT OVER THE

11:00.960 --> 11:03.696
PAST FEW MONTHS, AND IT SOUNDS

11:03.696 --> 11:09.802
LIKE IT IS GOING TO BE CERTAINLY

11:09.802 --> 11:11.337
HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE C.I.A.â€™S

11:11.337 --> 11:12.539
EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAM, AND,

11:12.539 --> 11:13.873
WELL, AMONG OTHER THINGS SAY

11:13.873 --> 11:15.141
THAT THE AGENCY MISLED BOTH THE

11:15.141 --> 11:16.342
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND CONGRESS

11:16.342 --> 11:17.644
AND I GUESS BY EXTENSION THE

11:17.644 --> 11:18.978
PUBLIC ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS

11:18.978 --> 11:21.548
OF THE PROGRAM.

11:21.548 --> 11:22.749
>> Sreenivasan: SO CONSIDERING

11:22.749 --> 11:24.250
THAT EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE

11:24.250 --> 11:25.418
COMPILED INTO THIS ONE LARGE

11:25.418 --> 11:26.653
REPORT, IS IT LIKELY TO

11:26.653 --> 11:28.154
HIGHLIGHT THE MISMANAGEMENT OF

11:28.154 --> 11:29.289
THE AGENCY THAT LED TO ALL OF

11:29.289 --> 11:30.423
THESE PROBLEMS?

11:30.423 --> 11:31.457
>> I THINK WE WILL SEE THAT AS

11:31.457 --> 11:32.258
ONE OF THE KEY FINDINGS OF THIS

11:32.258 --> 11:33.192
REPORT.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.427
WE ARE TOLD THAT THE C.I.A.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.562
COUNTER-TERRORISM CENTERS

11:35.562 --> 11:37.597
MANAGEMENT OF THE PROGRAM WAS AT

11:37.597 --> 11:39.899
TIMES REALLY INCORRECT AND

11:39.899 --> 11:42.835
INAPPROPRIATE, AND THAT IS

11:42.835 --> 11:45.538
SOMETHING THAT LAW MAKERS HAVE

11:45.538 --> 11:47.173
SAID IS AN ISSUE THAT STILL

11:47.173 --> 11:48.975
NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT THE C.I.A.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.443
SO THAT MAY PRODUCE SORT OF

11:50.443 --> 11:51.611
FOLLOW-UP PROPOSALS FOR REFORM.

11:51.611 --> 11:52.946
>> Sreenivasan: ANY OTHER IDEA

11:52.946 --> 11:53.713
OF ANY OF THE OTHER KEY FINDINGS

11:53.713 --> 11:55.915
IN HERE?

11:55.915 --> 12:02.689
>> WELL, I THINK THAT ONE OF THE

12:02.689 --> 12:04.824
BIG TAKE AWAYS, AT LEAST AS I

12:04.824 --> 12:06.693
HAVE SPOKEN WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE

12:06.693 --> 12:07.794
READ THE REPORT IS, THAT PEOPLE

12:07.794 --> 12:08.728
MAY NOT APPRECIATE HOW THESE

12:08.728 --> 12:09.762
TECHNIQUES WERE USED IN

12:09.762 --> 12:10.830
CONJUNCTION WITH EACH OTHER.

12:10.830 --> 12:11.931
IT IS ONE THING TO THINK THE

12:11.931 --> 12:12.899
DETAINEES WERE BEING DEPRIVED OF

12:12.899 --> 12:14.133
SLEEP, BEING EXPOSED TO LOUD

12:14.133 --> 12:15.702
MUSIC, BEING THROWN AGAINST

12:15.702 --> 12:17.270
WALLS, A WHOLE ASSORTMENT OF

12:17.270 --> 12:18.571
THINGS IN ADDITION TO FOR A FEW

12:18.571 --> 12:20.006
OF DETAINEES ALSO WATER

12:20.006 --> 12:21.975
BOARDING, BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT

12:21.975 --> 12:23.776
A LOT OF THOSE BEING USED SORT

12:23.776 --> 12:25.011
OF BACK-TO-BACK OVER AN EXTENDED

12:25.011 --> 12:26.479
PERIOD OF TIME, THE IMPACT IS

12:26.479 --> 12:28.114
SOMEWHAT MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN

12:28.114 --> 12:29.682
WHAT PEOPLE MAY HAVE ALREADY

12:29.682 --> 12:31.584
THOUGHT.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.986
>> Sreenivasan: SO HOW MANY

12:32.986 --> 12:34.187
PEOPLE HAVE ENDURED SOME OF

12:34.187 --> 12:35.488
THESE DIFFERENT PRACTICES BY THE

12:35.488 --> 12:36.723
C.I.A.?

12:36.723 --> 12:38.091
>> WELL, MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT

12:38.091 --> 12:39.492
IT IS SOMEWHERE AROUND 100 OR

12:39.492 --> 12:42.195
SOMETHING LESS THAN THAT.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.596
>> Sreenivasan: AND HOW THIS

12:43.596 --> 12:45.231
REPORT WAS GENERATED ALSO MADE

12:45.231 --> 12:46.866
NEWS IN WEEK WITH THE

12:46.866 --> 12:48.534
REVELATIONS THAT C.I.A. WAS

12:48.534 --> 12:49.736
SPYING ON SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF

12:49.736 --> 12:50.770
THE SENATE COMMITTEE WHO WERE

12:50.770 --> 12:51.504
INVESTIGATING THIS REPORT.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.373
>> YES.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.642
IT WAS, SORT OF, A FINAL STAGES

12:55.642 --> 12:57.644
OF REVIEWING THE REPORT AND SORT

12:57.644 --> 12:59.746
OF THE C.I.A.â€™S RESPONSE TO IT,

12:59.746 --> 13:02.615
THE C.I.A., I GUESS, CAME TO

13:02.615 --> 13:05.318
SUSPECT THAT THE SENATE MAY HAVE

13:05.318 --> 13:07.453
INAPPROPRIATELY OBTAINED AN

13:07.453 --> 13:09.656
INTERNAL DOCUMENT AND THE C.I.A.

13:09.656 --> 13:13.059
TOOK IT UPON ITSELF TO TRY TO

13:13.059 --> 13:15.361
FIGURE OUT BY MONITORING SENATE

13:15.361 --> 13:18.765
NETWORKS WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAD

13:18.765 --> 13:20.633
BEEN, YOU KNOW, WHETHER OR NOT

13:20.633 --> 13:22.402
THERE WAS NETWORK VULNERABILITY

13:22.402 --> 13:24.103
OR WHETHER THE DOCUMENT HAD BEEN

13:24.103 --> 13:25.538
STOLEN FROM THE C.I.A., AND WHEN

13:25.538 --> 13:27.173
THE C.I.A. DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN

13:28.841 --> 13:30.376

13:30.376 --> 13:32.412

A HUGE KIND OF AN INTERNAL

13:34.714 --> 13:36.749
FIRESTORM WITHIN THE COMMITTEE

13:36.749 --> 13:38.551

13:41.154 --> 13:42.955
AND THE OTHER DAY, THE INSPECTOR

13:44.824 --> 13:46.359
WEIGHED IN WITH HIS SORT OF

13:46.359 --> 13:47.960
VERDICT ON IT, AND HE FOUND THAT

13:47.960 --> 13:49.796
INDEED THE C.I.A. HAD

13:49.796 --> 13:51.264
INAPPROPRIATELY MONITORED SENATE

COMFORTABLE BEING YOUR TRUE,

14:37.043 --> 14:39.412
AUTHENTIC SELF."

14:39.412 --> 14:41.347

OFFER THEIR CITIZENS A THIRD BOX

14:42.682 --> 14:44.083
TO CHECK ON THEIR PASSPORTS

14:50.656 --> 14:51.891
DONâ€™T WANT TO HAVE TO FIT INTO

14:51.891 --> 14:53.726
ANY BOX AT ALL.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.328
AND NOW, THE FASHION INDUSTRY IS

14:55.328 --> 14:56.696
RESPONDING TO THEM IN A WAY

14:56.696 --> 14:58.331
THATâ€™S NEVER OCCURRED BEFORE.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.336
>> MY GENDER IDENTITY IS REALLY

15:03.336 --> 15:05.037
BASED IN BOTH MY EXPERIENCES AS

15:05.037 --> 15:06.773
A WOMAN, AND ALSO ITâ€™S JUST

15:06.773 --> 15:08.040
DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE FACT THAT

15:08.040 --> 15:11.344
Iâ€™M MASCULINE.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.513
>> Reporter: RACHEL TUTERA SAYS

15:13.513 --> 15:15.114
IT WASNâ€™T UNTIL SHE STARTED

15:15.114 --> 15:16.549
WEARING BOYâ€™S CLOTHES AS A PRE-

15:16.549 --> 15:17.483
TEEN, THAT SHE STARTED TO FEEL

15:17.483 --> 15:18.317
LIKE THE MOST AUTHENTIC VERSION

15:18.317 --> 15:20.453
OF HERSELF.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.754
YET, THE 29-YEAR-OLD SAYS

15:21.754 --> 15:23.189
SHOPPING FOR CLOTHES IN THE

15:23.189 --> 15:24.490
MENâ€™S DEPARTMENT LEFT HER

15:24.490 --> 15:25.992
FEELING INSECURE AND SELF-

15:25.992 --> 15:27.026
CONSCIOUS.

15:27.026 --> 15:28.461
NOTHING EVER FIT HER

15:28.461 --> 15:29.996
PROPORTIONS.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.664
SO SHE WAS RESIGNED TO THINKING

15:31.664 --> 15:34.133
THATâ€™S JUST THE WAY IT WAS.

15:34.133 --> 15:34.967
>> I GOT USED TO WEARING CLOTHES

15:34.967 --> 15:36.169
THAT HID ME.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.770
I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST END UP

15:37.770 --> 15:39.305
BEING SOMEONE WHO WOULD PREFER

15:39.305 --> 15:41.007
TO BE OVERLOOKED, OR NOT WORTH

15:41.007 --> 15:42.708
SORT OF A SECOND GLANCE.

15:42.708 --> 15:43.376
>> TYPICALLY, YOU SHOW A LITTLE

15:43.376 --> 15:45.578
BIT OF CUFF.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.951
HER FIRST TAILORED MENâ€™S SUIT

15:51.951 --> 15:53.519
AND SHE SAYS THE WAY SHE FELT

15:53.519 --> 15:54.587
WHEN SHE TRIED IT ON CHANGED HER

15:54.587 --> 15:57.490
LIFE.

15:57.490 --> 15:58.858
>> HAVING SOMETHING CUSTOM-MADE

15:58.858 --> 16:00.726
FOR MY BODY, BASICALLY, RE-

16:00.726 --> 16:02.495
INTRODUCED ME TO MY BODY, AND I

16:02.495 --> 16:04.263
HAVE FELT, LIKE, INCREDIBLY

16:04.263 --> 16:05.798
VISIBLE IN A WAY THATâ€™S NOT JUST

16:05.798 --> 16:07.767
CAUSING PEOPLE TO TAKE A SECOND

16:07.767 --> 16:09.335
LOOK AT ME, BUT I THINK PEOPLE

16:09.335 --> 16:11.037
SEE ME IN A WAY THAT MAY

16:11.037 --> 16:12.138
ACTUALLY BE ALIGNED WITH HOW I

16:12.138 --> 16:13.673
SEE MYSELF.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.041
AND THAT HAS BEEN THE MOST,

16:15.041 --> 16:16.309
LIKE, POWERFUL, MIND-BLOWING

16:16.309 --> 16:17.643
THING.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.345

16:19.345 --> 16:20.479
TUTERA WANT TO PASS THAT FEELING

16:20.479 --> 16:22.281
ALONG TO OTHERS.

16:22.281 --> 16:24.217
SO SHE APPROACHED THE NEW YORK

16:26.853 --> 16:28.721

16:28.721 --> 16:29.922
CONVINCING THE OWNER THAT HE WAS

16:29.922 --> 16:30.489
OVERLOOKING AN UNDER-SERVED

16:30.489 --> 16:32.792
MARKET.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.493
NOT ONLY MASCULINE WOMEN, BUT

16:34.493 --> 16:36.729
ALSO TRANSGENDER MEN AND OTHER

16:36.729 --> 16:38.464
GENDER NON-CONFORMING PEOPLE WHO

16:38.464 --> 16:40.766
WANT WELL-FITTING MENâ€™S SUITS.

16:40.766 --> 16:43.369

16:51.177 --> 16:51.944
TO $1,500 FOR THEIR CUSTOM MADE

16:51.944 --> 16:52.879
SUIT.

16:52.879 --> 16:53.779

16:53.779 --> 16:54.847
IS BEING RECOGNIZED IN

16:54.847 --> 16:55.781
PROGRESSIVE CITIES.

16:55.781 --> 16:56.749

16:56.749 --> 16:57.416
EMOTIONAL FOR ANY OF YOUR

16:57.416 --> 16:58.351
CLIENTS?

16:58.351 --> 16:59.118
>> YES, IT HAS BEEN EMOTIONAL,

16:59.118 --> 17:00.753
FOR SURE.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.555
SHOPPING OR WEARING CLOTHES

17:02.555 --> 17:04.357
SEEMS LIKE A REALLY MUNDANE

17:04.357 --> 17:06.292
THING, BUT ACTUALLY ITâ€™S, LIKE,

17:06.292 --> 17:07.827
INCREDIBLY MEANINGFUL, AND

17:07.827 --> 17:09.028
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL, AND IT CAN

17:09.028 --> 17:10.196
REALLY, LIKE, MAKE OR BREAK AN

17:10.196 --> 17:11.497

17:11.497 --> 17:13.432

17:13.432 --> 17:14.934
WAYS TO BE GENDER NONCONFORMING.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.369
AND THEREâ€™S AN EXPLOSION OF NEW

17:16.369 --> 17:18.271
VOCABULARIES TO TALK ABOUT IT.

THEMSELVES AS HAVING BEEN BORN

17:29.081 --> 17:30.783
INTO THE WRONG BODY.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.018
BUT THEY MIGHT FIND THEMSELVES

17:32.018 --> 17:33.386
DEEPLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE

17:33.386 --> 17:34.487
KINDS OF STRAIGHTJACKETS OF

17:34.487 --> 17:35.955
GENDER.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.290
THE WAYS IN WHICH, YOU KNOW,

YOUâ€™RE SUPPOSED TO SORT OF

PRESENT, AGAIN, THIS VERY NARROW

17:40.459 --> 17:42.328
NOTION OF FEMININITY IF YOU HAVE

17:42.328 --> 17:43.396
A FEMALE BODY, A VERY NARROW

17:43.396 --> 17:44.430
NOTION OF MASCULINITY IF YOU

17:44.430 --> 17:46.799
HAVE A MALE BODY.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.834
>> Reporter: SHE SAYS RECENTLY

17:48.834 --> 17:50.269
THEREâ€™S BEEN AN EXPLOSION OF

17:50.269 --> 17:52.305
GENDER NON-CONFORMING PEOPLE IN

17:52.305 --> 17:53.339
MAINSTREAM MEDIA, CHALLENGING

17:53.339 --> 17:56.709
CONVENTIONAL GENDER ROLES.

17:56.709 --> 17:57.910

OPENLY TRANSGENDER PERSON HAS

18:01.914 --> 18:03.316
APPEARED ON THE COVER OF "TIME"

18:03.316 --> 18:04.250
MAGAZINE, WHY NOW DO YOU THINK,

18:04.250 --> 18:05.518
LAVERNE?

18:05.518 --> 18:06.719
>> BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET AND

18:06.719 --> 18:08.321
BECAUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA TRANS

18:08.321 --> 18:09.622
PEOPLE WE OUR VOICES NOW, AND WE

18:09.622 --> 18:10.957
ARE LETTING OUR VOICE BE HEARD.

>> I THINK THAT WE ARE BORN AND

18:12.391 --> 18:13.426
WEâ€™RE ASSIGNED A SEX AT BIRTH.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.560
THAT IS A MATTER NONE OF US HAVE

18:14.560 --> 18:15.561
CONTROL OVER, BUT WE DO HAVE

18:15.561 --> 18:16.662
CONTROL OVER OUR DESTINIES AND

18:16.662 --> 18:17.897
OVER OUR IDENTITIES AND WE

18:17.897 --> 18:19.532
SHOULD BE RESPECTED.

GROWING VISIBILITY OF GENDER-

18:24.236 --> 18:25.938
NON-CONFORMING PEOPLE AND THE

18:25.938 --> 18:27.974
LEGALIZATION OF SAME-SEX

18:27.974 --> 18:29.475
MARRIAGE IN 19 STATES, HAS

18:29.475 --> 18:31.077
FORCED THE FASHION WORLD TO

18:31.077 --> 18:32.278
ACKNOWLEDGE THE PRESENCE AND

18:32.278 --> 18:33.646
BUYING POWER OF THE L.G.B.T.Q.

18:33.646 --> 18:36.415

18:36.415 --> 18:37.917

18:37.917 --> 18:39.352
BE CAPITALISM.

18:39.352 --> 18:40.086
AT THE END OF THE DAY, ITâ€™S

18:40.086 --> 18:40.953
ABOUT SEEING THAT THEREâ€™S A

18:40.953 --> 18:42.221

18:42.221 --> 18:43.923

TEN YEARS BECAUSE THEY COULDNâ€™T

20:27.126 --> 20:28.961
CLOTHES THAT WOULD APPEAL TO

20:28.961 --> 20:30.629
MASCULINE WOMEN IF THEY DIDNâ€™T

20:30.629 --> 20:32.231
THINK THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO

20:32.231 --> 20:33.699
COULD WALK IN WITH A WALLET AND

20:33.699 --> 20:36.469
PULL OUT A CREDIT CARD.

20:36.469 --> 20:37.970
>> Reporter: THOUGH MAINSTREAM

TRIED DEPARTMENT STORES WHERE

20:50.616 --> 20:52.751
THE DRESSING ROOMS ARE TYPICALLY

20:52.751 --> 20:55.054
GENDERED, AND THAT IS A REALLY

20:55.054 --> 20:58.190
VIOLENT EXPERIENCE TO BE REMOVED

20:58.190 --> 21:00.493
FROM A DRESSING ROOM OR TO BE

21:00.493 --> 21:01.727
TOLD THAT YOU DONâ€™T BELONG THERE

21:01.727 --> 21:02.695

AT A STORE AND GOING INTO A

21:08.701 --> 21:10.603
FITTING ROOM?

21:10.603 --> 21:12.071
>> THEREâ€™S A WEIRD TENDENCY IN

TELL IF YOUâ€™RE A MAN OR A WOMAN,

21:20.613 --> 21:22.815
DISCRIMINATION AND JUDGMENT

21:22.815 --> 21:24.450
DIRECTED AT PEOPLE LIKE HER IS

21:24.450 --> 21:26.018
OFTEN INEVITABLE.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.820
THATâ€™S WHY TWO YEARS AGO SHE

21:27.820 --> 21:29.155
STARTED A FASHION BLOG CALLED

21:29.155 --> 21:31.457
"THE HANDSOME BUTCH."

21:31.457 --> 21:33.058
THE SITE HOPES TO EMPOWER

21:33.058 --> 21:34.093
READERS WITH A SIMPLE MESSAGE,

21:34.093 --> 21:35.194
WHICH IS THAT THEY TOO HAVE THE

21:35.194 --> 21:36.495
RIGHT TO BE HANDSOME.

21:36.495 --> 21:37.596
>> IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A

21:37.596 --> 21:39.098
MEDITATION I HAD FOR MYSELF WHEN

21:39.098 --> 21:41.233
I WAS FIRST SHOPPING.

21:41.233 --> 21:41.734
IT WAS, I HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE

21:41.734 --> 21:43.769
HERE.

21:43.769 --> 21:44.770
I THINK I JUST HAD TO SAY OVER

21:44.770 --> 21:46.238
AND OVER TO MYSELF, "YOU HAVE

21:46.238 --> 21:47.072
THE RIGHT TO BE HANDSOME.

21:47.072 --> 21:47.873
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE

21:47.873 --> 21:49.041
HANDSOME."

21:49.041 --> 21:50.209
UNTIL IT ACTUALLY FELT LIKE A

21:50.209 --> 21:51.410
RIGHT INSTEAD OF, LIKE, A

21:51.410 --> 21:52.378
MEDITATION I WAS TRYING TO

21:52.378 --> 21:53.946
CONVINCE MYSELF WAS TRUE.
