STORY ON FRIDAY AND JOINS ME NOW

04:25.366 --> 04:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM WASHINGTON TO DISCUSS IT.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, EXPLAIN, HOW IS THIS PROCESS

04:28.133 --> 04:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO WORK?

04:29.333 --> 04:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR IS

04:30.666 --> 04:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESSENTIALLY THAT ADMINISTRATOR

04:32.000 --> 04:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRUITT WANTS TO RECRUIT

04:33.500 --> 04:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCIENTISTS TO WORK ON THIS RED

04:35.966 --> 04:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEAM, BLUE TEAM TO SORT OF LOOK

04:39.066 --> 04:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT ANY POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY

04:41.366 --> 04:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR UNCERTAINTY IN CLIMATE CHANGE

04:44.066 --> 04:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORTS.

04:45.433 --> 04:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE RED TEAM WOULD DO THAT,

04:46.633 --> 04:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BLUE TEAM WOULD BE THE TEAM

04:47.700 --> 04:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRODUCING AND DEFENDING THE

04:48.833 --> 04:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:50.066 --> 04:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THIS KIND OF

04:51.133 --> 04:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLIES IN THE FACE OF

04:52.300 --> 04:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEER-REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC

04:54.433 --> 04:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOURNALS AND HOW THEY ACTUALLY

04:55.866 --> 04:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUT SCIENCE FORWARD.

04:57.566 --> 04:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT DOES, AND THAT'S

04:58.800 --> 05:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABSOLUTELY WHAT YOU'VE HEARD

05:00.600 --> 05:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IN

05:01.900 --> 05:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSE TO THIS, THEY'RE SAYING

05:03.266 --> 05:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS EXACTLY HOW SCIENCE IS

05:04.533 --> 05:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE, SO BEFORE WE PUBLISH

05:05.966 --> 05:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING ON CLIMATE CHANGE OR

05:07.200 --> 05:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY OTHER MATTER WE'VE HAD IT

05:08.433 --> 05:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REVIEWED BY OTHER SCIENTISTS WHO

05:10.500 --> 05:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE LOOKED TO SEE THAT WE'VE

05:11.666 --> 05:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONE EVERYTHING CORRECTLY AND

05:12.800 --> 05:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE'VE COME TO THE CORRECT

05:13.833 --> 05:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCLUSIONS.

05:15.366 --> 05:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT THE

05:16.733 --> 05:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACT THAT THE OVERWHELMING

05:18.400 --> 05:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAJORITY OF CLIMATE SCIENTISTS

05:20.433 --> 05:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY THAT THIS IS REALLY NOT UP

05:21.500 --> 05:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR DISPUTE?

05:23.133 --> 05:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IF YOU WANTED TO DO THIS RED

05:24.866 --> 05:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEAM BLUE TEAM, WOULD IT BE RED

05:26.433 --> 05:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEAM THREE AND BLUE TEAM 97?

05:28.600 --> 05:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT

05:30.000 --> 05:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THE SPECIFICS WOULD LOOK

05:31.833 --> 05:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE, IT'S SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE

05:33.566 --> 05:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO ARE DISSENTERS WHO DO NOT

05:35.000 --> 05:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGREE WITH THE VAST MAJORITY WHO

05:36.433 --> 05:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF CLIMATE SCIENTISTS WHO SAY

05:37.700 --> 05:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT CLIMATE CHANGES HAPPENING

05:39.433 --> 05:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HUMANS ARE A CAUSE, A MAIN

05:40.966 --> 05:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAUSE, AND THAT ACTION NEEDS TO

05:42.566 --> 05:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO

05:44.066 --> 05:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRY TO STALL CLIMATE CHANGE.

05:46.266 --> 05:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AND HOW DID YOU

05:47.333 --> 05:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIND OUT THIS INFORMATION ON

05:48.366 --> 05:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRIDAY?

05:49.633 --> 05:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I ACTUALLY WAS AT AN EVENT

05:50.800 --> 05:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE THE PRESIDENT WAS SPEAKING

05:51.700 --> 05:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT

05:52.933 --> 05:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEADQUARTERS AND HAD A CHAT WITH

05:54.266 --> 05:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOB MURRAY, WHO'S THE C.E.O.

05:55.766 --> 05:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF MURRAY ENERGY, ONE OF THE

U.S.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE MENTIONED TO ME THAT HE

06:01.200 --> 06:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD HAD A MEETING WITH SCOTT

06:02.533 --> 06:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRUITT THE SAME MORNING AT A

06:03.200 --> 06:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COAL LOBBY BOARD MEETING AND

06:05.033 --> 06:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUT

06:06.766 --> 06:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ISSUE AND WHAT HE PLANNED

06:08.200 --> 06:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DO AND ALSO WHETHER HE PLANS

06:09.766 --> 06:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO CHALLENGE A LEGAL FINDING

06:11.800 --> 06:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS THE BASIS FOR U.S.

06:13.633 --> 06:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS.

06:15.733 --> 06:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: PUT THIS IN

06:17.100 --> 06:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSPECTIVE ON THE OTHER STEPS

06:18.866 --> 06:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SCOTT PRUITT TAKEN WHEN IT

06:20.166 --> 06:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMES TO CLIMATE SCIENCE.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO, FOR THE BUDGET PROPOSAL

06:23.733 --> 06:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAS CUT PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING

06:25.233 --> 06:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATED TO CLIMATE SCIENCE THAT

06:26.800 --> 06:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS AGENCY DOES RIGHT NOW.

06:28.733 --> 06:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER CONGRESS

06:30.566 --> 06:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS GOING TO APPROVE THE NUMBERS

06:32.566 --> 06:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE AND THE PRESIDENT ARE

06:34.066 --> 06:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKING AT.

06:35.733 --> 06:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ESSENTIALLY HE'S NIXED

06:38.133 --> 06:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING THAT WORK ON CLIMATE

06:39.966 --> 06:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCIENCE WITHIN THE E.P.A.,

06:41.533 --> 06:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S TAKEN EVERYTHING DOWN FROM

06:42.700 --> 06:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WEBSITE THAT HE CAN.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT PART IS NOT A SURPRISE.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S ALREADY EXPRESSED THAT EVEN

06:46.966 --> 06:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT

06:48.466 --> 06:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARBON DIOXIDE IS A MAIN CAUSE

06:49.733 --> 06:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

12:37.533 --> 12:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP AND IT'S A DEAD REEF.

12:39.066 --> 12:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

12:47.800 --> 12:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S THAT CHALLENGE IN TERMS

12:49.666 --> 12:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF MAKING PEOPLE AWARE OF THIS

12:51.266 --> 12:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

14:09.533 --> 14:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SMALL PIECE WHEN YOU THINK OF

14:11.633 --> 14:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SIZE OF ANTARCTICA.

14:13.566 --> 14:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

14:15.766 --> 14:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A SMALL PIECE, HARI, OF THE

14:18.100 --> 14:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARSEN SEA ICE SHELF THAT

14:20.233 --> 14:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S BREAKING OFF OF.

14:21.900 --> 14:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LARSEN SEA IS A FLOATING

14:24.466 --> 14:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SLAB OF ICE THE SIZE OF VERMONT

AND NEW HAMPSHIRE COMBINED AND

14:29.866 --> 14:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS A RIFT THAT

14:33.066 --> 14:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS BEEN GROWING YEARS NOW,

14:34.633 --> 14:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS YEAR REALLY ACCELERATED.

14:36.833 --> 14:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS YOU SAID, IT'S ABOUT 15

14:39.033 --> 14:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES WIDE, IT... AND IT'S BEEN

14:41.600 --> 14:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROWING FROM SOUTH TO NORTH.

14:43.666 --> 14:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY GOING TO SLICE A BIG

14:46.366 --> 14:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHUNK OF ICE OFF THE ICE SHELF

14:48.633 --> 14:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT CHUNK WILL BE THE SIZE

14:50.400 --> 14:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF DELAWARE.

14:51.933 --> 14:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE HAVE A PICTURE OF ONE OF

14:53.200 --> 14:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CRACKS THAT ARE GOING

14:54.366 --> 14:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH.

14:55.533 --> 14:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN LOOKING

14:56.866 --> 14:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND STUDYING AND TRYING TO GET

14:58.033 --> 14:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT SOME OF THESE CRACKS FOR A

14:59.100 --> 15:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG TIME.

15:00.533 --> 15:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DEEP DOES IT GO DOWN AND

15:01.733 --> 15:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY ARE THEY SO CONCERNED?

15:03.666 --> 15:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE CRACK IN LARSEN SEA,

15:05.200 --> 15:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE LARSEN SEA MEETS THE SEA,

15:07.633 --> 15:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S ABOUT 600 FEET THICK.

15:09.966 --> 15:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MOST OF THAT IS UNDER WATER.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE'S AN ICE CLIFF OF ABOUT

15:14.133 --> 15:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
60 FEET THAT TOWERS ABOVE THE

15:15.766 --> 15:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAVES.

15:17.066 --> 15:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE CRACK GOES ABOUT AT

15:19.033 --> 15:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAST 600 FEET.

15:20.733 --> 15:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF THIS ICEBERG GOES, THE WORRY

15:22.533 --> 15:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THAT THE WHOLE ICE SHELF

15:24.333 --> 15:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT COLLAPSE AS OTHER ICE

15:25.833 --> 15:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHELVES ON THE ANTARTICA

15:27.900 --> 15:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENINSULA HAVE ALREADY

15:29.233 --> 15:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLLAPSED.

15:30.833 --> 15:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ICE SHELVES THERE AND ELSEWHERE

15:32.933 --> 15:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE REALLY KIND OF CANARIES IN

15:35.033 --> 15:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COAL MINE, THEY'RE A SIGN OF

15:38.833 --> 15:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER, THAT

15:41.300 --> 15:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANTARTICA IS MELTING FASTER THAN

15:42.900 --> 15:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCIENTISTS HAD EXPECTED.

15:44.733 --> 15:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE

15:46.866 --> 15:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACT THAT THE ICE IS ALREADY IN

15:48.233 --> 15:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WATER AND IT'S JUST MELTING

15:49.400 --> 15:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A GLASS OF WATER, WE'RE

15:51.100 --> 15:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY ADDING NEW ICE CUBES TO

15:52.333 --> 15:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT GLASS, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES

15:53.833 --> 15:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SEA LEVEL RISE?

15:55.366 --> 15:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, YES.

15:56.566 --> 15:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S THE PERFECT ANALOGY.

15:57.933 --> 16:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ICE, THE LARSON SEA ICE

16:00.333 --> 16:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHELF IS FLOATING, IT IS LIKE AN

16:01.833 --> 16:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ICE CUBE IN A GLASS OF WATER.

16:03.833 --> 16:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN IF ALL OF IT COLLAPSES,

16:06.133 --> 16:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT, ITSELF, DOES NOT ADD TO

16:08.133 --> 16:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEA LEVEL.

16:10.166 --> 16:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE THING ABOUT ICE SHELVES

16:11.900 --> 16:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THAT THEY FUNCTION LIKE

16:13.766 --> 16:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CORKS, THEY'RE BOTTLING UP A

16:15.500 --> 16:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH LARGER AMOUNT ICE THAT'S ON

16:17.833 --> 16:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GROUND, ON THE LAND, IN THIS

16:19.333 --> 16:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASE, BEHIND THEM.

16:21.466 --> 16:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHEN... THAT'S THE GLACIERS

16:23.266 --> 16:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ARE CARRYING ICE FROM THE

16:25.000 --> 16:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERIOR OF ANTARTICA TOWARDS

16:26.800 --> 16:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SEA.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ICE SHELVES ARE SORT OF THE

16:29.866 --> 16:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLOATING ENDS OF THE GLACIERS.

16:31.233 --> 16:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO WHEN THAT FLOW INCREASES,

16:34.033 --> 16:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE ICE IS FALLING INTO THE SEA

16:36.633 --> 16:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND RAISING SEA LEVEL.
