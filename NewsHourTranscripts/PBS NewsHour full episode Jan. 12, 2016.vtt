JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff. Gwen Ifill is
away.

00:09.543 --> 00:13.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
President Obama delivers his
final State of the Union
address.

00:13.947 --> 00:17.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His chief of staff talks to
us about what to expect.

00:17.918 --> 00:24.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: A suicide bomber in Turkey
kills 10 foreigners in a popular
tourist spot.

00:24.625 --> 00:29.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, finally, a successful
program helping underserved
students prepare for and get
into

00:29.596 --> 00:31.331 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
college.

00:31.331 --> 00:35.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREA RUIZ DIAZ, Student: When
you're an immigrant and you're
in America, you're just

00:35.836 --> 00:38.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
focusing on learning the
language, graduating from high
school. You're not really
focusing

00:38.772 --> 00:40.607 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on college yet.

00:40.607 --> 00:43.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:43.176 --> 00:48.348 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:48.348 --> 01:03.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Iran picked up 10
U.S. Navy sailors and their two
small boats in the Persian

01:03.130 --> 01:09.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gulf today. U.S. officials
reported one boat had mechanical
trouble and ran aground. Iran

01:09.303 --> 01:14.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said the crews were detained for
trespassing. It happened near
Farsi Island. The Pentagon

01:14.341 --> 01:19.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said the vessels were moving
between Kuwait and Bahrain at
the time.

01:19.446 --> 01:24.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afterward, officials said Iran's
foreign minister assured
Secretary of State John Kerry
that

01:24.117 --> 01:28.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the sailors and their boats
will be handed over promptly.

01:28.555 --> 01:33.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Persian Gulf incident came
as President Obama was putting
the finishing touches on

01:33.360 --> 01:38.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his last State of the Union
address. He's expected to use
the prime-time speech to talk

01:38.699 --> 01:44.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about where he sees the country
headed for years to come,
including after he leaves
office.

01:44.805 --> 01:49.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But House Speaker Paul Ryan and
other Republicans talked up
their own ideas today on what
the

01:49.743 --> 01:53.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president should say, especially
when it comes to fighting
terrorism.

01:53.647 --> 01:57.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House: While we're not
certainly expecting much new,

01:57.484 --> 02:02.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is one thing that we hope
to hear from the president, and
that is a comprehensive

02:02.456 --> 02:07.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan to defeat ISIS. Americans
are so anxious right now about
their security, about what's

02:07.527 --> 02:10.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going on around the world.

02:10.130 --> 02:14.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the Democratic
side, Washington Senator Patty
Murray acknowledged there's

02:14.501 --> 02:18.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more work to be done and urged
both parties to pitch in.

02:18.672 --> 02:21.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D),
Washington: Tonight's speech is
going to be about the future of

02:21.641 --> 02:27.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our great country. And Democrats
are ready to keep working here
in Congress to make sure

02:27.180 --> 02:31.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that future works for families
and the middle class.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will get a
preview of tonight's address,
and talk to the president's
chief

02:33.520 --> 02:37.391 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
of staff, after
the news summary.

02:37.391 --> 02:42.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the presidential race, Vice
President Joe Biden weighed in
Monday on the Democratic

02:42.729 --> 02:48.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contest and offered words of
praise for Bernie Sanders. New
polls have the Vermont senator

02:48.235 --> 02:54.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leading Hillary Clinton in New
Hampshire and moving up closer
to her in Iowa. In a CNN

02:54.641 --> 02:58.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interview, the vice president
said Sanders has more
credibility on the issue of
income

02:58.178 --> 02:59.813 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inequality.

02:59.813 --> 03:04.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United States: Bernie is
speaking to a yearning that

03:04.351 --> 03:07.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is deep and real.

03:07.721 --> 03:13.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is relatively new for Hillary
to talk about that. Hillary's
focus has been other things

03:13.393 --> 03:18.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up to now. And that's been
Bernie's -- no one questions
Bernie's authenticity on those

03:18.131 --> 03:20.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later, the vice
president said that wasn't a
criticism of Clinton. He said

03:24.471 --> 03:29.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, as secretary of state, her
focus had rightly been on
foreign policy.

03:29.576 --> 03:35.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's been new trouble in
Germany over the wave of
migrants pouring into the
country.

03:35.182 --> 03:41.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 200 anti-immigration
protesters tore through the city
of Leipzig last night.

03:41.121 --> 03:47.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They carried racist signs and
shouted anti-Muslim slogans.
Dozens of police responded to
the

03:47.027 --> 03:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
scene and made arrests after
violence erupted. The rioters
smashed windows and vandalized

03:53.166 --> 03:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
several buildings. Earlier, some
2,000 protesters had marched
peacefully.

03:58.738 --> 04:05.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Japan warned today that it will
send armed vessels to keep
China's Navy away from disputed

04:05.412 --> 04:11.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
islands. The Senkaku Islands, in
the East China Sea, are claimed
by both nations. A

04:11.284 --> 04:16.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
top official in Tokyo says that
Japan means to control the
waters around them.

04:16.723 --> 04:20.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YOSHIHIDE SUGA, Japanese Chief
Cabinet Secretary (through
translator): This objective was
approved

04:20.827 --> 04:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the cabinet in May last year,
stating that foreign naval
passage into Japanese seas that

04:26.366 --> 04:29.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aren't considered nonthreatening
will trigger seaborne policing
action, and will be dealt

04:29.569 --> 04:32.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with by the self-defense force.

04:32.606 --> 04:37.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the
Philippines' Supreme Court
upheld a security deal with

04:37.244 --> 04:43.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.S. amid rising tensions in
the South China Sea. Manila
hopes that an increased

04:43.083 --> 04:48.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. military presence will fend
off aggressive Chinese moves
there.

04:48.688 --> 04:54.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some 50,000 British
doctors-in-training went on
strike today for the first time
in 40 years.

04:54.427 --> 05:00.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The 24-hour walkout was
triggered by a contract dispute
with the government-run National
Health

05:00.734 --> 05:06.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Service. The so-called junior
doctors took to the picket lines
to demand better pay for

05:06.039 --> 05:10.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
working weekends and to warn
against plans to lengthen their
schedules.

05:10.877 --> 05:15.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I already work up to 24
hours. Many times, that's
nonstop. And I don't really have
any

05:15.715 --> 05:20.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
set breaks during the day or the
night. But if those protections
are taken away and the

05:20.353 --> 05:23.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trusts are able to just make us
work for as many hours as they
wish, then, of course,

05:23.823 --> 05:27.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we are going to be more tired,
and, ultimately, that's going to
affect patients' safety.

05:27.761 --> 05:32.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: About 4,000
operations and outpatient
procedures had to be canceled
due

05:32.365 --> 05:37.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the walkout, but the doctors
still provided emergency care.

05:37.571 --> 05:42.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled 8-1 the
state of Florida's method of

05:42.542 --> 05:47.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
handing out the death penalty is
unconstitutional. Judges in the
state have the final say in

05:47.747 --> 05:53.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
capital cases and can even
impose a death sentence when a
jury decides against it. Today's

05:53.853 --> 06:01.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decision could mean new appeals
for some of the 390 people on
Florida's death row.

06:01.094 --> 06:07.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wall Street, stocks gained
ground, even as oil prices fell
to near $30 a barrel, and

06:07.634 --> 06:13.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pulled energy shares lower.
Despite that, the Dow Jones
industrial average gained 117

06:13.974 --> 06:23.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
points to close at 16516. The
Nasdaq rose nearly 48 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 added 15.

06:23.550 --> 06:29.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the University of Alabama
celebrated its fourth college
football national championship

06:29.456 --> 06:37.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since 2009 today. The Crimson
Tide beat Clemson last night
45-40. And per tradition, coach

06:37.230 --> 06:44.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nick Saban got a Gatorade shower
from his players. Bet it
probably felt good.

06:44.004 --> 06:48.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a look back at President Obama's
previous State of the

06:48.608 --> 06:53.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Union addresses, plus a look
forward to tonight's speech with
the White House chief of staff;

06:53.446 --> 07:09.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS blamed for a deadly blast
in Turkey; and much more.

07:09.796 --> 07:14.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight marks another milestone
for President Obama. In a few
hours, he will deliver the

07:14.334 --> 07:19.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State of the Union address that
will set the tone for his final
year in office.

07:19.072 --> 07:22.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"NewsHour" political director
Lisa Desjardins has been looking
at what he can do in his

07:22.742 --> 07:25.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
remaining months in office.

07:25.745 --> 07:32.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: President Obama
wasted no time kicking off his
2016, just five days

07:32.485 --> 07:35.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the new year, with a highly
publicized announcement that
he's going it alone on certain

07:35.889 --> 07:38.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gun control measures.

07:38.158 --> 07:42.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: There are actions
within my legal authority

07:42.128 --> 07:46.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we can take to help reduce
gun violence and save more
lives, actions that protect

07:46.132 --> 07:49.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our rights and our kids.

07:49.369 --> 07:55.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The president
is well aware his days in office
are numbered, 374, to be

07:55.108 --> 07:59.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exact. And so are the items he
can tackle in that time. What
kind of meaningful action

07:59.612 --> 08:03.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could the outgoing leader get
done? That depends who you ask.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN FEEHERY, Republican
Strategist: You look at the
president's biggest
accomplishments,

08:06.553 --> 08:10.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they all happened in the first
two years of his presidency. And
he's been trying to protect

08:10.457 --> 08:12.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that legacy ever since.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's John
Feehery, GOP strategist and
former spokesman for House

08:15.462 --> 08:17.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Speaker Dennis Hastert.

08:17.997 --> 08:23.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEEHERY: I think the
president is really kind of
finished on the legacy front.
His

08:23.503 --> 08:28.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relevance is diminishing every
day somewhat dramatically,
because he's a lame-duck.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHANIE CUTTER, Former Obama
Deputy Campaign Manager: I don't
think he's considering himself

08:30.377 --> 08:33.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a lame-duck and still
has a lot to get done.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And that's
Stephanie Cutter. She's a
Democratic consultant and a
former

08:36.349 --> 08:39.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
adviser to President Obama.

08:39.285 --> 08:41.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHANIE CUTTER: There's lots
of talk about this being an
election year, and nothing's

08:41.788 --> 08:47.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to get through Congress.
That's probably true, with some
minor exceptions on trade

08:47.060 --> 08:51.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and maybe criminal justice
reform. But if there's any
president equipped to handle
this

08:51.498 --> 08:55.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
type of situation and still find
ways to make progress, it's
President Obama.

08:55.668 --> 08:59.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: With voters
preoccupied with who will be
next the in the Oval Office, the

08:59.773 --> 09:05.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last year of a president's term
usually isn't the time for major
legacy milestones. For

09:05.044 --> 09:09.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some presidents, it was enough
time to do some things, like
create national monuments,

09:09.849 --> 09:14.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Teddy Roosevelt did with
the Grand Canyon in 1908, or
issue controversial presidential

09:14.788 --> 09:19.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pardons, like Bill Clinton on
his last day in office, or, in a
crisis:

09:19.759 --> 09:22.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE W. BUSH, Former President
of the United States: We're in
the midst of a serious financial

09:22.262 --> 09:26.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
crisis, and the federal
government is responding with
decisive action.

09:26.699 --> 09:30.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Push major
measures, like the Troubled
Asset Relief Program, known as

09:30.737 --> 09:35.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TARP, the $700 billion package
that some called the bank
bailout.

09:35.275 --> 09:39.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But like outgoing President
Bush, President Obama faces a
Congress run by strong
opposition.

09:39.913 --> 09:43.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: This is a 15-minute vote.

09:43.283 --> 09:49.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: The
Republican-led House started its
2016 by passing a repeal of
Obama's

09:49.489 --> 09:53.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
signature Affordable Care Act,
sending it to Obama's desk to
force a veto.

09:53.893 --> 09:56.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House: This is the
closest that we have come to
repealing

09:56.663 --> 10:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obamacare. And now we are
sending that repeal to the
president's desk.

10:00.900 --> 10:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It is a kind of
last yearlong duel between the
GOP and Democratic president.

10:06.072 --> 10:11.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a result, expect Obama to use
his only solo weapon, his
executive authority, to try

10:11.811 --> 10:15.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and cement his work on things
like the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
reform bill and climate change.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.951 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Again, Feehery:

10:17.951 --> 10:23.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN FEEHERY: He's going to be
pushing for Dodd-Frank
regulations, which is going to

10:23.723 --> 10:30.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put more constraints on banks
and make it more difficult for
banks to lend. He's going

10:30.530 --> 10:37.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to really be pushing on EPA. And
he had this big agreement on
environmental protection

10:37.904 --> 10:41.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and climate change, and I think
he's going to continue to try
through the regulatory

10:41.107 --> 10:45.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
front to really limit the
emissions on things like coal.

10:45.378 --> 10:50.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Cutter sees
foreign policy as another of
Obama's final year legacy agenda

10:50.450 --> 10:54.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
items. She points to Obama's
decision to reestablish ties
with Cuba, including reopening
the U.S.

10:54.687 --> 10:57.056 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Embassy there.

10:57.056 --> 11:01.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHANIE CUTTER: Cuba is a
significant piece of this
president's legacy. I think the
president,

11:01.694 --> 11:05.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the course of the next
year, including potentially even
visiting Cuba, will find

11:05.031 --> 11:07.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ways to make sure that
those doors stay open.

11:07.967 --> 11:13.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Polls show more
Americans disapprove of Obama's
performance than approve.

11:13.039 --> 11:16.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while he's ahead of his
predecessor's numbers at this
point in his second term,

11:16.843 --> 11:21.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama trails the same approval
ratings for Clinton and Reagan.

11:21.214 --> 11:24.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Going into his final year,
Obama's message to the country
and for his own legacy is his

11:24.584 --> 11:27.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
familiar theme: hope.

11:27.287 --> 11:33.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: If we make some
good choices now, whoever the
next president is, whoever

11:33.760 --> 11:39.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is controlling the next
Congress, there's no reason why
we shouldn't own the 21st
century.

11:39.899 --> 11:43.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: And the
president has a lot to do in
this speech tonight, but
Democrats

11:43.970 --> 11:47.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here tell me he's hoping to do
it in a shorter time than usual,
perhaps 50 minutes, less

11:47.407 --> 11:50.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than the hour or so it
took last year -- Judy.

11:50.209 --> 11:54.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, you
have been talking to members up
on the Hill. What are Democrats

11:54.247 --> 11:57.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying they expect to hear
from the president tonight?

11:57.483 --> 12:01.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Democrats, Judy
-- it's interesting -- are
saying this is an entirely
different

12:01.421 --> 12:05.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of State of the Union
address. They say it will not be
a wish list of items, not a

12:05.858 --> 12:11.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whole bunch of policy agenda
proposals, but instead a
sweeping vision.

12:11.030 --> 12:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the kind of language
they're using. They say that
this is something that is
forward-looking,

12:14.500 --> 12:17.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is different, of course,
for a president who on his way
out. Usually, those presidents

12:17.303 --> 12:20.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
try and recap their
time in office.

12:20.873 --> 12:25.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of that aside, there is
something Democrats really want
and need from this speech. They

12:25.111 --> 12:29.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need this president to try and
talk up what he's done. And
they're focusing on the economy.

12:29.882 --> 12:34.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're hoping that, as 2016 and
many of the members here are
facing reelection, comes

12:34.487 --> 12:38.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up, they want the president to
tout what they say is a strong
performance in the economy

12:38.124 --> 12:40.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under his tenure.

12:40.994 --> 12:45.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we heard
Paul Ryan, the speaker of the
House, a few minutes ago saying

12:45.365 --> 12:49.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he wants to hear what the
president has to say about
fighting terrorism, but you have

12:49.135 --> 12:51.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
been talking to other
Republicans. What are they
telling you they look for?

12:51.671 --> 12:54.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

12:54.140 --> 12:58.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans say two things. Some
strategists that I talked to
outside of this building

12:58.378 --> 13:03.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
told me that they think there
could be a chance that, as the
president speaks to his vision,

13:03.049 --> 13:05.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something Democrats want,
Republicans are fine with that
too, because they think his

13:05.551 --> 13:08.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vision helps them.

13:08.254 --> 13:11.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're actually -- one person
told me tonight, Judy, that they
think there might be some

13:11.691 --> 13:15.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clips from tonight's speech that
they can run in ads showing that
they think this big

13:15.061 --> 13:18.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government vision, as they see
it, was a failure and is a
failure.

13:18.931 --> 13:22.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, on the other hand, when you
talk the Republicans in this
building, they're also

13:22.902 --> 13:27.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
playing the forward-looking
game. They're saying they want
to talk about their own vision.

13:27.206 --> 13:32.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say that South Carolina
Governor Nikki Haley is not
going to give a reaction speech

13:32.011 --> 13:35.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Republican response
tonight. She also, they say,
going nontraditional, and will
instead

13:35.882 --> 13:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
present a Republican vision for
the future, the Republican
agenda.

13:39.585 --> 13:45.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's a lot of competing
vision optics here as well,
Judy. Democrats told me that

13:45.191 --> 13:50.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
several of their members, as
many as 20, are bringing Muslim
Americans as their guests.

13:50.229 --> 13:54.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that's not about President
Obama's agenda. That's clearly
about the 2016 campaign, which

13:54.434 --> 13:57.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think will be woven
through this speech.

13:57.804 --> 14:00.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One last note, Judy. I have
talked to a lot of people about
this speech tonight, but I

14:00.506 --> 14:05.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to say the most insightful
might have been my Uber driver
on the way here, a man

14:05.178 --> 14:09.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
named Earl Wiggins (ph), an
Obama fan, he said. He said he
wants to hear the president

14:09.749 --> 14:12.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really speak from the heart.
He's not sure about the
president himself. He says the
president

14:12.852 --> 14:16.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has to be genuine and really
speak to what he means.

14:16.055 --> 14:18.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ah, the
wisdom of real people.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just very
quickly, Lisa, you have been
covering Congress for a while.
Does

14:22.895 --> 14:26.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it feel different that this is
the last State of the Union?

14:26.299 --> 14:29.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I'm going to be
honest, Judy. It doesn't feel
all that different.

14:29.569 --> 14:33.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To me, this feels a little bit
like a classic State of the
Union. I

14:33.339 --> 14:37.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think there's been a bigger
change that could be expressed
in this speech tonight. I think

14:37.376 --> 14:42.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what is different in Congress at
this moment that I feel is that
now it is about competing

14:42.181 --> 14:46.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agendas. It's not as much about
the competing politics that we
have seen.

14:46.619 --> 14:50.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think that's being
expressed tonight, as the
president tries to express a
bigger

14:50.523 --> 14:54.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vision that they say is beyond
politics. Republicans are trying
to do the same. But what's
ironic

14:54.694 --> 14:58.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there is, of course, that's
kind of politics, too.

14:58.197 --> 15:01.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins,
reporting for us from the
Capitol, and we will be talking

15:01.134 --> 15:02.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to you later tonight. Thanks.

15:02.435 --> 15:05.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: You got it.

15:05.538 --> 15:09.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reports have it
that President Obama, White
House speechwriters and his
staff

15:09.075 --> 15:12.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have spent today tweaking the
State of the Union address.

15:12.678 --> 15:16.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A short time ago, I spoke with
the White House chief of staff,
Denis McDonough.

15:16.983 --> 15:19.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Denis McDonough, welcome.

15:19.318 --> 15:21.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're hearing this is going
to be a different sort of State
of the Union. What does that

15:21.988 --> 15:23.623 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mean?

15:23.623 --> 15:26.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENIS MCDONOUGH, White House
Chief of Staff: Judy, thanks for
the chance to be with you.

15:26.659 --> 15:31.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, the president -- you won't
hear tonight what is a
traditional list of policy
proposals,

15:31.664 --> 15:35.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, rather, you will hear the
president talk through the kind
of challenges that we will

15:35.735 --> 15:38.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be facing not only in the year
ahead, but really the decade
ahead.

15:38.771 --> 15:43.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he wants to make sure that
the institutions of Washington
are focused on those, and are

15:43.442 --> 15:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rolling up our sleeves to get
ready to deal with a changing
economy where everybody needs

15:47.713 --> 15:53.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have a shot at opportunity in
this economy, talking about
using all the elements of our

15:53.619 --> 15:58.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national power to protect the
country and expand our
influence, making sure that we

15:58.658 --> 16:03.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
use technology to advance our
interests, not use that -- not
have that technology used

16:03.663 --> 16:08.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against us, and then, of course,
talking about how he thinks our
politics could be done much

16:08.267 --> 16:10.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
better than they have been.

16:10.336 --> 16:14.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he will make sure that our
politics reflect the greatness
of this country.

16:14.574 --> 16:19.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, not putting
forward a list of proposals,
some are interpreting that to

16:19.178 --> 16:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mean he doesn't think he can get
much done this year, especially
with Congress.

16:23.349 --> 16:28.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENIS MCDONOUGH: Yes, well,
look, a lot of people said that
to us a year ago. And over

16:28.054 --> 16:31.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the course of the last year, we
got a deal with Cuba to open up
and establish diplomatic

16:31.591 --> 16:33.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
relations.

16:33.559 --> 16:40.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We got a budget deal, a tax
deal. We got TPA, which is a
trade negotiating authority. And

16:40.299 --> 16:47.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then we were able to get the
largest trade agreement in the
history of trade agreements

16:47.039 --> 16:50.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last year. And then, of course,
we got the climate deal in Paris
at the end of the year,

16:50.509 --> 16:55.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on top of the budget and on top
of all sorts of reforms and
export financing and other

16:55.581 --> 16:57.450 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

16:57.450 --> 17:03.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we will let the record speak
for itself. This president has
been, obviously, leading

17:03.456 --> 17:11.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policy debates for some time and
pushing the quickest recovery in
terms of job growth over

17:11.397 --> 17:16.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the last two years since back in
the 1990s and the quickest
reduction in the unemployment

17:16.402 --> 17:19.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rate since well over
three decades ago.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, not only do we have ideas.
We're implementing them. You
will hear more about that over
the

17:22.275 --> 17:24.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
course of the year.

17:24.677 --> 17:27.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, tonight, you will hear
about our challenges, how we're
going to confront them, how
we're

17:27.446 --> 17:30.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to draw on the strength of
all the American people to
confront them.

17:30.383 --> 17:35.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned
politics. The Republican
candidates are out there
painting

17:35.421 --> 17:38.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a pretty negative picture of the
State of the Union. It sounds
like you're saying the

17:38.925 --> 17:41.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president wants to counter that.

17:41.193 --> 17:44.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENIS MCDONOUGH: Well, I think
the president wants to be
factual.

17:44.697 --> 17:49.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think what he sees is an
American people who are -- when
they're working together and

17:49.669 --> 17:55.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
focused on the opportunities,
the sky's the limit for this
country. And I do find myself

17:55.608 --> 18:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- and I think the speech
tonight will lay this out a
little bit -- puzzled, perplexed

18:00.413 --> 18:05.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the fact that these guys --
guys primarily -- want to just
talk down the economy, talk

18:05.351 --> 18:08.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
down the United States.

18:08.321 --> 18:12.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's not consistent with
either the situation we find
ourselves in today or the
history

18:12.291 --> 18:15.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this great country. So we
will continue to press that
case, and you will hear it
tonight.

18:15.394 --> 18:19.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, given the
fact, Denis McDonough, that
two-thirds of the American

18:19.198 --> 18:23.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, give or take, are
telling pollsters they think the
country is off on the wrong

18:23.402 --> 18:26.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
track, what is the president
going to say to change their
mind? What is he going to

18:26.672 --> 18:29.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
say the state of the union is?

18:29.308 --> 18:34.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENIS MCDONOUGH: Look, I think
there's no doubt that people
coming -- what we came out

18:34.313 --> 18:39.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of, that great recession, the
deepest rescission since the
Great Depression that started in

18:39.885 --> 18:44.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2007-2008, where people saw the
values of their homes wiped out,
people saw their retirements,

18:44.991 --> 18:49.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the indicators of stability
for their families really took a
dramatic hit.

18:49.762 --> 18:56.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I don't doubt that people
feel uneasy, and they have every
right to feel uneasy.

18:56.502 --> 19:01.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our role, as the leaders in this
country, is to make sure that
we're making opportunities

19:01.340 --> 19:07.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for all the American people,
that they have the training, the
opportunities for growth,

19:07.346 --> 19:09.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the new jobs that we have been
talking about. And that's what
we are going to talk about

19:09.582 --> 19:11.283 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight.

19:11.283 --> 19:14.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there worry at
the White House, finally, Denis
McDonough, that what

19:14.820 --> 19:18.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president wants to do this
year could get completely
overwhelmed by, frankly, the

19:18.924 --> 19:22.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
2016 presidential race?

19:22.228 --> 19:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENIS MCDONOUGH: We don't spend
a lot of time worrying about the
politics or the races.

19:27.633 --> 19:31.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we spend a lot of time
worrying about is that this
country is ready for this
changing

19:31.904 --> 19:37.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and dynamic economy, so people
have opportunities, that we are
focused on the threats to this

19:37.510 --> 19:41.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country, that we're focused on
the new opportunities,
particularly the clean energy.

19:41.914 --> 19:46.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's what we will focus
on. What happens on the campaign
trail is not something we

19:46.018 --> 19:50.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can control, and we're not even
going to try. We have a story to
tell. We have a country

19:50.489 --> 19:54.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to lead, and this is a great
country. And we're blessed to
have the opportunity to do

19:54.060 --> 19:56.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it. That's what we're going
to do for the next year.

19:56.495 --> 19:59.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Denis McDonough,
White House chief of staff,
thank you very much for talking

19:59.732 --> 20:03.402 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with us.

20:03.402 --> 20:11.410 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
DENIS MCDONOUGH:
Thank you, Judy.

20:11.410 --> 20:16.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

20:16.949 --> 20:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
relief for starving families in
Syria, but how long will it
last?;

20:24.023 --> 20:31.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a kind of Teach for America
program for college advisers;
and how prison drove a man to
poetry.

20:31.597 --> 20:37.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, the deadly bombing
that shook Turkey's largest city
today. The suicide blast

20:37.636 --> 20:42.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
killed 10 people, including
eight Germans, and wounded 15.

20:42.942 --> 20:46.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret Warner
has the story.

20:46.779 --> 20:52.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: It was
mid-morning when the explosion
ripped through the historic
heart

20:52.318 --> 20:57.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of Istanbul. The site,
Sultanahmet Square, is a major
tourist destination, home to a

20:57.923 --> 21:02.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
landmark obelisk and just steps
from the famed Blue Mosque.

21:02.661 --> 21:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, its grounds were
scattered with bodies, and body
parts, as ambulance sirens

21:07.700 --> 21:12.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wailed and security forces
rushed to the scene.

21:12.538 --> 21:15.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It was
a suicide bomb. There was chaos.
Everybody was running

21:15.074 --> 21:16.742 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
somewhere.

21:16.742 --> 21:21.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The dead were
all foreigners, nearly all of
them, German tourists.

21:21.313 --> 21:25.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Reuters correspondent Ayla
Jean Yackley in Istanbul said
via Skype it's a blow to

21:25.518 --> 21:28.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Turkey's vital tourist industry.

21:28.721 --> 21:35.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AYLA JEAN YACKLEY, Reuters:
There is very much a sense of
deep sadness, fear. What does

21:35.594 --> 21:40.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this mean for Turkey's tourism
business? What does this mean
for Turkey's reputation or

21:40.399 --> 21:45.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
standing in the world? Will
Turkey now be perceived as
another dangerous no-go place

21:45.871 --> 21:50.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the region? These are some of
the questions that are on
people's minds here as well.

21:50.476 --> 21:53.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Turkish
officials responded quickly,
with the prime minister
declaring

21:53.045 --> 21:56.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Islamic State group
was responsible.

21:56.882 --> 22:01.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AHMET DAVUTOGLU, Turkish Prime
Minister (through translator):
Our fight against ISIS, which

22:01.720 --> 22:06.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
carried out this attack, will
continue with determination. The
perpetrators of this attack

22:06.325 --> 22:10.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and their links will be unveiled
and they will get the punishment
they deserve.

22:10.362 --> 22:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Turkey's deputy
prime minister said the
perpetrator was a Syrian
national

22:14.934 --> 22:19.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
born in 1988, that he'd entered
Turkey recently, but wasn't on
the country's watch list of

22:19.405 --> 22:22.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
suspected militants.

22:22.975 --> 22:28.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another report said the bomber
was Saudi-born. Turkey's leaders
also spoke by phone to German

22:28.214 --> 22:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chancellor Angela Merkel, who
later addressed reporters in
Berlin.

22:32.318 --> 22:36.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through translator): Today, it
hit Istanbul, but,

22:36.956 --> 22:42.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before that, it was Paris, and,
before that, it was Copenhagen,
Tunisia and so many other

22:42.561 --> 22:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
places. International terror
chooses the places of its
attacks in different ways, but
its

22:47.566 --> 22:52.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
target is always the same: our
life in freedom and our free
societies.

22:52.538 --> 22:57.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: This wouldn't
be the first time that ISIS
targeted Turkey. In July, more

22:57.943 --> 23:03.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than 30 people were killed in a
suicide attack in Suruc, near
the southeastern border with

23:03.382 --> 23:09.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syria. Then, in October, twin
suicide bombs exploded at a
peace rally in Ankara. More

23:09.555 --> 23:12.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than 100 were killed.

23:12.992 --> 23:17.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those attacks were aimed at
Turkish Kurds. Their Syrian
brethren are one of the most

23:17.696 --> 23:23.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effective forces fighting ISIS
in Syria. But Kurdish
separatists inside Turkey and
their

23:23.636 --> 23:28.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government are locked in a
vicious new war, after a
two-year cease-fire. Lately,
Turkey

23:28.240 --> 23:33.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is taking a stronger hand
in Syria against ISIS.

23:33.746 --> 23:37.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, it agreed to open its
bases to U.S. aircraft and to do
more to stop the flow

23:37.549 --> 23:40.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of foreign militants into Syria.

23:40.653 --> 23:45.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AYLA JEAN YACKLEY: Turkey's also
been more and more outspoken in
its criticism of Islamic

23:45.190 --> 23:50.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State. Maybe initially, there
was some reluctance to call them
terrorists, for example. And

23:50.329 --> 23:55.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now the government officials,
including the president, do call
them terrorists.

23:55.701 --> 24:04.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, there's also some
truth to the fact that Turkey
was a very ardent and outspoken

24:04.109 --> 24:09.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opponent and critic of Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad, which
may have encouraged turning

24:09.815 --> 24:15.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a blind eye. The idea that
either Turkey, the government,
helped bring this on by not

24:15.888 --> 24:20.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing enough or has brought it
on by joining the coalition and
maybe doing too much shows

24:20.392 --> 24:24.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you the sort of rock and a hard
place that Turkey's caught
between.

24:24.196 --> 24:30.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: All of that as
Turkey continues to host more
than two million Syrian
refugees.

24:30.035 --> 24:34.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just yesterday, Ankara said it
will offer refugees work permits
to discourage them from

24:34.139 --> 24:42.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
illegally crossing into
the European Union.

24:42.881 --> 24:56.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we turn to
another consequence of the Syria
war, and a weapon used against

24:56.962 --> 25:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
civilians caught in the middle
of that brutal conflict.

25:00.466 --> 25:04.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We begin with a report from
Lindsey Hilsum of Independent
Television News

25:04.770 --> 25:13.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY HILSUM: It's months
since they ate properly. Are
these tears of hunger or relief?

25:13.212 --> 25:22.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because, finally, after night
fell, food arrived, some of it
to eat right now, no waiting.

25:22.855 --> 25:27.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): The
situation in Madaya is so bad.
Before the siege, we

25:27.793 --> 25:31.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
used to live a proper life, but
when the armed rebels entered
the village and did what they

25:31.630 --> 25:34.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
did, they revealed
their true colors.

25:34.800 --> 25:42.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY HILSUM: It's a delicate
situation for the U.N. and the
Red Cross and Crescent,

25:42.040 --> 25:47.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are strictly neutral. They
negotiated for months to get
food and medicine into Madaya,

25:47.846 --> 25:52.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
besieged by the government, and
two villages besieged by the
rebels, relief for tit for

25:52.551 --> 25:55.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tat starving.

25:55.087 --> 25:58.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
People with no electricity are
burning shoes and plastic

25:58.991 --> 26:04.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bags to stay warm. People are in
the street looking for food in
the rubbish.

26:04.463 --> 26:10.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY HILSUM: This is Madaya
clinic. The few health
professionals left in town were

26:10.235 --> 26:16.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pleased to get badly need
medicines brought by the convoy.
But aid agencies say up to

26:16.074 --> 26:21.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
400 people should be evacuated
immediately because they have
serious illnesses that need

26:21.146 --> 26:24.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
treatment that's impossible
in these conditions.

26:24.817 --> 26:31.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): My
son has hepatitis and he has to
leave. I have a medical report

26:31.156 --> 26:35.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I want the take him out.
There are neither medicines, nor
doctors. There is nothing.

26:35.928 --> 26:40.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY HILSUM: The convoy
succeeded, but the problem is
not solved, and there are dozens

26:40.699 --> 26:43.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of besieged places in Syria.

26:43.368 --> 26:47.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAWEL KRZYSIEK, International
Committee of the Red Cross:
They're the hardest moments

26:47.272 --> 26:52.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to see, to listen to those
people, to hear their concerns,
and to realize that, you know,

26:52.845 --> 26:57.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one-time distribution will not
solve the long-term problem of
the people living in the
besieged

26:57.716 --> 27:04.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
areas, no matter where they are,
in Madaya, Foua and Kefraya,
Deir el-Zour. We just need

27:04.423 --> 27:09.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be able to come back and
bring the aid on a regular
basis.

27:09.862 --> 27:17.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY HILSUM: So much ruin.
Government barrel bombs have
destroyed the Damascus suburb of

27:17.236 --> 27:24.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Zariah (ph), but when they bring
their tanks, the rebels destroy
them.

27:24.343 --> 27:35.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in Idlib today, more Russian
airstrikes; 37 people were
reported killed. As long as

27:35.721 --> 27:40.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this goes on, there will be no
real relief for the besieged
people of Syria.

27:40.692 --> 27:45.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more on the
humanitarian situation in Madaya
and elsewhere in Syria,

27:45.130 --> 27:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we turn to William Brangham.

27:48.166 --> 27:51.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As we just
heard in Lindsey Hilsum's
report, the United Nations is
moving

27:51.169 --> 27:55.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
aid convoys into the
besieged city of Madaya.

27:55.107 --> 27:59.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the very latest on what's
happening there and elsewhere in
Syria, I'm joined via Skype

27:59.211 --> 28:03.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Kevin Kennedy, the U.N.'s
regional humanitarian
coordinator for the Syria
crisis. He's monitoring

28:03.215 --> 28:05.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the situation from
Amman, Jordan.

28:05.617 --> 28:09.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Kevin Kennedy, thank you
very much for being here.

28:09.121 --> 28:12.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen all of these
terrible images coming out of
Syria. Can you give us the
latest

28:12.190 --> 28:14.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on what's happening in
the town of Madaya?

28:14.326 --> 28:16.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN KENNEDY, U.N. Regional
Humanitarian Coordinator: Well,
as you know, we were able

28:16.395 --> 28:23.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to deliver after many months of
requests aid to Madaya last
night for the 42,000 people

28:23.535 --> 28:27.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are trapped there, and also
to two other towns to the north,
Foua and Kefraya.

28:27.039 --> 28:32.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we hope to provide some more
deliveries in the next couple
days here, because what

28:32.377 --> 28:35.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we were able to do last night
was -- had some of the basic
needs, but much more is required

28:35.414 --> 28:39.418 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
to meet their
situation in Madaya.

28:39.418 --> 28:42.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean, we
know that Assad's forces have
surrounded these towns,
sometimes

28:42.988 --> 28:46.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with barbed wire,
sometimes with snipers.

28:46.191 --> 28:48.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Have you seen any interference
at all with the aid convoys that
are going into these

28:48.594 --> 28:50.429 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
towns?

28:50.429 --> 28:54.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN KENNEDY: There was a delay
last night, but I would not call
it interference (INAUDIBLE)

28:54.299 --> 28:58.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but basically unimpeded. It took
a while to get there, but they
did get there about 8:00

28:58.737 --> 29:01.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the evening and stayed
until 4:00 in the morning.

29:01.773 --> 29:07.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I would say this is just one
town of many that are either
besieged or hard to reach

29:07.980 --> 29:14.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Syria. There's about 13.5
million people in need of one
form of humanitarian assistance

29:14.252 --> 29:17.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or another in Syria. And about
4.5 million of those are in
these hard-to-reach areas

29:17.956 --> 29:21.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and half of those in
ISIL-controlled areas.

29:21.126 --> 29:23.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Just as you
say, Amnesty International
referred to Madaya really as

29:23.929 --> 29:26.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just the tip of the iceberg.

29:26.565 --> 29:30.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what are you doing in those
other towns that have been
harder to reach as well?

29:30.902 --> 29:33.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN KENNEDY: Well, we continue
to try to reach them. And we do
in some cases, but not

29:33.939 --> 29:37.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
near to the degree
that we should.

29:37.042 --> 29:42.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.N., the Red Cross, Red
Crescent, the NGOs are very
active on the ground in Syria.

29:42.280 --> 29:45.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, it's quite remarkable,
because of the degree of
activity and assistance that's

29:45.050 --> 29:48.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
delivered in a very
active war zone.

29:48.854 --> 29:53.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some six million people are fed
every month, every five non-food
items, eight million people

29:53.992 --> 29:58.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with clean water, but this is
not meeting the needs that are
there in Syria, particularly

29:58.397 --> 30:01.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in those areas that are
controlled either by ISIL or
besieged by the armed groups or

30:01.433 --> 30:03.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by the government.

30:03.835 --> 30:08.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The United
Nations has passed resolutions
demanding that the Syrian
government

30:08.073 --> 30:12.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allow these aid convoys in, but
there has been very little
success moving the needle

30:12.110 --> 30:15.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there. What other levers do you
have to try to get the aid into
the places where it's

30:15.580 --> 30:17.382 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
needed?

30:17.382 --> 30:21.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN KENNEDY: Well, it's not
just the Syrian government,
though that's one part of the

30:21.820 --> 30:23.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conflict. There's other group as
well, ISIL and other armed
groups that restrict our aid

30:23.321 --> 30:26.825 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
efforts.

30:26.825 --> 30:30.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We continue to work with the
government to try to get access.
And we have had some success,

30:30.295 --> 30:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not the degree of success that
we would like. We also deliver
from outside the country,

30:35.067 --> 30:40.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Turkey, from Iraq, from
Lebanon and from Jordan as well,
into some of those hard-to-reach

30:40.539 --> 30:43.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
areas and negotiate with the
different armed groups there to
get through.

30:43.642 --> 30:48.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: My
understanding is that Monday's
delivery and last night's
delivery

30:48.880 --> 30:52.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really will last for about four
weeks. But what happens when
that food runs out? What

30:52.718 --> 30:55.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happens then?

30:55.053 --> 30:57.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN KENNEDY: We will be going
back to the situation you had
before, and the situation

30:57.756 --> 31:01.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was quite dire.

31:01.193 --> 31:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is interesting. A kilo of
wheat was going for $89 in
Madaya until yesterday. That
same

31:08.133 --> 31:13.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kilo goes for 75 cents in
Damascus, which gives you an
idea of the degree of
deprivation

31:13.138 --> 31:16.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the people have suffered.
And, of course, the concern is
not only in Madaya, but these

31:16.074 --> 31:18.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other locations, and what
conditions are they in?

31:18.910 --> 31:21.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So there are
some supplies in Madaya, but
people just simply can't afford

31:21.179 --> 31:23.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to purchase them?

31:23.381 --> 31:25.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN KENNEDY: Well, there is
always a black market in any
war, and there is a black market

31:25.016 --> 31:27.419 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this war.

31:27.419 --> 31:32.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I guess some things leak
into there, not in any great
quantities, but obviously at

31:32.824 --> 31:37.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
great expense, and really beyond
the reach of most of the people
to buy them. If the

31:37.329 --> 31:43.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
price is 89 times what it should
be, it gives you an idea of the
degree of scarcity and

31:43.268 --> 31:46.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the degree of how hard it
is to get these supplies.

31:46.471 --> 31:52.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we have about 15 areas in
Syria that we consider besieged,
and another -- and which

31:52.544 --> 31:57.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contain about 400,000 people,
and another four million people,
if you will, in these

31:57.115 --> 32:01.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hard-to-reach areas where we get
in intermittently, but not with
the consistency and the
sustained

32:01.186 --> 32:03.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
effort that we need.

32:03.522 --> 32:09.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Some of the
rebel groups have been arguing
that until aid is allowed

32:09.127 --> 32:13.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in freely into these towns, that
the peace talks that are planned
for the rest of -- for

32:13.298 --> 32:17.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the end of this month shouldn't
go forward. Do you believe that
that's the right strategy?

32:17.936 --> 32:24.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN KENNEDY: You know, we're
calling for immediate, open,
unimpeded and sustained access.

32:24.109 --> 32:29.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, we have been calling
on this for years. But this is a
good moment to really

32:29.548 --> 32:33.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put that into play. And I think
all parties in conflict or all
parties going to the peace

32:33.585 --> 32:37.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conference should abide by this.
Meeting the needs of the people,
wherever they may be,

32:37.289 --> 32:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in whatever area they're under
the control of, is most
important.

32:42.093 --> 32:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And denying people the basic
necessities of life and putting
their lives in danger is

32:48.233 --> 32:51.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a violation of international
humanitarian law and cannot be
abided by.

32:51.937 --> 32:53.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Kevin Kennedy of the United
Nations, thank you very much

32:53.205 --> 32:56.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for joining us.

32:56.174 --> 33:05.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEVIN KENNEDY: Thank you.

33:05.750 --> 33:14.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Final deadlines
for college applications are
looming this week, and students

33:14.259 --> 33:17.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are the first in their
family to apply to college are
the least likely to have had

33:17.562 --> 33:21.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
help navigating the
complex process.

33:21.099 --> 33:26.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A group called the College
Advising Corps is trying to turn
that disparity around. It

33:26.905 --> 33:32.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
partners with high schools and
universities to recruit and pay
recent college grads to

33:32.310 --> 33:37.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
advise lower-income,
first-generation students on
getting into college.

33:37.749 --> 33:42.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan visited two New
York City high schools working
with the corps.

33:42.487 --> 33:44.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VICTORIA DEL TORO, College
Advising Corps: You bought two
movie tickets. Your friend

33:44.823 --> 33:45.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cancels.

33:45.724 --> 33:48.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What would you do?

33:48.526 --> 33:50.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUDENT: I would call
my other friend.

33:50.562 --> 33:51.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VICTORIA DEL TORO: You would
call somebody else. What happens
if that person doesn't

33:51.730 --> 33:53.598 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
respond?

33:53.598 --> 33:57.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Many students
at Manhattan Academy for Arts
and Language all still learning

33:57.469 --> 34:02.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
English. Most of them are recent
immigrants. The idea of applying
and going to college

34:02.040 --> 34:05.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can feel totally foreign. That's
where Victoria Del Toro comes
in.

34:05.777 --> 34:06.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VICTORIA DEL TORO: Are you going
to lose out on that money?

34:06.678 --> 34:08.546 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENTS: No.

34:08.546 --> 34:14.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VICTORIA DEL TORO: You call
somebody else. So, colleges work
the same way. So, when they

34:14.152 --> 34:19.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
e-mail you, they track who
responds to what. And they want
to know that you're responsible,

34:19.124 --> 34:21.226 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

34:21.226 --> 34:23.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This is her
second full year at the school,
as part of a program called

34:23.962 --> 34:31.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
College Advising Corps.

34:31.202 --> 34:35.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the school's only dedicated
college counselor, her mission
is to have all of the school's

34:35.974 --> 34:41.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nearly 400 students believe
college is an option. It's a
mission that could be
challenging

34:41.112 --> 34:43.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in most American high schools.

34:43.915 --> 34:48.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at Manhattan Academy, few
have any friends or relatives
who have experience with
American

34:48.119 --> 34:50.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
higher education.

34:50.155 --> 34:54.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VICTORIA DEL TORO: They still
don't think they're performing
at the level that they

34:54.526 --> 35:00.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should be performing at. So,
they're very aware that they are
being compared to other

35:00.198 --> 35:03.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
students, and so they know that
the language is a barrier.

35:03.802 --> 35:08.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Andrea Ruiz
Diaz came to the U.S. from
Paraguay four years ago. She

35:08.573 --> 35:12.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was already convinced college
was in her future, but the
details of how to get there were
a

35:12.477 --> 35:14.412 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mystery.

35:14.412 --> 35:18.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREA RUIZ DIAZ, Student: I
wouldn't know about the SATs,
because, when you're an
immigrant

35:18.717 --> 35:22.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you're in America, you're
just focusing on learning the
language, graduating from

35:22.554 --> 35:26.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high school. You're not really
focusing on college yet.

35:26.925 --> 35:33.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The type of
help Del Toro provides,
one-on-one help with choosing
schools,

35:33.631 --> 35:37.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
help with writing essays, and
guiding students through
completing paperwork, is what
affluent

35:37.469 --> 35:41.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
families pay hundreds
of dollars for.

35:41.573 --> 35:47.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Across the country, the average
college counselor works with
more than 450 students a year.

35:47.812 --> 35:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means the average student
has less than 40 minutes of
individual coaching on college

35:53.385 --> 35:58.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
applications. Without partnering
with College Advising Corps,
principal Siv Boletsis says

35:58.456 --> 36:02.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her students would be in the
same boat. Instead, Del Toro
tries to spend 20 to 30 minutes
a

36:02.360 --> 36:04.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
week with each student.

36:04.829 --> 36:09.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How important has that
role been on campus here?

36:09.067 --> 36:11.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SIV BOLETSIS, Principal,
Manhattan Academy for Arts and
Language: The two guidance
counselors

36:11.803 --> 36:18.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who are here provide the
socio-emotional support and
programming for the students.
There was

36:18.877 --> 36:25.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a need for someone like Victoria
to be here to explain certain
things. These are families

36:25.316 --> 36:28.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who don't know about the college
application process at all.

36:28.853 --> 36:32.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Del Toro says
her hours with students and
parents are chipping away

36:32.924 --> 36:37.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
at skepticism about the
stressful college application
process being worth it.

36:37.695 --> 36:43.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VICTORIA DEL TORO: My first year
here at Manhattan Academy, it
was definitely not, like, a goal

36:43.768 --> 36:49.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for a student or even a
conversation for a student to
say, hey, I signed up for the
SAT,

36:49.007 --> 36:51.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm going to take it.

36:51.910 --> 36:59.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now, I must say, like, when
I saw my data and I saw that 94
percent of my senior class

36:59.918 --> 37:03.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
registered for the SAT, I said,
things are changing in here.

37:03.955 --> 37:09.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But the goal
is not just to get students to
apply to any college. Aiming

37:09.327 --> 37:14.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high can make a difference. A
growing body of research
suggests low-income,
first-generation

37:14.899 --> 37:20.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students who have the grades to
get into selective schools are
more likely to graduate from
those

37:20.605 --> 37:26.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
colleges than from the local,
open-enrollment campuses where
they're still more likely
register.

37:26.544 --> 37:29.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VICTORIA DEL TORO: I have more
students applying to private
institutions out of the state
than

37:29.848 --> 37:31.816 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ever before.

37:31.816 --> 37:35.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the spring,
Del Toro posts where students
have been accepted and

37:35.987 --> 37:40.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the scholarships they have won
on bulletin boards, spurring
competition.

37:40.492 --> 37:44.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Andrea Ruiz Diaz says her ideas
about what's possible have
expanded.

37:44.863 --> 37:50.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREA RUIZ DIAZ: I definitely
wouldn't have considered
applying to schools out of
state.

37:50.935 --> 37:55.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, I have always had the fear
of going out of my house,
especially because I'm an

37:55.440 --> 38:00.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigrant. It feels weird and
scary, but she I'm open to it
now.

38:00.245 --> 38:04.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AILEEN MONER, College Advising
Corps: There are so many
talented students that don't see

38:04.449 --> 38:07.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
themselves competitive enough.

38:07.519 --> 38:11.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Aileen Moner
is director of College Advising
Corps' New York office

38:11.756 --> 38:17.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and oversees two-dozen
counselors working in more than
20 high schools across the city.

38:17.028 --> 38:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AILEEN MONER: I think we're
definitely working with those
students that maybe don't have

38:21.733 --> 38:27.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the social capital to be able to
see themselves on campuses that
-- that they can really succeed

38:27.071 --> 38:28.973 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

38:28.973 --> 38:33.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: College
Advising Corps started at the
University of Virginia in 2005.
Today,

38:33.878 --> 38:39.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it has more than 500 advisers
working in 14 states. The
students they work with are 30

38:39.817 --> 38:43.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
percent more likely to apply to
college and more than 25 percent
more likely to apply

38:43.321 --> 38:46.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for financial aid.

38:46.491 --> 38:50.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New York high schools the corps
has worked with over time, like
Eximius College Prep

38:50.595 --> 38:56.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Bronx, are seeing more
students enroll at more
selective four-year colleges.

38:56.701 --> 38:59.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jon Daly partnered with the
Advising Corps when he became
principal of Eximius five years

38:59.470 --> 39:01.439 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

39:01.439 --> 39:03.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON DALY, Principal, Eximius
College Preparatory Academy:
When I first got here, I
couldn't

39:03.041 --> 39:06.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
understand the fact that most of
the students from the South
Bronx here, they were attending

39:06.010 --> 39:09.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Staten Island College. That's
where they were going.

39:09.347 --> 39:13.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was really wondering, why
is that happening? Because it's
like a two-hour train ride. and

39:13.518 --> 39:16.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was because a brother or
sister of some of the students
here went there, and then

39:16.788 --> 39:18.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it just seemed like that's where
most of the students were going.

39:18.890 --> 39:23.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Daly says his
goal for every student is the
best college at the best price.

39:23.861 --> 39:27.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON DALY: Being an immigrant
myself, and being the first
person in my family to go to
college,

39:27.765 --> 39:31.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know firsthand how scary that
process is, and how hard it is
to navigate that. And that's

39:31.836 --> 39:35.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why I was like, we need somebody
here that can demystify this for
the parents.

39:35.873 --> 39:40.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That focus has
given the school a reputation as
a promising avenue

39:40.044 --> 39:44.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the largely low-income
South Bronx to high-quality
colleges.

39:44.482 --> 39:46.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON DALY: We have four years to
get you into the best college.
That's what we will do.

39:46.184 --> 39:48.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All right?

39:48.019 --> 39:52.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the school
is making good on that promise.
Last year, every graduate

39:52.957 --> 39:57.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was admitted to college. Nine of
those 110 grads are at New York
University this year

39:57.795 --> 40:02.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with full or substantial
financial aid.

40:02.100 --> 40:05.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tiffany Marte is one of those
nine. She says a private
university seemed unrealistic
before

40:05.903 --> 40:08.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
working with her adviser.

40:08.439 --> 40:12.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIFFANY MARTE, Student: It was
more of a reach school for me,
and by reach, I mean like
impossible?

40:12.510 --> 40:17.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because it was like -- it was my
dream school. Like, it was in
the city. It had all the class

40:17.849 --> 40:22.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- all the courses that I wanted
to take, but it wasn't something
that I thought about.

40:22.520 --> 40:26.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Her classmate
Jeninne Ware was going to skip
filing extra paperwork for

40:26.257 --> 40:30.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
private scholarships. But her
adviser wouldn't let her off the
hook.

40:30.028 --> 40:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENINNE WARE, Student: The
weekend before it was due, I
completed it, because he texted

40:35.933 --> 40:40.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me, and he's like, are you --
did you do it? And I'm like, no,
I'm not going to a private

40:40.171 --> 40:43.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
school. So, he really
encouraged me to complete it.

40:43.508 --> 40:47.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Without that
prodding, Ware says she wouldn't
be where she is today.

40:47.278 --> 40:57.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Hari Sreenivasan in New York.

40:57.822 --> 41:05.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last night, we
told the story of a writing
program for juveniles in a
Chicago

41:05.396 --> 41:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
detention center.

41:08.700 --> 41:13.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In part two of his report,
Jeffrey Brown profiles a man who
lost his way and then found it
again,

41:13.771 --> 41:16.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in prison, through poetry.

41:16.574 --> 41:21.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS, Poet: All
our thoughts were beginnings.
And you became the roundness

41:21.312 --> 41:24.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that grew to a moon above
your mother's hips.

41:24.615 --> 41:29.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We first met
Reginald Dwayne Betts in Chicago
at the Cook County Juvenile

41:29.153 --> 41:32.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Temporary Detention Facility,
where he'd come to read his
poetry to young inmates and
answer

41:32.757 --> 41:35.059 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their questions.

41:35.059 --> 41:37.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: If I
never got caught, do I think --
so you're just going to put

41:37.395 --> 41:38.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
me on the spot like that?

41:38.229 --> 41:39.630 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:39.630 --> 41:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Does it take you
back when you walk in a place
like this?

41:42.633 --> 41:45.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: Mostly
no, because it's really
different walking in from the

41:45.570 --> 41:49.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side I walk in now. And so the
reason it takes me back is I
recognize how different the
experience

41:49.040 --> 41:51.142 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

41:51.142 --> 41:52.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, when I see the kids,
though, it takes me back,
because all of them remind

41:52.910 --> 41:55.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
me of me when I was younger.

41:55.947 --> 42:00.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Betts grew up 700
miles to the east in Suitland,
Maryland, a community

42:00.318 --> 42:02.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
southeast of Washington, D.C.

42:02.453 --> 42:05.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: This is
my first time being back in a
while, yes

42:05.757 --> 42:10.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He was a bright
child, an honor student who
loved to read, and had hopes for

42:10.228 --> 42:13.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
college, despite being
surrounded by drugs, occasional
violence and peers who'd been
locked

42:13.931 --> 42:15.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

42:15.800 --> 42:19.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: I
expected myself to be the
exception, despite the fact that
I

42:19.837 --> 42:23.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
smoked weed, just like everybody
else, and I kind of hung around
out here late at night,

42:23.408 --> 42:26.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just like everybody else. I
guess I thought I would end up
different.

42:26.310 --> 42:28.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why?

42:28.780 --> 42:31.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: I thought
I was smart. I thought I was
better. I thought I could

42:31.082 --> 42:35.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beat the odds, maybe. And I
thought the stuff that I was
doing wasn't that bad anyway.

42:35.987 --> 42:41.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That all changed
on the evening of December 7,
1996, at this mall in
Springfield,

42:41.959 --> 42:46.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Virginia, when then 16-year-old
Betts and a friend used a gun to
rob a man and steal

42:46.197 --> 42:48.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
his car.

42:48.666 --> 42:53.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: I
recognized carjacking was wrong
and it was crazy, but, in the
spur

42:53.237 --> 42:57.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the moment, I just didn't
think about it at all.

42:57.708 --> 43:01.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Betts was
arrested the very next day. It
was his first run-in with the

43:01.779 --> 43:06.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law. He was transferred to adult
court and later given a
nine-year sentence.

43:06.717 --> 43:11.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you go to prison, you're a
teenager, and you're among
adults.

43:11.122 --> 43:12.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: Yes.

43:12.290 --> 43:14.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Scary?

43:14.258 --> 43:19.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: Yes. I
couldn't go and bring my mom
water late at night if she

43:19.163 --> 43:22.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wanted water. I didn't have my
own bed to sleep in. So that was
part of being terrified,

43:22.667 --> 43:26.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is just what it meant for now
being an adult and to be on my
own.

43:26.771 --> 43:31.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the other part of being
terrified, I think, was just
partly prison is a dangerous

43:31.075 --> 43:33.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and scary place, and you never
know what's going to happen
from, you know, one moment

43:33.377 --> 43:35.480 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the next.

43:35.480 --> 43:40.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Reading became a
comfort, and one day changed his
life altogether when he

43:40.618 --> 43:44.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was handed a copy of Dudley
Randall's "The Black Poets," an
anthology that would open

43:44.755 --> 43:47.992 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
his eyes to the
possibilities of poetry.

43:47.992 --> 43:50.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What did it give you,
being there in prison?

43:50.895 --> 43:54.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: Well, the
poetry gave me ability to access
the world and communicate

43:54.165 --> 43:57.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
my ideas and my feelings
about the world.

43:57.301 --> 44:02.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, also, it was my idea of how
to be somebody. Being a poet,
for me, was being somebody.

44:02.773 --> 44:08.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it gave me something to
pursue, and I could easily tell
when I was doing it right

44:08.179 --> 44:13.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by people's response. And, also,
I just really admire poets,
Etheridge Knight, Sonia Sanchez,

44:13.351 --> 44:19.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Robert Hayden, Amiri Baraka,
Jack Gilbert, Agha Shahid Ali,
just people who I found able

44:19.690 --> 44:23.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to say something to me about a
world that I didn't know in
verse, and I just aspired

44:23.094 --> 44:25.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be able to do that.

44:25.863 --> 44:30.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: After getting out
of prison, Betts attended
community college, taught middle

44:30.301 --> 44:35.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
school, and earned his
undergraduate and master's
degrees. And he wrote, a memoir
and two books

44:35.506 --> 44:40.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of poetry. The latest is titled
"Bastards of the Reagan Era."

44:40.678 --> 44:44.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The poems, he says, speak of a
generation of black men lost to
drugs, violence and long

44:44.749 --> 44:46.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
prison terms.

44:46.851 --> 44:50.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: So lost
in terms of maybe not coming up
with a father in the house,

44:50.254 --> 44:53.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, more significantly, lost in
a way in which -- almost as if
the larger community

44:53.558 --> 44:56.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has abandoned you.

44:56.093 --> 44:59.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we can look around,
and we can look at the
playground. We could go to the
schools

44:59.830 --> 45:03.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and look at the school system,
and we could ask ourselves what
kind of opportunities were

45:03.034 --> 45:06.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
available for this kid
or that kid or that kid.

45:06.103 --> 45:09.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"For the City That
Nearly Broke Me."

45:09.407 --> 45:15.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"No indictment follows Malik's
death, follows smoke running
from a fired pistol. An old

45:15.913 --> 45:22.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
quarrel, crimson against
concrete and the officer's gun
still smoking. Someone says

45:22.486 --> 45:29.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the people need to stand up,
that the system's a glass house
falling on only a few heads."

45:29.160 --> 45:33.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I talk in D.C., a lot of
the poems were written when I
was teaching in Southeast.

45:33.431 --> 45:36.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was teaching in Hart Middle
School. And some of the poems
come out of that experience,

45:36.701 --> 45:41.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
just thinking about how
sometimes that it's just
overwhelmingly difficult.

45:41.305 --> 45:48.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, I had more moments
of just heartbreak, I think, and
tragedy teaching than I did in

45:48.446 --> 45:53.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prison. And so, in those poems,
I think I'm fixating on the
thing that causes me so much

45:53.050 --> 45:59.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pain, not to the exclusion of
everything else, but to the
point that I really want to have

45:59.223 --> 46:04.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to confront what it means to
meet somebody that you really
think is brilliant, and know

46:04.729 --> 46:11.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it might not pan out
for them the way you want.

46:11.035 --> 46:17.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Betts himself is
now finishing law school at Yale
University. And he's also

46:17.208 --> 46:21.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an advocate for prison reform,
particularly for the treatment
of juveniles.

46:21.078 --> 46:23.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: The
question is, do some people have
to get locked up to get to

46:23.814 --> 46:26.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that certain point where they
can make themselves better in
life?

46:26.150 --> 46:29.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And serves on the
White House Coordinating Council
on Juvenile Justice and

46:29.453 --> 46:32.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Delinquency Prevention.

46:32.056 --> 46:38.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When it came up when we were
together in Chicago from some of
the young inmates there, in a

46:38.329 --> 46:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sense, was it better for you to
go to prison? You started
reading, you started writing.

46:42.500 --> 46:44.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everything that's happened
to you since came from that.

46:44.869 --> 46:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: Yes, so I
guess I tend to push back on
that.

46:48.239 --> 46:53.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was fortunate in a lot of
ways. Like, I was safe in
prison, and you can't bank on

46:53.144 --> 46:58.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being safe in prison. You know,
you could say that prison was
the catalyst for all that,

46:58.616 --> 47:01.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I think that that would be
true, but there's also an
argument to be made that, for
that

47:01.786 --> 47:06.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to happen, a lot of things had
to fall in place in a perfect
way.

47:06.123 --> 47:10.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I always say that what that
signals is not the benefit of
prison, but what that signals

47:10.327 --> 47:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the dearth of opportunities
and the dearth of imagination in
the lives of a lot of young

47:16.100 --> 47:23.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
folks, that, really, we have to
rely on things like institutions
to supply the notion that

47:23.107 --> 47:28.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- not that you could rise above
your circumstances, but that
your circumstances should
include

47:28.012 --> 47:31.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something more, that your
circumstances should include
being a writer.

47:31.215 --> 47:33.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And
what is the plan now?

47:33.918 --> 47:36.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: The
plan now, to be a lawyer.

47:36.253 --> 47:37.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: To be a lawyer.

47:37.154 --> 47:39.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS:
To be a lawyer.

47:39.056 --> 47:43.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to try to solve big
problems. Somebody told me
yesterday that you don't go to
Yale

47:43.494 --> 47:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Law School to play it safe. And
he said, despite the fact that
you got three felonies, you're

47:49.567 --> 47:54.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
playing with house money, and
you need to make a decision
about what you could do that's

47:54.004 --> 47:57.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually ambitious and test the
possibilities of the world. And
can you think of ways to

47:57.942 --> 47:58.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
solve big problems?

47:58.843 --> 48:01.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And writing?

48:01.212 --> 48:04.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: And
writing, always writing. Writing
is like breathing, so always

48:04.115 --> 48:06.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
writing, always writing.

48:06.751 --> 48:11.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From Suitland,
Maryland, I'm Jeffrey Brown for
the "PBS NewsHour."

48:11.288 --> 48:16.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The first part of
Jeffrey Brown's report looks at
a writing program in one of

48:16.494 --> 48:30.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the nation's largest juvenile
detention facilities. That's on
our Web site at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

48:30.508 --> 48:39.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, another installment in
our series of "NewsHour" essays,
a long tradition of

48:39.617 --> 48:42.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the "NewsHour" that we
have resurrected recently.

48:42.520 --> 48:46.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from Nicholas
Thompson, the editor of "The New
Yorker" magazine's Web

48:46.323 --> 48:50.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
site, NewYorker.com.

48:50.461 --> 48:54.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We hear a lot these days about
how the Internet, social media,
and our addictive use of our

48:54.832 --> 48:59.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
handheld devices are reducing
our attention spans.

48:59.036 --> 49:04.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, in tonight's essay,
Thompson takes a distinctly
different point of view.

49:04.241 --> 49:06.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICHOLAS THOMPSON, "The New
Yorker": The word story is a
shortening of the word history

49:06.844 --> 49:10.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and derives from the work of
Herodotus 2,500 years ago.

49:10.447 --> 49:15.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wanted people to understand
the collision between the Greek
and Persian worlds, and

49:15.152 --> 49:18.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he wanted us to enjoy reading
what he wrote. The opening of
first book describes money,

49:18.956 --> 49:23.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sex, violence, and kidnapping.

49:23.427 --> 49:28.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For most of human history,
storytelling helped humans
survive. The societies that
first learned

49:28.032 --> 49:31.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to write kept better records,
planned their expeditions more
carefully, and described

49:31.635 --> 49:35.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the faraway lands they
would soon plunder.

49:35.239 --> 49:39.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, technology enabled
storytelling. Sharing stories is
easier when you can write

49:39.577 --> 49:44.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them down or when you can print
and bind them. Now, however, as
you may have heard, storytelling

49:44.882 --> 49:49.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is under threat. The Internet is
shortening our attention spans,
distracting us, quite

49:49.386 --> 49:53.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
possibly muddling the
structures of our brains.

49:53.524 --> 49:58.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I started writing long magazine
stories about 15 years ago,
right about when one of the

49:58.128 --> 50:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
main publishers of long magazine
stories, "Rolling Stone,"
declared it was abandoning

50:03.400 --> 50:07.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them. "I don't think people have
time to sit down and read," the
editor declared. And that

50:07.071 --> 50:10.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was before Twitter.

50:10.274 --> 50:14.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2008, Nicholas Carr published
his seminal essay, "Is Google
Making Us Stupid?" People,

50:14.879 --> 50:19.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he argued, have lost the ability
to read deeply. We can only
skim, bouncing between
hyperlinks,

50:19.250 --> 50:21.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
distracted by beliefs.

50:21.418 --> 50:25.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He bemoaned the fact that The
New York Times had started to
publish more and more news

50:25.389 --> 50:29.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
summaries. Carr later expanded
his article into a book, making
the same argument, but

50:29.793 --> 50:34.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more intensely. He called
it "The Shallows."

50:34.498 --> 50:39.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since then, you might think, the
argument has been vindicated.
Look at the Internet.

50:39.169 --> 50:44.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's plagued by short, shallow
rewrites of gibberish. We buy
books, but we don't read

50:44.008 --> 50:46.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them. Five years from now,
something will have been
invented that makes tweets seem

50:46.210 --> 50:48.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
long and ponderous.

50:48.646 --> 50:53.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, actually, look more
closely. The New York Times did
start publishing additional

50:53.851 --> 50:58.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
news summaries back then, but,
ever since, it has shifted huge
amounts of energy to long-form

50:58.689 --> 51:02.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
journalism. Even the criminals
in this tale, The Huffington
Post and BuzzFeed, have started

51:02.126 --> 51:05.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doing their own long form work.

51:05.195 --> 51:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Rolling Stone" is back in it,
for better or worse. "The New
Yorker" continues to run

51:09.266 --> 51:12.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
long stories every week. Likely
the best-read piece in the
history of the magazine's Web

51:12.703 --> 51:17.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
site is a 24,000-word
piece on Scientology.

51:17.841 --> 51:23.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The editors of longform.org get
classic referrals from the
dating site OkCupid, meaning
that

51:23.113 --> 51:28.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people are listing their love
of the site on their profiles.

51:28.052 --> 51:33.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, television has
evolved toward almost endless
and overwhelming complexity. The
shows

51:33.624 --> 51:38.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that define the '60s, '70s and
'80s, "Cheers," "The Simpsons"
or "Seinfeld," are cream cheese

51:38.595 --> 51:43.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bagels compared to the full
meals offered by "The Sopranos,"
"Breaking Bad," or "Games

51:43.434 --> 51:47.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Thrones." And I should add
that the latter show is, of
course, based upon a series of

51:47.237 --> 51:53.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
books written by George R.R.
Martin that cumulatively run
about 5,000 pages.

51:53.310 --> 51:58.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So what's happening? Technology
takes our time away, but it also
gives it back. Our

51:58.148 --> 52:02.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
smartphones, our computers, our
connection speeds make it
possible to process and absorb

52:02.820 --> 52:06.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever more information. We have
near infinite memories. It's
become easier to write, and

52:06.256 --> 52:09.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's become easier to read.

52:09.259 --> 52:13.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's something deeply human
about storytelling. It's part of
how we learn language as babies,

52:13.697 --> 52:17.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it's part of how we come to
understand our world as adults.
The intelligence of humans

52:17.901 --> 52:21.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is best thought of as a
combination of ourselves and our
machines.

52:21.338 --> 52:26.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And looked at this way, you
realize we're becoming smarter
and smarter every day. We

52:26.310 --> 52:30.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't have as much free time as
we used to, and the Internet has
created all kinds of

52:30.247 --> 52:34.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrible habits. Just try to
avoid checking your e-mail when
this ends.

52:34.585 --> 52:40.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But complexity surrounds us and
beckons us. It's hard not to
think that Herodotus would

52:40.157 --> 52:46.764 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be proud.

52:46.764 --> 52:54.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Before we go
tonight, in the last few
minutes, the White House has
released

52:54.805 --> 52:59.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
excerpts from tonight's State of
the Union address that the
president will be delivering

52:59.243 --> 53:03.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Congress in the coming hours.
The sections made public
highlight a vision for the
future

53:03.680 --> 53:07.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that includes healing the
current political divide.

53:07.618 --> 53:13.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Obama is expected to say --
quote -- "The future we want,
opportunity and security for

53:13.357 --> 53:19.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our families, a rising standard
of living and a sustainable,
peaceful planet for our

53:19.296 --> 53:24.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kids, all that is within our

And, meantime, on the "NewsHour"
online: With the Powerball
jackpot jumping to $1.5 billion,

53:43.887 --> 53:49.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the largest ever, you may be
thinking it's time to buy a
ticket or two. But, despite

53:49.226 --> 53:54.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the incredible negative odds,
playing the lottery still
delivers a thrill worth at least

53:54.998 --> 53:59.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the $2 for a ticket. Our Making
Sense columnist explains how.
