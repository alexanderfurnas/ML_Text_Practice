JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we turn
to the grinding civil war in
Yemen, which has also become

00:04.866 --> 00:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a proxy conflict
between neighboring
Saudi Arabia and Iran.

00:09.333 --> 00:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A two-and-a-half-year bombing
campaign has killed thousands.

00:13.066 --> 00:16.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Vast swathes of the
country lie devastated.

00:16.233 --> 00:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Compounding the horror, Yemen
is on the brink of famine.

00:19.500 --> 00:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are critical shortages
of aid and medical care,
and now an outbreak of
cholera is spreading.

00:26.400 --> 00:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The country has been essentially
closed to journalists for
months, but filmmaker Martin

00:30.800 --> 00:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Smith and his team from
"Frontline" were able to
gain access to Yemen in May.

00:37.766 --> 00:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Frontline" has a short
film on its Web site
documenting what they saw.

00:40.033 --> 00:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here is an excerpt, beginning
in the capital, Sanaa.

00:43.966 --> 00:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SMITH: It's not just
the jets you hear overhead, or
the buildings that are bombed,

00:51.400 --> 00:54.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or the airport
that's demolished.

00:54.033 --> 00:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the knock-on effects of
the war on infrastructure.

01:01.133 --> 01:04.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When we came into town,
what struck me right
away was the amount of
garbage on the streets.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The garbage workers hadn't
been paid in eight months.

01:10.933 --> 01:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rains came, washing through
the garbage, bacteria carried
into the water supply, people

01:18.800 --> 01:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
drinking bad water.

01:21.433 --> 01:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they were hit by
a cholera epidemic.

01:30.400 --> 01:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cholera simply dehydrates you
quickly, so that anything you
ingest, any water you drink

01:37.333 --> 01:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or food you eat just completely
passes through your system,
and you get no nutrients out

01:40.900 --> 01:43.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: She is very tired
because of the exhaustion
from the electrolyte
imbalance that she has.

01:48.366 --> 01:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She can't control herself now
until she gets enough fluid.

01:55.733 --> 02:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SMITH: The World Health
Organization is saying that
there are over 300,000 cases

02:03.033 --> 02:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of cholera; 1,600 people have
died, many of them children.

02:08.900 --> 02:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the numbers keep going up.

02:11.733 --> 02:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The hospital we visited, they
were already beyond capacity.

02:16.433 --> 02:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The nurses and doctors were
suffering from a lack of
medicines and equipment.

02:23.300 --> 02:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they were there working,
in spite the fact that
they hadn't been paid.

02:26.866 --> 02:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We don't get salary.

02:29.133 --> 02:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Last salary I got was
in September only.

02:32.800 --> 02:36.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If I will not work,
then they will die.

02:36.033 --> 02:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And maybe tomorrow, I will
be sick, and nobody will
see me because of no salary.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARTIN SMITH: People
often ask why the Saudis
are bombing Yemen.

02:53.866 --> 02:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a question for the Saudis.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will tell you they're
fighting against the rebel
group that's trying to take over

03:00.500 --> 03:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the country, who are backed
by their archrival, Iran.

03:07.433 --> 03:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet, in the time I was there,
it was hard to see really
what the Iranians were doing.

03:12.833 --> 03:17.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But the impact of the
Saudi-led coalition
bombing was very clear.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Parts of the country
have been isolated of
bomb strikes on bridges.

03:24.466 --> 03:26.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People on the ground
in Yemen are suffering.

03:26.033 --> 03:29.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're caught in the
crossfire of this war.

03:29.800 --> 03:34.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In Hajjah, we went
to a hospital.

03:36.833 --> 03:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I met a nurse there who
showed me pictures she'd taken
a day or two before of a young

03:41.766 --> 03:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
boy who came in severely
malnourished, and died.

03:46.233 --> 03:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
Of course one gets very upset.

03:50.733 --> 03:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
All of us here do.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We do our job, and
we love the child.

03:55.600 --> 04:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, in the end, they pass away.

04:00.266 --> 04:02.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's hard.

04:02.366 --> 04:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SMITH: She then was
called away to go take care
of a new severe malnutrition

04:07.300 --> 04:08.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
patient.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A mother came in with her child.

04:11.633 --> 04:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a little girl named
Aline, a seventh-month-old baby.

04:18.433 --> 04:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
For sure, it's a
consequence of the war.

04:26.566 --> 04:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The war is behind
the malnourishment.

04:28.633 --> 04:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it is only getting worse.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The cases have increased.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is a food shortage.

04:33.466 --> 04:35.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How are your living
conditions at home?

04:35.800 --> 04:40.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN (through
translator): Terrible.

04:40.300 --> 04:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SMITH: There were always
malnutrition cases in Yemen,
but the nurse told us that

04:48.300 --> 04:53.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the number of cases had
more than doubled since

04:56.366 --> 04:58.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the war.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And maybe an hour later,
another mother came
in with her daughter.

05:01.700 --> 05:02.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ruqayah her name.

05:02.700 --> 05:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a 5-year-old girl.

05:06.800 --> 05:11.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ruqayah had come from
an IDP, an internally
displaced persons camp.

05:11.300 --> 05:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's quite a ways away up
near the Saudi border, traveled
several hours, because the

05:17.500 --> 05:19.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hospital up near
her had been bombed.

05:19.966 --> 05:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): As
a result of these catastrophes,
they don't have the means

05:26.500 --> 05:30.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to travel from their
areas, which are usually
very far from ours.

05:30.933 --> 05:32.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So they wait.

05:32.900 --> 05:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was an
excerpt of "Inside Yemen," a
"Frontline" short film by Martin

05:39.500 --> 05:41.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Smith.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on the conflict and
the people caught in between,
we're joined from New York by

05:44.700 --> 05:46.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
David Miliband.

05:46.666 --> 05:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is president and CEO of the
International Rescue Committee,
a global aid agency, and

05:53.266 --> 05:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he served as foreign
secretary of the United
Kingdom from 2007 to 2010.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
David Miliband, welcome
back to the "NewsHour."

06:00.766 --> 06:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was a horrific film we
have just seen an excerpt of.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tell us more about just how bad
things are right now in Yemen.

06:08.533 --> 06:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND, President,
International Rescue
Committee: Well, I think
horrific is the right

06:11.333 --> 06:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
word for the tragedy
that's unfolding in Yemen.

06:15.366 --> 06:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is the modern face of
humanitarian catastrophe,
because Yemen represents
a political emergency,

06:21.633 --> 06:24.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as well as a
humanitarian emergency.

06:24.666 --> 06:28.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Yemen is one of four
countries threatened by
famine at the moment.

06:28.333 --> 06:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the numbers in Yemen
are absolutely staggering,
20 million people in
humanitarian need, over

06:35.266 --> 06:37.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
300,000 diagnosed
with cholera already.

06:37.766 --> 06:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And our teams on the
ground -- the International
Rescue Committee has
150 or 200 staff on the

06:42.133 --> 06:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ground in Yemen -- and what
they report is direct danger
to civilians from bombing as

06:49.066 --> 06:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of the war that's going
on, and indirect danger from
the consequences of war that are

06:55.200 --> 06:58.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
impeding access to --
of humanitarian workers
and have destroyed about
half of the hospitals

06:59.666 --> 07:01.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the country.

07:01.133 --> 07:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it really is complete
meltdown in Yemen at the moment.

07:03.200 --> 07:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if I were
to ask you what are people --
what are the main needs that

07:07.400 --> 07:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people have, it sounds as
if you're saying everything.

07:09.900 --> 07:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Yes, it is
everything, but I think one
can be specific, first of all,

07:14.500 --> 07:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the war needs to be
conducted within the confines
of international humanitarian

07:19.133 --> 07:21.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law.

07:21.166 --> 07:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
International humanitarian law,
which defends civilians from
attack, needs to be observed.

07:23.866 --> 07:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Secondly, the bombing
of hospitals needs to
be arrested and stopped.

07:28.166 --> 07:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thirdly, access for humanitarian
aide workers needs to be
supported, rather than impeded.

07:34.666 --> 07:38.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There's a threat to
the main port in Yemen,
the Hodeidah port.

07:38.300 --> 07:40.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's a threat
to bomb that port.

07:40.866 --> 07:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, it needs stronger
U.N. presence there to
ensure that food is able
to enter the country,

07:46.533 --> 07:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because, obviously, the
agriculture has been completely
ruined over the last few years

07:50.200 --> 07:52.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of war.

07:52.233 --> 07:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, fourthly, and critically,
there needs to be support
from the whole international

07:55.866 --> 08:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diplomatic and political,
as well as humanitarian
community for some kind
of political settlement

08:02.033 --> 08:04.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that can put ahold
to the fighting.

08:04.100 --> 08:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nearly two years ago at the
United Nations, I attended a
meeting of foreign nations of

08:07.033 --> 08:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gulf countries who said
they were committed
to finding a political
settlement, but, frankly,

08:13.233 --> 08:14.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's no nearer now
than it was then.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And civilians in Yemen
are paying the price.

08:16.700 --> 08:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why has
it gotten to this point?

08:19.800 --> 08:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You describe a situation that,
by stages, has gotten to a
point, as you're describing,

08:26.266 --> 08:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's going to be very difficult
to put this back together again.

08:28.233 --> 08:29.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID MILIBAND: You're
absolutely right.

08:29.600 --> 08:33.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, there are two
main reasons, I think.

08:33.100 --> 08:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, the war itself
has seen a significant
upping of the ante, first
of all, by the Saudi-led

08:40.133 --> 08:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coalition, the U.S. supporting
that, then the Iranians getting
involved, then retaliation

08:44.566 --> 08:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
against the Iranian involvement.

08:46.600 --> 08:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so you see an escalation
upon escalation, neither side
willing to compromise, for fear

08:51.966 --> 08:54.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of losing face.

08:54.033 --> 08:57.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The second thing that's
been happening is
that the humanitarian
tragedy and the failure

08:57.800 --> 09:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to protect civilians and deliver
humanitarian aid has, I'm
afraid, fueled the political

09:04.133 --> 09:05.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
emergency.

09:05.366 --> 09:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's provided fuel
for radicalism.

09:07.366 --> 09:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's entrenched both sides.

09:09.466 --> 09:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bloodletting has meant that
both the Houthi rebels and the
government who have the support

09:15.566 --> 09:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Saudis and the
American side have got
further and further apart.

09:19.733 --> 09:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A million refugees have
left the country, including
some fleeing to Somalia.

09:23.566 --> 09:27.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You have got a situation
where Somalia is safer
for them than Yemen.

09:27.566 --> 09:29.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And those are the
two main reasons.

09:29.166 --> 09:33.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There is one other
thing, just to further
enlighten your audience.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Yemen is a country that
is suffering terribly
from climate change.

09:36.866 --> 09:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanaa is predicted to be the
first capital city in the
world to run out of water.

09:40.333 --> 09:44.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So you have got chronic
long-term problems and
acute problems in the
short term as well.

09:44.933 --> 09:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A number of
guilty parties you're talking
about, including the United

09:50.400 --> 09:51.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What, politically, can be done?

09:53.400 --> 09:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you said a moment ago,
David Miliband, this is even
more a political crisis than

09:59.433 --> 10:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a humanitarian, as bad as it
is on a humanitarian level.

10:01.433 --> 10:03.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What has to be done?

10:03.466 --> 10:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: I think the
diplomatic and political muscle
needs to be applied to ensure

10:09.866 --> 10:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that there is a cease-fire, that
that then is built on with a
proper negotiated settlement,

10:16.400 --> 10:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because the truth is that the
current trajectory of the war
is in the interests of neither

10:18.866 --> 10:19.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
side.

10:19.866 --> 10:21.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No one is winning.

10:21.400 --> 10:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the civilians of Yemen
are losing very big time.

10:25.433 --> 10:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm pleased to say that
there are some senators
speaking up on this.

10:29.033 --> 10:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was in Washington on Monday.

10:31.266 --> 10:36.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is growing concern,
I think, in the Senate to call
on the U.S. administration

10:38.266 --> 10:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to persuade the Saudis to call
a halt to this bombing campaign,
which, as I say, is fueling

10:41.066 --> 10:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the insurgency, rather than
curbing it, and to give time
for humanitarian aid to get in.

10:48.133 --> 10:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it tells you something
that we in the humanitarian
sector are desperately calling

10:51.633 --> 10:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on there to be no bombing of
the main port through which
90 percent of the food gets

10:57.266 --> 10:58.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into Yemen.

10:58.933 --> 11:01.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Yemen is one of
four countries that are
threatened by famine.

11:01.600 --> 11:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a unique coalition of
eight American-led NGOs
have come together to
form a global emergency

11:08.000 --> 11:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
response coalition to call
on the American public to
support us in trying to staunch

11:14.500 --> 11:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the bloodshed, to staunch
the humanitarian suffering,
even while the war going on.

11:19.500 --> 11:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's for the diplomats
and the politicians to try
and bring the war to an end.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What's at
stake if that doesn't happen?

11:24.933 --> 11:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Suffering and
further fuel for the insurgency.

11:31.833 --> 11:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a downward spiral
to hell that really
needs to be arrested.

11:35.100 --> 11:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Miliband
of the International Rescue
Committee, thank you very much.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID MILIBAND:
Thank you very much.
