from Chicago visited former

David Boder's recordings are
among the earliest testimonies
from Holocaust survivors.

00:15.866 --> 00:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And long-missing reels of
songs from this collection
were recently discovered at the

00:20.300 --> 00:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
University of Akron, Ohio.

00:22.966 --> 00:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From PBS station WVIZ
ideastream in Cleveland,
David C. Barnett reports.

DAVID C. BARNETT: Jon Endres
gingerly threads a thin silver
strand of wire through a machine

00:34.700 --> 00:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that will reproduce some
sounds unheard for decades.

00:38.333 --> 00:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON ENDRES, University of Akron:
It runs much like a reel-to-reel
tape player, if you remember

00:46.233 --> 00:48.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
those.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Endres
is a media specialist at
the University of Akron.

00:50.766 --> 00:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His colleague James Newhall
spent three years building this
playback machine from spare

00:55.633 --> 00:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parts scrounged from
electronic stores and eBay.

00:59.200 --> 01:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The goal was to play some
mysterious recordings
made by psychologist
David Boder over 70 years

01:05.266 --> 01:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ago on a wire recorder.

01:07.366 --> 01:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BAKER, Cummings Center
for the History of Psychology:
One of Boder's areas of interest

01:10.600 --> 01:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and an important area of
his work was his work on
the measurement of trauma.

01:17.633 --> 01:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was the basis of his grant
in 1946 to travel to Europe to
interview a group of traumatized

01:26.133 --> 01:27.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

01:27.566 --> 01:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this included many
survivors of the Holocaust.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A collection of Boder material
was deposited here in 1967.

01:34.800 --> 01:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it included some
instruments and apparatus,
documents, and it included
a box of wire recordings.

01:42.533 --> 01:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: One, two, three,
one two, three.

01:45.933 --> 01:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BAKER: Scholars
were telling us that
there was a missing reel.

01:49.733 --> 01:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a reel of songs
that were sung to Boder by
Holocaust survivors in a camp in

01:56.400 --> 01:58.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
France after the war.

01:58.533 --> 02:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had a box of reels, and
scholars would ask from time
to time, do you know what's

02:01.866 --> 02:03.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on those?

02:03.200 --> 02:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we had to say, no, we don't.

02:05.133 --> 02:07.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID C. BARNETT:
But now they do.

02:07.433 --> 02:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: We are reproducing on this
spool a set of songs that have
been recorded 50 kilometers

02:15.166 --> 02:19.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Paris at a colony
of displaced persons.

02:19.966 --> 02:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Baker
says the recent discovery
of this long-missing
reel of songs in the

02:27.466 --> 02:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cummings Center archives has
sparked worldwide interest.

02:31.766 --> 02:36.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID BAKER: Two of the
songs were sung by a
woman named Guta Frank.

02:39.966 --> 02:44.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Guta Frank had survived
a number of the ghettos
in Poland, eventually
ending up in a -- doing

02:48.966 --> 02:53.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
forced labor at a
munitions factory.

03:01.233 --> 03:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One song they translated for
us: "Our village is burning."

03:08.133 --> 03:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In singing the song, she changed
the lyric from, "Our village
is burning" to "The Jewish

03:16.133 --> 03:18.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people are burning."

03:18.266 --> 03:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In introducing the song, Guta
Frank discussed the fact that
the composer's daughter would

03:25.166 --> 03:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sing this song in basements in
the Krakow ghetto, inspiring
people to rebel against

03:32.266 --> 03:34.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Nazis.

03:34.766 --> 03:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: For
concentration camp prisoners
who had no means of
writing down and preserving

03:43.333 --> 03:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what was happening to them,
they could sing songs about
it to each other and pass the

03:48.033 --> 03:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stories down in
an oral tradition.

03:50.733 --> 03:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Australian researcher
Joseph Toltz focuses the
music of the Holocaust.

03:55.033 --> 03:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, in this specialized
field, he's heard it all.

03:58.200 --> 04:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH TOLTZ, Researcher:
This was a beloved song
that traveled around the
entire Yiddish-speaking

04:03.166 --> 04:05.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
world, even to America
and other places.

04:05.666 --> 04:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Toltz is
particularly impressed with the
clarity of the Akron recordings.

04:09.966 --> 04:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH TOLTZ: This is a
technology that is 60, 70 years
old and completely outdated.

04:16.966 --> 04:20.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they have done it
in such a way that has
brought a completely
new quality to the sound

04:20.733 --> 04:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is sort of trapped
in these wire recordings.

04:24.033 --> 04:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Jon
Endres was the one who
made the digital transfer.

04:27.066 --> 04:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JON ENDRES: I remember
hearing Krakow.

04:30.300 --> 04:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I remember recognizing
some of the more German words
in Yiddish, and knowing full

04:37.300 --> 04:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well they were saying things
along the lines of burning and
dying, and it was extremely

04:41.966 --> 04:43.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
intense.

04:43.466 --> 04:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BAKER: It's a bit like
hearing the voice of a ghost.

04:49.333 --> 04:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here are voices that have
been silent for 70 years.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, all of a sudden,
they're singing.

04:54.733 --> 04:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're singing to us.

04:59.266 --> 05:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
