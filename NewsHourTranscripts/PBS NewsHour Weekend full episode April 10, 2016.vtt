04:19.593 --> 04:21.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ARGUMENT UNDERSCORES A NEW

04:21.261 --> 04:22.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAW IN TEXAS, THE NATION'S

04:22.963 --> 04:24.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

APPEALING CONVICTIONS BASED ON

04:26.666 --> 04:28.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNSOUND SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE,

04:28.902 --> 04:30.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETIMES CALLED "JUNK SCIENCE."

04:30.303 --> 04:31.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN TONIGHT'S SIGNATURE SEGMENT,

04:31.738 --> 04:32.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT ALISON

04:32.739 --> 04:34.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEWART WENT TO TEXAS TO SEE HOW

04:34.674 --> 04:38.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT LAW IS WORKING.

04:38.111 --> 04:38.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BABY.

04:39.746 --> 04:41.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I ADORED HIM.

04:41.381 --> 04:42.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS KIND OF ECCENTRIC.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAD HIS FLAWS.

04:44.651 --> 04:45.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT, OH MY GOD, HE WAS A GOOD

04:45.886 --> 04:46.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN.

04:46.820 --> 04:47.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

RICHARDSON.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE EARLY 1990S, CACY LIVED

04:52.259 --> 04:54.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FORT STOCKTON, TEXAS WITH HER

04:54.294 --> 04:55.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNCLE, WHO WAS IN HIS SEVENTIES

04:55.929 --> 04:57.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SUFFERING FROM A FORM OF

04:57.164 --> 04:58.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMENTIA.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 10TH,

05:00.066 --> 05:02.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1991, EVERYTHING CHANGED.

05:02.702 --> 05:04.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE NIGHT BEFORE WE WATCHED A

05:04.204 --> 05:07.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVIE TOGETHER.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BURT LANCASTER WAS IN IT, AND

05:08.308 --> 05:09.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS MY FAVORITE.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN WHEN THAT WAS OVER, IT

05:11.244 --> 05:12.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS A LATE MOVIE, I WENT TO BED,

05:12.913 --> 05:14.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE WERE BOTH ALIVE.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE THEN 44 YEAR OLD CACY

05:21.421 --> 05:22.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESCAPED THROUGH A WINDOW AND RAN

05:22.656 --> 05:24.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO A NEIGHBOR, WHO CALLED 911.

05:24.891 --> 05:26.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN EMERGENCY RESPONDERS FOUND

05:26.660 --> 05:28.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARDSON, THE 76-YEAR-OLD MAN

05:28.628 --> 05:30.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS DEAD.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AUTHORITIES SAID THE FIRE WAS

05:31.531 --> 05:32.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSPICIOUS.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN DID YOU SENSE, SONIA, THAT

05:34.367 --> 05:36.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE AUTHORITIES SUSPECTED YOU OF

05:36.570 --> 05:38.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SETTING THE FIRE?

05:38.004 --> 05:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THEY TOOK ME TO THE

05:39.172 --> 05:40.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOSPITAL.

05:40.407 --> 05:41.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WAS THERE EIGHT DAYS FOR SMOKE

05:41.575 --> 05:43.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INHALATION.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCRAPED ALL MY FINGERNAILS.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I SAID, "WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT

05:47.981 --> 05:50.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?" AND I WAS

05:50.183 --> 05:52.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL CRYING OVER UNCLE BILL.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE SAID, "BLOOD OR

05:54.221 --> 05:56.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHATEVER'S ON YOU."

05:56.289 --> 05:57.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: FIVE MONTHS LATER,

05:57.324 --> 05:58.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CACY WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED

05:58.858 --> 06:01.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH MURDER BY ARSON.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH

06:02.896 --> 06:04.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FIRE THAT OCCURRED ON

06:04.097 --> 06:05.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOVEMBER 10, 1991?

06:05.565 --> 06:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DID NOT.

06:08.468 --> 06:11.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DID NOT EVER, ANYTHING.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CACY'S ATTORNEY.

06:17.143 --> 06:18.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THEY CLAIMED THAT SHE HAD

06:18.345 --> 06:20.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOUSED HER UNCLE BILL, IN

06:20.780 --> 06:22.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GASOLINE AND SET HIM ON FIRE,

06:22.949 --> 06:24.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH KILLED HIM AND THEN BURNED

06:24.517 --> 06:25.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE HOUSE DOWN.

06:25.619 --> 06:26.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: AT THE TRIAL, THE

06:26.586 --> 06:27.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST CRITICAL PIECE OF

06:27.887 --> 06:29.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFORMATION CAME FROM A REPORT

06:29.256 --> 06:31.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY A TOXICOLOGIST, SOMEONE

06:31.091 --> 06:32.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAINED TO CHECK FOR DRUGS AND

06:32.392 --> 06:33.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHEMICALS IN THE BODY.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE TESTIFIED THAT ACCELERANT WAS

06:35.996 --> 06:38.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOUND ON RICHARDSON'S CLOTHING.

06:38.531 --> 06:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PROSECUTION'S FIRE

06:39.633 --> 06:41.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVESTIGATOR ALSO TESTIFIED THAT

06:41.501 --> 06:42.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BURN PATTERNS IN THE HOUSE WERE

06:42.936 --> 06:45.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDICATIVE OF AN ACCELERANT.

06:45.705 --> 06:49.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SONIA IS A REAL, LIVE EXAMPLE

06:49.609 --> 06:51.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF SOMEBODY WHOSE LIFE WAS

06:51.878 --> 06:55.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY DESTROYED BASED UPON BAD

06:55.649 --> 06:58.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCIENTIFIC TESTIMONY IN COURT.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: IN 1993, CACY, A

WIFE AND MOTHER OF THREE GROWN

07:01.388 --> 07:03.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

07:03.123 --> 07:04.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JURY TRIAL AND LATER SENTENCED

07:04.624 --> 07:07.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO 99 YEARS IN PRISON.

07:07.394 --> 07:09.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT A RELATIVELY NEW TEXAS LAW

07:09.095 --> 07:10.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD CHANGE CACY'S LIFE.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S KNOWN AS THE "JUNK SCIENCE

07:12.365 --> 07:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAW."

07:13.433 --> 07:15.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LAW OFFERS A DIRECT PATH TO

07:15.035 --> 07:16.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPEAL WHEN THERE IS SCIENTIFIC

07:16.770 --> 07:18.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVIDENCE THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE

AT THE TIME OF THE CONVICTION OR

07:19.939 --> 07:21.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS NEW EVIDENCE THAT

07:21.441 --> 07:23.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTRADICTS WHAT WAS USED TO

07:23.176 --> 07:24.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVICT.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE THE LAW, IT WAS

07:25.478 --> 07:26.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPOSSIBLE IN TEXAS TO APPEAL A

07:26.980 --> 07:28.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVICTION BASED ONLY ON FLAWED

07:28.815 --> 07:30.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THE INNOCENCE PROJECT OF

07:31.885 --> 07:33.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEXAS TOOK CACY'S APPEAL,

07:33.687 --> 07:35.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTORNEYS IMMEDIATELY QUESTIONED

07:35.422 --> 07:37.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TOXICOLOGIST'S RESULTS,

07:37.457 --> 07:39.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIFICALLY A CHROMATOGRAPHY

TEST, WHICH SEPARATES MIXTURES

07:41.394 --> 07:43.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOUND AT CRIME SCENES TO DETECT

MOLECULES LIKE THOSE FROM

07:44.597 --> 07:45.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GASOLINE.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HIS REPORT WHERE HE SAID THE

07:53.673 --> 07:55.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAUSE OF THE FIRE SHOULD BE

07:55.308 --> 07:57.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISTED AS A "UNDETERMINED."

07:57.243 --> 07:58.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT, THAT

07:58.545 --> 07:59.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS NO GASOLINE ON THE

07:59.646 --> 08:00.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLOTHING.

08:00.580 --> 08:01.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO YOU COULDN'T SAY THAT IT WAS

08:01.915 --> 08:03.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARSON.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DR. BUC IS THE EXPERT THAT THE

DISTRICT ATTORNEY HIRED.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

>> WHICH BACKFIRED, BECAUSE DR.

08:08.755 --> 08:10.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUC SAID THAT THE CHROMATOGRAMS

08:10.623 --> 08:13.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE "NEGATIVE FOR GASOLINE,"

08:13.126 --> 08:14.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT ALL OF OUR

08:14.661 --> 08:16.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BURNS.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

08:27.307 --> 08:29.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKELY HAPPENED IS THAT UNCLE

08:29.342 --> 08:33.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILL WAS A VERY CARELESS SMOKER.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE ACCIDENTALLY SET THE HOUSE ON
