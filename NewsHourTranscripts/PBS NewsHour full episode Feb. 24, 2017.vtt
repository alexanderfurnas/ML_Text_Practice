JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.441 --> 00:11.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
President Trump
keeps up his attack on the news
media, as

00:11.211 --> 00:17.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the White House bans CNN, The
New York Times,
The Los Angeles Times and others
from a press

00:17.618 --> 00:18.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
briefing.

00:18.619 --> 00:22.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then: face to face with voting
constituents.

00:22.589 --> 00:26.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans in Congress hear
complaints at
packed town hall meetings.

00:26.126 --> 00:30.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCI BANDELLI, Co-Founder,
Westfield 2020:
We never knew that this was in
our community.

00:30.130 --> 00:36.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We never knew the passion and
that these caring
people were here.

00:36.103 --> 00:37.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's Friday.

00:37.938 --> 00:41.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
analyze the
week's news.

00:41.108 --> 00:46.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: the story of a man who
offers a home
to terminally ill foster
children.

00:46.446 --> 00:48.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMED BZEEK, Foster Parent: I
know it's
heartbreak.

00:48.682 --> 00:51.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I know it's a lot of work.

00:51.118 --> 00:54.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I know it's going to hurt me
sometimes.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know, I feel sad.

00:56.823 --> 01:01.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in my opinion, we should
help each other,
you know?

01:01.628 --> 01:09.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:09.603 --> 01:12.339 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:12.372 --> 01:21.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The spotlight was
on President
Trump today, as he took the
stage at the annual

01:21.848 --> 01:25.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Conservative Political Action
Conference outside
Washington.

01:25.752 --> 01:30.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He touted his agenda and called
some news
outlets the enemy of the people.

01:30.657 --> 01:36.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's before a crowd of
activists who have
at times viewed him with a
skeptical eye.

01:36.229 --> 01:38.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang reports from the
conference.

01:38.198 --> 01:45.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Our victory was a victory and a
win for conservative

01:45.839 --> 01:47.507 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
values.

01:47.541 --> 01:52.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Trump moved
today to
put his brand on the
conservative movement,

01:52.045 --> 01:55.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
stressing his populist,
nationalist vision
of America first.

01:55.716 --> 02:02.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: There is no such
thing as a
global anthem, a global
currency, or a global

02:02.189 --> 02:03.590 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
flag.

02:03.624 --> 02:07.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the United States of
America that
I'm representing.

02:07.260 --> 02:10.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not representing the globe.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm representing your country.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:14.901 --> 02:19.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Speaking at the
Conservative Political
Action Conference, or CPAC, in a
packed hotel

02:19.306 --> 02:23.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ballroom, the president said he
is transforming
the Republican Party.

02:23.276 --> 02:33.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The GOP will be,
from now on,
the party also of the American
worker.

02:33.353 --> 02:40.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at how much bigger
our party has
gotten during this cycle,
millions and millions

02:40.360 --> 02:42.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of people were joining.

02:42.662 --> 02:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I won't say it was because
of me, but
it was, OK?

02:46.299 --> 02:48.101 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:48.135 --> 02:52.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump told the
enthusiastic
crowd he would soon sign a new
temporary travel

02:52.739 --> 02:57.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ban, a signature campaign
pledge, replacing
the executive order the federal
courts put

02:58.011 --> 02:59.646 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on hold.

02:59.679 --> 03:03.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And in a matter of
days, we
will be taking brand-new action
to protect

03:03.917 --> 03:08.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our people and keep America
safe.

03:08.221 --> 03:09.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You will see the action.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:11.391 --> 03:17.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I will never, ever
apologize
for protecting the safety and
security of

03:17.130 --> 03:18.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the American people.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I won't do it.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: While some conference
attendees
said they have reservations
about another

03:22.969 --> 03:29.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
key Trump policy position,
opposition to multinational
trade deals, it doesn't dampen
their enthusiasm

03:29.810 --> 03:31.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the president.

03:31.611 --> 03:33.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX GERSHUNY, CPAC Attendee:
Everything he
said, I agree with, with the
exception of

03:33.046 --> 03:34.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
maybe some of the trade stuff.

03:34.848 --> 03:40.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, I can't get 100
percent from
him, can't get 100 percent from
anyone, but,

03:40.554 --> 03:42.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
overall, I was very pleased.

03:42.756 --> 03:47.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Others said Mr.
Trump's election
is redefining the Republican
Party.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS MELVIN, CPAC Attendee: I
think there's
a lot of people that have the
conservative

03:49.663 --> 03:50.730 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
values.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, they just haven't come
out of the
closet.

03:53.500 --> 03:57.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, they were kind of
keeping low before,
but there's a lot of people I
have talked

03:57.537 --> 04:00.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to that said they have come out
since Trump
won.

04:00.941 --> 04:06.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The president also
devoted much
of today's speech to a favorite
topic: lambasting

04:06.146 --> 04:08.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what he calls the fake media.

04:08.115 --> 04:14.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I'm against the
people that
make up stories and make up
sources.

04:14.988 --> 04:20.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They shouldn't be allowed to use
sources unless
they use somebody's name.

04:20.627 --> 04:22.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: His latest target?

04:22.429 --> 04:28.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A CNN report that FBI officials
refused the
White House's request to knock
down reports

04:28.368 --> 04:33.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of alleged conversations between
Trump associates
and Russian intelligence
officials during

04:33.907 --> 04:36.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the 2016 campaign.

04:36.376 --> 04:41.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before this morning's speech,
the president
tweeted: "The FBI is totally
unable to stop

04:41.681 --> 04:45.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the national security leakers
that have permeated
our government.

04:45.919 --> 04:51.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Classified information is being
given to media
that could have a devastating
effect on U.S."

04:51.591 --> 04:55.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This afternoon, the Trump
administration's
relationship with the White
House press corps

04:55.295 --> 04:57.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hit another stumbling block.

04:57.097 --> 05:02.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Several news outlets, including
The New York
Times, CNN, and The Los Angeles
Times, were

05:02.569 --> 05:08.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
excluded from an informal,
off-camera briefing
with Press Secretary Sean
Spicer.

05:08.875 --> 05:11.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Conservative news organizations
were allowed
in.

05:11.444 --> 05:14.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House officials offered no
immediate
explanation.

05:15.015 --> 05:19.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang at CPAC
in Oxon Hill, Maryland.

05:19.853 --> 05:23.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's been much
reaction
late today to the decision by
the White House

05:23.957 --> 05:28.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to ban some news media outlets
from the briefing
in the press secretary's office.

05:28.795 --> 05:30.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's often called a gaggle.

05:30.597 --> 05:37.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two prominent organizations, the
Associated
Press and "TIME" magazine, chose
to boycott

05:37.270 --> 05:40.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attending in solidarity with
those news organizations.

05:40.440 --> 05:44.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sally Buzbee is the executive
editor and senior
vice president of the AP.

05:44.477 --> 05:46.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And she joins me now.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sally, thank you for being here.

05:47.447 --> 05:49.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why did the AP not attend that
briefing?

05:49.516 --> 05:51.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You were not shut out.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY BUZBEE, Executive Editor,
Associated
Press: We think that the public
deserves as

05:53.253 --> 05:57.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much access to the president and
other governing
officials as possible.

05:57.657 --> 06:02.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we find ourselves in a
situation where
national news organizations seem
to be being

06:02.395 --> 06:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deliberately excluded, we think
that's dangerous
territory.

06:06.199 --> 06:13.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is this White
House -- are
these behaviors, rules different
from previous

06:13.907 --> 06:15.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
White House rules?

06:15.242 --> 06:19.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SALLY BUZBEE: There is always
physical limitations
on access.

06:19.312 --> 06:26.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is always compromises that
we make and
sort of concessions that are
made for physical

06:26.720 --> 06:28.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
limitations and other things.

06:28.588 --> 06:31.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, when you get to the
point where there
are news organization that seem
to be being

06:31.992 --> 06:34.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deliberately excluded, I think
that's different.

06:34.494 --> 06:35.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We felt today was different.

06:35.862 --> 06:38.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, that hasn't
happened before,
to your knowledge?

06:38.465 --> 06:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SALLY BUZBEE: I can't speak for
all of history.

06:40.433 --> 06:42.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY BUZBEE: I think, in the
access fight
that we have been engaged in for
many decades,

06:44.738 --> 06:46.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this felt very different to us
today.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is the
problem?

06:48.108 --> 06:52.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For those -- for people who
don't know the
news media, what's the problem
for the press

06:52.345 --> 06:56.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if the White House says, well,
we're going
to talk the some news
organizations, but not

06:56.383 --> 06:58.184 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to others?

06:58.218 --> 07:01.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY BUZBEE: Obviously, the
White House has
the right to do what it wants,
and there are

07:01.788 --> 07:04.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situations where there might be
individual
types of reporters that it makes
more sense

07:04.758 --> 07:07.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to talk to, if it's economic
news or something
like this.

07:07.093 --> 07:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this was a general briefing,
where they
are talking about issues that
cover a wide

07:12.399 --> 07:14.234 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
range of topics.

07:14.267 --> 07:18.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the thing that the
public should
think about is, if there start
to be exclusions

07:18.772 --> 07:23.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and favorites picked and things
like that,
essentially all access in the
end is probably

07:23.043 --> 07:24.911 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to suffer.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sally Buzbee, I
want to ask
you about something else,
something the president

07:27.447 --> 07:30.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said in his speech today at that
conservative
conference.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said -- he talked about -- he
was critical
of the news media.

07:33.320 --> 07:37.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said some reporters make up
news and they
make up sources.

07:37.390 --> 07:43.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he went on to say that
reporters shouldn't
use sources unless they name
those sources.

07:43.096 --> 07:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want to ask you about that
in context,
say, for example, with a story
that ran late

07:46.966 --> 07:52.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today by the AP having to do
with an internal
report done by the Department of

Security, saying that there was
insufficient
evidence to show that citizens
from the seven

07:58.545 --> 08:03.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries, Muslim majority
countries, named
in the president's travel ban
pose a terror

08:03.583 --> 08:04.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
threat to the U.S.

08:04.951 --> 08:07.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, your organization ran that
story late
today.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There were no named sources.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, is this a story you stand
by?

08:12.225 --> 08:13.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And how do you explain this to
people?

08:13.960 --> 08:15.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SALLY BUZBEE: oh, absolutely, we
stand by
that story.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We think it's an important
story.

08:18.598 --> 08:22.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reporters attempt at all times
to get people
to talk to them with their names
attached,

08:22.502 --> 08:25.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because that obviously is the
gold standard.

08:25.605 --> 08:29.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there is information that you
cannot get
any other way, and you know that
it's factual

08:29.876 --> 08:33.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information, not spin, but
someone is in a
position to know what they're
talking about,

08:34.013 --> 08:37.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we think that information is
critically important,
and the public needs to know
about it.

08:37.951 --> 08:41.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's actually very difficult to
get the government
to tell you what they're doing.

08:41.254 --> 08:44.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We fight for information and for
facts every
day.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have for decades.

08:46.326 --> 08:49.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really a struggle to get
information,
factual information about what
the government

08:49.896 --> 08:51.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is doing.

08:51.765 --> 08:55.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we view it really as our
mission to find
out what the government is
doing, the actions,

08:55.835 --> 09:01.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the thoughts that they're
having, the decisions
they're mulling, and express
that to the public.

09:01.107 --> 09:05.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why we use anonymous
sources whenever
we have to.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't like it, but sometimes
it's the only
way to get facts to the public.

09:08.314 --> 09:14.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does the AP have
a plan for
what to do if President Trump
continues to

09:14.921 --> 09:20.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be as tough on the news media as
he is right
now, talking about fake news,
saying that

09:20.360 --> 09:23.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reporters are making up stories
and making
up sources?

09:23.129 --> 09:28.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY BUZBEE: I think we think
that a fight
between the government and any
government

09:28.535 --> 09:33.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
official and the media is
unfortunate, because
we think that people should be
focused on

09:33.306 --> 09:35.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the actual factual things that
are going on.

09:35.775 --> 09:40.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will say that we are going to
do what we
always do, which is, we are
going to fight

09:40.313 --> 09:44.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like mad to find out what's
going on in terms
of facts, and we are going to
report that

09:44.517 --> 09:45.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the public.

09:45.552 --> 09:46.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we are going to do that
every single day.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we are not going to stop.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's our plan.

09:50.790 --> 09:54.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sally Buzbee,
executive editor
of the Associated Press, thank
you very much.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SALLY BUZBEE: Thank you.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Appreciate it.

09:57.530 --> 10:02.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the day's other news: At
least 68 people
are dead, after a pair of
Islamic State bombings

10:02.235 --> 10:04.037 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Syria.

10:04.070 --> 10:08.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They happened near the northern
town of Al-Bab,
which Turkish and Syrian
fighters retook from

10:08.441 --> 10:09.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ISIS just yesterday.

10:09.976 --> 10:15.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In one attack, a suicide car
bomb exploded
outside a security checkpoint.

10:15.682 --> 10:20.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most of the dead were civilians
who were lined
up for permits to return home.

10:20.687 --> 10:26.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraq's air force struck Islamic
State targets
in Syria for the first time
today.

10:26.359 --> 10:32.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Warplanes hit two towns, in
response to recent
ISIS-claimed bombings in
Baghdad.

10:32.098 --> 10:36.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraqi forces are also battling
ISIS back in
their own country.

10:36.236 --> 10:41.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Troops pushed into the first
neighborhood
of Western Mosul, as part of a
now six-day

10:41.374 --> 10:42.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
offensive.

10:42.742 --> 10:49.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.N. says about 750,000
civilians are
trapped in the area.

10:49.482 --> 10:54.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Malaysian toxicologists have now
determined
that a chemical weapon was used
to assassinate

10:54.754 --> 10:58.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
North Korean leader Kim
Jong-un's half-brother.

10:58.258 --> 11:02.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was attacked at a crowded
airport in Kuala
Lumpur.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Margaret Warner has our report.

11:03.830 --> 11:08.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It's the latest
stunning
twist in a murder case already
brimming with

11:08.635 --> 11:10.603 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mystery.

11:10.637 --> 11:16.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Malaysian police now say Kim
Jong-nam, estranged
half-brother of North Korean
leader Kim Jong-un,

11:16.943 --> 11:20.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was killed by the deadly nerve
agent V.X.

11:20.113 --> 11:25.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two female assailants, caught on
surveillance
cameras, allegedly rubbed the
poison on Kim's

11:25.585 --> 11:28.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
face in an airport two weeks
ago.

11:28.187 --> 11:32.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're both under arrest, along
with several
North Koreans living in
Malaysia.

11:32.158 --> 11:35.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KHALID ABU BAKAR, Royal Malaysia
Police (through
translator): The chemical is
illegal.

11:35.795 --> 11:37.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is a chemical weapon.

11:37.964 --> 11:39.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are investigating how it
entered the country.

11:39.933 --> 11:44.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The discovery
of the nerve
agent has deepened speculation
that the North

11:44.470 --> 11:49.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Korean regime was behind the
apparent hit,
a charge Pyongyang has denied.

11:49.709 --> 11:55.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to the Centers for
Disease Control,
V.X. is among the most potent
nerve agents

11:55.181 --> 11:56.449 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the world.

11:56.482 --> 11:58.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is odorless, and tasteless.

11:58.751 --> 12:01.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tiny amounts can kill in
minutes.

12:01.387 --> 12:04.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Producing it requires
sophisticated equipment.

12:04.524 --> 12:09.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Experts say that points to North
Korea, which
has reportedly stockpiled the
chemical.

12:09.562 --> 12:14.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jean Lee is the former Pyongyang
bureau chief
of the Associated Press.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She spoke to us via Skype from
Seoul.

12:16.636 --> 12:22.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN LEE, Journalist: The other
thing, obviously,
that it confirms to us, if it
indeed is the

12:22.508 --> 12:26.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work of the North Koreans, is
that they are
making chemical weapons and that
they are

12:26.813 --> 12:28.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
willing to use them

12:28.548 --> 12:32.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Malaysian
authorities said
they began to suspect V.X. was
used after

12:32.518 --> 12:34.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one of the attackers fell ill.

12:34.787 --> 12:36.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, who was their target?

12:37.023 --> 12:41.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kim Jong-nam was the eldest son
of former
North Korean leader Kim Jong Il,
and once

12:41.928 --> 12:44.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
considered his heir apparent.

12:44.297 --> 12:50.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But after he was caught trying
to enter Japan
illegally in 2001, reportedly to
visit Disneyland,

12:50.670 --> 12:52.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he fell out of favor.

12:52.772 --> 12:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His half-brother Kim Jong-un
ascended to power
when their father died in 2011.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kim Jong-nam had been living in
exile.

13:00.446 --> 13:06.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jean Lee says North Korea's
leader might have
seen his half-brother as a
threat to his legitimacy.

13:06.319 --> 13:12.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN LEE: Perhaps he was angry
that his half-brother
had been speaking out against
the regime.

13:12.859 --> 13:15.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This, of course, is illegal
under North Korean
law.

13:15.328 --> 13:20.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it could have been a strong
message that
he was sending to North Koreans
overseas,

13:20.700 --> 13:23.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
including his brother, including
defectors.

13:23.403 --> 13:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The younger Kim
has purged
many relatives within North
Korea in the past.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He had his uncle executed in
2013.

13:33.012 --> 13:38.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Malaysian officials say they
will decontaminate
the airport to eliminate any
residual trace

13:38.117 --> 13:39.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the nerve toxin.

13:39.719 --> 13:42.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

13:42.088 --> 13:46.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So far, there
have been no
reports of any innocent
bystanders in the

13:46.626 --> 13:48.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
airport falling ill.

13:48.795 --> 13:53.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the FBI is
investigating
a possible hate crime, following
a shooting

13:53.533 --> 13:59.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Kansas this week; 51-year-old
Adam Purinton
has been charged with killing an
Indian-American

13:59.906 --> 14:01.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
engineer Wednesday night.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A second Indian-American man was
wounded.

14:04.343 --> 14:08.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Purinton is accused of opening
fire at a bar
outside Kansas City.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A bartender said he used --
quote -- "racial
slurs."

14:11.350 --> 14:14.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the victim's brother
called on Indian
officials to act.

14:14.854 --> 14:20.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VENU MADHAV, Brother of Victim:
Government
should voice out this strongly,
because our

14:20.560 --> 14:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
brothers, sisters and our
relatives are there.

14:24.797 --> 14:30.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you really look into this
incident,
this is not done by a teenager
or a burglar

14:30.636 --> 14:32.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or something like that.

14:32.305 --> 14:35.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After the
shooting, Purinton
was found and arrested in
Missouri.

14:35.942 --> 14:39.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, he was extradited back to
Kansas.

14:39.746 --> 14:42.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And stocks edged higher on Wall
Street today.

14:42.281 --> 14:45.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 11
points to close at 20821.

14:45.184 --> 14:51.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly 10, and
the S&amp;P 500
added three.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the week, the Dow gained 1
percent.

14:53.826 --> 14:57.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500
added a fraction
of a percent.

14:57.964 --> 15:02.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
two views
on what the Democratic Party
should stand

15:02.702 --> 15:08.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for now; grassroots efforts to
derail the
Trump agenda find inspiration in
Tea Party

15:09.008 --> 15:19.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tactics; Mark Shields and David
Brooks take
on the week's news; and much
more.

15:19.051 --> 15:25.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tactics; Mark Shields and David
Brooks take
on the week's news; and much
more.

15:25.792 --> 15:30.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
November's presidential defeat,
along with
years of losses in Congress,
governor's mansions

15:30.696 --> 15:36.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and statehouses have left the
Democratic Party
with less power at the federal
and state level

15:36.536 --> 15:39.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than it has had in more than 80
years.

15:39.071 --> 15:43.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the Democratic National
Committee prepares
to elect its new leader this
weekend, we want

15:43.676 --> 15:46.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to assess the state of the party
with Jaime
Harrison.

15:46.979 --> 15:52.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the chair of the South
Carolina Democratic
Party and, until yesterday, a
contender for

15:52.285 --> 15:54.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the job himself.

15:54.120 --> 15:58.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Symone Sanders, she's a
political strategist
for Priorities USA.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a Democratic super PAC.

16:00.359 --> 16:05.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's also the former national
press secretary
for Senator Bernie Sanders'
presidential campaign.

16:05.998 --> 16:08.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the "NewsHour."

16:08.467 --> 16:10.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to start with you,
Jaime Harrison.

16:10.469 --> 16:14.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What should the message of the
Democratic
Party be right now?

16:14.340 --> 16:17.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAIME HARRISON, Chairman, South
Carolina Democratic
Party: Well, hopefully tomorrow,
Judy, the

16:17.810 --> 16:20.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
message is a unified one.

16:20.513 --> 16:25.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We really need to have a chair
right now to
help lead the resistance, to
push back against

16:25.451 --> 16:30.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Donald Trump and the
rubber-stamp Republican
Congress that we have right now.

16:30.256 --> 16:35.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen some unprecedented
things over
the course of the past few
weeks.

16:35.094 --> 16:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the first time in the
history of this
country, a vice president had to
pass a tie-breaking

16:40.499 --> 16:42.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
note for a nominee.

16:42.468 --> 16:47.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the first time, we have
someone like Jeff
Sessions in the Justice
Department leading

16:47.540 --> 16:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that effort, an anti-Semite, who
-- in Steve
Bannon in the White House with
the president's

16:54.213 --> 16:55.648 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ear.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Time and time again, we have had
these issues
with this administration.

16:58.985 --> 17:02.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the Democratic message
is, enough is
enough.

17:02.288 --> 17:06.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is time to really put America
back on the
right track.

17:06.359 --> 17:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that means eventually
getting rid of Donald
Trump and the Republican
Congress.

17:10.229 --> 17:13.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That is mostly an
anti-Trump
message.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Symone Sanders, is there a
positive message
right now for Democrats?

17:15.635 --> 17:17.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SYMONE SANDERS, Former Sanders
Campaign National
Press Secretary: Oh, definitely.

17:17.436 --> 17:21.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Look, I think there is
tremendous opportunity
for Democrats right now.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can see in the streets all
across the
country, whether it's the
airports, whether

17:24.977 --> 17:29.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's the women's march, whether
it's town
halls during this recess,
people, Democrats,

17:29.916 --> 17:33.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans, and independents,
are standing
up and saying they want to, one,
hold their

17:33.519 --> 17:36.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elected officials accountable,
and, two, they
care about the issues.

17:36.756 --> 17:43.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so Democrats need to focus
on the overall
message of explaining who we are
as Democrats

17:43.129 --> 17:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what does it mean to be a
progressive and
how Democrats are going to fight
for the American

17:47.266 --> 17:48.901 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

17:48.935 --> 17:51.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe we have to beat back
Donald Trump,
but we did that during the
general.

17:51.704 --> 17:55.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Priorities, their role was to
make Donald
Trump unpopular.

17:55.374 --> 17:57.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they succeeded.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we know Hillary Clinton is
now not the
45th president of the United
States.

17:59.979 --> 18:02.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, folks want to hear more than
the other
guy is bad.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want to know what Democrats
are going
to do for them.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's also the challenge that
the party sees
going forward.

18:06.686 --> 18:10.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jaime Harrison,
looking forward
to the results of the election
in November,

18:10.823 --> 18:15.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what's more important for
Democrats now, to
focus on winning back
working-class white

18:15.227 --> 18:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters or to shore up the
Democratic base
among African-Americans, among
labor union

18:21.233 --> 18:22.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
members and so forth?

18:22.735 --> 18:26.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAIME HARRISON: Judy, it's not
an either/or
thing.

18:26.205 --> 18:30.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to work on and fight for
working people
in this country.

18:30.576 --> 18:38.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The same issues that
working-class African-Americans,
working-class Latinos,
working-class white

18:38.484 --> 18:40.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people are dealing with, they
are the same
issues.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are all struggling to make
sure that
they put food on the table.

18:44.523 --> 18:48.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're all struggling to make
sure that there
is a living wage, so that they
can provide

18:48.861 --> 18:50.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for their family.

18:50.663 --> 18:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're all struggling in
schools that are
crumbling, or driving on roads
that are falling

18:54.834 --> 18:56.635 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
apart.

18:56.669 --> 19:00.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, if we can address all
those issues,
as Symone said, if we can come
up with what

19:00.506 --> 19:06.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our message is, and not only
talk about that
message, but demonstrate that, I
think we

19:06.846 --> 19:13.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can make great inroads with the
American people,
regardless of their ethnicity,
their background

19:13.252 --> 19:14.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or their religion.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what has to be the
focus over the
course of the next few years.

19:17.723 --> 19:21.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Symone Sanders,
you agree it's
not either/or, that Democrats
have to do both,

19:21.660 --> 19:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or is it time to turn more focus
to the white
working-class Americans, which
some Democrats

19:27.266 --> 19:28.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are saying it is?

19:28.601 --> 19:31.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SYMONE SANDERS: Look, I think
it's a false
choice, actually.

19:31.237 --> 19:35.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for the Democrats that are
saying it's
time to turn more focus toward
the white working-class

19:35.408 --> 19:40.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Americans, I would say that they
have to take
a hard look at our message.

19:40.179 --> 19:44.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Look, Bernie Sanders was
extremely successful
during the Democratic primary
because Bernie

19:44.216 --> 19:45.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
talked about the issues.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He talked about the fact that
folks want to
know, what are you going to do
to help me

19:48.020 --> 19:52.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put more money in my pockets,
more food on
the table, and help keep my kids
safe, our

19:52.925 --> 19:56.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
communities safe, and good
education, good
schools, great jobs?

19:56.095 --> 19:58.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is what the American people
want to talk
about.

19:58.697 --> 20:02.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, folks in McDowell County,
West Virginia,
have some of the same issues and
concerns

20:02.935 --> 20:07.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as people, working-class urban
folks in downtown
Chicago.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.107 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

20:08.140 --> 20:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that is where Democrats need
to go.

20:10.709 --> 20:15.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this argument about whether
we move to
the coasts or we come to the
middle, look,

20:15.681 --> 20:17.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm from Omaha, Nebraska, OK?

20:17.550 --> 20:22.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think many people
think of black
people when you think of Omaha
and Nebraska.

20:22.188 --> 20:23.956 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

20:23.989 --> 20:26.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SYMONE SANDERS: But that's where
we need to
focus, the message, not
necessarily the coasts

20:26.625 --> 20:28.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or the white working-class.

20:28.427 --> 20:31.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we expect
to know tomorrow
who the party is going to choose
as its new

20:31.063 --> 20:32.431 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
chair.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yesterday, Jaime Harrison, you
-- you were
a candidate yourself.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have thrown your support to
Tom Perez.

20:37.369 --> 20:39.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Just quickly tell us why.

20:39.205 --> 20:44.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAIME HARRISON: Well, listen,
Judy, I think
the next chair has to -- one of
the reasons

20:44.043 --> 20:48.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why I dropped out is because, in
the end of
the day, I saw that the votes
were not there.

20:48.481 --> 20:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, it would have
been great to
go on the floor and get a number
of votes.

20:53.185 --> 20:58.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, I, based on our
whip count,
was in third place at the time.

20:58.724 --> 21:01.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that wasn't for the best
interests of
this party.

21:01.794 --> 21:06.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to have a very unified
message coming
out of this vote tomorrow, that
we're all

21:06.932 --> 21:08.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the same page.

21:08.868 --> 21:13.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so rather than drag three
and four and
five ballots so that it looks
like the Democratic

21:13.572 --> 21:17.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party is divided and didn't know
where we
were going, I wanted to make
sure that we

21:17.176 --> 21:19.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could focus on -- there are two
people in
this race can win.

21:19.778 --> 21:24.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's either going to be Tom
Perez of Keith
Ellison, who I respect both of
them tremendously

21:25.017 --> 21:26.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and known both for a while now.

21:27.019 --> 21:31.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the end of the day, I
thought that
the next chair has to be a
builder, has to

21:31.490 --> 21:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be a organizer, has to be a
visionary and
a fighter.

21:34.059 --> 21:36.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I thought Tom Perez fit that
mold.

21:36.829 --> 21:37.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's why I'm supporting
him.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Symone Sanders, you have not
endorsed anyone
for chair.

21:41.233 --> 21:45.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think both of these, that
all the candidates
running are equally qualified to
lead the

21:45.905 --> 21:46.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
party going forward?

21:46.906 --> 21:48.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYMONE SANDERS: Absolutely.

21:48.407 --> 21:52.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the Democrats are in
great hands,
regardless of who wins tomorrow.

21:52.111 --> 21:56.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, regardless of who wins,
we're going
to have to come together, we're
going to have

21:56.048 --> 21:57.783 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
unify.

21:57.816 --> 22:00.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And each one of those candidates
for chair
will have real work to do if
elected as chair

22:00.619 --> 22:02.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Democratic National
Committee.

22:02.254 --> 22:06.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, look, I'm here for the
millennials and
the brown folks, as I like to
say.

22:06.492 --> 22:10.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I and my peers and
millennials all across
this country are poised and
ready to hold

22:10.663 --> 22:12.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the next chair accountable.

22:12.498 --> 22:15.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm going to ask
each of you,
if you boil down the Democratic
Party message

22:15.935 --> 22:18.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to one sentence, Jaime Harrison,
what is it?

22:18.704 --> 22:23.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAIME HARRISON: We are the party
that believes
in opportunity for all.

22:23.876 --> 22:27.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regardless of your background,
your religion,
who you love, we believe that
you should all

22:27.913 --> 22:31.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have the ability to live the
American dream.

22:31.550 --> 22:33.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Symone
Sanders?

22:33.118 --> 22:34.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYMONE SANDERS: I co-sign that.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would just like to add we
are also the
party that is for the people, by
the people,

22:37.923 --> 22:39.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and all about the people.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we are
going to
leave it there.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we will also be watching
tomorrow's vote.

22:43.963 --> 22:46.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Symone Sanders, Jaime Harrison,
thanks to
both of you.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYMONE SANDERS: Thank you.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Members of
Congress have been
on recess this week.

23:02.414 --> 23:07.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Usually, that would mean a
number of constituent
town halls in their home states
and districts.

23:07.753 --> 23:13.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But fewer than 30 Republicans
are holding
those meetings, as protests grow
outside some

23:13.259 --> 23:19.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
district offices, and
constituents rally inside
the town halls that are
scheduled.

23:19.164 --> 23:23.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our team traveled to one of them
in Northern
New Jersey, near New York City,
to see the

23:23.936 --> 23:25.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dynamics in play.

23:25.371 --> 23:28.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins reports from the
Garden State.

23:28.874 --> 23:35.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Five-term New
Jersey Congressman
Leonard Lance is about to hold
his 41st town

23:35.781 --> 23:39.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hall, but, tonight, the scale is
different.

23:39.118 --> 23:44.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He walks out to face more than
1,000 people
ready to let him hear it, and
still scores

23:44.456 --> 23:46.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more are protesting outside.

23:46.292 --> 23:51.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I'm very concerned with
what Trump is
doing with our country, and what
our congressman

23:51.096 --> 23:52.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is allowing him to do.

23:52.197 --> 23:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEVERLY SMITH, New Jersey: We
should do something.

23:53.699 --> 23:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We should change what's going
on, and we should
do it now.

23:57.069 --> 23:58.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

REP.

23:59.405 --> 24:00.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEONARD LANCE (R), New Jersey:
Very good.

24:00.673 --> 24:01.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Thank you very much for
choosing my
lucky number.

24:01.740 --> 24:04.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It is polite
tension.

24:04.476 --> 24:08.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those at the microphones give
their local
hometowns and ask questions that
strike deep

24:08.847 --> 24:10.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into national territory.

24:10.382 --> 24:12.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Why repeal?

24:12.384 --> 24:14.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why not reform the ACA?

24:14.620 --> 24:18.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: All of us feel betrayed
because you
have flip-flopped on your
position on the

24:18.991 --> 24:19.958 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
environment.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.327 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Do you support impeachment?

24:21.360 --> 24:23.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Lance sometimes
surprises
the crowd by agreeing:

REP.

24:25.731 --> 24:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEONARD LANCE: I was the first
Republican
in New Jersey to criticize the
initial executive

24:29.835 --> 24:30.803 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

24:30.836 --> 24:31.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

24:31.837 --> 24:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But, more
often, he differs.

REP.

24:35.174 --> 24:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEONARD LANCE: I don't believe
the Ways and
Means Committee should be
investigating the

24:39.945 --> 24:42.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
returns of private individuals.

24:42.147 --> 24:43.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: He's the president.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's the president.

24:45.551 --> 24:49.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's a public individual.

24:49.888 --> 24:53.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This fury has
been building
since the election, and it
exploded across

24:53.992 --> 24:59.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country in the past week,
Congress' first
week of recess in the Trump
presidency.

24:59.231 --> 25:02.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Arkansas, Senator Tom Cotton
heard about
the Affordable Care Act.

25:02.768 --> 25:09.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I can tell you, three
members of my
family, including me, that would
be dead and

25:09.174 --> 25:12.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
homeless if it wasn't for ACA.

25:12.611 --> 25:14.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

25:14.346 --> 25:19.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In Iowa, for
Senator Chuck
Grassley, immigration and
religion.

25:19.051 --> 25:22.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I am a person from a Muslim
country,
and I am a Muslim.

25:22.254 --> 25:23.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who is going to save me here?

25:23.989 --> 25:28.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For Senate
Leader Mitch McConnell,
there was concern about miners.

25:28.260 --> 25:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: And the last I heard,
these coal jobs
are not coming back, and now
these people

25:34.767 --> 25:36.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't have the insurance they
need because
they're poor.

25:36.702 --> 25:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The outcry is
in some liberal-leaning
areas, but also in places where
the clear

25:39.838 --> 25:42.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
majority of voters is Republican
or moderate.

25:42.875 --> 25:48.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Here in New Jersey's 7th
District, Congressman
Lance is particularly on the
radar because

25:48.313 --> 25:53.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's been seen as moderate in
the past, and
because Hillary Clinton won this
district

25:53.085 --> 25:55.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in November.

25:55.053 --> 25:57.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
National Democrats are now
targeting his district.

25:57.890 --> 26:02.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And unless he's a check against
President
Trump, voters like these want
him out, too.

26:02.828 --> 26:05.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Do you guys have Lindsey
Graham over
there?

26:05.097 --> 26:06.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

26:08.333 --> 26:12.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEONARD LANCE: Meet Westfield

group only a few months old,
today writing

26:12.871 --> 26:14.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
postcards to lawmakers.

26:14.973 --> 26:17.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most have never done anything
like this before.

26:17.910 --> 26:23.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That includes founders Marci
Bandelli and
Lillian Duggan, Democrats and
working moms

26:23.148 --> 26:25.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who were casual acquaintances,
and then, suddenly,
allies.

26:25.851 --> 26:31.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCI BANDELLI, Co-Founder,
Westfield 2020:
After the election, devastating
election,

26:31.723 --> 26:33.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lillian reached out to me.

26:33.492 --> 26:35.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LILLIAN DUGGAN, Co-Founder,
Westfield 2020:
It just occurred to me that, you
know, even

26:35.327 --> 26:38.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
though I was very sad, that we
needed to do
something.

26:38.096 --> 26:43.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought, people need to
figure out how
this happened and start
organizing.

26:43.669 --> 26:50.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCI BANDELLI: Being from the
New York and
New Jersey area, we know Donald
Trump.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is a showman.

26:52.711 --> 26:58.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Theirs is one
of nearly a
dozen new anti-Trump groups in
the congressional

26:58.383 --> 27:00.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
district since the election.

27:00.385 --> 27:04.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This one started on Facebook,
and is now more
than 1,600-members strong.

27:04.056 --> 27:10.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LILLIAN DUGGAN: It's important
that our representation
in Congress is -- thinks
critically about

27:10.929 --> 27:15.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what Donald Trump is doing, and
is able to
stand up to his policies.

27:15.734 --> 27:19.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCI BANDELLI: We never knew
that this was
in our community.

27:19.605 --> 27:25.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We never knew the passion and
that these caring
people, were here.

27:25.944 --> 27:31.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really rescued us from this
pit that
we're really in.

27:31.517 --> 27:33.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And -- and everybody's
motivated.

LISA DESJARDINS: Two hundred
miles away, from
his living room in Washington,
D.C., Ezra

27:39.358 --> 27:44.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Levin is trying to galvanize all
that local
motivation into a national
strategy for the

left.

27:46.532 --> 27:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EZRA LEVIN, Executive Director,
Indivisible:
The theory of change here is
that Donald Trump's

27:47.666 --> 27:49.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agenda doesn't depend on Donald
Trump.

27:49.535 --> 27:53.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It depends on whether or not
individual members
of Congress choose to
rubber-stamp that or

27:53.839 --> 27:55.607 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
resist it.

27:55.641 --> 27:58.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He's executive
director of
Indivisible, a progressive group
with growing

27:58.577 --> 28:01.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
numbers of chapters and a
borrowed game plan.

28:01.547 --> 28:06.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EZRA LEVIN: The inspiration for
the guide
strategy and tactics is the Tea
Party.

28:06.685 --> 28:11.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They understood back in 2009
that they didn't
have agenda-setting power.

28:11.990 --> 28:14.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They didn't have the House, the
Senate or
the presidency.

28:14.693 --> 28:17.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They had the power to respond
and resist.

28:17.329 --> 28:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they did through going to
town halls,
through meeting with their
members of Congress

28:20.799 --> 28:22.534 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in person.

28:22.568 --> 28:25.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Rutgers
political science
Professor Ross Baker says, so
far, the Tea

28:25.637 --> 28:27.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Party comparison is only
superficial.

28:27.573 --> 28:30.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSS BAKER, Political Science
Professor, Rutgers
University: The real question
is, can it be

28:30.242 --> 28:32.010 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sustained?

28:32.044 --> 28:36.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Tea Party managed to --
managed to get
that going and sustain it over a
long period

28:36.214 --> 28:43.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of time, because, I think, their
focus was
much more targeted, on
Affordable Care Act

28:43.322 --> 28:46.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, subliminally, at least, on
President
Obama personally.

loud voices
at the moment across the
country.

28:53.832 --> 28:56.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: A lot of folks
mention the
word anger.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think there's anger going

now?

REP.

28:59.404 --> 29:03.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEONARD LANCE: I observed some
anger, that
I think that's definitely the
case.

29:03.308 --> 29:07.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I try never to be angry.

29:07.913 --> 29:16.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's much better to try to
reason with people,
listen to their concerns, and to
have a constructive

29:16.521 --> 29:17.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dialogue back and forth.

29:17.923 --> 29:20.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: On that much,
his constituents
agree.

29:20.626 --> 29:22.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCI BANDELLI: I'm not angry.

29:22.861 --> 29:24.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm motivated.

29:24.196 --> 29:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LILLIAN DUGGAN: We're sort of we
have started
a business, right?

29:28.166 --> 29:32.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at the same time we have
started the business,
we're offering a product, which
is activism,

29:32.471 --> 29:34.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and I think camaraderie as well.

29:34.172 --> 29:37.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This group
stresses none
of them is paid.

29:37.275 --> 29:39.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They even buy their own stamps.

29:39.645 --> 29:43.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's despite what the White
House press
secretary has said about
organizations like

29:43.615 --> 29:45.384 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
theirs.

29:45.417 --> 29:47.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press

People are clearly upset, but
there is a bit

29:47.386 --> 29:50.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of professional protester,
manufactured base
in there.

29:50.455 --> 29:54.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: President Trump
weighed in,
tweeting: "The so-called angry

29:54.960 --> 29:59.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually, in numerous cases,
planned out by
liberal activists."

Back at the New Jersey town
hall, the volume
rises in the final 30 minutes.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.404 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

30:05.437 --> 30:12.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEONARD LANCE: I believe that
when, the president
misstates, as, for example, the
facts...

30:12.744 --> 30:14.579 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Lies.

30:14.613 --> 30:20.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: With calls for
Lance to oppose
the president, the congressman
holds his own

30:20.085 --> 30:21.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and tries to look ahead.

30:21.787 --> 30:27.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He tells the crowd that, to meet
demand, he
will hold another town hall
Saturday.

30:27.225 --> 30:30.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Marci Bandelli, watching
quietly, is also
making plans.

30:30.796 --> 30:33.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Her group will be here, too.

30:33.165 --> 30:36.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins
in Westfield, New Jersey.

30:36.735 --> 30:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, from that,
let's turn
to the analysis of Shields and
Brooks.

30:40.472 --> 30:44.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

30:44.976 --> 30:48.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, gentlemen, Mark, let's just
talk about
this right now.

30:48.280 --> 30:56.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you see this energy or
this emotion
and anger, what does it mean
coming at these

30:56.121 --> 30:57.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republican town halls?

30:57.923 --> 31:03.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, first of
all, a shout-out
for Congressman Lance for doing
it, and for

31:03.495 --> 31:09.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a thoughtful interview with
Lisa, for having
another town meeting, because
several of his

31:09.634 --> 31:15.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
colleagues have tucked tail and
run and ducked
it.

31:15.240 --> 31:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so the energy, Judy, is
real.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no doubt about it.

31:20.512 --> 31:25.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think Ross Baker put the
point well,
the political philosopher and
teacher, when

31:25.884 --> 31:29.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he said, it isn't as focused.

31:29.287 --> 31:30.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's quite diffuse.

31:30.422 --> 31:33.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are those who want to
impeach Donald
Trump.

31:33.825 --> 31:38.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, I hate to tell
people who are
concerned about it, is not going
to be impeached.

31:38.296 --> 31:43.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The American people believe in
giving somebody
a fair chance.

31:43.702 --> 31:44.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's a new president.

31:44.903 --> 31:48.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been troubles, there
have been
problems.

31:48.573 --> 31:54.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the stock market just set 10
days in a
row of new records, whether
because of him

31:54.946 --> 31:56.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or in spite of him.

31:56.581 --> 31:59.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that's -- but the energy is
real.

31:59.518 --> 32:03.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the question is, can it be
focused, can
it be disciplined, can it be
sustained?

32:03.622 --> 32:05.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you answer
all those
questions?

32:05.357 --> 32:08.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: First, I think
Donald Trump
is not going to be impeached
this month.

32:08.627 --> 32:11.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's not close out
possibilities.

32:11.329 --> 32:12.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would say a couple of things.

32:12.998 --> 32:18.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think that what's happening
is great
and that people are active and
people are

32:18.236 --> 32:20.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just involved in the democratic
process.

32:20.205 --> 32:23.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Tea Party thing is only apt
in some ways.

32:23.708 --> 32:26.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The activism in the town halls,
that looks
superficially like it.

32:26.778 --> 32:31.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what the Tea Party did was,
they went
after the party, the Republican
Party, as

32:31.383 --> 32:32.517 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their vehicle.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And parties is how you change
history.

32:34.319 --> 32:37.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's fine to be an activist,
but you're
not -- if you're not putting up
candidates,

32:37.155 --> 32:40.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you're not getting political,
if you're
not in your party, then you're
probably not

32:40.992 --> 32:41.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to have long-term change.

32:41.993 --> 32:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You will probably dissipate.

32:43.862 --> 32:46.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then it's tempting to
remember that the
Tea Party had a peak and then
the Republican

32:46.898 --> 32:48.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Party establishment sort of beat
it back down.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so these things are won in a
day.

32:50.602 --> 32:54.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the final thing the Tea
Party had
was, they fed into the
philosophy that Donald

32:54.306 --> 32:55.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump now embodies.

32:55.707 --> 32:58.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they had a different view of
how the world
should be governed.

32:58.810 --> 33:02.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they had a lot of things
that we didn't
appreciate going for them as
time went by.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, it did lead
to something,
Mark.

33:04.482 --> 33:05.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Oh, it certainly
did.

33:05.483 --> 33:09.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It led to the Republican
takeover in 2010.

33:09.120 --> 33:13.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Kevin McCarthy, who is now
the House majority
leader, was pretty open.

33:13.725 --> 33:18.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He went out and recruited
candidates who had
emerged from that movement.

33:18.396 --> 33:23.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Republicans in the House
have paid
a price for it ever since,
because they cannot

33:23.668 --> 33:30.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pass anything comprehensive or
real because
of the Freedom Caucus, which is
the child,

33:30.742 --> 33:32.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the product, the progeny of the
Tea Party.

33:32.911 --> 33:36.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But to both of
you just quickly,
you're hearing some Republicans,
you're hearing

33:36.548 --> 33:43.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the White House saying, well, a
lot of this
is orchestrated, it's been
somebody sitting

33:43.154 --> 33:44.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there sort of pulling the
strings.

33:44.389 --> 33:45.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

33:45.390 --> 33:46.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How genuine is
this?

33:46.391 --> 33:48.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It's genuine.

33:48.293 --> 33:53.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, the argument of those who
are being
criticized at any time, the
civil rights movement

33:53.465 --> 33:58.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forward, the anti-war movement
forward, is,
it's always outside agitators
doing it.

33:58.870 --> 34:02.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Wall Street Journal had a
pretty good
piece yesterday that this is
organic.

34:02.607 --> 34:04.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not organized.

34:04.342 --> 34:05.543 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's real.

34:05.577 --> 34:08.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are -- are there people
nationally working
on it?

34:08.179 --> 34:09.314 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sure.

34:09.347 --> 34:11.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But people who are emerging are
from those
districts.

34:11.149 --> 34:15.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Tom Cotton hears a woman
stand up in
Arkansas and said three members
of my family

34:15.787 --> 34:23.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be dead but for ACA,
including me, and
where do you get your insurance,
Senator,

34:23.194 --> 34:24.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're all going to be asked
that.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, it's genuine.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And there's
nothing wrong with
being organized.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:29.034 --> 34:31.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Things that change
history tend
to be organized.

34:31.269 --> 34:38.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I do think what the Tea
Party also
had was Obamacare and the
unpopularity of

34:38.143 --> 34:39.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that, at least at the time.

34:39.911 --> 34:43.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so whether there is
something that is
equally unpopular and equally
galvanizing

34:43.481 --> 34:48.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is almost self-destructive
from the administration,
that's another factor that we
will wait and

34:48.286 --> 34:49.454 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
see.

34:49.487 --> 34:51.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will
wait and see
about that.

34:51.289 --> 34:52.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, meantime, right now -- and
we talked
about it a few minutes ago on
the show, Mark

34:52.524 --> 34:56.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- the Democrats are about to
choose a new
party chair.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We were talking about the
message of the party.

34:58.663 --> 35:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you hear a clear message
coming from the
Democrats?

35:01.099 --> 35:04.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think it matters whether
they come
together around any message
right now?

35:04.336 --> 35:05.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Sure.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It will, Judy.

35:06.504 --> 35:09.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, no, I don't hear any clear,
coherent
message.

35:09.908 --> 35:15.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, when you're a party out
of power,
it's the time to be a national
party chair.

35:15.313 --> 35:18.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the party holds the White
House, all
the political decisions are made
in the White

35:18.650 --> 35:19.684 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
House.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And being a party chair, you're
just an artifact.

35:21.252 --> 35:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, being a party chair, you
really have
a chance to make a difference.

35:24.322 --> 35:28.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but what the Democrats have to
do is recognize
and accept the fact that they're
at their

35:28.293 --> 35:32.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lowest point since 1928 in the
United States
House of Representatives and
their lowest

35:32.364 --> 35:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
point since 1925 in states.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they have got to start
winning elections.

35:38.003 --> 35:42.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That involves not some great
idea, but it
also involves recruiting
candidates.

35:42.974 --> 35:49.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of
Chicago, who
has given obnoxiousness a new
definition in

35:49.114 --> 35:53.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
his personal behavior,
oftentimes in his dealings
with the press, had a very good
point.

35:53.952 --> 35:57.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, the Democrats have
to do what
he did when he was chairman of
the Democratic

35:57.655 --> 36:03.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Campaign Committee,
recruit veterans,
recruit football players,
recruit businesspeople.

36:03.461 --> 36:07.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's what the job
of the new
party chair has to be.

36:07.298 --> 36:09.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess, to me, the fundamental
thing -- well,
I guess I see a lot of people
debating this

36:12.937 --> 36:14.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the wrong way.

36:14.739 --> 36:16.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of the debate is, should
we go to the
coasts, should we go to the
center, should

36:16.141 --> 36:18.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we go to the left, should we go
to the right?

36:18.376 --> 36:21.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Trump is instructive here,
actually.

36:21.079 --> 36:24.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You figure out, what is the
crucial issue
facing the country right now?

36:24.783 --> 36:29.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for Trump, it was that the
global economy
and the international world
order were failing

36:29.621 --> 36:31.056 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
regular people.

36:31.089 --> 36:32.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so he said, that's the
crucial issue.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to take a clear stand
on that issue.

36:35.560 --> 36:36.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And he did.

36:36.561 --> 36:37.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's very internally
consistent.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he won with it.

36:39.264 --> 36:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the Democrats, they're
trying to avoid
having the Sanders-Clinton
debate over and

36:42.434 --> 36:43.601 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over again.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, to some degree, they're
sentenced to
that debate.

36:45.837 --> 36:49.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton is much more embracing
of the global
economy and the international
world order.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sanders and Warren are much less
so.

36:51.476 --> 36:53.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have got to figure out
which side
the party is on, if they're
going to have

36:53.845 --> 36:54.979 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a clear message.

36:55.013 --> 36:57.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think this is probably one you
probably
can't straddle.

36:57.282 --> 37:03.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when you
hear, as we heard
earlier, when they say, well,
opportunity

37:03.455 --> 37:06.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for all, you're saying it's got
to be more
specific?

37:06.424 --> 37:10.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: You have got to
have -- Franklin
Roosevelt had a pretty clear
line.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ronald Reagan had a pretty clear
line, people
who rescue parties.

37:13.631 --> 37:16.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it doesn't have to be the
same line that
we have had for the last 40
years, because

37:16.634 --> 37:18.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that clearly isn't working on
any level.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you have got to have a
pretty clear line
on this crucial issue.

37:21.506 --> 37:26.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Basically, global capitalism,
basically to
support it, or is it to be
opposed?

37:26.678 --> 37:29.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is international order to be
supported, or
is it to be opposed?

37:29.447 --> 37:31.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans have taken a very
clear line.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats can have a different
version of
the line, or they can just say,
no, we are

37:34.119 --> 37:39.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the party of international peace
and activism,
and we're the party that's going
to have a

37:39.124 --> 37:40.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
civilized capitalism.

37:40.125 --> 37:41.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Two points.

37:41.960 --> 37:47.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, that's way above
the job description
and job definition of a party
chair.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
That is.

37:49.234 --> 37:53.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That will be fought out in the
primaries in
1920 -- in 2020.

37:54.005 --> 37:54.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:55.006 --> 37:57.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Before that, in
2018 as well.

37:57.342 --> 38:04.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Franklin Roosevelt also ran
on a balanced
budget in 1932, and the greatest
president,

38:04.983 --> 38:07.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
certainly, of the 20th century.

38:07.185 --> 38:13.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, so the idea that
you lay out
a predicate right now, Donald
Trump has recreated

38:13.958 --> 38:15.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Republican Party in his
image.

38:15.660 --> 38:17.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We saw that at the CPAC
convention, Judy.

38:17.362 --> 38:19.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was a total surrender of
the Reagan era.

38:19.831 --> 38:20.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ronald Reagan is gone.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wow.

38:22.033 --> 38:23.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He is nothing but
a distant
memory.

38:23.768 --> 38:25.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gone?

38:25.570 --> 38:28.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, seeing that
party today,
I mean, he stood up and he said,
you finally

38:28.239 --> 38:30.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have a president, you finally
have a president.

38:30.608 --> 38:32.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I am the future.

38:32.210 --> 38:33.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what did he get?

38:33.778 --> 38:37.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hosannas and huzzahs and
genuflection.

38:37.215 --> 38:40.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a total takeover of the
conservative
movement.

38:40.151 --> 38:44.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Like, that's what the
conservative movement
has become, is basically an
annex of the Trump

38:44.822 --> 38:45.790 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I wish I could
disagree.

38:47.192 --> 38:48.993 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:49.027 --> 38:51.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think the
two are now
one, that it's the Trump and the
conservative...

38:51.196 --> 38:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I don't know if it
will be forever,
but, for this moment, yes, for
sure.

38:55.366 --> 39:00.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Steve Bannon went to the CPAC
this week and
he said that there was a very
important historical

39:00.238 --> 39:04.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turning point, getting rid of
the TPP.

39:04.475 --> 39:08.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Republican Party has
stood for that
for as long as I have been
alive.

39:08.846 --> 39:13.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then Trump today, he -- you
know, buy
American, buy American,
anti-free trade, and

39:13.651 --> 39:14.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
got big cheers.

39:14.886 --> 39:19.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're waving Russian flags,
probably partly
as a joke.

39:19.357 --> 39:23.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, still, the party has become
an ethnic
nationalist party.

39:23.561 --> 39:27.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think it's just
because they,
oh, that we agree with Trump on
some things

39:27.232 --> 39:28.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and not on others.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think, over the last 10
years, a lot
of Republicans have decided it's
not working,

39:33.638 --> 39:37.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the party believed in, free
trade, global
capitalism, open borders.

39:37.075 --> 39:42.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They looked at basically the
failed wars and
they said, oh, this, us being
the policeman

39:43.014 --> 39:44.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the world, that is not
working.

39:44.782 --> 39:48.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so something really serious
has shifted
in the minds of Republicans and
certainly

39:48.653 --> 39:50.521 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
others.

39:50.555 --> 39:53.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But aren't there
still Republicans
who say, CPAC doesn't represent
me, that I'm

39:53.524 --> 39:58.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not part of the conservative
movement, I'm
a Republican, but I'm not there?

39:58.229 --> 39:59.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Sure.

39:59.330 --> 40:01.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely.

40:01.132 --> 40:04.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, this is a group, don't
forget, that
gave its presidential straw
ballot to Ron

40:04.068 --> 40:06.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paul, Ron Paul, and Rand Paul
and Rand Paul.

40:06.604 --> 40:11.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they have abandoned what --
their libertarian
values and instincts to embrace
Trump.

40:11.709 --> 40:16.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Judy, gone is any mention of
American exceptionalism.

40:16.547 --> 40:21.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I happen to believe that twice,
three times
in the 20th century, the United
States saved

40:21.452 --> 40:26.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Western democracy, both World
War -- both
World Wars and the Cold War.

40:26.691 --> 40:28.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you're
hearing about
America first.

40:28.593 --> 40:34.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: But America's
exceptionalism,
American leadership, the
American model, the

40:34.065 --> 40:38.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American values are not --
they're something
that end at the border.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're something that are just
for us.

40:41.539 --> 40:45.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And American responsibility is
-- there is
no mention of it.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

40:47.412 --> 40:48.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had the clip earlier in the
program of
Trump saying: I'm not president
of the globe.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm president of the United
States.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Reagan would have never said
that.

40:52.483 --> 40:56.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eisenhower would have never said
that, because
he would have said, yes, I'm
president of

40:56.354 --> 40:58.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States, but it's in
our interests
to be securing a world order.

40:58.690 --> 40:59.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: A citizen of the
world.

41:00.024 --> 41:02.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And that is -- the
two are so
intricately linked.

41:02.927 --> 41:04.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Trump sees an opposition
between the two.

41:04.962 --> 41:06.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a very different mind-set.

41:06.764 --> 41:09.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing that has changed
-- and this
is more detailed to CPAC than
the general

41:09.767 --> 41:16.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Party -- is they have
always been
an outsider, Ann Coulter, sort
of protest

41:16.107 --> 41:18.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
style, a little ruder than most
Republicans.

41:18.843 --> 41:21.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this goes back all the way
to Reagan.

41:21.145 --> 41:25.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Lee Atwater, Reagan's
strategist, had no patience
for CPAC, because he thought
they were sort

41:25.116 --> 41:27.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of wild and immature, basically.

41:27.518 --> 41:29.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so that's always been a
strain.

41:29.420 --> 41:35.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, it's interesting how
identity politics
and Ann Coulter-style tactics
have now blossomed.

41:35.226 --> 41:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they were always there in
CPAC.

41:37.061 --> 41:39.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK, just about a
minute, a
minute-and-a-half left.

41:39.530 --> 41:41.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want to quickly ask you.

41:41.332 --> 41:46.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are careful about how we talk
about President
Trump and the news media,
because we think

41:46.471 --> 41:51.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can quickly get into a
situation, Mark,
where you are looking at
yourself and being

41:51.142 --> 41:53.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a little too self-referential,
any of us in
the news media.

41:53.444 --> 41:55.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

41:55.246 --> 41:59.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what I want
to ask both
of you, quickly, is, is this
something that

41:59.517 --> 42:06.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the press -- that's going to
begin to define
the press, the president's
constant, daily

42:06.524 --> 42:10.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying fake news, the press is
dishonest,
the press makes things up?

42:10.294 --> 42:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, Judy, he's
moved from
the enemy being Barack Obama,
now gone, fading

42:15.566 --> 42:18.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is Hillary Clinton, and there is
no question
he's chosen the enemy.

42:19.003 --> 42:27.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought what Steve Bannon said
yesterday
was probably more chilling or
more threatening

42:27.812 --> 42:31.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than anything the president
says, I mean,
because he said, it's a constant
day.

42:31.582 --> 42:33.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to defeat the press.

42:33.785 --> 42:39.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Kennedy, after the
Bay of Pigs,
said to Turner Catledge of The
New York Times:

42:39.457 --> 42:43.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wish you had written more, I
wish you had
investigated more, because it
might have saved

42:43.628 --> 42:45.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country of the cataclysm of
the Bay of
Pigs.

42:46.030 --> 42:54.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, that's the job of
a free press
is to hold the lamp up, to
investigate, to

42:54.038 --> 42:55.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hold accountable.

42:55.873 --> 43:01.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And denying access, as Sean
Spicer did today,
is the first step toward a
dictatorship.

43:01.312 --> 43:02.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

43:03.014 --> 43:07.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's both strategic, to get
people's minds
off other things, and to pick an
internal

43:07.852 --> 43:09.554 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
enemy.

43:09.587 --> 43:12.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of his psychodynamics
to always
care about his press coverage
intensely.

43:12.290 --> 43:14.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's more interested in that
than anything
else.

43:14.559 --> 43:15.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Will it to stick?

43:15.793 --> 43:18.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, I tend to think not,
the fake media.

43:18.996 --> 43:20.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I'm sure little Marco didn't
think it
would stick.

43:20.898 --> 43:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm sure crooked Hillary didn't
think it would
stick.

43:22.800 --> 43:26.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These labels do have a certain
power to them.

43:26.737 --> 43:28.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so we will see how it plays
out.

43:28.306 --> 43:30.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will see.

43:30.508 --> 43:38.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Brooks, Mark Shields,
thank you both.

43:39.016 --> 43:45.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

43:45.122 --> 43:52.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the story of
a good man
on a quiet and heartbreaking
mission, one

43:52.096 --> 43:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many people would never consider
undertaking.

43:54.899 --> 43:59.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He worked for years in
obscurity, until recent
notice brought this remarkable
man and his

43:59.837 --> 44:01.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
story to light.

44:01.606 --> 44:06.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Los Angeles, special
correspondent Gayle
Tzemach Lemmon brings us this
profile.

44:06.177 --> 44:08.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMED BZEEK, Foster Parent:
What are you
doing?

44:08.479 --> 44:12.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Mohamed
Bzeek has become
something of a local hero here
in Los Angeles

44:12.984 --> 44:13.951 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recently.

44:13.985 --> 44:15.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOHAMED BZEEK: I am not an
angel.

44:15.987 --> 44:17.655 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I am not a hero.

44:17.688 --> 44:21.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just what we are supposed
to do as a
human being.

44:21.058 --> 44:25.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: In 1978,
Bzeek, then
a former marathon runner, came
to the U.S.

44:26.030 --> 44:28.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from Libya to study engineering.

44:28.099 --> 44:32.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He met his wife here in the
U.S., and became
a citizen in 1997.

44:32.303 --> 44:35.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, today, he is a different
kind of champion.

44:35.706 --> 44:37.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
His distinction?

44:37.508 --> 44:42.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is the only foster parent in
this city
of four million who cares solely
for terminally

44:42.713 --> 44:45.850 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ill children.

44:45.883 --> 44:47.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What happens if you get sick?

44:47.251 --> 44:48.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOHAMED BZEEK: Father doesn't
get sick day.

44:48.853 --> 44:51.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: It is not
a glamorous
job.

44:51.155 --> 44:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMED BZEEK: You have to do it
from your
heart, really.

44:53.958 --> 44:57.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you do it for money, you're
not going to
stay for long.

44:57.662 --> 45:03.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Over
almost three decades,
he and his wife cared for scores
of children.

45:03.534 --> 45:07.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ten have died in his care.

45:07.038 --> 45:11.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most of the children he's taken
recently are
born with terminal illnesses.

45:11.042 --> 45:15.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, they are abandoned or
born to parents
with drug addiction.

45:15.680 --> 45:19.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once they enter the foster care
system, the
county works to connect them
with foster parents

45:19.984 --> 45:21.986 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like Mohamed.

45:22.019 --> 45:26.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The memories of the children, he
says, still
live with him every day.

45:26.457 --> 45:31.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMED BZEEK: And this is my
kid who died
with the cancer.

45:31.963 --> 45:34.031 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He has a cancer.

45:34.065 --> 45:35.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
He died.

45:35.600 --> 45:41.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They operate on him, and they
find the cancer
separate all of his organs.

45:41.138 --> 45:49.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the doctor said, let's
stitch him back,
and said, there's nothing we can
do for him.

45:49.413 --> 45:53.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Today, he
lives with
a 6-year-old foster daughter
born with microcephaly,

45:53.351 --> 45:57.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a rare disorder in which a
baby's brain doesn't
fully develop.

45:58.022 --> 46:00.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She cannot see or hear.

46:00.324 --> 46:03.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She responds only to touch.

46:03.527 --> 46:07.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At seven weeks old, the county
took her from
her biological parents.

46:07.498 --> 46:11.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They called Bzeek, and he agreed
to take her
in.

46:11.435 --> 46:17.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also cares for his biological
son, Adam,
who himself was born in 1997
with brittle

46:17.942 --> 46:22.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bones, dwarfism and other
physical challenges.

46:22.647 --> 46:26.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Taking in critically ill
children is a painful
process.

46:26.183 --> 46:29.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He knows at the start their time
together
will be short.

46:29.553 --> 46:31.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOHAMED BZEEK: I know it's
heartbreak.

46:31.656 --> 46:33.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I know it's a lot of work.

46:33.891 --> 46:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I know it's going to hurt me
sometimes.

46:37.061 --> 46:39.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know, I feel sad.

46:39.597 --> 46:43.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in my opinion, we should
help each other,
you know?

46:43.934 --> 46:48.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Much of
his dedication,
he says, derives from his faith.

46:48.506 --> 46:51.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Bzeek is a practicing Muslim.

46:51.208 --> 46:55.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his story gained special
notice recently,
after President Trump issued an
executive

46:56.013 --> 47:01.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
order seeking to bar immigrants
from seven
majority Muslim nations,
including his own

47:01.686 --> 47:03.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
home country of Libya.

47:03.821 --> 47:07.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bzeek says he sees the negative
stereotypes
out there.

47:07.425 --> 47:08.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But he is not deterred.

47:08.626 --> 47:12.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOHAMED BZEEK: As a Muslim, I
don't hate nobody.

47:12.897 --> 47:13.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I love everybody.

47:13.898 --> 47:15.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I respect everybody.

47:15.666 --> 47:19.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: His faith
has continued
to guide him through many
heartbreaks.

47:19.236 --> 47:21.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His wife passed away in 2015.

47:21.672 --> 47:26.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After your wife died, did you
ever think,
this is actually too much for
one person to

47:26.210 --> 47:27.178 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do?

47:27.211 --> 47:29.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOHAMED BZEEK: Sometimes.

47:29.447 --> 47:32.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I know somebody who needs
help.

47:32.616 --> 47:34.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will do it as long as I am
healthy.

47:34.552 --> 47:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Now he has
a nurse's
aide that helps with care on
weekdays from

47:38.756 --> 47:40.524 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
8:00 to 4:00.

47:40.558 --> 47:47.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, still, it's a full-time
job, one he handles
by himself every night and every
weekend.

47:47.698 --> 47:52.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With his foster daughter's
seizures happening
more and more often, he usually
sleeps near

47:52.203 --> 47:54.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
her on the couch, just in case.

47:55.005 --> 47:58.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says he hasn't had a day off
since 2010.

47:58.576 --> 48:01.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the challenges have
continued to mount.

48:01.078 --> 48:04.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In November, the caregiver
became the patient.

48:04.081 --> 48:10.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMED BZEEK: I find out in
November I have
colon cancer.

48:10.187 --> 48:16.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they told me they have to
operate on you
in December.

48:16.761 --> 48:21.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I said -- I talk with the
surgeon.

48:21.766 --> 48:23.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I said, Doctor, I can't.

48:23.234 --> 48:29.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to give me time,
because I have a
foster kid who is terminal.

48:29.874 --> 48:30.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I have my son.

48:30.875 --> 48:31.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is handicapped.

48:31.876 --> 48:33.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is nobody for them, you
know?

48:33.277 --> 48:35.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Did anyone
go with you
to the hospital?

48:35.513 --> 48:36.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MOHAMED BZEEK: No.

48:36.514 --> 48:38.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was the scary part, you
know?

48:38.916 --> 48:43.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I felt about the kids who's been
sick for
all their for.

48:43.954 --> 48:52.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I am adult, 62 years old, and
I feel this,
that I am alone, I am scared,
nobody tells

48:52.163 --> 48:59.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me it's OK and it will be fine,
this experience,
this humbled me.

48:59.069 --> 49:02.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: She's talking.

49:02.907 --> 49:09.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOHAMED BZEEK: Yes, she's
talking.

49:09.346 --> 49:17.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: There's so
much heartbreak,
and yet you keep doing it.

49:17.254 --> 49:19.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMED BZEEK: I mean, these
kids need -- need
somebody.

49:19.924 --> 49:21.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Even if
there's that
much heartbreak?

49:21.258 --> 49:23.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOHAMED BZEEK: Even though my
heart is breaking.

49:23.994 --> 49:26.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
To me, death is part of life.

49:26.230 --> 49:32.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm glad that I help these
kids go through
this period of his time, you
know?

49:32.703 --> 49:33.671 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I help him.

49:33.704 --> 49:34.672 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I be with him.

49:34.705 --> 49:36.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I comfort him.

49:36.106 --> 49:39.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I love him or her.

49:39.677 --> 49:48.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And until he pass away, I am
with him and
make him feel he has a family
and he has somebody

49:48.152 --> 49:49.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who cares about him and loves
him.

49:49.720 --> 49:51.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: That
they're not alone.

49:51.255 --> 49:52.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MOHAMED BZEEK: No.

49:52.256 --> 49:54.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're not alone.

49:54.158 --> 49:57.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Bzeek
underwent a successful
cancer surgery in December, and
treatment

49:57.094 --> 49:58.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is ongoing.

49:58.929 --> 50:03.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His story has received wide
attention that
led to an online fund-raising
drive that has

50:03.300 --> 50:07.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
already raised over $200,000.

50:07.037 --> 50:12.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says he will use the money
for a new roof,
air conditioning, and maybe even
a replacement

50:12.476 --> 50:14.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for his 14-year-old van.

50:14.411 --> 50:20.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMED BZEEK: I was reading all
the comments
that people put on the Internet.

50:20.217 --> 50:25.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every day, I was crying because
of their kindness
and the nice words they said.

50:25.823 --> 50:29.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: And, in
the end, he
says he has been humbled by just
how much

50:29.560 --> 50:32.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his story has brought out
others' heart and
humanity.

50:32.763 --> 50:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMED BZEEK: I can't describe
the feeling,
you know?

50:35.666 --> 50:42.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you see how many nice
people around
us, but we don't see them
because of this

50:42.039 --> 50:44.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
turmoil and this time.

50:44.575 --> 50:48.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We didn't see just how many nice
and kind
people around us.

50:48.846 --> 50:51.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Do you
think you see
more of them now?

50:51.715 --> 50:53.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MOHAMED BZEEK: Yes.

50:53.183 --> 51:01.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is always good in this
world, you know,
more than the bad, always.

51:01.592 --> 51:03.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what I believe.

51:04.028 --> 51:13.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: For the
"PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Gayle Tzemach Lemmon in Los
Angeles.

51:13.871 --> 51:27.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: A classic toy goes virtual.

51:27.685 --> 51:31.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We look at the science behind
the latest Barbie
toy, a hologram.

NARRATOR: British Prime Minister
Theresa May
has tried to assuage concerns by
stating her

52:09.226 --> 52:11.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
preference for a frictionless
border.

52:11.562 --> 52:17.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Gerry Adams, a towering
figure among Catholic
Republicans, and a key player in
the peace

52:17.568 --> 52:21.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
process, isn't buying it.

52:21.238 --> 52:27.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For 34 years, Adams has led Sinn
Fein, the
political party historically

separate
Northern Ireland from the United
Kingdom,

52:32.316 --> 52:37.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a British government Adams

doesn't have Northern Ireland's
best interests

52:37.521 --> 52:38.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at heart.

think they
give a fig about people here.

52:42.159 --> 52:43.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't think they ever have.

JUDY WOODRUFF: That's tomorrow
night on "PBS
NewsHour Weekend."

52:47.664 --> 52:51.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

want to mark
the passing of Ward Chamberlin.

52:51.535 --> 52:54.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

importance of
public media.

53:05.849 --> 53:07.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he will be missed.

53:07.985 --> 53:09.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.
