00:32.833 --> 00:34.635

00:34.635 --> 00:36.036
>> THE CONFUSED JURISDICTION IN

00:36.036 --> 00:37.638
INDIAN COUNTRY CREATES THIS

00:37.638 --> 00:39.606

00:39.606 --> 00:40.774

00:50.651 --> 00:51.518
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:51.518 --> 00:53.654
IN A MAJOR UNANNOUNCED POLICY

00:53.654 --> 00:55.289
SHIFT, AMERICAN TROOPS SERVING

00:58.992 --> 01:00.594
ENGAGE IN COMBAT AGAINST THE

01:00.594 --> 01:01.461
TALIBAN.

01:01.461 --> 01:02.663
THIS FROM THE "NEW YORK TIMES,"

01:02.663 --> 01:04.064
WHICH SAYS THE NEW POLICY ALSO

01:04.064 --> 01:05.699
AUTHORIZES THE USE OF AMERICAN

01:07.901 --> 01:09.636
SUPPORT AFGHAN TROOPS ON THEIR

01:09.636 --> 01:10.871
COMBAT MISSIONS.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.139
LAST MAY, THE PRESIDENT HAD SAID

01:12.139 --> 01:13.874
THE REMAINING 10,000 AMERICAN

01:13.874 --> 01:15.042
TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN WOULD BE

01:15.042 --> 01:16.643
LIMITED TO TRAINING AFGHAN

01:16.643 --> 01:18.445
FORCES AND HUNTING THE REMNANTS

01:18.445 --> 01:19.746
OF AL QAEDA.

01:19.746 --> 01:20.714
THE PRESIDENT’S CHANGE OF HEART

01:20.714 --> 01:21.915
CAME AT A TIME WHEN THE

01:21.915 --> 01:22.883
ADMINISTRATION WAS BEING

01:22.883 --> 01:24.618
CRITICIZED FOR ITS DECISION NOT

01:24.618 --> 01:27.254
TO LEAVE TROOPS BEHIND IN IRAQ.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.188
THE UNITED STATES IS PRESSING

01:28.188 --> 01:29.356
ITS CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISIS

01:29.356 --> 01:31.058
EXTREMISTS IN IRAQ.

01:31.058 --> 01:31.959
ACCORDING TO THE U.S. CENTRAL

01:31.959 --> 01:34.127
COMMAND, 23 AIRSTRIKES HAVE BEEN

01:34.127 --> 01:35.395
LAUNCHED AGAINST ISIS SINCE

01:35.395 --> 01:36.229
WEDNESDAY.

01:36.229 --> 01:37.564
ANOTHER SEVEN ISIS POSITIONS

01:37.564 --> 01:39.132
WERE TARGETED IN SYRIA.

01:39.132 --> 01:41.068
THIS AS THE IRAQI ARMY HAS

01:41.068 --> 01:42.436
LAUNCHED A COUNTEROFFENSIVE

01:42.436 --> 01:43.870
AGAINST THE MILITANTS IN ANBAR

01:43.870 --> 01:45.672
PROVINCE, WEST OF BAGHDAD.

01:45.672 --> 01:46.940
DURING THEIR ADVANCE, IRAQI

01:46.940 --> 01:48.241
TROOPS DISCOVERED THE BODIES OF

01:48.241 --> 01:50.110
DOZENS OF TRIBESMEN APPARENTLY

01:50.110 --> 01:51.511
KILLED FOR RESISTING THE

01:51.511 --> 01:52.446
MILITANTS.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.314
EXTREMISTS IN EAST AFRICA ARE

01:54.314 --> 01:56.049
SAID TO BE BEHIND A MASS KILLING

01:56.049 --> 01:57.050
THERE TODAY.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.285
AUTHORITIES SAY AL SHABAB

01:58.285 --> 02:00.220
MILITANTS HIJACKED A BUS, THEN

02:00.220 --> 02:01.855
MURDERED ALL THE NON-MUSLIMS ON

02:01.855 --> 02:02.889
BOARD.

02:02.889 --> 02:04.958
AT LEAST 28 PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.827
THE DEADLINE FOR A NUCLEAR DEAL

02:06.827 --> 02:08.462
BETWEEN IRAN AND THE WESTERN

02:08.462 --> 02:09.663
POWERS, INCLUDING THE UNITED

02:09.663 --> 02:11.198
STATES, IS MONDAY, AND TALKS

02:11.198 --> 02:12.566
BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES CONTINUED

02:12.566 --> 02:13.700
TODAY IN VIENNA.

02:13.700 --> 02:14.668
THIS IS HOW SECRETARY OF STATE

02:14.668 --> 02:16.236
JOHN KERRY ASSESSED THE STATE OF

02:16.236 --> 02:18.138
THE NEGOTIATIONS.

02:18.138 --> 02:22.042
>> WE’VE BEEN OBVIOUSLY HAVING

02:22.042 --> 02:24.378
DIFFICULT TALKS HERE ON A

02:24.378 --> 02:26.146
COMPLICATED TOPIC.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.781
WE ARE WORKING HARD.

02:27.781 --> 02:31.918
WE HOPE WE ARE MAKING CAREFUL

02:31.918 --> 02:35.255
PROGRESS, BUT WE HAVE BIG GAPS.

02:35.255 --> 02:37.224
WE STILL HAVE SOME SERIOUS GAPS

02:37.224 --> 02:39.326
WHICH WE ARE WORKING TO CLOSE.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.327
>> Sreenivasan: THE IRANIAN

02:40.327 --> 02:41.661
FOREIGN MINISTER, MOHAMMAD JAVID

02:41.661 --> 02:43.163
ZARIF, TOLD REPORTERS HE

02:43.163 --> 02:45.599
BELIEVES THERE WILL BE A DEAL.

02:45.599 --> 02:46.266
IN EUROPE TODAY, DUTCH

02:46.266 --> 02:47.200
AUTHORITIES KILLED SEVERAL

02:47.200 --> 02:48.568
THOUSAND DUCKS IN AN EFFORT TO

02:48.568 --> 02:50.037
CONTAIN AN OUTBREAK OF THE BIRD

02:50.037 --> 02:50.637
FLU.

02:50.637 --> 02:52.272
MORE THAN 200,000 BIRDS HAVE

02:52.272 --> 02:53.540
BEEN KILLED IN THE PAST WEEK.

02:53.540 --> 02:54.775
BUT TODAY, GERMAN AUTHORITIES

02:54.775 --> 02:56.443
CONFIRMED A SECOND CASE OF BIRD

02:56.443 --> 02:57.444
FLU THERE.

02:57.444 --> 02:58.378
THE WORLD ORGANIZATION FOR

02:58.378 --> 02:59.646
ANIMAL HEALTH SAID TODAY THE

02:59.646 --> 03:01.548
LATEST BIRD VIRUS IN EUROPE IS

03:01.548 --> 03:03.083
SIMILAR TO ONE THAT DEVASTATED

03:03.083 --> 03:05.118
POULTRY FLOCKS IN SOUTH KOREA

03:05.118 --> 03:06.353
EARLIER THIS YEAR.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.487
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS

03:07.487 --> 03:08.522
APPARENTLY STEPPING UP ITS

03:08.522 --> 03:10.257
EFFORTS TO SHUT DOWN THE PRISON

03:10.257 --> 03:12.092
AT GUANTANAMO BAY IN CUBA.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.627
AUTHORITIES SAY SEVEN DETAINEES

03:13.627 --> 03:15.896
HAVE BEEN SET FREE THIS MONTH.

03:15.896 --> 03:16.863
THE LATEST: A SAUDI MAN

03:16.863 --> 03:18.098
SUSPECTED OF FIGHTING FOR AL

03:18.098 --> 03:19.299
QAEDA IN AFGHANISTAN.

03:19.299 --> 03:20.901
HE HAD BEEN HELD FOR 12 YEARS

03:20.901 --> 03:22.602
BUT HAS NOW BEEN RETURNED TO

03:22.602 --> 03:23.537
SAUDI ARABIA.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.439
THERE ARE NOW ABOUT 140

03:25.439 --> 03:27.040
PRISONERS AT GUANTANAMO.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.242
AT ONE TIME, FOLLOWING 9/11, THE

03:29.242 --> 03:31.244
PRISON HELD MORE THAN 750

03:31.244 --> 03:32.712
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.

03:32.712 --> 03:33.980
MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE WHO

03:33.980 --> 03:35.982
REMAIN ARE FROM YEMEN.

03:35.982 --> 03:37.117
THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA TODAY

03:37.117 --> 03:38.618
SUSPENDED ALL FRATERNITY

03:38.618 --> 03:40.253
ACTIVITIES UNTIL JANUARY

03:40.253 --> 03:41.721
FOLLOWING ALLEGATIONS THAT A

03:41.721 --> 03:43.657
FEMALE STUDENT WAS GANG RAPED IN

03:43.657 --> 03:45.225
ONE OF THE FRATERNITY HOUSES IN

03:45.225 --> 03:46.460
2012.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.828
THE INCIDENT CAME TO LIGHT IN AN

03:47.828 --> 03:49.196
ARTICLE PUBLISHED EARLIER THIS

03:49.196 --> 03:50.030
WEEK.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.364
U.V.A. PRESIDENT TERESA SULLIVAN

03:51.364 --> 03:52.732
SAID THE TIME BETWEEN NOW AND

03:52.732 --> 03:54.468
JANUARY WILL BE USED TO ASSEMBLE

03:54.468 --> 03:56.169
GROUPS OF STUDENTS AND OTHERS TO

03:56.169 --> 03:58.205
DISCUSS HOW TO PREVENT SEXUAL

03:58.205 --> 03:59.940
VIOLENCE ON CAMPUS.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.675
AND NASA HAS RELEASED AN

04:01.675 --> 04:04.010
ENHANCED IMAGE OF EUROPA, ONE OF

04:04.010 --> 04:06.146
JUPITER’S 67 MOONS.

04:06.146 --> 04:08.014
THE WHITE AND FAINTLY BLUE AREAS

04:08.014 --> 04:09.382
OF THE IMAGE ARE THOUGHT TO

04:09.382 --> 04:11.418
CONTAIN ICE, WHICH COULD MAKE IT

04:11.418 --> 04:13.086
CONDUCIVE TO LIFE.

04:13.086 --> 04:13.820
IN CASE YOU ARE WONDERING,

04:13.820 --> 04:16.690
EUROPA IS ONLY 390 MILLION MILES

04:16.690 --> 04:18.325
FROM EARTH.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.400
>> Sreenivasan: LATE YESTERDAY,

04:27.400 --> 04:28.668
THERE WERE NEW FINDINGS ABOUT

04:28.668 --> 04:30.337
THE ATTACK IN BENGHAZI, LIBYA,

04:30.337 --> 04:32.339
IN 2012 THAT LED TO THE DEATHS

04:32.339 --> 04:33.406
OF AMBASSADOR CHRISTOPHER

04:33.406 --> 04:34.741
STEVENS AND THREE OTHER

04:34.741 --> 04:35.642
AMERICANS.

04:35.642 --> 04:36.743
KEN DILANIAN OF THE ASSOCIATED

04:36.743 --> 04:38.345
PRESS WROTE ABOUT IT AND JOINS

04:38.345 --> 04:39.312
US NOW FROM WASHINGTON.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.681
SO, KEN, WHAT WERE THE FINDINGS?

04:41.681 --> 04:44.751
>> WELL, HARI, THIS REPORT

04:44.751 --> 04:46.520
ESSENTIALLY DEBUNKED ALMOST

04:46.520 --> 04:48.722
EVERY CRITICISM THAT HAD BEEN

04:48.722 --> 04:49.623
LEVELED AT THE OBAMA

04:49.623 --> 04:50.991
ADMINISTRATION OVER THIS

04:50.991 --> 04:51.925
INCIDENT.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.460
IT BASICALLY SAID THAT THERE WAS

04:53.460 --> 04:54.694
NO INTENT TO MISLEAD THE

04:54.694 --> 04:56.363
AMERICAN PUBLIC ABOUT IT, THAT

04:56.363 --> 04:57.397
THE C.I.A. AND THE MILITARY

04:57.397 --> 04:59.900
ACTED APPROPRIATELY, AND THAT

04:59.900 --> 05:01.568
MANY OF THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES

05:01.568 --> 05:02.636
THAT HAVE BEEN OUT THERE ABOUT

05:02.636 --> 05:06.072
COVER-UPS AND DARK FORCES AT

05:06.072 --> 05:07.841
WORK WERE NOT ACCURATE.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.109
AND PRINCIPALLY, THE MOST

05:09.109 --> 05:10.310
INTERESTING FINDING FOR ME IS

05:10.310 --> 05:12.412
THAT AFTER THE-- THE WEEKEND

05:12.412 --> 05:13.914
AFTER THE ATTACK, THE

05:13.914 --> 05:15.048
THEN-AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED

05:15.048 --> 05:16.483
NATIONS, SUSAN RICE, WENT ON THE

05:16.483 --> 05:17.751
SUNDAY SHOWS, MANY VIEWERS MAY

05:17.751 --> 05:20.253
REMEMBER, AND SAID THAT THE

05:20.253 --> 05:21.655
ATTACK HAD EVOLVED FROM A

05:21.655 --> 05:22.956
PEACEFUL PROTEST.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.324
THAT TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG, AND

05:24.324 --> 05:25.392
SHE AND THE ADMINISTRATION TOOK

05:25.392 --> 05:27.327
A LOT OF FLAK AS A RESULT OF

05:27.327 --> 05:28.228
THAT ERROR.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.262
THIS REPORT BY THE HOUSE

05:29.262 --> 05:30.564
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, WHICH

05:30.564 --> 05:31.798
IS A REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED

05:31.798 --> 05:34.568
COMMITTEE, ESSENTIALLY SAYS

05:34.568 --> 05:35.936
THAT RICE WAS RELYING ON

05:35.936 --> 05:37.204
INTELLIGENCE THAT WAS PROVIDED

05:37.204 --> 05:39.072
TO HER FROM THE C.I.A. AND OTHER

05:39.072 --> 05:40.674
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, AND IN

05:40.674 --> 05:41.741
FACT, POINTS OUT THAT THERE WERE

05:41.741 --> 05:44.244
21 INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT

05:44.244 --> 05:45.445
SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN A

05:45.445 --> 05:46.880
PROTEST AT THIS DIPLOMATIC

05:46.880 --> 05:47.948
FACILITY.

05:47.948 --> 05:48.982
THOSE TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG,

05:48.982 --> 05:51.084
BUT THE INTELLIGENCE PICTURE WAS

05:51.084 --> 05:52.586
INCREDIBLY CONFUSED.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.454
AND SO THE REPORT FOUND THAT

05:54.454 --> 05:55.422
THERE WAS NO INTENT TO

05:55.422 --> 05:57.824
MISLEAD BY ANYBODY IN THE

05:57.824 --> 05:59.259
GOVERNMENT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

05:59.259 --> 05:59.693
HERE.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.594
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY, SO WHAT

06:00.594 --> 06:01.861
MAKES THIS PARTICULAR COMMITTEE

06:01.861 --> 06:03.096
OR THIS PARTICULAR FINDING

06:03.096 --> 06:03.630
DIFFERENT?

06:03.630 --> 06:04.397
THERE HAVE BEEN PREVIOUS

06:04.397 --> 06:06.566
INVESTIGATIONS, RIGHT?

06:06.566 --> 06:08.268
>> YEAH, THIS IS THE SEVENTH

06:08.268 --> 06:09.302
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION, I

06:09.302 --> 06:12.072
BELIEVE, AND THE EIGHTH OVERALL.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.507
AND THIS, ESSENTIALLY, MIRRORED

06:14.507 --> 06:15.408
SOME OF THE FINDINGS OF THE

06:15.408 --> 06:17.077
OTHER INVESTIGATIONS,

06:17.077 --> 06:17.911
PARTICULARLY ON THE ROLE OF THE

06:17.911 --> 06:18.912
MILITARY.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.280
BUT THIS ONE-- THE HOUSE

06:20.280 --> 06:21.214
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS

06:21.214 --> 06:22.282
ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED

06:22.282 --> 06:23.850
INTELLIGENCE AND C.I.A.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.585
PERSONNEL THAT OTHER COMMITTEES

06:25.585 --> 06:28.054
DON’T HAVE, SO THIS REPORT GOT

06:28.054 --> 06:30.090
THE DEEPEST INTO WHAT THE

06:30.090 --> 06:31.625
INTELLIGENCE SAID, YOU KNOW, WHO

06:31.625 --> 06:32.826
CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK, WHAT

06:32.826 --> 06:33.593
THEIR MOTIVATIONS WERE.

06:33.593 --> 06:34.928
AND IN FACT, IT POINTED OUT

06:34.928 --> 06:36.496
THAT TO THIS DAY THAT’S NOT

06:36.496 --> 06:40.400
COMPLETELY CLEAR.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.167
WHAT WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANT

06:41.167 --> 06:42.269
ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT’S A

06:42.269 --> 06:43.770
REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED COMMITTEE.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.238
THE CHAIRMAN IS MIKE ROGERS,

06:45.238 --> 06:46.673
OUTGOING RETIRING MEMBER FROM

06:46.673 --> 06:47.474
MICHIGAN.

06:47.474 --> 06:48.642
A VERY PARTISAN REPUBLICAN,

06:48.642 --> 06:50.477
BUT HE CONCLUDED AND HIS

06:50.477 --> 06:52.112
COLLEAGUES CONCLUDED THAT MANY

06:52.112 --> 06:54.180
OF THE CHARGES AGAINST THE OBAMA

06:54.180 --> 06:55.215
ADMINISTRATION WHICH HAVE BEEN

06:55.215 --> 06:56.283
LEVELED BY REPUBLICANS-- THIS

06:56.283 --> 06:57.784
HAS BEEN A BIG POLITICAL ISSUE--

06:57.784 --> 06:58.752
MANY OF THOSE CHARGES JUST

06:58.752 --> 07:00.587
SIMPLY DON’T HOLD UP.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.354
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY, SO WHAT

07:01.354 --> 07:02.422
ARE THE REPERCUSSIONS NOW?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.591
DOES THIS CHANGE... I THINK

07:04.591 --> 07:06.092
THERE’S ONE MORE COMMITTEE THAT

07:06.092 --> 07:07.894
COULD HAVE FINDINGS?

07:07.894 --> 07:09.863
>> WELL, THERE IS A SELECT

07:09.863 --> 07:13.833
COMMITTEE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO

07:13.833 --> 07:15.502
CONTINUE AN INVESTIGATION INTO

07:15.502 --> 07:16.736
THIS ISSUE.

07:16.736 --> 07:18.171
AND THEY HAVE SAID THEY WILL

07:18.171 --> 07:21.274
TAKE THIS LATEST FINDING INTO

07:21.274 --> 07:22.509
ACCOUNT, BUT SOME OF THE KEY

07:22.509 --> 07:24.010
REPUBLICANS ON THAT COMMITTEE

07:24.010 --> 07:25.145
HAVE COME OUT AND SAID, LOOK,

07:25.145 --> 07:26.346
THIS HOUSE INTELLIGENCE

07:26.346 --> 07:27.881
COMMITTEE REPORT DEBUNKS A LOT

07:27.881 --> 07:29.249
OF THE QUESTIONS YOU GUYS HAVE

07:29.249 --> 07:30.350
BEEN RAISING SO LET’S FOCUS ON

07:30.350 --> 07:32.118
WHAT WE ALL AGREE WAS A

07:32.118 --> 07:33.753
SHORTCOMING IN THIS INCIDENT,

07:33.753 --> 07:35.388
WHICH IS THAT FACILITY WAS NOT

07:35.388 --> 07:36.923
WELL PROTECTED; THE STATE

07:36.923 --> 07:39.192
DEPARTMENT PART OF THE FACILITY,

07:39.192 --> 07:40.493
IN PARTICULAR, WAS NOT WELL

07:40.493 --> 07:41.294
PROTECTED.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.295
THE PEOPLE GUARDING IT KNEW

07:42.295 --> 07:44.397
THAT, AND THEY HAD ASKED FOR

07:44.397 --> 07:45.799
MORE... BETTER SECURITY FROM

07:45.799 --> 07:46.766
WASHINGTON, AND THAT WAS NOT

07:46.766 --> 07:47.300
GRANTED.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.501
EVERYONE AGREES THAT THAT WAS

07:48.501 --> 07:51.037
A SHORTCOMING, AND THE HOPE IS

07:51.037 --> 07:52.739
THAT THIS-- AT LEAST AMONG

07:52.739 --> 07:53.673
DEMOCRATS -- THAT THIS

07:53.673 --> 07:55.075
COMMITTEE CAN FOCUS ON THAT

07:55.075 --> 07:56.676
SHORTCOMING AND RECTIFYING IT

07:56.676 --> 07:57.577
AND BETTER PROTECTING

07:57.577 --> 07:58.912
DIPLOMATIC FACILITIES AROUND

07:58.912 --> 07:59.846
THE WORLD.

07:59.846 --> 08:00.714
>> Sreenivasan: ANY IDEA HOW

08:00.714 --> 08:01.648
MANY DOLLARS ALL THESE

08:01.648 --> 08:03.350
INVESTIGATIONS COST?

08:03.350 --> 08:04.084
>> YOU KNOW, I DON’T KNOW,

08:04.084 --> 08:05.118
BUT IT’S GOT TO BE TENS OF

08:05.118 --> 08:08.822
MILLIONS.

08:08.822 --> 08:09.723
THERE’S DOCUMENT GATHERING THAT

08:09.723 --> 08:10.190
TAKES PLACE.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.392
IN THIS PROBE ALONE, THERE

08:12.392 --> 08:13.693
WERE 20 HEARINGS OR EVENTS

08:13.693 --> 08:14.627
BY THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE

08:14.627 --> 08:15.362
COMMITTEE, AND THEY TALKED TO

08:15.362 --> 08:16.496
DOZENS OF PEOPLE AND REVIEWED

08:16.496 --> 08:17.664
THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.798
IT HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS

08:18.798 --> 08:19.733
UNDERTAKING.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.267
AND WE’LL NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH

08:21.267 --> 08:23.036
TIME EXECUTIVE BRANCH PERSONNEL

08:23.036 --> 08:24.938
HAVE SPENT RESPONDING TO THESE

08:24.938 --> 08:25.438
INQUIRIES.

08:25.438 --> 08:26.272
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, KEN

08:26.272 --> 08:27.107
DILANIAN FROM THE ASSOCIATED

08:27.107 --> 08:27.907
PRESS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR

08:27.907 --> 08:28.942
JOINING US.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.243
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME, HARI.

08:38.752 --> 08:39.452
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO OUR

08:39.452 --> 08:40.687
SIGNATURE SEGMENT, OUR ORIGINAL

08:40.687 --> 08:42.088
IN-DEPTH REPORTS FROM AROUND THE

08:42.088 --> 08:43.490
NATION AND AROUND THE WORLD.

08:43.490 --> 08:44.991
TONIGHT, WE FOCUS ON THE VERY

08:44.991 --> 08:46.926
HIGH LEVELS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

08:46.926 --> 08:48.595
AGAINST NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN

08:48.595 --> 08:49.629
LIVING ON RESERVATIONS

08:49.629 --> 08:50.764
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.298
TWO THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND: THE

08:52.298 --> 08:54.000
OVERWHELMING PERCENTAGE OF

08:54.000 --> 08:55.668
ASSAILANTS ARE ACTUALLY NOT

08:55.668 --> 08:57.170
AMERICAN INDIANS, BUT OTHERS

08:57.170 --> 08:59.105
LIVING ON OR NEAR RESERVATIONS;

08:59.105 --> 09:01.241
AND UNTIL RECENTLY, THE TRIBAL

09:01.241 --> 09:03.076
COURTS THAT PRESIDE OVER THESE

09:03.076 --> 09:04.778
RESERVATIONS HAD NO JURISDICTION

09:04.778 --> 09:07.313
OVER NON-NATIVE PERPETRATORS.

09:07.313 --> 09:08.915
NOW, CONGRESS HAS CHANGED THE

09:08.915 --> 09:10.617
LAW THROUGH THE VIOLENCE AGAINST

09:10.617 --> 09:12.185
WOMEN ACT, BUT SOME VICTIMS OF

09:12.185 --> 09:13.686
SEXUAL CRIMES SAY THE CHANGES

09:13.686 --> 09:15.822
DON’T GO NEARLY FAR ENOUGH, AND

09:15.822 --> 09:17.590
OTHER CRITICS SAY THE NEW LAW IS

09:17.590 --> 09:18.858
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND

09:18.858 --> 09:21.060
UNENFORCEABLE ANYWAY.

09:21.060 --> 09:21.995
THE NEWSHOUR’S STEPHEN FEE

09:21.995 --> 09:23.062
REPORTS.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.132
>> Reporter: AMERICAN INDIAN

09:26.132 --> 09:27.767
LISA BRUNNER SPENT HER CHILDHOOD

09:27.767 --> 09:30.170
ON AND AROUND THE WHITE EARTH

09:30.170 --> 09:32.772
INDIAN RESERVATION, A HUGE TRACT

09:32.772 --> 09:34.641
OF LAND IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA

09:34.641 --> 09:36.609
THAT’S HOME TO AROUND 4,000

09:36.609 --> 09:38.645
AMERICAN INDIANS.

09:38.645 --> 09:40.046
LISA GREW UP SURROUNDED BY

09:40.046 --> 09:42.048
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SINCE HAS

09:42.048 --> 09:43.483
BECOME A LEADING ADVOCATE FOR

09:43.483 --> 09:45.718
NATIVE VICTIMS OF ABUSE.

09:45.718 --> 09:47.253
>> IT’S HAPPENING EVERY DAY.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.054
>> Reporter: NATIVE WOMEN IN THE

09:48.054 --> 09:49.789
U.S. FACE SOME OF THE HIGHEST

09:49.789 --> 09:51.825
LEVELS OF VIOLENCE OF ANY GROUP.

09:51.825 --> 09:52.926
ACCORDING TO THE JUSTICE

09:52.926 --> 09:55.195
DEPARTMENT, ONE IN THREE NATIVE

09:55.195 --> 09:57.096
WOMEN HAS BEEN RAPED, AND THREE

09:57.096 --> 09:58.665
OUT OF FIVE WILL EXPERIENCE

09:58.665 --> 09:59.966
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THEIR

09:59.966 --> 10:01.301
LIFETIMES.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.002
LISA SAYS SHE TOO IS A VICTIM OF

10:03.002 --> 10:05.305
BOTH RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.140
SHE HAD ENOUGH, SHE SAYS, WHEN A

10:07.140 --> 10:08.775
BOYFRIEND SLAPPED HER ACROSS THE

10:08.775 --> 10:10.710
FACE WHILE SHE CRADLED HER NINE-

10:10.710 --> 10:11.978
MONTH-OLD CHILD.

10:11.978 --> 10:14.714
>> AND I PACKED UP AND LEFT THE

10:14.714 --> 10:16.683
NEXT DAY, AND I NEVER WENT BACK.

10:16.683 --> 10:18.384
AND I VOWED THEREAFTER THAT NO

10:18.384 --> 10:20.253
MAN WILL EVER TOUCH ME AGAIN.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.689
I WILL NOT... MY BABIES WILL NOT

10:22.689 --> 10:24.757
KNOW THE LIFE THAT I HAD TO

10:24.757 --> 10:25.758
SURVIVE.

10:25.758 --> 10:26.893
>> Reporter: LISA SAYS THAT AS

10:26.893 --> 10:28.595
AN ADULT SHE SELDOM WENT TO THE

10:28.595 --> 10:31.264
POLICE AND THAT MUCH OF THAT HAS

10:31.264 --> 10:32.799
TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT SOME OF

10:32.799 --> 10:34.501
THE MEN WHO ATTACKED HER WERE

10:34.501 --> 10:36.469
NON-NATIVE--NOTAMERICAN

10:36.469 --> 10:37.537
INDIANS.

10:37.537 --> 10:38.938
SO WHY DOES THAT MATTER?

10:38.938 --> 10:41.007
UP UNTIL RECENTLY, NON-NATIVE

10:41.007 --> 10:42.275
PEOPLE WERE IMMUNE FROM

10:42.275 --> 10:44.477
PROSECUTION IN TRIBAL COURTS.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.645
THAT’S IMPORTANT FOR TWO

10:45.645 --> 10:47.380
REASONS: ONE, THE JUSTICE

10:47.380 --> 10:49.516
DEPARTMENT SAYS NON-NATIVE MEN

10:49.516 --> 10:51.451
COMMIT THE VAST MAJORITY OF

10:51.451 --> 10:52.819
RAPES AND ASSAULTS AGAINST

10:52.819 --> 10:55.522
NATIVE WOMEN; AND TWO, FEDERAL

10:55.522 --> 10:57.357
ATTORNEYS WHO ARE OFTEN THE ONLY

10:57.357 --> 10:59.292
LAWYERS WHO CAN TRY NON-NATIVE

10:59.292 --> 11:00.760
PEOPLE WHO COMMIT CRIMES ON

11:00.760 --> 11:02.562
RESERVATIONS OFTEN DON’T

11:02.562 --> 11:04.063
PROSECUTE.

11:04.063 --> 11:07.367
>> I KNEW WHEN I HAD BEEN RAPED

11:07.367 --> 11:09.702
AND BEEN VICTIMIZED AND WHATNOT

11:09.702 --> 11:11.204
I NEVER TRIED TO REPORT IT

11:11.204 --> 11:13.273
BECAUSE NOTHING... I KNEW

11:13.273 --> 11:14.807
NOTHING WOULD EVER HAPPEN.

11:14.807 --> 11:16.643
I KNEW NOTHING WOULD BE DONE.

11:16.643 --> 11:17.343
>> WHEN YOU HAVE THE

11:17.343 --> 11:19.412
COMBINATION OF THE SILENCE

11:19.412 --> 11:20.947
THAT COMES FROM VICTIMS WHO

11:20.947 --> 11:23.349
LIVE IN FEAR AND A LACK OF

11:23.349 --> 11:24.751
ACCOUNTABILITY BY OUTSIDE

11:24.751 --> 11:26.252
JURISDICTIONS TO PROSECUTE

11:26.252 --> 11:28.087
THAT CRIME, YOU’VE CREATED,

11:28.087 --> 11:29.889
IF YOU WILL, THE PERFECT STORM

11:29.889 --> 11:31.558
FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL

11:31.558 --> 11:33.493
ASSAULT, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT

11:33.493 --> 11:34.894
ALL THE STATISTICS WOULD SORT

11:34.894 --> 11:35.929
OF BEAR OUT.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.031
>> Reporter: IN A 1978 DECISION,

11:38.031 --> 11:39.999
THE U.S. SUPREME COURT SAID

11:39.999 --> 11:41.501
INDIAN TRIBES WITH THEIR OWN

11:41.501 --> 11:43.369
TRIBAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS AND

11:43.369 --> 11:45.071
COURTS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO

11:45.071 --> 11:46.973
CHARGE NON-INDIANS UNLESS

11:46.973 --> 11:48.875
CONGRESS PASSED A LAW, BUT

11:48.875 --> 11:51.010
CONGRESS DIDN’T ACT FOR 35

11:51.010 --> 11:52.045
YEARS.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.013
THEN, JUST LAST YEAR, WHEN

11:54.013 --> 11:55.949
LAWMAKERS WERE REAUTHORIZING THE

11:55.949 --> 11:57.584
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT,

11:57.584 --> 11:59.252
SOMETIMES CALLED VAWA, THEY

11:59.252 --> 12:00.820
INCLUDED A NEW PROVISION

12:00.820 --> 12:02.555
GRANTING TRIBAL COURTS

12:02.555 --> 12:04.490
JURISDICTION OVER A LIMITED

12:04.490 --> 12:06.359
NUMBER OF DOMESTIC AND DATING

12:06.359 --> 12:08.227
VIOLENCE CRIMES COMMITTED BY

12:08.227 --> 12:10.363
NON-INDIANS ON RESERVATIONS,

12:10.363 --> 12:12.265
PERHAPS ALLOWING PEOPLE LIKE

12:12.265 --> 12:14.834
LISA BRUNNER TO SEE JUSTICE.

12:14.834 --> 12:15.868
WHILE THE TRIBAL DOMESTIC

12:15.868 --> 12:17.570
VIOLENCE PROVISION DOESN’T KICK

12:17.570 --> 12:19.973
IN UNTIL MARCH OF NEXT YEAR,

12:19.973 --> 12:21.841
THREE INDIAN RESERVATIONS HAVE

12:21.841 --> 12:23.743
TAKEN PART IN A PILOT PROGRAM

12:23.743 --> 12:25.211
WHERE THEY CAN BEGIN SOME OF

12:25.211 --> 12:27.180
THOSE PROSECUTIONS NOW: ONE

12:27.180 --> 12:29.282
RESERVATION IN ARIZONA; ONE IN

12:29.282 --> 12:30.984
OREGON; AND THIS INDIAN

12:30.984 --> 12:32.518
RESERVATION, THE TULALIP

12:32.518 --> 12:34.087
RESERVATION, A LITTLE MORE THAN

12:34.087 --> 12:35.388
AN HOUR’S DRIVE NORTH OF

12:35.388 --> 12:37.423
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.058
THERESA POULEY HAS SERVED AS

12:39.058 --> 12:40.827
CHIEF JUDGE ON THE TULALIP

12:40.827 --> 12:43.329
TRIBAL COURT SINCE 2009.

12:43.329 --> 12:45.198
SHE SAYS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO

12:45.198 --> 12:46.799
PROSECUTE OFFENDERS ON INDIAN

12:46.799 --> 12:49.002
RESERVATIONS BELONGS TO TRIBAL

12:49.002 --> 12:50.136
COURTS.

12:50.136 --> 12:51.471
>> THE CONFUSED JURISDICTION IN

12:51.471 --> 12:53.272
INDIAN COUNTRY WHICH LEAVES

12:53.272 --> 12:54.540
THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES

12:54.540 --> 12:56.142
OFTENTIMES TO THE STATE AND

12:56.142 --> 12:57.677
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHO DON’T

12:57.677 --> 12:59.145
EFFECTIVELY PROSECUTE THOSE

12:59.145 --> 13:02.148
CRIMES, CREATES THIS PLACE WHERE

13:02.148 --> 13:03.616
YOU HAVE A CATEGORY OF PEOPLE ON

13:03.616 --> 13:05.585
INDIAN RESERVATIONS WHO ARE

13:05.585 --> 13:06.586
ESSENTIALLY ABOVE THE LAW.

13:06.586 --> 13:07.620
>> Reporter: WHAT DOES THIS

13:07.620 --> 13:10.256
TRIBAL PROVISION IN VAWA DO TO

13:10.256 --> 13:11.557
HELP CLOSE THAT GAP?

13:11.557 --> 13:14.560
>> IT ALLOWS ME TO TREAT ALL

13:14.560 --> 13:16.996
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PERPETRATORS

13:16.996 --> 13:18.798
EXACTLY THE SAME, INDIAN OR NON-

13:18.798 --> 13:19.532
INDIAN.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.701
SO I HAVE AUTHORITY OVER INDIANS

13:21.701 --> 13:23.269
WHO COMMIT THAT CRIME.

13:23.269 --> 13:24.871
THIS JUST GIVES ME AUTHORITY

13:24.871 --> 13:26.439
OVER NON-INDIANS WHO COMMIT THE

13:26.439 --> 13:28.174
EXACT SAME CRIME.

13:28.174 --> 13:28.908
>> Reporter: SINCE MARCH OF THIS

13:28.908 --> 13:30.543
YEAR, THE TULALIP TRIBAL

13:30.543 --> 13:32.278
PROSECUTOR HAS BROUGHT CHARGES

13:32.278 --> 13:35.014
AGAINST FIVE ALLEGED NON-INDIAN

13:35.014 --> 13:36.816
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DEFENDANTS.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.484
AS OF THIS AIRING, TWO HAVE

13:38.484 --> 13:40.286
PLEAD GUILTY, TWO ARE AWAITING

13:40.286 --> 13:41.988
TRIAL AND ONE CASE HAS BEEN

13:41.988 --> 13:42.955
DISMISSED.

13:42.955 --> 13:44.557
BUT WILL THIS NEW AUTHORITY

13:44.557 --> 13:46.726
ACTUALLY HELP STOP THE CRISIS OF

13:46.726 --> 13:49.429
VIOLENCE AGAINST INDIAN WOMEN?

13:49.429 --> 13:51.831
ONE CONCERN: THE NEW LAW ONLY

13:51.831 --> 13:53.466
COVERS DOMESTIC AND DATING

13:53.466 --> 13:55.468
VIOLENCE; IT DOES NOT INCLUDE

13:55.468 --> 13:56.969
CRIMES LIKE ASSAULT BY A

13:56.969 --> 13:59.172
STRANGER OR EVEN RAPE.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.840
MICHELLE DEMMERT IS THE TULALIP

14:00.840 --> 14:02.408
TRIBES’ LEAD ATTORNEY.

14:02.408 --> 14:03.943
>> UNFORTUNATELY IT’S NOT QUITE

14:03.943 --> 14:05.011
GONE FAR ENOUGH.

14:05.011 --> 14:08.247
IN JUST THREE RECENT CASES, WE

14:08.247 --> 14:10.450
HAD CHILDREN INVOLVED, AND WE’RE

14:10.450 --> 14:13.119
NOT ABLE TO CHARGE ON THE CRIMES

OTHER.

14:26.666 --> 14:27.867

14:27.867 --> 14:28.634
THAT’S RIGHT.

AUTHORITY TO NON-INDIANS.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.103
INDIAN POPULATIONS IN THE

15:04.103 --> 15:06.139

15:06.139 --> 15:07.640
SHOULD HAVE FORCED U.S.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.542
ATTORNEYS, FEDERAL LAWYERS, TO

15:09.542 --> 15:11.010
PROSECUTE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

CRIMES ON RESERVATIONS MORE

15:12.678 --> 15:14.647

15:14.647 --> 15:16.716
AUTHORITY TO TRIBAL COURTS.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.818

15:18.818 --> 15:21.020
SHORT AND MAY EVEN BE OVERTURNED

15:21.020 --> 15:22.655
IN COURT BECAUSE SOME TRIBAL

15:22.655 --> 15:24.257
SYSTEMS MAY NOT HAVE THE

15:24.257 --> 15:26.959
RESOURCES TO ENSURE DUE PROCESS.

AND GUARANTEE CONSTITUTIONAL

15:31.931 --> 15:34.200
PROVISIONS UNDER WHAT PASSED.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.569

15:38.037 --> 15:40.473
CHALLENGED AND ON APPEAL THEY’LL

16:01.160 --> 16:02.929

16:04.964 --> 16:06.933

DATING VIOLENCE CRIMES.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.504
THEY ALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO

STRAIGHT TO FEDERAL COURT AND

16:13.206 --> 16:15.041
ASK TO BE RELEASED IF THEIR

16:15.041 --> 16:16.576
RIGHTS ARE BEING VIOLATED.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.144

ZERO.

16:21.581 --> 16:22.615
>> Reporter: HIRSCH CONCEDES THE

16:22.615 --> 16:24.684
LAW IS LIMITED, ESPECIALLY

16:24.684 --> 16:26.285
BECAUSE IT ONLY COVERS DOMESTIC

16:26.285 --> 16:28.054
VIOLENCE AND NOT MORE SERIOUS

16:28.054 --> 16:28.955
CRIMES.

16:28.955 --> 16:30.590
BUT HE SAYS THE JUSTICE

16:30.590 --> 16:32.291
DEPARTMENT IS STEPPING UP ITS

16:32.291 --> 16:34.227
PROSECUTION RATE AGAINST NON-

16:34.227 --> 16:35.628
NATIVES.

16:35.628 --> 16:36.529
>> AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE TO

16:36.529 --> 16:38.664
RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN FEDERAL

16:38.664 --> 16:40.633
PROSECUTORS AND F.B.I. AGENTS

16:40.633 --> 16:42.235
ARE OFTEN LOCATED HUNDREDS OF

16:42.235 --> 16:44.503
MILES AWAY, MANY HOURS’ DRIVE

16:44.503 --> 16:46.539
AWAY, IT’S VERY HARD FOR THEM TO

16:46.539 --> 16:48.241
PLAY THE ROLE OF LOCAL LAW

16:48.241 --> 16:49.709
ENFORCEMENT, ESPECIALLY ON

16:49.709 --> 16:51.277
MISDEMEANOR LEVEL CRIMES AND

16:51.277 --> 16:52.378
LOWER-LEVEL FELONIES.

PROSECUTE NON-INDIANS, CHIEF

16:57.884 --> 17:00.052
JUDGE THERESA POULEY SAYS SHE’S

17:00.052 --> 17:01.654
ALREADY SEEN ONE MARK OF

17:01.654 --> 17:02.755
SUCCESS.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.056
>> THE REPORTING OF DOMESTIC

17:04.056 --> 17:05.524
VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT

17:05.524 --> 17:07.727
CASES HAVE GONE UP AT TULALIP

17:07.727 --> 17:08.694
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS

17:08.694 --> 17:11.497
STEADILY AS VICTIMS KNOW THAT

17:11.497 --> 17:12.765
PERPETRATORS WILL BE HELD

17:12.765 --> 17:13.866
ACCOUNTABLE.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.968
AND AS THEY KNOW THEY’RE GOING

17:15.968 --> 17:17.703
TO BE LISTENED OR HEARD, THEY

17:17.703 --> 17:19.538
ACTUALLY REPORT IT MORE OFTEN.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.373
SO IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE

17:20.373 --> 17:23.175
NUMBERS, YOU SORT OF SEE THAT IT

17:23.175 --> 17:25.211
CHANGES THE LEVEL OF REPORTING,

17:25.211 --> 17:26.245
AND THAT’S REALLY THE FIRST STEP

17:26.245 --> 17:27.446
TOWARDS STOPPING IT.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.349
EARTH RESERVATION, LISA BRUNNER

17:30.349 --> 17:31.884
IS STILL CONCERNED ABOUT THE

17:31.884 --> 17:33.686
LIMITATIONS OF THE NEW LAW, THAT

17:33.686 --> 17:35.121
IT DOESN’T COVER CRIMES LIKE

17:35.121 --> 17:36.022
RAPE.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.657
IT’S ESPECIALLY PERSONAL BECAUSE

17:37.657 --> 17:39.592
SHE SAYS ONE OF HER DAUGHTERS

17:39.592 --> 17:41.494
WAS RAPED A FEW YEARS AGO BY

17:41.494 --> 17:43.429
NON-NATIVE MEN WHO CAME ON TO

17:43.429 --> 17:44.497
THE RESERVATION.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.298
>> OF COURSE THEY THREATENED

17:45.298 --> 17:46.232
HER, AND SHE DIDN’T TELL ME

17:46.232 --> 17:48.968
UNTIL AFTER THE FACT, BUT WE DID

17:48.968 --> 17:52.505
REPORT IT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

17:52.505 --> 17:54.040
THAT WAS IT.

17:54.040 --> 17:54.941
>> Reporter: NOTHING HAPPENED

17:54.941 --> 17:55.608
AFTER THAT?

17:55.608 --> 17:56.208
>> NO.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.076
NOTHING.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.244
>> Reporter: ONCE THE NEW LAW

17:58.244 --> 18:00.112
GOES INTO FULL EFFECT NEXT YEAR,

18:00.112 --> 18:01.781
IT’S EXPECTED THAT ONLY A FEW

18:01.781 --> 18:03.616
DOZEN TRIBES ARE PREPARED TO

18:03.616 --> 18:05.384
INITIALLY TAKE ON THE TASK OF

18:05.384 --> 18:06.986
PROSECUTING NON-INDIAN

18:06.986 --> 18:08.154
DEFENDANTS.

18:17.363 --> 18:18.531
>> Sreenivasan: IN THE PAST FEW

18:18.531 --> 18:19.832
YEARS, BLACK FRIDAY SHOPPING

18:19.832 --> 18:21.334
SALES HAVE CREPT RIGHT INTO

18:21.334 --> 18:23.369
THANKSGIVING DAY AS STORES TRY

18:23.369 --> 18:24.704
TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE OVER THEIR

18:24.704 --> 18:26.038
COMPETITORS AT THE START OF THE

18:26.038 --> 18:27.707
HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.075
BUT NOW, THERE IS BACKLASH

18:29.075 --> 18:30.676
AGAINST THAT PRACTICE WITHIN THE

18:30.676 --> 18:31.944
BUSINESS COMMUNITY.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.112
STEPHEN GREENHOUSE OF THE "NEW

18:33.112 --> 18:34.080
YORK TIMES" WROTE ABOUT THIS

18:34.080 --> 18:34.847
RECENTLY.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.282
I SPOKE WITH HIM EARLIER.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.950
SO HAS IT FINALLY GOTTEN TOO

18:37.950 --> 18:39.986
FAR, THAT PEOPLE ARE ESSENTIALLY

18:39.986 --> 18:42.355
BRINGING THEIR STAFFS IN JUST TO

18:42.355 --> 18:43.422
TRY TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN ON

18:43.422 --> 18:44.623
THANKSGIVING DAY?

18:44.623 --> 18:46.058
>> YOU KNOW, LAST YEAR, ALL

18:46.058 --> 18:47.193
THE NEWS WAS THAT MORE AND MORE

18:47.193 --> 18:48.327
STORES WERE OPENING ON

18:48.327 --> 18:50.463
THANKSGIVING IN THEORY TO PLEASE

18:50.463 --> 18:52.064
CONSUMERS, AND THEN THERE’S SUCH

18:52.064 --> 18:53.232
A CRUSH ON BLACK FRIDAY THEY

18:53.232 --> 18:54.700
WERE COMPETING TO MOVE THINGS UP

18:54.700 --> 18:55.768
INTO THURSDAY.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.203
NOW, THERE’S A BACKLASH, AS YOU

18:57.203 --> 18:58.871
SAY, HARI, WHERE A LOT OF

18:58.871 --> 19:01.340
RETAILERS SEE THAT A LOT OF

19:01.340 --> 19:02.942
CONSUMERS DON’T LIKE THE IDEA OF

19:02.942 --> 19:04.176
SHOPPING ON THANKSGIVING, AND

19:04.176 --> 19:05.911
THEY THINK THAT WORKERS SHOULD

19:05.911 --> 19:06.812
HAVE THE DAY OFF.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.382
SO SOME PROMINENT RETAILERS--

19:09.382 --> 19:11.917
COSTCO, MARSHALL, GAME STOP--

19:11.917 --> 19:13.185
HAVE ALL KIND OF NOT JUST

19:13.185 --> 19:13.886
ANNOUNCED BUT THEY’RE

19:13.886 --> 19:14.920
BOASTING, "WE’RE GOING TO

19:14.920 --> 19:16.989
REMAIN CLOSED ON THANKSGIVING.

19:16.989 --> 19:17.990
IT SHOWS THAT WE CARE ABOUT OUR

19:17.990 --> 19:18.657
WORKERS.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.425
IT SHOWS WE CARE ABOUT THE

19:19.425 --> 19:19.959
HOLIDAY.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.527
IT SHOWS WE CARE ABOUT THEIR

19:21.527 --> 19:22.194
FAMILIES."

19:22.194 --> 19:23.362
THERE’S AN INTERESTING TUG-OF-

19:23.362 --> 19:25.831
WAR NOW ABOUT WHETHER TO STAY

19:25.831 --> 19:28.267
OPEN TO PLEASE CONSUMERS OR STAY

19:28.267 --> 19:31.137
CLOSED KIND OF TO PLEASE WORKERS

19:31.137 --> 19:32.271
AND IT’S, I THINK, VERY GOOD

19:32.271 --> 19:33.939
PUBLIC RELATIONS TO REMAIN

19:33.939 --> 19:34.740
CLOSED.

19:34.740 --> 19:35.841
>> Sreenivasan: SO, I KNOW THAT

19:35.841 --> 19:37.143
WALMART KIND OF PUSHED BACK AND

19:37.143 --> 19:38.844
SAID, "LOOK, WE’RE ALMOST LIKE

19:38.844 --> 19:40.246
AIRPORTS AND GAS STATIONS, AND

19:40.246 --> 19:41.747
WE’VE BEEN OPEN ON THANKSGIVING

19:41.747 --> 19:43.482
FOR 20 YEARS."

19:43.482 --> 19:45.818
>> ON ONE HAND, WALMART CAN SAY

19:45.818 --> 19:47.853
WE’RE A SUPERMARKET, AND A LOT

19:47.853 --> 19:48.721
OF SUPERMARKETS ARE OPEN

19:48.721 --> 19:50.523
THANKSGIVING MORNING BECAUSE IN

19:50.523 --> 19:52.191
CASE YOU THE NEED THE

19:52.191 --> 19:54.360
CRANBERRIES OR CRANBERRY SAUCE,

19:54.360 --> 19:56.095
OR GOD FORBID YOU FORGOT A

19:56.095 --> 19:57.196
TURKEY.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.031
THE OTHER PART OF THE WALMART IS

19:59.031 --> 20:00.966
THE VERY COMPETITIVE RETAILER

20:00.966 --> 20:04.170
THAT MOVED BLACK FRIDAY INTO

20:04.170 --> 20:05.471
THURSDAY THE WAY MANY OTHER

20:05.471 --> 20:07.773
RETAILERS HAVE, AND THAT MEANT

20:07.773 --> 20:09.542
IT NEEDED A LOT MORE WORKERS.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.178
THAT MEANT KIND OF PRESSURED--

20:12.178 --> 20:13.746
INVITE A LOT OF CONSUMERS TO GET

20:13.746 --> 20:15.081
UP FROM THEIR THANKSGIVING TABLE

20:15.081 --> 20:16.482
AT 4:00 P.M. AND RUSH OVER TO

20:16.482 --> 20:17.883
WALMART AND WAIT IN LINE FOR TWO

20:17.883 --> 20:18.951
HOURS TO SHOP.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.687
AND WALMART HAS IN WAYS SEEN

20:21.687 --> 20:23.389
THAT’S A PROBLEM.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.457
IT’S GOING TO REMAIN OPEN ON

20:24.457 --> 20:26.158
THANKSGIVING, BUT IT SAW THAT

20:26.158 --> 20:27.226
SO MANY CONSUMERS ARE UNHAPPY

20:27.226 --> 20:28.360
ABOUT HAVING TO WAITING AN HOUR,

20:28.360 --> 20:29.462
TWO HOURS, THREE HOURS IN LINE

20:29.462 --> 20:30.996
ON THANKSGIVING DAY AND BLACK

20:30.996 --> 20:32.731
FRIDAY FOR BLACK FRIDAY SALES,

20:32.731 --> 20:35.067
IT SAYS BLACK FRIDAY IS GOING TO

20:35.067 --> 20:36.335
MAGICALLY BECOME A FIVE-DAY

20:36.335 --> 20:37.903
AFFAIR WHERE THE BLACK FRIDAY

20:37.903 --> 20:39.171
SALES WILL BE SPREAD.

20:39.171 --> 20:41.140
AND THAT MIGHT MEAN FEWER

20:41.140 --> 20:42.208
PEOPLE WILL BE NEEDED TO WORK ON

20:42.208 --> 20:43.676
THANKSGIVING DAY.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.578
>> Sreenivasan: THIS IS ALSO A

20:45.578 --> 20:47.079
BIG, BIG MOMENT THAT STARTS THE

20:47.079 --> 20:48.080
SEASON.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.049
AND FOR RETAILERS THIS LAST

20:50.049 --> 20:51.016
STRETCH OF THE YEAR IS

20:51.016 --> 20:51.784
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO THEIR

20:51.784 --> 20:52.952
BOTTOM LINE, RIGHT?

20:52.952 --> 20:53.452
>> ABSOLUTELY.

20:53.452 --> 20:54.553
THEY CALL IT BLACK FRIDAY

20:54.553 --> 20:56.689
BECAUSE IN THEORY THEY’VE BEEN

20:56.689 --> 20:58.057
RUNNING IN THE RED ALL YEAR LONG

20:58.057 --> 20:59.191
AND ON BLACK FRIDAY’S THEY’RE

20:59.191 --> 21:00.259
MAKING MONEY.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.694
I HAD AN INTERESTING INTERVIEW

21:01.694 --> 21:03.629
WITH THE HEAD P.R. GUY FOR

21:03.629 --> 21:05.397
NORDSTROM, AND HE SAID, "WE USED

21:05.397 --> 21:08.834
TO BE CLOSED ON JULY 4 AND NEW

21:08.834 --> 21:10.469
YEAR’S DAY BUT OUR CONSUMERS

21:10.469 --> 21:12.404
PUSHED US TO OPEN THOSE DAYS.

21:12.404 --> 21:13.672
SO NOW WE’RE OPEN NEW YEAR’S DAY

21:13.672 --> 21:14.507
AND JULY 4."

21:14.507 --> 21:16.175
BUT HE SAID, "BUT SO FAR, OUR

21:16.175 --> 21:18.244
CONSUMERS AND SHOPPERS AREN’T

21:18.244 --> 21:19.712
PUSHING US TO OPEN ON

21:19.712 --> 21:21.580
THANKSGIVING, AND IF THEY DO,

21:21.580 --> 21:23.115
THEN EVEN WE-- GREAT,

21:23.115 --> 21:25.384
PRESTIGIOUS NORDSTROM-- MIGHT DO

21:25.384 --> 21:26.452
THAT AS WELL."

21:26.452 --> 21:27.620
SO, THERE REALLY ARE A LOT OF

21:27.620 --> 21:28.387
OF CONFLICTING PRESSURES.

21:28.387 --> 21:29.922
A LOT OF WORKERS REALLY DON’T

21:29.922 --> 21:31.323
WANT TO WORK THAT DAY.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.959
AND A LOT OF CONSUMERS, IF THEY

21:33.959 --> 21:35.728
COULD GET A GOOD BARGAIN THAT

21:35.728 --> 21:37.229
DAY, THEY’RE HAPPY TO GO.

21:37.229 --> 21:38.464
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS THIS

21:38.464 --> 21:39.398
POLL DONE LAST YEAR BY THE

21:39.398 --> 21:40.699
UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT WHERE,

21:43.002 --> 21:44.970
SHOPPERS SAY THEY REALLY DON’T

21:44.970 --> 21:46.705
LOVE TO GO OUT RUNNING FOR BLACK

21:46.705 --> 21:49.141
FRIDAY SALES ON THANKSGIVING

21:49.141 --> 21:51.043
DAY, AND JUST 7% SAID THEY’RE

21:51.043 --> 21:52.077
HAPPY TO.

21:52.077 --> 21:54.847
BUT MAYBE A LOT OF RETAILERS ARE

21:54.847 --> 21:57.249
EAGER NOT TO MISS THAT 7%.

21:57.249 --> 21:58.083
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS.

WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO SHOW IS A

22:34.320 --> 22:36.422
NEW PLAN TO USE ANOTHER

22:36.422 --> 22:38.457
ALTERNATIVE AND UTTERLY RELIABLE

22:45.030 --> 22:46.265

22:46.265 --> 22:47.633
BUT JUST BECAUSE IT’S BEEN

22:47.633 --> 22:49.301
FLUSHED DOWN THE DRAIN DOES NOT

22:49.301 --> 22:50.669
MEAN IT’S UNWANTED.

22:50.669 --> 22:53.172
IN FACT, IT’S A FUEL, AND IN

22:53.172 --> 22:54.873
THIS CASE, WHERE THERE’S MUCK,

22:54.873 --> 22:57.876
THERE’S MILEAGE.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.278
FOR THE FIRST TIME, A BUS IS

22:59.278 --> 23:00.946
BEING POWERED BY THE METHANE

GAS GENERATED FROM THE TREATMENT

23:03.082 --> 23:06.252
OF HUMAN AND FOOD WASTE.

23:06.252 --> 23:08.320

GET THE HEADLINES, BUT IT

23:16.161 --> 23:18.130
DOESN’T REALLY RUN ON WASTE.

23:18.130 --> 23:19.131
OBVIOUSLY, IT RUNS ON THE

23:19.131 --> 23:21.000
BY-PRODUCT OF WASTE.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.435
AND BIO-METHANE IS NOT A

23:23.435 --> 23:24.336
FOSSIL FUEL.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.538
IT’S INFINITELY RENEWABLE.

23:26.538 --> 23:27.840
ALL THE TIME THERE ARE PEOPLE ON

23:27.840 --> 23:29.875
THE PLANET PRODUCING WASTE, THE

23:29.875 --> 23:32.011
BIO-METHANE WILL BE PRODUCED.

IMPURITIES BEFORE ADDING AN ODOR

23:44.623 --> 23:46.425
REACHES THE EXACTING STANDARDS

23:46.425 --> 23:49.328
REQUIRED FOR THE FUEL TANK.

23:49.328 --> 23:50.829
>> THE EMISSION LEVELS ARE 92%

23:50.829 --> 23:51.997
LESS THAN WHAT YOU WOULD
