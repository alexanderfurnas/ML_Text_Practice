02:08.428 --> 02:09.896
SYRIA, THE GOVERNMENT'S LAST

02:09.896 --> 02:14.134
STRONGHOLD IN THE AREA.

02:14.134 --> 02:21.575
IRAQ'S FOREIGN MINISTER CALLED

02:21.575 --> 02:23.210
FOR INTERNATIONAL HELP IN ITS

02:23.210 --> 02:24.945
BATTLE AGAINST ISIS.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.380
LAWMAKERS HERE CONTINUE TO

02:26.380 --> 02:27.681
EXPRESS OUTRAGE OVER THE

02:27.681 --> 02:29.049
EXECUTION OF AN AMERICAN

02:29.049 --> 02:30.951
JOURNALIST, SAYING THE GROUP

02:30.951 --> 02:32.652
COULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO ATTACK

02:32.652 --> 02:34.321
INSIDE THE U.S.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.189
>> THEY'VE EXPRESSED A WILL TO

02:36.189 --> 02:36.890
HIT THE HOME LAND.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.358
THAT'S PART OF THEIR AGENDA

02:38.358 --> 02:39.626
TO DRIVE US OUT OF THE MIDEAST.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.828
IF OUR GROUND FORCES TELL US

02:41.828 --> 02:46.767
THAT WE NEED FORCES TO DEFEAT

02:46.767 --> 02:48.068
ISIL, SO BE IT.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.236
>> Sreenivasan: DEMOCRATIC

02:49.236 --> 02:50.604
SENATOR JACK REED URGED CAUTION.

02:50.604 --> 02:51.571
>> WE HAVE TO BEGIN WITH THE

02:51.571 --> 02:52.873
PRESUMPTION THAT THERE COULD BE

02:52.873 --> 02:54.207
SUCH A THREAT BUT TO JUMP FROM

02:54.207 --> 02:56.143
WHAT THEY'VE DONE WHICH IS

02:56.143 --> 02:58.178
HORRIFIC PARTICULARLY THE

02:58.178 --> 02:59.346
MURDER OF MR. FOLEY TO THE

02:59.346 --> 03:00.914
ASSUMPTION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

03:00.914 --> 03:06.086
BE AN IMMEDIATE AND WITHIN DAYS

03:06.086 --> 03:07.721
THREAT TO US HERE IN OUR HOME

03:07.721 --> 03:09.556
LAND I THINK YOU DON'T JUMP TO

03:09.556 --> 03:10.824
THAT ASSUMPTION.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.192
>> BRITAIN'S AMBASSADOR TO THE

03:12.192 --> 03:13.527
UNITED STATES SAYS HIS COUNTRY

03:13.527 --> 03:14.928
IS CLOSE TO IDENTIFYING THE MAN

03:14.928 --> 03:16.830
SEEN ON THE VIDEO AT JAMES

03:16.830 --> 03:18.532
FOLEY'S EXECUTION.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.100
>> THERE ARE SOPHISTICATED VOICE

03:20.100 --> 03:25.806
TECHNOLOGIES TO BE SURE WHO THIS

03:25.806 --> 03:27.707
PERSON IS BEFORE VERY LONG.

03:27.707 --> 03:28.675
>> Sreenivasan: AND THIS

03:28.675 --> 03:30.077
AFTERNOON, A MASS TO HONOR THE

03:30.077 --> 03:31.445
SLAIN JOURNALIST WAS HELD IN HIS

03:31.445 --> 03:32.612
HOME TOWN OF ROCHESTER, NEW

03:32.612 --> 03:34.214
HAMPSHIRE.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.217
JOINING US FROM WASHINGTON IS

03:37.217 --> 03:38.685
IS FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.620
IT SEEMS TO BE PACE OF CHANGE

03:40.620 --> 03:42.456
HERE IN THE U.S. ATTITUDE AND

03:42.456 --> 03:45.725
INVOLVEMENT IN SYRIA OR IN AIR

03:45.725 --> 03:47.260
STRIKES HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY

03:47.260 --> 03:49.463
JUST IN THE LAST 24 OR 36 HOURS.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.964
>> YES, THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT

03:50.964 --> 03:52.666
THE BEHEADING OF JAMES FOLEY

03:52.666 --> 03:54.067
CHANGED THE CALCULUS FOR THE

03:54.067 --> 03:55.735
ADMINISTRATION HERE AND THE

03:55.735 --> 03:57.337
RHETORIC RAMPED UP ALMOST

03:57.337 --> 03:58.772
IMMEDIATELY.

03:58.772 --> 03:59.973
YOU HEARD SECRETARY OF STATE

03:59.973 --> 04:00.841
KERRY SAID THEY'RE WICKEDNESS

04:00.841 --> 04:01.875
THAT HAS TO BE DESTROYED.

04:01.875 --> 04:05.545
THE PENTAGON IS ESCALATING ITS

04:05.545 --> 04:08.148
EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY TARGETS

04:08.148 --> 04:10.016
INSIDE SYRIA.

04:10.016 --> 04:11.651
THEY'RE LOOKING AT EXPANDING THE

04:11.651 --> 04:14.554
AIR CAMPAIGN IN IRAQ.

04:14.554 --> 04:16.890
I THINK MILITARILY, THEY COULD

04:16.890 --> 04:17.891
EXPAND THIS FAIRLY QUICKLY.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.426
I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO SEE IN

04:19.426 --> 04:20.560
THE COMING WEEK IS WHETHER

04:20.560 --> 04:22.863
THERE'S A POLITICAL WILL TO MOVE

04:22.863 --> 04:25.599
IN THIS DIRECTION, AND YOU'LL

04:25.599 --> 04:26.833
PROBABLY REMEMBER IT WAS A YEAR

04:26.833 --> 04:28.635
AGO THAT WE WERE HAVING A

04:28.635 --> 04:31.705
SIMILAR CONVERSATION AFTER

04:31.705 --> 04:36.209
PRESIDENT ASSAD WAS ACCUSED OF

04:36.209 --> 04:38.211
THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK THAT

04:38.211 --> 04:39.479
KILLED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND

04:39.479 --> 04:42.582
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS ASKING FOR

04:42.582 --> 04:43.917
AIR STRIKES IN SYRIA THEN AS

04:43.917 --> 04:44.751
WELL.

04:44.751 --> 04:46.987
>> WHETHER OR NOT THE ISLAMIC

04:46.987 --> 04:47.988
STATE IS A THREAT TO THE HOME

04:47.988 --> 04:48.989
LAND.

04:48.989 --> 04:49.856
>> YES.

04:49.856 --> 04:52.058
WELL AND THERE'S NO QUESTION

04:52.058 --> 04:54.127
THEY'RE A GROWING THREAT TO

04:54.127 --> 04:54.761
AMERICANS.

04:54.761 --> 04:56.329
FROM THE ISLAMIC STATE'S

04:56.329 --> 04:57.664
PERSPECTIVE, THEY'RE SAYING THAT

04:57.664 --> 05:00.300
THE AIR STRIKES IN IRAQ THAT

05:00.300 --> 05:01.535
PRESIDENT OBAMA AUTHORIZED ARE

05:01.535 --> 05:02.769
AN ATTACK ON THEM.

05:02.769 --> 05:04.337
AND NOW THEY'RE TURNING THEIR

05:04.337 --> 05:05.472
FOCUS ON US.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.240
NOW, THE QUESTION IS ARE THEY A

05:07.240 --> 05:09.609
THREAT TO THE CONTINENTAL UNITED

05:09.609 --> 05:10.944
STATES AND THAT'S VERY MUCH OPEN

05:10.944 --> 05:12.779
FOR DEBATE.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.948
MARTIN DEMPSEY, THE TOP GENERAL

05:14.948 --> 05:16.816
FOR AMERICA, SAID RECENTLY AS

05:16.816 --> 05:18.385
THIS WEEK THAT HE BELIEVES THEY

05:18.385 --> 05:20.353
ARE A REGIONAL THREAT, THAT

05:20.353 --> 05:22.022
THEY'RE A THREAT TO THE REGION

05:22.022 --> 05:24.991
BUT THAT THEY COULDN'T STAGE ANY

05:24.991 --> 05:26.927
KIND OF 9/11 TYPE ATTACK ON THE

05:26.927 --> 05:27.794
UNITED STATES.

05:27.794 --> 05:29.663
AS YOU'LL HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE

05:29.663 --> 05:31.531
SAY, THE ENEMY HAS A VOTE ON

05:31.531 --> 05:33.166
THIS AND THEY'RE CLEARLY TURNING

05:33.166 --> 05:34.734
THEIR FOCUS ON US AND WE DON'T

05:34.734 --> 05:35.702
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

05:35.702 --> 05:38.171
THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS THESE

05:38.171 --> 05:39.739
FOREIGN FIGHTERS LIKE THE MAN

05:39.739 --> 05:41.474
WHO APPARENTLY BEHEADED JAMES

05:41.474 --> 05:44.511
FOLEY WHO HAD A BRITISH ACCENT

05:44.511 --> 05:48.782
AND TIES TO ENGLAND.

05:48.782 --> 05:53.420
WHETHER THOSE COULD COME BACK IN

05:53.420 --> 05:55.689
ONES OR TWOS OR THREES AND

05:55.689 --> 05:56.990
ATTACK.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.291
>> WOULD THAT BE A DECLARATION

05:58.291 --> 05:59.092
OF WAR?

05:59.092 --> 06:01.628
>> YES, WELL THIS IS THE DEBATE

06:01.628 --> 06:03.363
I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO SEE PLAY

06:03.363 --> 06:04.464
OUT THIS WEEK AND I THINK THE

06:04.464 --> 06:05.532
ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO

06:05.532 --> 06:07.834
FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR RATIONALE

06:07.834 --> 06:09.035
WOULD BE.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.570
THE INITIAL SIGNALS FROM THE

06:10.570 --> 06:11.438
ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE THAT

06:11.438 --> 06:13.273
THEY USE THE BROUGHT SELF

06:13.273 --> 06:14.140
DEFENSE ARGUMENT THAT THEY WOULD

06:14.140 --> 06:16.009
BE ATTACKING ISLAMIC STATE

06:16.009 --> 06:17.844
FIGHTERS THAT THEY BELIEVE ARE

06:17.844 --> 06:19.713
AN IMMINENT THREAT TO AMERICANS.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.615
BUT THERE ARE THOSE IN CONGRESS

06:21.615 --> 06:23.483
THAT BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT

06:23.483 --> 06:25.151
CAN AND SHOULD COME TO THEM FOR

06:25.151 --> 06:26.953
SUPPORT FOR AUTHORIZATION FOR A

06:26.953 --> 06:28.755
BROADER WAR, AND THE PRESIDENT

06:28.755 --> 06:30.457
HIMSELF HAS INDICATED THAT HE'S

06:30.457 --> 06:31.958
WILLING TO DO THIS AND HAS

06:31.958 --> 06:35.262
THOUGHT ABOUT DOING IT THIS IS

06:35.262 --> 06:37.230
PAST -- IT IN THE PAST.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.099
WE HAVE SEEN HIM CHANGE HIS

06:39.099 --> 06:41.034
THINKING ON THIS IN THE PAST AND

06:41.034 --> 06:42.469
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY

06:42.469 --> 06:43.270
WILL COME DOWN.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.973
>> ALL RIGHT, DION NISSENBAUM

06:46.973 --> 06:48.675
FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,

06:48.675 --> 06:50.644

07:07.794 --> 07:09.062
HAMAS AS THEY ARE ALL CONSIDERED

07:09.062 --> 07:10.397
TARGETS.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.264

07:22.142 --> 07:23.043
FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA SINCE

07:23.043 --> 07:24.311
FRIDAY.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.112
THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS MAKE THE

07:26.112 --> 07:27.480
TREACHEROUS AND OFTEN DEADLY

07:27.480 --> 07:28.248
TRIP FROM NORTH AFRICA TO EUROPE

07:28.248 --> 07:29.683
EACH YEAR.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.117
THE BREAKDOWN OF ORDER IN LIBYA

07:31.117 --> 07:32.385
HAS LED TO AN INCREASE IN

07:32.385 --> 07:33.753
ATTEMPTED CROSSINGS.

07:33.753 --> 07:35.288
ON FRIDAY A BOAT CARRYING UP TO

16:03.229 --> 16:04.363
THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE LAW

16:04.363 --> 16:06.132
HERE, HE SAYS THAT FOR THE LAW

16:06.132 --> 16:07.733
TO BE EFFECTIVE IT MUST EMPOWER

16:07.733 --> 16:12.171
WOMEN TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES,

16:12.171 --> 16:13.039
WHICH THE CURRENT LAW NOW

16:13.039 --> 16:14.607
LIMITS.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.042
WITHOUT THOSE CHOICES MANY WOMEN

16:16.042 --> 16:17.276
MAY STILL FEEL THE NEED TO SEEK

16:17.276 --> 16:19.278
OUT ABORTIONS.

16:19.278 --> 16:21.280
HERE IN MANILA, THAT MEANS A

16:21.280 --> 16:24.817
VISIT TO WHAT COULD BE DESCRIBED

16:24.817 --> 16:25.785
AS AN ABORTION BLACK MARKET,

AS A WAY TO END UNWANTED

16:38.898 --> 16:41.567
PREGNANCIES.

16:41.567 --> 16:42.935
FOR THE EQUIVALENT OF FIVE

16:42.935 --> 16:45.037
DOLLARS, WE WERE ABLE TO BUY

16:45.037 --> 16:47.840
THIS CONCOCTION-- WHAT THE

THE NEED TO CONTROL THIS

18:10.456 --> 18:11.724
COUNTRY'S POPULATION GROWTH IS

18:11.724 --> 18:13.125
BECOMING A MATTER OF SURVIVAL

OF SURVIVAL FROM THE CRADLE TO

FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IN LIBERIA,

19:15.521 --> 19:17.289
ONE IS REALLY ONE OF GOVERNMENT

19:17.289 --> 19:18.224
MISTRUST IS STILL THERE.

19:18.224 --> 19:20.092
THIS IS A COUNTRY THAT FOUGHT A

19:20.092 --> 19:21.727
14 YEAR CIVIL WAR ONE OF THE

19:21.727 --> 19:23.429
MOST HORRIFIC IN MODERN MEMORY.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.000
THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WHICH IS

19:28.000 --> 19:29.769
THAT PEOPLE THINK THAT EBOLA IS

19:29.769 --> 19:32.071
A CONSPIRACY OR A GOVERNMENT

STARTED RUMOR IS STILL THERE.

19:37.143 --> 19:39.612

19:39.612 --> 19:41.647
PROBABLY THAT THERE WILL BE MORE

19:41.647 --> 19:45.384

19:45.384 --> 19:47.353
PEOPLE GET HUNGRY IN THE

20:44.477 --> 20:48.447
WE'RE WAY PAST THAT POINT WHERE

20:48.447 --> 20:49.915
