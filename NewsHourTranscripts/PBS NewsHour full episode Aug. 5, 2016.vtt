JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.607 --> 00:09.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight, the
focus is on
our pocketbooks.

00:09.877 --> 00:14.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the latest jobs numbers, we
compare the
presidential candidates'
approaches to the

00:14.648 --> 00:16.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
economy.

00:16.516 --> 00:21.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: combating the wave of
children soldiers
being recruited by ISIS, while
dealing with

00:21.889 --> 00:24.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the trauma left in the terror
group's wake.

00:24.358 --> 00:28.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RANIA, Mother (through
translator): He was
telling me all the time, "I will
be a suicide

00:28.328 --> 00:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bomber," and he was so happy,
but he didn't
know what it meant.

00:32.499 --> 00:33.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is what scared me.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

00:35.602 --> 00:40.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Brooks and Ruth Marcus
take on another
week of political roller
coasters.

00:40.774 --> 00:47.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:47.648 --> 00:50.417 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:50.450 --> 01:00.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's been just
one week since
the Democratic Convention ended,
and Hillary

01:00.294 --> 01:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton has surged to big leads
over Republican
Donald Trump in virtually every
national poll.

01:06.600 --> 01:11.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, new numbers put her ahead
by as much
as 15 points, and found her
trying to win

01:11.905 --> 01:14.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over doubters.

01:14.508 --> 01:19.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton ended the week
on a high note,
but she acknowledged today that
many voters

01:19.813 --> 01:21.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
say they still don't trust her.

01:21.982 --> 01:24.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She spoke to black and Hispanic
journalists
in Washington.

01:24.785 --> 01:27.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
It doesn't make me feel good
when people say

01:27.254 --> 01:30.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those things, and I recognize
that I have
work to do.

01:30.891 --> 01:37.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to work my heart out
in this campaign
and as president to produce
results for people.

01:37.631 --> 01:43.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same time,
Clinton secured
a major endorsement from former
acting CIA

01:43.570 --> 01:45.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Director Mike Morell.

01:45.405 --> 01:50.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wrote in The New York Times
that Donald
Trump has no experience in
national security,

01:50.944 --> 01:56.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, worse yet -- quote -- "The
character
traits he has exhibited during
the primary

01:56.116 --> 02:01.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
season suggest he would be a
poor, even dangerous,
commander in chief."

02:01.922 --> 02:08.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Morell said Trump's praise of
Russian President
Vladimir Putin suggests he's
become a -- quote

02:08.161 --> 02:10.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- "unwitting agent of the
Russians."

02:10.597 --> 02:17.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But on NBC this morning,
Republican vice presidential
nominee Mike Pence dismissed the
Morell endorsement.

02:17.604 --> 02:19.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
Truthfully, honestly, the
comment by the former

02:21.308 --> 02:25.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CIA official, I suppose this is
the same CIA
that told the president that
ISIS was the

02:25.545 --> 02:27.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
J.V. team.

02:27.280 --> 02:31.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
back-and-forth came as
Trump admitted he'd been
mistaken in saying

02:31.451 --> 02:38.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he'd seen video of Iranians
unloading a U.S.
cash payment this year around
the same time

02:38.558 --> 02:42.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
four Americans were freed from
Iranian prisons.

02:42.195 --> 02:48.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Trump tweeted: "The plane
I saw on
television was the hostage plane
in Geneva,

02:48.268 --> 02:54.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Switzerland, not the plane
carrying $400 million
in cash going to Iran."

02:54.274 --> 03:00.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, Trump and Pence linked up
in Des Moines,
Iowa, as they work to rally the
heartland

03:00.147 --> 03:01.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against Clinton.

03:01.882 --> 03:06.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
If Hillary Clinton becomes
president, you

03:06.920 --> 03:15.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will have -- you will have
terrorism, you
will have problems, you will
have really,

03:15.729 --> 03:20.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in my opinion, the destruction
of this country
from within.

03:20.200 --> 03:25.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump also holds
a rally in
Green Bay, Wisconsin, this
evening, amid reports

03:25.839 --> 03:32.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's about to reverse himself,
and endorse
House Speaker Paul Ryan in his
primary election,

03:32.746 --> 03:34.681 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
after all.

03:34.714 --> 03:40.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But intraparty divisions will
still be on
display, with Wisconsin's top
Republican officials.

03:40.754 --> 03:47.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ryan, U.S. Senator Ron Johnson,
and Governor
Scott Walker all planning to be
somewhere

03:47.127 --> 03:49.496 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
else instead.

03:49.529 --> 03:54.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: July
proved to be
a healthy month for hiring by
U.S. employers.

03:54.634 --> 03:59.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Labor Department reports a
net gain of
255,000 jobs for the month.

03:59.906 --> 04:05.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The unemployment rate stayed at
4.9 percent,
as more people entered the work
force and

04:05.345 --> 04:07.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nearly all were hired.

04:07.180 --> 04:11.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will take a deeper look at
the economy
in this presidential campaign
year right after

04:11.318 --> 04:13.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the news summary.

04:13.120 --> 04:17.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The jobs report gave Wall Street
a big boost,
leading to their biggest gains
in almost a

04:17.257 --> 04:18.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
month.

04:18.692 --> 04:24.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 191
points to close at 18543.

04:24.064 --> 04:29.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly 55 points
and the S&amp;P
500 added 18.

04:29.069 --> 04:34.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Authorities in Chicago released
video today
from the fatal shooting of a
black teenager

04:34.407 --> 04:36.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by police last week.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul O'Neal was mortally wounded
during a
car chase.

04:39.846 --> 04:45.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The clips show police firing
multiple times
at the speeding car, and then
chasing O'Neal

04:45.852 --> 04:47.554 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on foot.

04:47.587 --> 04:52.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officers can be heard saying
they thought
they'd been shot at first, but
no gun was

04:52.225 --> 04:54.060 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
found.

04:54.094 --> 04:58.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In South Africa, tonight, the
ruling African
National Congress is facing its
worst electoral

04:58.932 --> 05:03.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defeat since it ended white
minority rule
in 1994.

05:03.737 --> 05:08.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Results from local elections
show the group
losing control of the city of
Port Elizabeth

05:08.575 --> 05:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and possibly of Johannesburg and
Pretoria.

05:11.811 --> 05:15.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's driven by a poor economy
and alleged
corruption.

05:15.482 --> 05:20.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): You
saw how the
ANC performed in the township
here.

05:20.921 --> 05:25.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nothing seems to progress, but
go and see
how they stay in top hotels, and
at the end

05:25.125 --> 05:28.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the day, they give us
T-shirts and no service
delivery.

05:28.094 --> 05:34.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: These local
results could foreshadow
trouble for the ANC in national
elections

05:34.234 --> 05:36.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coming in 2019.

05:36.336 --> 05:41.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's word that Islamic State
fighters have
captured some 3,000 villagers in
Northern

05:41.074 --> 05:42.909 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iraq.

05:42.943 --> 05:47.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. Refugee Agency reports
that it happened
Thursday as the refugees were
trying to reach

05:47.113 --> 05:48.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shelter in Kirkuk.

05:48.915 --> 05:55.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
U.N. officials say ISIS
militants are using
the Iraqis as human shields
against attacks

05:55.055 --> 05:57.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by government forces.

05:57.457 --> 06:01.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's officially opening
night at the Summer
Olympics in Brazil.

06:01.861 --> 06:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The run-up in Rio de Janeiro has
been marked
by political and economic
turmoil, and worries

06:07.500 --> 06:09.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about Zika and pollution.

06:09.836 --> 06:15.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even today, the Olympic torch
was forced to
detour after thousands of
protesters blocked

06:15.642 --> 06:17.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Copacabana Beach Boulevard.

06:17.944 --> 06:21.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were calling for the
interim president's
removal.

06:21.982 --> 06:26.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
contrasting
the presidential candidates'
plans to boost

06:26.553 --> 06:32.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the economy; children recruited
into brutal
ISIS missions; Hillary Clinton's
statements

06:32.692 --> 06:43.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the e-mail investigation in
context; and
much more.

06:43.637 --> 06:52.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's U.S. jobs report was
largely seen
as a solid one, and in many
respects better

06:52.279 --> 06:53.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than economists had predicted.

06:53.847 --> 06:59.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the year so far, the economy
is gaining
about 185,000 jobs a month.

07:00.020 --> 07:05.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for many Americans who have
seen slow
wage growth for years, the
recovery doesn't

07:05.191 --> 07:09.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yet feel like one, and both
presidential nominees
are speaking to that.

07:09.863 --> 07:15.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump has proposed tax
cuts across
the board, including for the
wealthy, as well

07:15.068 --> 07:19.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as new tariffs and escalating
battles over
trade.

07:19.072 --> 07:23.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump will be laying out more
about his proposals
on Monday, but he told voters in
Ashburn,

07:23.777 --> 07:26.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Virginia, this week that his
ideas would boost
the economy.

07:26.746 --> 07:30.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
This is the third straight
quarter that the

07:30.550 --> 07:41.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economy has grown under 2
percent and is the
single weakest, weakest of any
economic expansion

07:41.161 --> 07:43.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in more than 70 years.

07:43.697 --> 07:49.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Household incomes are more than
$4,000 lower
than their levels in the year
2000.

07:49.102 --> 07:55.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Think of it, household incomes
-- you're now
making $4,000 less now than you
did 16, 17

07:55.108 --> 07:56.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
years ago.

07:56.943 --> 08:02.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another one that's very common
and out there,
people, many people in this
room, but people

08:02.682 --> 08:09.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are making, in terms of real
wages, less money
today than they made 18 years
ago.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're working two jobs in
many cases.

08:11.791 --> 08:16.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For her part,
Hillary Clinton
has also tried to address
economic anxiety

08:16.963 --> 08:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and persistent concerns over
stagnation.

08:20.066 --> 08:21.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Her plan is quite different.

08:21.901 --> 08:26.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's been making the case at
her rallies
for an agenda that includes tax
hikes on the

08:26.473 --> 08:32.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wealthiest, a higher minimum
wage nationwide,
and new tuition aid in higher
education.

08:32.879 --> 08:38.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Las Vegas yesterday, she
joined Senator
Harry Reid and called for a big
boost in spending

08:38.284 --> 08:40.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on infrastructure.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
We are going to create more good
jobs with

08:42.989 --> 08:44.724 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rising incomes.

08:44.758 --> 08:50.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to have the biggest
investment
in new jobs that we have had
since World War

08:50.463 --> 08:51.431 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
II.

08:51.464 --> 08:52.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, how are we going to do
that?

08:52.766 --> 08:56.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, number one, we are going
to do exactly
what Harry said.

08:56.803 --> 09:02.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We are going to have an
investment in infrastructure,
our roads, our bridges, our
tunnels, our ports,

09:02.842 --> 09:03.810 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our airports.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

09:05.345 --> 09:08.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: For
every billion
dollars, we get 47,500 jobs.

09:08.314 --> 09:12.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they are mostly good union
jobs with a
good middle-class income.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

09:14.354 --> 09:21.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, now let's
look deeper
into what the candidates are
proposing, as

09:21.127 --> 09:24.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of our coverage looking
more closely
at the issues.

09:24.431 --> 09:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jared Bernstein is an informal
adviser to
the Clinton campaign.

09:27.300 --> 09:31.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was a former economic adviser
to Vice President
Biden.

09:31.037 --> 09:34.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now at the Center on Budget
and Policy
Priorities.

09:34.441 --> 09:38.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stephen Moore is a senior
economic adviser
to the Trump campaign, and a
fellow at the

09:38.711 --> 09:40.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Heritage Foundation.

09:40.213 --> 09:44.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a former member of the
editorial board
of The Wall Street Journal.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the program.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Stephen Moore, let me start with
you.

09:48.421 --> 09:52.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to get from both of you
your quick
take on today's jobs report.

09:52.358 --> 09:58.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the surface, most of the
reaction, Stephen
Moore, has been, this is
positive, 255,000

09:58.698 --> 10:02.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jobs in the month of July, but
Donald Trump
painting a dark picture here.

10:02.902 --> 10:04.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's your take?

10:04.671 --> 10:06.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN MOORE, Trump Campaign
Adviser: No,
I think he's painting a
realistic picture.

10:06.506 --> 10:10.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at what has happened
to incomes,
the Census Bureau just came out
with a report

10:10.610 --> 10:15.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recently shows that the median
family in America,
the part of the middle class,
has actually

10:15.715 --> 10:17.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lost income during this
recovery.

10:17.450 --> 10:21.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We haven't ever seen a recovery,
at least
since the Great Depression,
when, during a

10:21.955 --> 10:23.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
recovery, people lost income.

10:23.790 --> 10:28.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By the way, if you're losing
income, you are
in a personal recession, so a
lot of people

10:28.628 --> 10:30.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't think there has been much
of a recovery
at all.

10:30.964 --> 10:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other statistic that came
out in recent
days was this 1 percent growth
rate for the

10:37.203 --> 10:38.771 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last six months.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's a dreadful number.

10:40.707 --> 10:44.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, look, the other thing is
just ask the
American people how they feel
about the economy.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are you confident about it?

10:45.378 --> 10:47.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How are your own personal
finances?

10:47.146 --> 10:51.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all of those statistics show
people are
extremely concerned and they're
financially

10:51.251 --> 10:53.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stressed out.

10:53.052 --> 10:55.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me get
your take
on the jobs report, and if you
want to respond

10:55.421 --> 10:57.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to what he just said, Jared
Bernstein.

10:57.223 --> 10:59.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JARED BERNSTEIN, Clinton
Campaign Economic
Adviser: It was a positive jobs
report, another

10:59.559 --> 11:01.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a series of those reports.

11:01.895 --> 11:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The unemployment rate, at 4.9
percent, is
low.

11:06.666 --> 11:10.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while Stephen was talking
about numbers
that go up to 2014 -- that's the
most recent

11:11.004 --> 11:15.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Census Bureau number -- if you
actually look
more recently, you do find wages
growing,

11:15.909 --> 11:19.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and not just growing at the
middle -- and
I'm talking about in real terms,
adjusted

11:19.245 --> 11:21.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for inflation -- but actually
growing even
more quickly at the bottom.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By the way, one of the reasons
is because
a lot of states have increased
their minimum

11:24.584 --> 11:25.685 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wages.

11:25.718 --> 11:27.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Steve's data is a little bit
out of date
there.

11:27.820 --> 11:31.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, if you do take the
long-term picture
-- and I think Donald Trump went
back to the

11:32.025 --> 11:37.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year 2000 -- you will definitely
find structural
problems in the economy that
persisted.

11:37.897 --> 11:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I put them under the rubric
of inequality.

11:40.733 --> 11:44.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is, GDP has grown, but not
enough of
that growth has reached the
middle class.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a message, by the way,
that you will
hear from both candidates.

11:46.973 --> 11:50.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN MOORE: And, by the way,
there has
been -- the biggest increase in
inequality

11:50.276 --> 11:54.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has actually been in the last
seven years,
which is ironic, because Donald
Trump has

11:54.914 --> 11:56.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
made income inequality a big
issue.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JARED BERNSTEIN: That's
factually incorrect.

11:58.585 --> 12:02.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN MOORE: Yes, if you look
at what the
Gini coefficient, which I don't
want to get

12:02.355 --> 12:06.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into, but it looks at what
happens with inequality,
the top 1 percent and everybody
else.

12:06.826 --> 12:07.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That has actually gone up.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:09.195 --> 12:09.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: Inequality's
actually been
stable...

12:09.963 --> 12:10.930 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:10.964 --> 12:11.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: ... since 2007.

12:11.931 --> 12:12.899 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:12.932 --> 12:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:15.668 --> 12:16.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN MOORE: The top 10
percent have done
very well, the 90 percent not
much.

12:16.836 --> 12:17.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: That, we agree
on.

12:17.837 --> 12:18.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK.

12:18.838 --> 12:19.806 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You do agree.

12:19.839 --> 12:20.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN MOORE: Even Bernie
Sanders says that.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:22.609 --> 12:25.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: If you want to
talk about
the job market, the job market
has actually

12:25.311 --> 12:29.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
generated real wage gains in
recent months,
really over the past few
quarters.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, that's not enough to make
up for...

12:31.317 --> 12:32.285 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:32.318 --> 12:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
both.

12:33.553 --> 12:36.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to get to the proposals
by these two
candidates.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, Stephen Moore, to you first
on jobs.

12:38.591 --> 12:45.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is talking about
a major jobs
program, creating jobs, mainly,
we heard her

12:45.064 --> 12:49.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, through infrastructure,
10.4 million
jobs, she says, we're going to
see.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's wrong with that plan?

12:50.436 --> 12:52.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STEPHEN MOORE: You mean
Hillary's plan?

12:52.205 --> 12:53.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN MOORE: OK.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, look, I think it's very
easy.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It sounds very familiar.

12:57.910 --> 13:03.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's talking about raising the
minimum wage,
more shovel-ready projects for
infrastructure

13:03.216 --> 13:05.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and more taxes increased on the
rich.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gee, where have we heard that
before?

13:07.086 --> 13:10.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's exactly what Obama came in
with seven-and-a-half
years ago.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we have seen the results.

13:12.358 --> 13:13.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It hasn't worked.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jared was there.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was part of the stimulus
plan, one of the
biggest wastes of money we have
ever had in

13:17.897 --> 13:19.098 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this country.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all we have got is $8
trillion of debt
to show for it.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A waste of money?

13:22.635 --> 13:27.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: No, I mean, we
could definitely
re-debate the stimulus plan.

13:27.206 --> 13:30.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's widely agreed upon
by economists
of all stripes that really...

13:30.743 --> 13:32.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STEPHEN MOORE: Not any
conservative economists.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's let
him...

13:33.546 --> 13:36.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: Yes, that that
was instrumental
in getting us to recovery.

13:36.449 --> 13:40.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that when it comes
to the kind
of agenda that Hillary Clinton
is talking

13:40.787 --> 13:46.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about, it's actually structured
to do precisely
what needs to be done in the
context of our

13:46.726 --> 13:50.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conversation, which is help the
middle class
reconnect to the growing
economy.

13:50.863 --> 13:52.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have GDP growth.

13:52.799 --> 13:57.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I agree that it's too slow, but
we're doing
actually better than most other
advanced economies.

13:57.170 --> 14:01.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in order to make that growth
reach the
middle class, we're going to
have to make

14:01.874 --> 14:05.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the kinds of investments she's
talking about,
whether it's college, or
preschool, raising

14:05.445 --> 14:09.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the minimum wage, green
investment infrastructure.

14:09.615 --> 14:13.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are the connective tissue
kinds of ideas
that will help.

14:13.152 --> 14:18.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What won't help -- and here I
want to engage
Steve on this -- is a tax cut
that's heavily

14:18.391 --> 14:20.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tilted towards the wealthy.

14:20.359 --> 14:26.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What that will do is further
exacerbate the
inequality problem and take away
the revenues

14:26.399 --> 14:29.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we need to make the investments
that have
to be forthcoming.

14:29.235 --> 14:31.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And let's get to
that.

14:31.137 --> 14:34.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is Donald Trump's answer
for jobs, for
making sure more people have
good-paying jobs?

14:35.007 --> 14:39.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN MOORE: Well, I think the
heart of
the plan is this business tax
cut.

14:39.412 --> 14:43.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this will be taking America
from having
the highest business tax rate in
the world

14:43.649 --> 14:45.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to one of the lowest.

14:45.518 --> 14:49.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think almost everyone
agrees we should
do this, except maybe Barack
Obama and Hillary

14:49.055 --> 14:50.790 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You bring those businesses taxes
-- and, by
the way, not just big
businesses, but also

14:53.826 --> 14:59.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
small businesses from the career
corner grocer
to the start-up in Silicon
Valley.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:00.867 --> 15:02.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But all the way
up the income
scale, just to be...

15:02.268 --> 15:03.236 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:03.269 --> 15:04.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN MOORE: No, we're talking
businesses.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN MOORE: For businesses,
they're going
to pay -- look, where do jobs
come from?

15:07.673 --> 15:09.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They come from healthy
businesses.

15:09.509 --> 15:12.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Without healthy businesses,
you're not going
to get jobs.

15:12.044 --> 15:16.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the evidence is very clear
that when businesses
invest more -- and if you look,
Judy, in the

15:16.516 --> 15:21.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last year, this is maybe the
killer statistic
for the economy -- businesses
are not investing.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's negative for the last year.

15:22.388 --> 15:24.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When they invest more, wages go
up.

15:24.957 --> 15:25.925 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's the key.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:27.226 --> 15:28.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you want to
answer that
specific point?

15:29.028 --> 15:30.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: When I look at
the plan that
Steve just described, to me, it
solves the

15:30.663 --> 15:32.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
following problem.

15:32.932 --> 15:37.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
America -- American
corporations, American
multinationals aren't rich
enough.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The corporate sector isn't doing
well enough.

15:40.039 --> 15:42.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the problem these guys
seem to be trying
to solve.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, by the way, the team that
was announced
today is all guys.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
In fact...

15:47.046 --> 15:47.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean the
Trump economic
team.

15:47.980 --> 15:48.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: The Trump
economic team.

15:48.981 --> 15:51.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, none of that helps the
middle class.

15:51.384 --> 15:55.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can go cut corporate taxes
all day, but
what we have seen over the past
10 years is

15:55.688 --> 16:00.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
corporate profitability has been
one sector
of the economy that has done
extremely well,

16:00.293 --> 16:03.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
while, as I said earlier, that
growth isn't
reaching the middle class.

16:03.896 --> 16:08.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, how you would then conclude
that what
we need to do is actually be
even kinder to

16:08.968 --> 16:13.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our corporations and cut their
taxes further,
it seems to me to be completely
upside-down.

16:13.339 --> 16:14.307 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:14.340 --> 16:16.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you answer
that?

16:16.209 --> 16:18.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN MOORE: So, this is a
central distinction
between those on the left and
the right.

16:18.578 --> 16:21.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is true corporations are
profitable.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have become lean and
efficient.

16:22.648 --> 16:26.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's amazing corporations can
make money in
this environment, but they do.

16:26.152 --> 16:30.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem has been -- and I
think most economists
agree -- they're sitting on
their balance

16:30.389 --> 16:32.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sheets with like $2 trillion.

16:32.792 --> 16:37.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's not happening to grow the
economy is
they're not re-injecting that
money into investment.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're not investing in plant,
in equipment,
in computers.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are the kinds of things
you need if
you want jobs.

16:43.135 --> 16:45.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you ask them why they aren't
investing.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they say two things.

16:47.373 --> 16:50.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The taxes are too high and the
regulations
are strangling themselves.

16:50.309 --> 16:53.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen businesses move out
of the United
States.

16:53.346 --> 16:58.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have reported on this,
Burger King, Medtronic,
Johnson Controls, Walgreens,
major companies,

16:58.651 --> 16:59.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they say they're leaving
because taxes
are too high.

16:59.986 --> 17:00.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Would you like to
come back
on that?

17:00.987 --> 17:02.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: I agree with
some of that.

17:02.755 --> 17:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I very much agree with this
point that we're
not seeing the kind of business
investment

17:07.226 --> 17:08.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
record that we should.

17:08.494 --> 17:10.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it has nothing to do with
taxes and regulations.

17:10.897 --> 17:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, the cost of
borrowing is the
lowest it's been.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's extremely low.

17:15.301 --> 17:16.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN MOORE: But try getting a
loan.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: I'm talking
about the after-tax
costs.

17:18.371 --> 17:24.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it can't possibly be that
somehow goosing
this process by lowering taxes
even further

17:24.176 --> 17:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- so what we need to do, if the
private sector
is failing to invest the way we
need them

17:28.214 --> 17:30.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to, the public sector must pick
up the slack.

17:30.650 --> 17:34.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that's why this
infrastructure idea that
you hear Hillary Clinton talking
about, it's

17:34.553 --> 17:39.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of her 100-day plan, hit
the ground running
with a deep dive into
infrastructure investment.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That will solve a lot of what's
ailing us,
in my view.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
there's much more
to talk about.

17:43.696 --> 17:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to be coming back to
this time
and again over the course of
this election.

17:47.099 --> 17:48.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you have gotten us started
tonight.

17:48.467 --> 17:49.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we thank you very much.

17:49.468 --> 17:50.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEPHEN MOORE: Thank you.

17:50.703 --> 17:57.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stephen Moore,
Jared Bernstein,
thank you.

17:57.944 --> 18:04.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: Thank you.

18:04.550 --> 18:08.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

18:08.654 --> 18:13.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
David Brooks
and Ruth Marcus take on the
week's news; plus,

18:13.659 --> 18:19.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a wild saga recounts the 1970s
kidnapping
of American heiress Patty
Hearst.

18:19.899 --> 18:24.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first: For centuries,
children have been
used as weapons of war.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today's conflict in Syria is no
exception.

18:27.273 --> 18:33.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS has recruited and exploited
children
in Syria and Iraq, using them as
soldiers,

18:33.145 --> 18:34.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
informants and even
executioners.

18:34.981 --> 18:42.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour" special correspondent
Marcia Biggs
brings us a profile of one
former ISIS child

18:42.254 --> 18:44.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
solder, and his deep emotional
scars.

18:44.824 --> 18:50.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a warning: This report
contains material
that may be disturbing to some
viewers.

18:50.162 --> 18:57.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The images are all
over the
Internet, children growing up in
the ranks

18:57.403 --> 19:00.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of armed groups in the war in
Syria.

19:00.806 --> 19:06.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This child in an ISIS propaganda
video beheads
a Syrian regime soldier.

19:06.178 --> 19:11.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These children execute captured
soldiers in
the ancient city of Palmyra.

19:11.450 --> 19:17.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to a study published
by Georgia
State University, it's a
phenomenon that's

19:17.556 --> 19:22.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
playing out on all sides of the
conflict,
with almost 1,000 children in
the last three

19:22.628 --> 19:28.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years showing up in online
eulogies, calling
kids martyrs, having died for
the cause.

19:29.001 --> 19:33.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those are only the ones
whose videos made
it to the Internet.

19:33.439 --> 19:38.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Riyad Al-Najem represents one of
only a handful
of small local organizations
trying to combat

19:38.911 --> 19:43.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this problem inside Syria,
visiting families
one by one.

19:43.149 --> 19:47.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIYAD AL-NAJEM, Syria: In some
areas, the
main reason of child recruitment
is poverty.

19:47.286 --> 19:53.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parents can't find food for
their children,
so they push them into armed
groups to get

19:53.225 --> 19:54.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
money and food.

19:54.326 --> 19:57.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In other areas, it's about
culture.

19:57.830 --> 20:05.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parents consider that their
children have
become men, and they should
carry weapons,

20:05.237 --> 20:10.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it's not acceptable for a
child of his
cousin holding a weapon and he's
not.

20:10.176 --> 20:14.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: In Idlib province,
activists
from the group Children Not
Soldiers hang

20:15.014 --> 20:18.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
signs and spray-paint graffiti
to create awareness.

20:18.851 --> 20:23.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. has a campaign of the
same name,
but has not yet been able to
gain a foothold

20:23.355 --> 20:25.558 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

20:25.591 --> 20:30.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fighting recruitment of children
is an uphill
battle within a brutal war.

20:30.429 --> 20:36.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And no activists can work in
highly radicalized
areas, where a sinister form of
manipulation

20:36.168 --> 20:38.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is used as ammunition.

20:38.804 --> 20:42.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We met Ibrahim and his mother,
Rania, in a
hotel in Southern Turkey.

20:42.875 --> 20:46.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were too afraid of ISIS
sleeper cells
to meet elsewhere.

20:46.345 --> 20:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We can't show you their faces.

20:48.147 --> 20:54.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before the revolution, Ibrahim
loved math
and dreamed of being an
aeronautical engineer.

20:54.120 --> 21:01.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His father was killed by a
sniper in 2012,
leaving his mother alone with
three children.

21:01.127 --> 21:06.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ibrahim was 13 years old when
ISIS took his
town of Deir el-Zour, and
enlisted him and

21:06.165 --> 21:08.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his friends.

21:08.134 --> 21:12.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM, Former ISIS Soldier
(through translator):
They started to recite verses
from the Koran,

21:12.304 --> 21:14.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
speeches from Mohammed.

21:14.206 --> 21:18.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said they were the real
Islamic State
and would fulfill all the
obligations of Islam.

21:18.110 --> 21:23.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They came to us and said, you
will be martyrs
and you will earn paradise and
virgins.

21:23.048 --> 21:28.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: He says he began
as an informer,
and then graduated to weapons
training.

21:28.854 --> 21:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM (through translator):
They had me
be a rat for the people who
smoked, who didn't

21:34.059 --> 21:35.828 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
go to mosque.

21:35.861 --> 21:39.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They forced me to follow the
women who didn't
wear the right clothes and bring
them in from

21:39.198 --> 21:40.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the street.

21:40.866 --> 21:44.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, they brought captive
soldiers,
and they told us, if you want to
kill any

21:44.136 --> 21:46.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of these prisoners, you are
allowed to kill
them.

21:46.338 --> 21:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: His mother says
ISIS began a
form of brainwashing.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RANIA, Mother (through
translator): He thought
he became a man.

21:52.945 --> 21:57.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they told him, this will make
you a real man
and you will enter paradise.

21:57.449 --> 22:01.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Leave everything behind you and
follow us,
and we will take care of
everything.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will take care of your
family.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Do you think he
felt proud?

22:04.823 --> 22:06.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RANIA (through translator): Yes.

22:06.859 --> 22:09.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At the beginning, yes, he was
very happy.

22:09.361 --> 22:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He felt like a man and he was
learning about
weapons, but he didn't know the
consequences

22:14.633 --> 22:16.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of these actions.

22:16.435 --> 22:21.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: They say he never
hurt anyone,
but his snitching had deadly
consequences,

22:21.340 --> 22:24.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when the punishment for even
small crimes
can be death.

22:24.176 --> 22:30.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM (through translator):
All the children,
they forced them to watch
beheadings.

22:30.115 --> 22:32.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even if they cut the head of a
father, they
made the child watch.

22:32.985 --> 22:37.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: How did you feel
when you heard
that your son was forced to
watch a public

22:37.523 --> 22:39.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
execution?

22:39.325 --> 22:42.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANIA (through translator): I
wanted to have
a plane to take my family and
fly away.

22:42.828 --> 22:44.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can't handle this.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A person can't live like this.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They brainwashed my child.

22:48.801 --> 22:51.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They told him the way to
paradise was through
them.

22:51.737 --> 22:57.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He tried to get out of it by
telling them,
I am the eldest son, the family
breadwinner.

22:57.109 --> 23:00.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They told him, come join us and
we will take
care of your family.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But they're lying.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't give anyone anything.

23:03.148 --> 23:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But he gravitated to them.

23:05.084 --> 23:10.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Rania says ISIS
fighters came
to the door every morning and
her son would

23:10.122 --> 23:13.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disappear for eight or nine
hours per day.

23:13.158 --> 23:15.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RANIA (through translator): He
was attracted
to them.

23:15.928 --> 23:19.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He started to think like them,
to think their
way.

23:19.231 --> 23:22.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If he stayed home, they would
come and take
him, and I couldn't say no.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I couldn't control him.

23:24.370 --> 23:25.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I couldn't confront him.

23:25.838 --> 23:29.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Did you feel like
you were losing
your boy?

23:29.575 --> 23:30.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RANIA (through translator): Yes.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: What was your
worst fear?

23:33.646 --> 23:40.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANIA (through translator): I
was afraid they
would take him like they took
many children,

23:40.452 --> 23:43.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young people, and he would not
come back.

23:43.188 --> 23:47.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many friends and relatives of
mine, their
children were taken to fight in
battles, and

23:47.426 --> 23:49.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they didn't come back.

23:49.228 --> 23:53.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Rania finally
decided to flee
with her family, ending up here
in a border

23:53.966 --> 23:56.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
town in Southern Turkey.

23:56.068 --> 24:00.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she couldn't keep her son
from contacting
ISIS back home.

24:00.272 --> 24:04.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After two months, Ibrahim
announced he was
returning to Syria to be a
fighter.

24:04.543 --> 24:05.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IBRAHIM (through translator): I
threatened
them.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I told them, I will do this.

24:07.913 --> 24:11.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You will wake up in the morning,
and you will
not find me in the house.

24:11.583 --> 24:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For me, it was impossible to
leave them.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was my way to force them to
come with me.

24:16.121 --> 24:20.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Going and fighting
with ISIS
was more important to you than
your family?

24:20.726 --> 24:25.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM (through translator):
Yes, it was
stronger, and I was controlled
by them completely.

24:25.931 --> 24:31.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Rania says she had
to make the
most difficult decision of her
life to return

24:31.403 --> 24:32.371 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Syria.

24:32.404 --> 24:35.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RANIA (through translator): I
had to do it.

24:36.008 --> 24:42.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only choice I had was to
keep him under
my eyes.

24:42.081 --> 24:47.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before we left the first time,
he was telling
me all the time, "I will be a
suicide bomber,"

24:47.286 --> 24:50.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he was so happy, but he
didn't know what
it meant.

24:50.756 --> 24:52.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is what scared me.

24:52.524 --> 24:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Once they got
back, Ibrahim
did put his name on a list to be
a suicide

24:56.695 --> 25:00.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bomber, with other children as
young as 12
years old.

25:00.366 --> 25:03.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, eventually, he became
disillusioned.

25:03.202 --> 25:08.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM (through translator): We
really wanted
to become suicide bombers, and
we put our

25:08.273 --> 25:10.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
names on the list.

25:10.042 --> 25:13.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then we saw what happened to
the people
that came before us.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one took care of their
families.

25:15.114 --> 25:16.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we took our names off the
list.

25:16.915 --> 25:21.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: No longer trusted,
Ibrahim was
imprisoned for several days, and
what he saw

25:21.820 --> 25:23.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sealed his disillusionment.

25:23.655 --> 25:28.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM (through translator): I
saw people
tortured, hanged from their
hands for 40 days.

25:28.794 --> 25:31.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One was crucified upside down,
hanged from
his legs.

25:31.864 --> 25:36.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I have seen in prison, I
have seen how
they tortured people in a cruel
way, no limits

25:36.435 --> 25:40.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the torture, the sight of
young children
playing with the severed heads.

25:40.506 --> 25:43.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These sights will make this
generation a cruel
generation.

25:43.575 --> 25:48.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Finally, Rania was
able to convince
him to leave again, and they
endured another

25:48.714 --> 25:52.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dangerous and arduous journey
back to Turkey.

25:52.151 --> 25:56.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just as we were sitting down
with Ibrahim
and his mother, we found cell
phone video

25:56.121 --> 25:59.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of this boy, only 12 years old.

25:59.124 --> 26:04.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says ISIS trained him for 15
days and then
took him and eight other boys to
the front

26:04.329 --> 26:05.898 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
line in Mar'a.

26:05.931 --> 26:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a battle with the Free Syrian
Army, he
is the only one of the boys who
lived.

26:10.369 --> 26:14.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now he is a prisoner of war, but
still bargains
like a child.

26:14.473 --> 26:17.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BOY (through translator): Just
let me out.

26:17.443 --> 26:18.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I won't go back to ISIS.

26:18.844 --> 26:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just want to go back to my
family.

26:22.147 --> 26:25.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I won't tell my dad anything bad
about the
Free Syrian Army.

26:25.317 --> 26:30.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: It's a fate
Ibrahim narrowly
avoided, and with no
psychological help for

26:30.622 --> 26:33.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
her son, Rania still worries.

26:33.659 --> 26:40.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RANIA (through translator):
Every night, I
cry myself to sleep.

26:40.632 --> 26:44.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I took the cell phone away from
him.

26:44.236 --> 26:47.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now he uses only my phone, and I
see everything
that he does.

26:47.706 --> 26:51.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Here in Southern
Turkey, we
weren't able to find any
substantive programs

26:51.944 --> 26:56.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to deal with children like
Ibrahim coming
out of radicalized areas.

26:56.148 --> 27:01.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we did find small places
like this center,
where the imam says he's trying
to teach kids

27:01.820 --> 27:05.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what he calls the real Islam.

27:05.090 --> 27:07.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What kind of trauma are you
seeing, and how
do you help them?

27:07.693 --> 27:11.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHEIKH ZAHARIYA AL MASAOUD, Imam
(through
translator): By taking care of
them, being

27:11.563 --> 27:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nice to them, loving them,
trying to integrate
them into their community,
giving them what

27:15.801 --> 27:19.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were missing in Syria, they
will come
back to normal step by step.

27:19.204 --> 27:23.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The imam and his
staff may be
doing the best they can, but
some of these

27:23.809 --> 27:26.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kids are severely traumatized.

27:26.712 --> 27:30.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We spoke with this 13-year-old
girl about
the horrors she witnessed.

27:30.415 --> 27:35.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): If
someone can't
fast during Ramadan, they would
lock them

27:35.220 --> 27:37.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up for the whole Ramadan.

27:37.089 --> 27:41.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, when they let them out,
they pour honey
on them and leave them outside
for the wasps.

27:41.326 --> 27:46.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: We didn't see any
older children
Ibrahim's age, even though we
had been told

27:46.331 --> 27:48.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children were coming here to be
rehabilitated.

27:48.667 --> 27:53.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHEIKH ZAHARIYA AL MASAOUD
(through translator):
The ones we are teaching now are
very young.

27:53.705 --> 27:57.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They didn't get to the age where
the terrorist
organizations would be
interested in them.

27:57.509 --> 28:01.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those who are old enough to be
members of
terrorist organizations are
mostly dead, because

28:01.647 --> 28:06.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the terrorist organizations kill
them or send
them to the front line to die.

28:06.385 --> 28:12.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Too old to be
considered a kid
still worth saving, yet having
escaped the

28:13.025 --> 28:17.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fate of most boys his age,
Ibrahim is in a
vacuum.

28:17.062 --> 28:19.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he says he will never go
back to ISIS.

28:19.798 --> 28:24.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IBRAHIM (through translator):
It's impossible
that I would go back to them.

28:24.469 --> 28:26.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am against them now.

28:26.104 --> 28:28.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would join anyone who is
fighting against
them.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: You're just a kid,
though.

28:30.442 --> 28:34.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you want to just be a kid, be
in school,
play football?

28:34.713 --> 28:39.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM (through translator):
Yes, of course,
but after all we have seen,
after all the

28:39.818 --> 28:44.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
torture I saw in prison, all the
kids they
killed, we don't have any other
options.

28:44.623 --> 28:49.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: He may have
escaped, but the
effects of the cruelty remain.

28:49.962 --> 28:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he and his mother walk off
into a future
where they are completely on
their own.

28:55.067 --> 29:03.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Marcia Biggs in
Sanliurfa, Southern Turkey.

29:03.508 --> 29:16.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now, the
latest installment
in our Candidates in Context
series, where

29:16.622 --> 29:20.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we go behind the headlines to
explain what's
happening and why.

29:20.826 --> 29:25.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Tonight, the latest
back-and-forth over Hillary
Clinton's private e-mail server.

29:25.731 --> 29:27.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has that.

29:27.332 --> 29:32.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Two years in on
Hillary Clinton's
e-mails, what was new today?

29:32.437 --> 29:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An important change in her words
about truth,
and specifically on this
statement she made

29:37.309 --> 29:40.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sunday about FBI Director James
Comey, and
her e-mail.

29:40.512 --> 29:43.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Director Comey said that my
answers were truthful,

29:43.382 --> 29:47.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that what I have said is
consistent with
what I have told the American
people.

29:47.052 --> 29:49.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: OK, now her
words today.

29:49.087 --> 29:54.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Director
Comey had
said that my answers in my FBI
interview were

29:54.526 --> 29:55.494 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
truthful.

29:55.527 --> 29:57.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's really the bottom line
here.

29:57.162 --> 29:59.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The difference,
these words:

29:59.064 --> 30:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: In my
FBI interview.

30:00.899 --> 30:04.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Before, Clinton
had implied
that Comey had backed up all of
her statements,

30:04.903 --> 30:08.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not just what she said behind
closed doors
to the FBI.

30:08.206 --> 30:10.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She seemed to admit a mistake.

30:10.042 --> 30:15.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I may
have short-circuited
it, and, for that, I will try to
clarify.

30:15.247 --> 30:19.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In fact, last
month, Comey
testified that some things
Clinton said before

30:19.351 --> 30:21.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congress and in public were
false.

30:21.219 --> 30:23.055 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

30:23.088 --> 30:24.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREY GOWDY (R), South Carolina:
Secretary
Clinton said there was nothing
marked classified

30:24.389 --> 30:26.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on her e-mails either sent or
received.

30:26.558 --> 30:27.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Was that true?

30:27.559 --> 30:29.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES COMEY, FBI Director:
That's not true.

30:29.261 --> 30:32.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were a small number of
portion markings
on, I think, three of the
documents.

30:32.564 --> 30:36.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In other words,
Clinton's
statements that nothing on her
server was

30:36.401 --> 30:41.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marked classified were wrong,
which brings
us to another thing about
today's comments,

30:41.440 --> 30:44.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what we know about the e-mails.

30:44.142 --> 30:48.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton estimated 60,000 to
70,000 e-mails
went through her private server
when she was

30:48.613 --> 30:50.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
secretary of state.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
About half were deleted.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She says they were personal.

30:53.518 --> 31:00.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Looking at the rest, some
30,000, the FBI
found 110 that contained
information classified

31:00.559 --> 31:02.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the time.

31:02.260 --> 31:04.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is different than Clinton's
original
assertion.

31:04.663 --> 31:11.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: There is
no classified
material, so I'm certainly well
aware of the

31:11.470 --> 31:12.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
classification requirements.

31:12.804 --> 31:16.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Later, she
added the phrase
marked classified.

31:16.108 --> 31:20.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I never
sent or received
any material marked classified.

31:20.112 --> 31:22.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: So, back to
those e-mails.

31:22.414 --> 31:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of those 110 that had classified
information,
the FBI says three did contain
classified

31:28.720 --> 31:30.522 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
markings.

31:30.555 --> 31:33.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Clinton points out today
that those marks,
the letter C, were lower in the
documents.

31:33.892 --> 31:41.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: In
questioning, Director
Comey made the point that the
three e-mails

31:41.333 --> 31:46.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of the 30,000 didn't have
the appropriate
markings.

31:46.471 --> 31:54.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was therefore reasonable
to conclude
that anyone, including myself,
would have

31:54.913 --> 31:57.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not suspected that they were
classified.

31:57.883 --> 31:59.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Did Comey say
that?

31:59.684 --> 32:04.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: I think it's
possible, possible
that she didn't understand what
a C meant

32:04.823 --> 32:06.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when she saw it in the body of
the e-mail
like that.

32:06.958 --> 32:09.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That leaves two
questions.

32:09.060 --> 32:13.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Was Hillary Clinton truthful
when she said
none of her e-mails were marked
classified?

32:13.932 --> 32:15.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

32:15.066 --> 32:18.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Three out of 30,000 were marked
classified.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And did she intentionally lie to
Congress
about that?

32:21.907 --> 32:24.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, that is a matter for
debate.

32:24.042 --> 32:26.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Comey has not given an opinion.

32:26.278 --> 32:31.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Republicans in the House
have asked him
and the FBI to investigate.

32:31.082 --> 32:33.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

32:33.618 --> 32:37.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings
us to the analysis
of Brooks and Marcus.

32:37.055 --> 32:41.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's New York Times columnist
David Brooks
and Washington Post columnist
Ruth Marcus.

32:41.693 --> 32:43.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mark Shields is away.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hello to both of you.

32:45.297 --> 32:48.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're going to get to
Hillary Clinton
and the e-mails in just a
moment.

32:48.133 --> 32:53.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David, let me start with Donald
Trump and
the rough week that he's had.

32:53.071 --> 32:54.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you size it up?

32:54.906 --> 32:58.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know even know where to
begin, whether
it's with the Khan family or
something else.

32:58.276 --> 33:00.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you see when you look
back at this
week for Donald Trump?

33:00.979 --> 33:04.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Let's stick with
the top 150
gaffes, and that will limit our
time.

33:04.916 --> 33:06.818 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:06.852 --> 33:09.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think the
significant thing
is the shift not so much in
Trump's personality

33:09.454 --> 33:13.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- he's been doing this kind of
stuff a lot
-- it's concentrated maybe this
week -- but

33:13.658 --> 33:15.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the shift in the polls.

33:15.427 --> 33:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, finally, if you have 47
bad weeks
in a row, on week 47, people
begin to notice.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this is the first time --
we have been
saying, he goes too far, this
will really

33:26.037 --> 33:27.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hurt him, and nothing has hurt
him.

33:27.873 --> 33:32.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But now he's really been
hurting, and nationally,
not only in a post-convention
bump for the

33:32.277 --> 33:35.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats, but I think some
evidence of sustained
support.

33:35.580 --> 33:38.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
National, Clinton is up by 6, 7
points, if
you average all the polls
together.

33:39.017 --> 33:42.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the significant
thing is, if you
begin to look at the state
polls, and what's

33:42.821 --> 33:45.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's support in these crucial
states that
he has to win, the Wisconsins,
the Michigans,

33:45.457 --> 33:49.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Pennsylvanias, the
Colorados?

33:49.060 --> 33:53.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's at like 36, 38 percent
in a lot of
these states, New Hampshire,
too.

33:53.798 --> 33:59.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if he's that low, and you're
trying to
imagine him rising 13 points by
Election Day,

33:59.371 --> 34:02.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's super hard to imagine in
all these
different states, unless
something really

34:02.307 --> 34:04.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
big happens.

34:04.175 --> 34:07.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this is the week, I think,
that the polls
really shifted, and the whole
nature of the

34:07.946 --> 34:09.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
race shifted as a result.

34:09.714 --> 34:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: and Ruth, we know
it's early,
but these polls numbers don't
look good.

34:14.319 --> 34:16.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What led to this for Donald
Trump?

34:16.187 --> 34:18.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Donald Trump led to
this for
Donald Trump.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.492 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:20.525 --> 34:23.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: He took a bad week
last week,
when Hillary Clinton had an
excellent convention,

34:23.395 --> 34:30.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he -- it seems like ages ago
now -- made
that good convention even more
problematic

34:30.502 --> 34:35.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for him by talking about the
Russian hacking
into -- encouraging Russian
hacking into her

34:35.240 --> 34:36.641 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
e-mails.

34:36.675 --> 34:40.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then he had a week -- and like
David, you
don't know where to start.

34:40.712 --> 34:45.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have never seen a week in
politics where
a candidate, in the course of a
single week,

34:46.017 --> 34:50.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inflicted more damage on himself
than normal
politicians do in the course of
not just a

34:50.956 --> 34:54.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regular campaign, but in the
course of an
entire career.

34:54.859 --> 34:55.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He picked fights with everybody.

34:56.027 --> 34:57.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He picked fights with a baby.

34:57.729 --> 35:00.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He picked fights with the
speaker of the House.

35:00.565 --> 35:04.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He found himself splitting from
his own vice
president.

35:04.669 --> 35:12.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he just doesn't -- we have
talked for
a while about Donald Trump and
the pivot,

35:12.644 --> 35:15.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the whole Republican Party
has been waiting
for pivot.

35:15.447 --> 35:20.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm stealing a line from my
colleague
Alexandra Petri here, but
waiting for pivot

35:20.685 --> 35:23.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Donald Trump is like
waiting for Godot.

35:23.154 --> 35:24.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not going to come.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And David is exactly right.

35:26.257 --> 35:30.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the week when the polls
started to
catch up with the reality.

35:30.395 --> 35:34.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what's happening
here is we're
not in the primary campaign
anymore.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're really in the general
election season.

35:37.235 --> 35:42.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these missteps, to be kind
about them,
really do start to have a
cumulative impact.

35:42.540 --> 35:48.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David Brooks,
are these
the kind of missteps that can't
be undone?

35:48.546 --> 35:50.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that what you're saying?

35:50.415 --> 35:55.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I do think
they're not
missteps in a way, because
they're not errors.

35:55.453 --> 35:57.288 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're him.

35:57.322 --> 36:01.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think we have seen -- we
have seen this
all along from him, two things,
one, incapacity

36:01.526 --> 36:03.395 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for empathy.

36:03.428 --> 36:07.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a normal person looks at
Mrs. Khan and
sees a woman in deep pain and
has an instinctual

36:07.232 --> 36:11.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
response of respect and
admiration for what
she has endured and sympathy.

36:11.970 --> 36:14.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you respond in a certain
way.

36:14.072 --> 36:17.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's shown an incapacity for
that for
a long time.

36:17.509 --> 36:22.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the second thing is
just an incapacity
to control his own attention and
to say things

36:22.747 --> 36:26.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are just inappropriate for
a politician
or inappropriate for a human
being.

36:26.918 --> 36:30.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you get these trains of
thought that
go on where a word sparks off a
thought, that

36:31.022 --> 36:34.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sparks off a thought, that
sparks off a thought.

36:34.059 --> 36:38.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it gives the impression of
someone really
not in control of their own
attention span.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.031 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And so these are
characterological.

36:40.065 --> 36:42.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that is what sent
the shivers
through the Republican Party.

36:43.001 --> 36:46.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's become the subject of
the debate
this week, not did he make a
mistake, but

36:46.604 --> 36:48.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is this in a sense who he is?

36:49.007 --> 36:53.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Ruth, a lot
of people may
be coming to that conclusion,
but there are

36:53.912 --> 36:56.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still others who are sticking
with Donald
Trump.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: Sure.

36:58.316 --> 37:03.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like he told us, he could --
Donald Trump
supporters are Donald Trump
supporters, and

37:03.088 --> 37:04.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have stuck with him through
a lot of
things.

37:05.023 --> 37:09.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As he told us, he could shoot
somebody in
the middle of Fifth Avenue, and
it wouldn't

37:09.594 --> 37:11.463 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dissuade them.

37:11.496 --> 37:16.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But those -- you can win the
Republican nomination
with 10 million voters, 13
million voters.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You cannot win the general
election.

37:18.103 --> 37:21.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You need 65 million voters for
the general
election.

37:21.806 --> 37:23.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's his problem.

37:23.675 --> 37:29.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you take an electorate
where he's alienated
big chunks of it, right,
African-Americans

37:29.114 --> 37:34.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not for Trump, a huge swathe of
the Hispanic
community not for Trump, women,
who make up

37:34.953 --> 37:38.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than half of the electorate
-- this week,
we don't even talk about it,
because it was

37:38.823 --> 37:40.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so minor.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He made these dismissive
comments about sexual
harassment.

37:42.927 --> 37:46.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If his daughter was sexually
harassed, well,
she should just find another
career or another

37:46.397 --> 37:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
job, that's the way to deal with
it.

37:48.266 --> 37:52.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you start alienating all
these people,
you are left with a shrinking
pool of voters

37:52.537 --> 37:54.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to win an election with.

37:54.339 --> 37:57.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want to say one thing
about winning
the election, because among the
many things

37:57.675 --> 38:01.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that -- I know why the
Republican Party has
shivers up its spine.

38:01.546 --> 38:05.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What put shivers up my spine
with Donald Trump
this week was his suggestion
that, if he does

38:05.817 --> 38:11.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lose, that the election will be
rigged, because
I don't think there is evidence
of that.

38:11.823 --> 38:16.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is not the American way
of losing
elections.

38:16.060 --> 38:20.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Al Gore lost the election
and the Supreme
Court ruled against him in 2000,
he issued

38:20.632 --> 38:24.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a gracious statement about how
it was the
time for healing.

38:24.903 --> 38:29.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump in 2012 was
tweeting about the
need for revolution when Mitt
Romney lost.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

38:31.342 --> 38:33.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: And so I'm very
nervous about
what could happen, not just if
Donald Trump

38:33.978 --> 38:35.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wins, but if he loses.

38:35.914 --> 38:40.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David
Brooks, there presumably
are some Americans who think an
election like

38:40.218 --> 38:41.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this could be rigged.

38:41.352 --> 38:44.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do we think that's why Donald
Trump raised
that?

38:44.389 --> 38:49.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, his campaign
-- I still
think he's the wrong answer to a
right problem,

38:49.727 --> 38:53.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the people who support him,
some of them
are -- have some racist
tendencies, and some

38:53.731 --> 38:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sexist and some very ugliness.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But a lot of people support him
for good reasons.

38:57.535 --> 39:01.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we shouldn't totally dismiss
the support
there.

39:01.105 --> 39:04.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he did raise $82 million
over the recent
period.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So there is some real fervent
support there.

39:06.611 --> 39:11.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're people who have lost
faith in
the system, and they have lost
faith in America,

39:11.382 --> 39:14.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they have lost faith in the
idea that,
if I do A, I will get B, that
the normal chain

39:14.953 --> 39:17.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of responsibility is working for
them.

39:17.488 --> 39:19.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so they -- Ruth is right.

39:19.257 --> 39:24.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They could take a look at an
election defeat
and decide that the whole system
is rigged

39:24.062 --> 39:28.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and their level of cynicism
could go up another
notch, if they're -- if that is
inflamed.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the danger that was
Ruth was pointing
to.

39:30.902 --> 39:33.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think there's a problem
here this week
-- because he's not going away,
because he

39:33.838 --> 39:36.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has this base of support -- for
other Republicans.

39:36.441 --> 39:37.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

39:37.942 --> 39:40.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: If he would just
go away, then
they would have an option.

39:40.178 --> 39:44.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think they can no
longer sustain
the position they have had,
which is, I really

39:44.782 --> 39:48.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have contempt for this Trump
action, that
Trump statement, and that Trump
statement,

39:48.753 --> 39:50.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but I still support the guy.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that's becoming much
more untenable
for them.

39:52.790 --> 39:54.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they have to think of a plan
B.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's the
question I really
did want to ask both of you.

39:56.761 --> 39:58.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ruth, what about that?

39:58.663 --> 40:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, how long can a number of
these Republicans
who are saying disagree with him
on a number

40:02.600 --> 40:06.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of things, but I'm still going
to support
him because I don't like Hillary
Clinton?

40:06.771 --> 40:10.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Well, the ones who
are up for
reelection are in just a very
exquisitely

40:10.908 --> 40:16.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
difficult situation, because
there is a group
of core Republican Party voters
who will punish

40:16.447 --> 40:23.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them if they divorce themselves
from Trump,
but there is a group of voters
in the middle

40:23.488 --> 40:26.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who will punish them if they
don't divorce
themselves from Trump.

40:26.324 --> 40:30.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I'm thinking about somebody
like Senator
Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire,
who -- Trump

40:30.962 --> 40:32.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is down 15 points in her state.

40:32.830 --> 40:38.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was down 10 points in a very
close, difficult
race against the governor there,
Maggie Hassan,

40:38.903 --> 40:40.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for reelection.

40:40.805 --> 40:43.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's a Kelly Ayotte to do?

40:43.041 --> 40:47.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you have those sort of
leaders of
the congressional wing, who I
think eventually

40:47.745 --> 40:51.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will come up with -- and you
started to see
it this week -- come up with a
plan B, much

40:51.783 --> 40:58.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like with Bob Dole in 1996,
which is to say,
OK, you don't like Trump voters,
but keep

40:58.656 --> 41:02.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us Republicans in charge to keep
a check on
that dangerous President Clinton
who is coming

41:02.760 --> 41:03.728 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in there.

41:03.761 --> 41:04.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the Senate and
the House.

41:04.762 --> 41:06.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: In the Senate and
the House.

41:06.264 --> 41:07.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, I want to
-- I do want
to turn to Hillary Clinton.

41:08.032 --> 41:13.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard Lisa Desjardins's
report sort of
dissecting what Hillary Clinton
said today,

41:13.571 --> 41:15.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what she said in the past about
these e-mails.

41:15.973 --> 41:21.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Otherwise, Hillary Clinton has
been a pretty
quiet figure over the last week
or so.

41:21.212 --> 41:24.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's been the beneficiary of
Trump's problems.

41:24.615 --> 41:30.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But how much does this lingering
set of questions
around the e-mails stand to hurt
her?

41:30.188 --> 41:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, her best
move, given what
Trump has been doing in the last
week or two,

41:34.359 --> 41:35.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is just to be boring.

41:35.927 --> 41:38.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she has a capacity to do
that.

41:38.763 --> 41:40.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So she's been laying low.

41:40.431 --> 41:45.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think that we're now
parsing how many
e-mails, where the C was on the
e-mail.

41:45.303 --> 41:49.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Lisa laid it out, for
anybody who wants
to just -- what exactly
happened.

41:49.273 --> 41:53.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think the damage done
to her, which
is lingering, is just in the
idea of having

41:53.211 --> 41:57.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a separate server, that the
basic fact of
the situation was that she was
playing outside

41:57.982 --> 41:59.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the rules.

41:59.784 --> 42:04.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has this strong distrust of
the system
at large, and, therefore, she's
building walls

42:04.288 --> 42:07.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
around herself and her e-mails
and her communication.

42:07.625 --> 42:12.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the secretiveness and
incommunicativeness
that has surrounded her the last
couple of

42:12.196 --> 42:17.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decades is really the core of
this scandal,
not exactly how many servers she
had or what

42:17.268 --> 42:18.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she said at this press
conference.

42:18.936 --> 42:20.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that does certainly link...

42:20.505 --> 42:22.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ruth, how do you
see this?

42:22.774 --> 42:26.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: I'm going to be
harder here on
Hillary Clinton than David was,
because there

42:26.611 --> 42:33.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the original sin of not
having a regular
State Department e-mail and the
separate server.

42:33.384 --> 42:42.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then there is the second
sin, or I would
call it just political
malpractice of her

42:42.226 --> 42:49.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inability/refusal to come up
with an honest,
credible, consistent,
non=-parsing explanation

42:50.001 --> 42:51.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for what was going on here.

42:51.803 --> 42:56.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, she took a bad situation,
and she has
consistently and almost every
time she has

42:56.941 --> 43:01.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
addressed this situation, made
it worse, instead
of making it better.

43:01.045 --> 43:07.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it just goes to what has
always been her
biggest weakness, which is that
honesty and

43:07.118 --> 43:08.386 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
trustworthiness.

43:08.419 --> 43:11.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They started out with a problem,
and they
kept digging that hole.

43:11.389 --> 43:16.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David, what
kind of damage
are we talking about for her?

43:16.694 --> 43:20.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Have we already seen the maximum
damage this
issue could do to her?

43:20.198 --> 43:21.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Could it grow?

43:21.199 --> 43:22.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I don't think it
will grow.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think we're in the
petering-down phase of
it.

43:25.169 --> 43:27.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she's distrusted, and she is
distrusted
largely.

43:27.738 --> 43:30.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her favorable/unfavorable is
actually getting
a little better.

43:30.541 --> 43:35.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it's -- people have
factored in
that she can lie, that she's
very secretive,

43:35.613 --> 43:39.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that she's insular, that she is
not the most
super likable person in the
political landscape.

43:39.183 --> 43:42.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, right now, it's certainly
not -- and
it's keeping her numbers pretty
low, by the

43:43.020 --> 43:44.455 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

43:44.489 --> 43:46.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I talked about how low Trump's
numbers are
in a lot of these states.

43:46.257 --> 43:49.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hers are significantly higher,
but they're
not where a Barack Obama, a Bill
Clinton or

43:49.894 --> 43:51.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan
would be.

43:51.562 --> 43:54.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She is still a significantly
unpopular politician.

43:54.765 --> 43:58.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She just happens to be the
luckiest politician
in America, running against a
guy who is super

43:58.402 --> 43:59.370 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unpopular.

43:59.403 --> 44:00.371 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:00.404 --> 44:01.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thirty seconds,
Ruth.

44:01.839 --> 44:06.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Super unpopular and
super incapable
of containing himself.

44:06.611 --> 44:09.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if somebody had locked
Donald Trump in
a room and taken away his cell
phone this

44:09.981 --> 44:13.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week, what would we have been
talking about
all week?

44:13.417 --> 44:14.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
E-mails and Hillary Clinton's
interviews.

44:14.719 --> 44:17.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, we were talking about
the Khans and
everything else.

44:17.688 --> 44:19.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there may be
more to talk
about next week.

44:19.824 --> 44:20.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: There most
certainly will.

44:20.825 --> 44:22.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:22.226 --> 44:26.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ruth Marcus,
David Brooks,
have a great weekend.

44:26.397 --> 44:35.339 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you both.

44:35.373 --> 44:45.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
revisiting
a strange kidnapping saga that
captured the

44:45.383 --> 44:48.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nation's attention back in the
'70s.

44:48.586 --> 44:51.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the latest
edition of our
"NewsHour" Bookshelf.

44:51.923 --> 44:58.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: On February 4,
1974, 19-year-old
Patty Hearst, granddaughter of
publishing

44:58.796 --> 45:04.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
titan William Randolph Hearst,
was kidnapped
from her home in Berkeley,
California, by

45:04.035 --> 45:08.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members of a radical group that
called itself
the Symbionese Liberation Army.

45:08.806 --> 45:13.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was an event that riveted the
nation, even
more so when, not long after her
abduction,

45:13.844 --> 45:17.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it began to look as though
Hearst might have
joined the group.

45:17.882 --> 45:20.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In April, she took part in a
bank robbery.

45:20.952 --> 45:26.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hearst was captured in September
1975, more
than a year after six members of
the SLA were

45:26.757 --> 45:29.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killed in a gun battle with
police in Los
Angeles.

45:29.927 --> 45:34.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She served almost two years in
prison before
her sentence was commuted by
President Jimmy

45:34.532 --> 45:35.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Carter.

45:35.700 --> 45:38.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She later received a full pardon
from President
Clinton.

45:38.703 --> 45:45.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The incredible story is told
anew in "American
Heiress: The Wild Saga of the
Kidnapping,

45:45.176 --> 45:47.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Crimes and Trial of Patty
Hearst."

45:47.678 --> 45:51.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And author Jeffrey Toobin, staff
writer at
"The New Yorker" and legal
analyst for CNN,

45:51.916 --> 45:52.850 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
joins me now.

45:52.883 --> 45:54.585 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

45:54.619 --> 45:55.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY TOOBIN, Author,
"American Heiress:
The Wild Saga of the Kidnapping,
Crimes and

45:55.486 --> 45:56.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trial of Patty Hearst": Good to
be here.

45:56.487 --> 45:58.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I want to begin
where you do.

45:58.356 --> 46:01.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the strangeness of this
period, the early
1970s, the violence that was
almost routine

46:01.792 --> 46:05.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a country at that time that
is difficult
to even remember or imagine.

46:05.363 --> 46:11.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY TOOBIN: Think about one
fact, one
fact alone, 1,000 political
bombings a year

46:11.268 --> 46:14.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in '72, '73, '74.

46:14.271 --> 46:15.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Almost inconceivable.

46:15.640 --> 46:17.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was what the world was
like.

46:17.341 --> 46:19.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Skyjackings were epidemic.

46:19.110 --> 46:20.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:20.978 --> 46:25.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY TOOBIN: You had an
actual revolutionary
movement in this country that,
while never

46:25.716 --> 46:31.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
likely to succeed, was
disrupting the country,
especially Northern California,
in a way that's

46:31.822 --> 46:33.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's just hard to believe.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I was just even
thinking about
the opening of the Olympics, of
course, in

46:36.894 --> 46:39.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1972 was the Munich Olympics,
right, what
happened there.

46:39.330 --> 46:40.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY TOOBIN: Of course.

46:40.331 --> 46:42.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That the world...

46:42.133 --> 46:46.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY TOOBIN: And Watergate
and the energy
crisis, nervous breakdown
collectively for

46:46.537 --> 46:47.505 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the country.

46:47.538 --> 46:48.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:48.539 --> 46:49.507 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

46:49.540 --> 46:51.342 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All right.

46:51.375 --> 46:52.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you start thinking
about Patty Hearst
-- and you say it -- the central
question,

46:52.410 --> 46:55.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right, which side was she on, in
a sense?

46:55.646 --> 47:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Before all this happened, there
was no hint
of politics in her?

47:01.085 --> 47:02.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY TOOBIN: She was a kid.

47:02.353 --> 47:04.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She was 19 years old.

47:04.155 --> 47:10.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she was utterly unknown to
her kidnappers,
except that she was a Hearst and
a student

47:10.594 --> 47:12.229 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at Cal.

47:12.263 --> 47:16.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what they didn't know is
that she was
at a very restless moment in her
life.

47:16.767 --> 47:23.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was engaged to be married to
Steven Weed,
who she was living, but unhappy,
starting

47:23.374 --> 47:25.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to develop a bit of political
consciousness.

47:25.976 --> 47:33.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after those few first days
of terror -- and
they were horrible days of
terror -- she did

47:33.551 --> 47:35.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
become receptive to their
appeals.

47:35.653 --> 47:41.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Symbionese
Liberation Army,
the kidnappers, right, in your
telling, no

47:41.092 --> 47:47.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
real plan of what they wanted to
do, no -- a
kind of vague revolutionary
ideology of the

47:47.798 --> 47:50.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
time, but they had killed.

47:50.301 --> 47:52.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were quite serious in their
intent.

47:52.436 --> 47:58.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY TOOBIN: They had killed
the Oakland
school superintendent in a mad
act, a heroic

47:58.776 --> 48:02.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
African-American educator named
Marcus Foster.

48:02.580 --> 48:08.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But several of the SLA members
came out of
the Indiana University theater
program.

48:08.486 --> 48:12.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they did have a sense of
guerrilla theater
about them.

48:12.189 --> 48:14.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They knew how to put on a show.

48:14.125 --> 48:17.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why they were so
captivating to
the nation.

48:17.561 --> 48:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They had no real plan for what
they were going
to do more than 24 hours ahead.

48:23.033 --> 48:26.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But during each act, they knew
how to get
a lot of attention.

48:26.337 --> 48:31.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so come
back to this
early period of her capture.

48:31.442 --> 48:34.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So many questions about what
happened, right?

48:34.512 --> 48:36.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY TOOBIN: Right.

48:36.080 --> 48:41.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There were
questions then and
now about sexual abuse, rape.

48:41.118 --> 48:47.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In her telling, rape happened,
that she had
a -- sexual relationship with
one of them.

48:47.324 --> 48:52.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you conclude about what
took place,
did she turn, why she turned?

48:52.963 --> 48:58.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY TOOBIN: Well, certainly,
in the immediate
aftermath of the kidnapping,
this was pure

48:58.903 --> 49:03.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorism, and she had no part
in it, she
had no foreknowledge.

49:03.174 --> 49:11.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But after a few weeks, there was
a bond that
developed between Patricia and
her kidnappers.

49:11.582 --> 49:18.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you look at the range of
her activities,
from her kidnapping in February
of '74, the

49:18.722 --> 49:23.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
robbery of the Hibernia Bank
with the very
familiar photographs of her with
the machine

49:23.694 --> 49:30.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gun, all the way to her arrest
in September
of '75, almost a year-and-a-half
later, the

49:30.501 --> 49:35.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enormous numbers of crimes she
committed,
three bank robberies, one in
which a woman

49:35.573 --> 49:42.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was killed, shooting up a street
in Los Angeles,
bombings that she participated
in, in San

49:42.947 --> 49:48.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Francisco, and the multiple,
multiple opportunities
she had to escape, I conclude
that she did,

49:48.552 --> 49:50.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in fact, voluntarily join the
SLA.

49:50.321 --> 49:51.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is not her
version, right?

49:51.589 --> 49:52.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY TOOBIN: This is not.

49:52.590 --> 49:53.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: She has written
her own book.

49:53.591 --> 49:54.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She didn't want to talk to you.

49:54.592 --> 49:56.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY TOOBIN: Right.

49:56.560 --> 50:01.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says she was coerced and
lived in fear
for every moment, and wasn't a
voluntary participant

50:01.265 --> 50:02.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in any crimes.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And I note that
you -- you
don't want to use words like
brainwashing

50:06.237 --> 50:07.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or Stockholm syndrome.

50:07.905 --> 50:09.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You don't want to go there.

50:09.273 --> 50:11.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY TOOBIN: No, because
those terms are
journalistic terms.

50:11.242 --> 50:12.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

50:12.243 --> 50:13.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY TOOBIN: They're not
medical terms.

50:13.844 --> 50:17.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't even think they're
useful in describing
what went on in her life.

50:17.181 --> 50:22.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what happened with her
is, she made
rational choices at each step in
the process.

50:22.920 --> 50:28.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It made sense to her, as it
might make sense
to other 19-year-olds, to join
in.

50:28.893 --> 50:33.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then -- and after she was
arrested, it made
sense for her to say, the hell
with all this

50:33.330 --> 50:34.298 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stuff.

50:34.331 --> 50:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to go back -- be a Hearst
again.

50:36.166 --> 50:37.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, and
just briefly,
in our last minute, the
sentence, as I said,

50:37.601 --> 50:39.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was commuted by President
Carter.

50:39.203 --> 50:41.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was pardoned by President
Clinton.

50:41.305 --> 50:45.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You see this as an extreme case
of privilege,
really, for a wealthy person.

50:45.743 --> 50:47.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what she went back to
being in
a sense, right?

50:47.745 --> 50:52.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY TOOBIN: She is the only
person in
American history to receive a
commutation

50:52.316 --> 50:54.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from one president and a pardon
from another.

50:54.952 --> 51:00.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And perhaps the most bizarre
fact about this
whole story is that she went
back to the life

51:00.925 --> 51:08.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she was always going to lead,
sort of a wealthy
socialite homemaker with a few
exotic hobbies.

51:08.132 --> 51:12.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She made a few movies, but now
she raises
dogs, show dogs.

51:12.703 --> 51:14.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's a grandmother.

51:14.438 --> 51:16.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is the life she was
going to lead.

51:17.007 --> 51:19.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The book is
"American Heiress."

51:19.209 --> 51:21.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Toobin, thank you very
much.

51:21.278 --> 51:29.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY TOOBIN: Thanks for
having me.

51:29.119 --> 51:37.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: Marilyn Monroe's death 54
years ago reminds

51:37.294 --> 51:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us that long before today's
opioid epidemic,
there were plenty of
prescription drugs that

51:42.499 --> 51:45.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could be abused with deadly
results.

51:45.536 --> 51:50.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Medical historian Howard Markel
offers up
a cautionary tale in his
retelling of the
