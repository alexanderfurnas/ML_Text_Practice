EASY PROBLEM IN IRAN AND A      
HARD PROBLEM.                   
THE EASY PROBLEM IS             

16:53.729 --> 16:54.928
HARD PROBLEM.                   
THE EASY PROBLEM IS             
VERIFYING THE DECLARED

AND SO HAVING DAILY ACCESS      

16:57.330 --> 16:59.361
FACILITIES.                     
AND SO HAVING DAILY ACCESS      
TO THOSE FACILITIES I THINK     

16:59.364 --> 17:00.761
AND SO HAVING DAILY ACCESS      
TO THOSE FACILITIES I THINK     
GIVES ONE A VERY HIGH LEVEL     

17:00.763 --> 17:01.761
TO THOSE FACILITIES I THINK     
GIVES ONE A VERY HIGH LEVEL     
OF ASSURANCE.                   

17:01.763 --> 17:03.163
GIVES ONE A VERY HIGH LEVEL     
OF ASSURANCE.                   
THE HARD PROBLEM IN IRAN IS     

17:03.164 --> 17:04.129
OF ASSURANCE.                   
THE HARD PROBLEM IN IRAN IS     
ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE          

17:04.131 --> 17:05.196
THE HARD PROBLEM IN IRAN IS     
ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE          
POSSIBILITY OF A COVERT         

17:05.198 --> 17:06.563
ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE          
POSSIBILITY OF A COVERT         
FACILITY, A FACILITY ONE        

17:06.564 --> 17:08.096
POSSIBILITY OF A COVERT         
FACILITY, A FACILITY ONE        
CAN'T SEE.                      

17:08.098 --> 17:09.629
FACILITY, A FACILITY ONE        
CAN'T SEE.                      
AND SO THE WAY THAT ONE         

17:09.631 --> 17:11.328
CAN'T SEE.                      
AND SO THE WAY THAT ONE         
NEEDS TO ADDRESS THAT IS BY     

17:11.330 --> 17:12.695
AND SO THE WAY THAT ONE         
NEEDS TO ADDRESS THAT IS BY     
HAVING A MUCH BROADER AND       

17:12.698 --> 17:14.063
NEEDS TO ADDRESS THAT IS BY     
HAVING A MUCH BROADER AND       
MORE COMPREHENSIVE ACCESS TO

IF THEY SHOW UP IN A

IF THEY SHOW UP IN A            
MOUNTAIN SOMEWHERE, IN A

NUCLEAR ISSUE AND FINDING A     
WAY TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN       

20:58.916 --> 21:00.446
NUCLEAR ISSUE AND FINDING A     
WAY TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN       
SOME KIND OF NEGOTIATING        

21:00.449 --> 21:01.314
WAY TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN       
SOME KIND OF NEGOTIATING
