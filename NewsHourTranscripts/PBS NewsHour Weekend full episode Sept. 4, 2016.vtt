WATCH BREAKING BAD."

14:49.200 --> 14:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I SAID, WELL WHAT DO YOU

15:03.600 --> 15:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

15:11.833 --> 15:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THAT MOMENT FOR ME

15:13.433 --> 15:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY ENCAPSULATES WHAT'S WRONG

15:14.733 --> 15:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

15:24.733 --> 15:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

15:26.967 --> 15:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMES TO THIS PAIN.

15:27.600 --> 15:31.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
