JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:06.039 --> 00:06.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gwen Ifill is on assignment.

00:08.809 --> 00:14.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Donald Trump and
Hillary Clinton trade barbs on
major foreign

00:14.248 --> 00:20.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy issues after a town hall
centered on
what it takes to be commander in
chief.

00:20.354 --> 00:25.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: The Republican nominee
still refuses
to release his income tax
returns.

00:25.959 --> 00:31.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take a deep dive into what
they could tell
us about Donald Trump the
candidate and the

00:31.465 --> 00:33.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
businessman.

00:33.367 --> 00:39.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And catching a wave in
California to learn
about China's rise in
manufacturing and how

00:39.473 --> 00:42.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's leaving some American
workers out to
dry.

00:42.376 --> 00:47.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVE BOEHNE, Infinity
Surfboards: Ninety-five
percent of the boards being sold
in the world

00:47.648 --> 00:50.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
weren't made by us in
California, who started
the surfboard industry.

00:50.984 --> 00:54.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

(BREAK)

(BREAK)

02:10.030 --> 02:16.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Russian leaders,
American generals,
sensitive e-mails, and more, all
of it the

02:16.803 --> 02:20.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Russian leaders,
American generals,
sensitive e-mails, and more, all
of it the

02:56.843 --> 03:01.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stuff of the presidential
campaign over the
past 24 hours.

03:01.248 --> 03:03.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has our report.

03:03.150 --> 03:09.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This morning, Hillary
Clinton didn't
even wait for her first campaign
stop of the

03:09.423 --> 03:12.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day, attacking Donald Trump
before boarding
her plane.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Last night was yet another test,
and Donald

03:15.896 --> 03:17.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump failed yet again.

03:17.998 --> 03:24.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw more evidence that he is
temperamentally
unfit and totally unqualified to
be commander

03:24.638 --> 03:26.440 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in chief.

03:26.473 --> 03:29.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It was in response to
the candidates'
back-to-back appearances last
night on an

03:29.643 --> 03:32.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NBC News military forum.

03:32.646 --> 03:36.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump was asked about Russian
President Vladimir
Putin's praise for him.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
If he says great things about
me, I'm going

03:38.552 --> 03:39.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to say great things about him.

03:39.753 --> 03:42.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have already said, he is
really very much
of a leader.

03:42.255 --> 03:44.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you can say, oh, isn't
that a terrible
thing?

03:44.724 --> 03:47.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He called -- the man has very
strong control
over a country.

03:47.794 --> 03:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, it's a very different
system, and I don't
happen to like the system.

03:50.764 --> 03:54.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, certainly, in that system,
he's been
a leader, far more than our
president has

03:54.568 --> 03:55.802 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been a leader.

03:55.836 --> 03:58.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, that brought
Clinton's strongest
rebuke.

03:58.338 --> 04:06.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: That's
not just unpatriotic
and insulting for the people of
our country,

04:06.246 --> 04:08.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as well as to our commander in
chief.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It is scary.

04:10.684 --> 04:15.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Last night, a former
Naval officer
challenged Clinton about her
handling of classified

04:15.555 --> 04:17.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
material.

04:17.357 --> 04:20.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: How can you expect those
such as myself
who were and are entrusted with
America's

04:20.627 --> 04:26.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most sensitive information to
have any confidence
in your leadership as president
when you clearly

04:26.133 --> 04:27.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
corrupted our national security?

04:27.767 --> 04:33.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: You know
and I know
classified material is
designated.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It is marked.

04:35.075 --> 04:41.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a header, so that there
is no dispute
at all that what is being
communicated to

04:41.214 --> 04:47.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or from someone who has that
access is marked
classified.

04:47.687 --> 04:55.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I communicated about classified
material on
a wholly separate system.

04:55.061 --> 04:56.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I took it very seriously.

04:56.863 --> 05:02.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Another big topic at
the forum
was the fight against ISIS in
Iraq and Syria.

05:02.569 --> 05:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton insisted she would never
put ground
troops into Iraq again.

05:06.807 --> 05:10.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Trump was asked about his
claim that he
knows more about ISIS than the
generals.

05:10.677 --> 05:14.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
The generals under Barack Obama
and Hillary

05:14.814 --> 05:16.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Clinton have not been
successful.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT LAUER, NBC News: Do you
know more about
ISIS than they do?

05:18.051 --> 05:22.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I think under the
leadership
of Barack Obama and Hillary
Clinton, the generals

05:22.889 --> 05:24.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have been reduced to rubble.

05:24.858 --> 05:28.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been reduced to a
point where it's
embarrassing for our country.

05:28.495 --> 05:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Half-a-world away,
President Obama
responded as he closed out his
trip to Asia.

05:33.300 --> 05:37.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I don't think the guy is
qualified to be president

05:37.070 --> 05:38.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

05:38.505 --> 05:45.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And every time he speaks, that
opinion is
confirmed.

05:45.111 --> 05:55.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the most important
thing for the
public and the press is to just
listen to

05:55.589 --> 06:01.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what he says and follow up and
ask questions
about what appear to be either
contradictory

06:01.728 --> 06:05.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or uninformed or outright wacky
ideas.

06:05.699 --> 06:11.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Foreign policy also
figured prominently
today for libertarian candidate
Gary Johnson,

06:11.104 --> 06:13.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
though he may have wished it
hadn't.

06:13.707 --> 06:19.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On MSNBC's "Morning Joe," he was
asked about
a much-discussed war-torn Syrian
city.

06:19.646 --> 06:22.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE BARNICLE, MSNBC: What would
you do if
you were elected about Aleppo?

06:22.782 --> 06:25.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON, Libertarian
Presidential Candidate:
About Aleppo.

06:26.019 --> 06:26.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what is Aleppo?

06:27.020 --> 06:29.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIKE BARNICLE: You're kidding.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GARY JOHNSON: No.

06:31.291 --> 06:34.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE BARNICLE: Aleppo is in
Syria.

06:34.961 --> 06:37.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the epicenter of the
refugee crisis.

06:37.664 --> 06:38.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GARY JOHNSON: OK.

06:38.665 --> 06:39.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Got it.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.368 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Got it.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: The long-shot
candidate later said
there was no excuse for the
confusion.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

06:46.740 --> 06:51.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will return to
the issue
of relations with Russia, and
how Donald Trump

06:51.511 --> 06:55.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Hillary Clinton differ on
that, after
the news summary.

06:55.849 --> 07:00.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other news: The president is
on his way
home tonight from that summit
with Southeast

07:00.287 --> 07:02.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Asian leaders.

07:02.155 --> 07:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was his final planned trip to
the region
before leaving office, and he
rejected criticism

07:07.227 --> 07:09.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that his pivot to Asia has
fallen short.

07:09.863 --> 07:16.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: The concern that I
have heard
is not that what we have done
hasn't been

07:16.870 --> 07:18.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
important and successful.

07:18.071 --> 07:21.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The concern that I have heard
is, will it
continue?

07:21.741 --> 07:30.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And almost uniformly, the
question I get from
other leaders is, we hope that
America's interest

07:30.183 --> 07:34.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and presence and engagement is
sustained.

07:34.454 --> 07:39.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Obama also
pledged again
to do all he can to get the
Trans-Pacific

07:39.659 --> 07:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trade pact through Congress
before he leaves
office.

07:43.630 --> 07:49.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Afghanistan, Taliban fighters
pushed deep
into a provincial capital before
being repulsed.

07:49.636 --> 07:56.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds of militants overran
government checkpoints
around the city of Tirin Kot in
Uruzgan Province.

07:56.910 --> 08:02.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Local officials fled as Taliban
fighters got
within a few hundred yards of
the governor's

08:02.382 --> 08:03.750 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
compound.

08:03.783 --> 08:07.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, reinforcements and
allied airstrikes
pushed them back.

08:07.654 --> 08:13.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia announced today that
Israeli and Palestinian
leaders have agreed in principle
to meet in

08:13.259 --> 08:15.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Moscow, to relaunch peace talks.

08:15.795 --> 08:17.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But no date was set.

08:17.731 --> 08:22.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, two Israeli
researchers reported
finding documents that show
Palestinian President

08:22.702 --> 08:26.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mahmoud Abbas was a Soviet spy
in the 1980s.

08:27.006 --> 08:33.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Abbas' office denied it, all of
this as Israel
began work on an underground
barrier along

08:33.513 --> 08:34.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Gaza border.

08:35.014 --> 08:39.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's meant to stop militants
from digging
tunnels to carry out attacks.

08:39.919 --> 08:45.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lawmakers in Britain declared
their own Parliament
Building an impending crisis
today.

08:45.191 --> 08:51.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A special committee recommended
that the complex
be vacated in order to allow
sweeping repairs

08:51.331 --> 08:55.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
estimated to cost the equivalent
of $4.7 billion.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Brand of Independent
Television News
reports.

08:58.438 --> 09:02.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BRYANT, U.K. Parliament
Member: Outside
the tourist marvel at the mother
of all parliaments,

09:02.942 --> 09:07.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but hidden from sight, it houses
the mother
of all problems, its walls
crumbling with

09:07.947 --> 09:13.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
damp, roofs leaking, and
asbestos lurking
somewhere down here.

09:13.086 --> 09:18.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, if you look here, you
see that there's
a gas there -- gas main -- and
it sits immediately

09:18.892 --> 09:20.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
next to the danger high voltage.

09:20.693 --> 09:24.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL BRAND: This M.P. heads up a
committee
which has decided it's becoming
too dangerous.

09:24.531 --> 09:29.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BRYANT: The risk is, and
it's growing
year by year, and we have taken
far too long

09:29.369 --> 09:32.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to address it, the risk is of
some kind of
catastrophic failure.

09:32.405 --> 09:36.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we want to preserve this
iconic historic
building, we have got the seize
the opportunity

09:36.142 --> 09:37.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

09:37.877 --> 09:40.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL BRAND: But the renovation
could cost
up than four billion pounds and
take up to

09:40.780 --> 09:45.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eight years to complete, partly
because the
oldest bit of the building dates
back 900

09:45.285 --> 09:51.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, with the rest rebuilt in
1840 after
a fire burned down much of the
previous place.

09:51.858 --> 09:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The big question, of course, is
where everyone
goes while the work is being
done.

09:55.028 --> 09:59.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the answer for M.P.s is
here, Richmond
House, the Department of Health.

09:59.332 --> 10:03.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Doesn't look like much from the
outside and
there's no bathroom on the
inside, but it

10:03.169 --> 10:05.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
does have space for a debating
chamber.

10:05.572 --> 10:10.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the Lords get the
plusher QEII
conference center just down the
road, as they

10:10.276 --> 10:12.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
too insist it is a good use of
money.

10:12.846 --> 10:17.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: For all of us who live
here, all of
us who are taxpayers, we know
that we have

10:17.317 --> 10:20.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got to spend money on lots of
things that
are vital to us.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But this is one of those things.

10:22.555 --> 10:27.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can't say it's more important
than something
else, but it is equally
important.

10:27.160 --> 10:31.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL BRAND: The decision on
Parliament's future
will now be put to Parliament
itself.

10:31.397 --> 10:34.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
M.P.s and Lords will have a
final vote on
the plans.

10:34.534 --> 10:38.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The last time the
members of
Parliament had to move out was
during World

10:38.338 --> 10:43.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
War II, when German bombs set
the House of
Commons on fire.

10:43.142 --> 10:46.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former Virginia Governor Bob
McDonnell received
good news today.

10:46.946 --> 10:51.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Federal prosecutors announced
that they will
not retry him, or his wife, on
corruption

10:51.985 --> 10:53.953 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
charges.

10:53.987 --> 11:00.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The McDonnells were convicted in
2014 of accepting
$175,000 in gifts and loans to
promote a dietary

11:01.027 --> 11:02.695 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supplement.

11:02.729 --> 11:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in June of this year, the
U.S. Supreme
Court ruled that McDonnell never
took any

11:06.299 --> 11:09.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
action that violated bribery
laws.

11:09.602 --> 11:15.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Olympic Committee has
suspended swimmer
Ryan Lochte for 10 months over a
drunken incident

11:15.875 --> 11:17.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the Rio Olympics.

11:17.810 --> 11:23.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The action today means that
Lochte is ineligible
for next year's World Swimming
Championships.

11:23.082 --> 11:27.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also forfeits $100,000 in
Olympic bonus
money.

11:27.787 --> 11:33.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, in Rio, the
Paralympic Games got
under way with swimming and
track and field

11:33.226 --> 11:34.594 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
events.

11:34.627 --> 11:38.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That followed last night's
opening ceremonies
in Maracana Stadium.

11:38.064 --> 11:44.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 4,300 athletes from
some 160 countries
are taking part in the Games.

11:45.004 --> 11:47.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Russian team is not there.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was banned for
state-sponsored doping.

11:50.376 --> 11:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street today, the
Dow Jones industrial
average lost 46 points to close
near 18480.

11:57.150 --> 12:01.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 24, and the S&amp;P
500 gave up
nearly five.

12:01.821 --> 12:08.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how the next
president can be expected to
deal with Russia;

12:08.061 --> 12:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump's refusal to
release his tax
returns put in context; what
surfing has to

12:13.733 --> 12:23.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do with business competition
from China; and
much more.

12:23.409 --> 12:34.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A major topic throughout this
election year
surfaced again last night at the
presidential

12:34.754 --> 12:40.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate forum on national
security, Russia,
and what kind of relations the
U.S. should

12:40.593 --> 12:42.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have with Vladimir Putin.

12:42.729 --> 12:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's some of what Donald Trump
had to say,
followed by Hillary Clinton's
response today.

12:47.567 --> 12:51.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE:
I think I would have a very,
very good relationship

12:51.671 --> 12:55.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Putin, and I think I would
have a very,
very good relationship with
Russia.

12:55.942 --> 12:59.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT LAUER, NBC News: Let me ask
you about
some of things you have said
about Vladimir

12:59.078 --> 13:00.980 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Putin.

13:01.014 --> 13:03.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You said, "I will tell you, in
terms of leadership,
he's getting an A. Our president
is not doing

13:03.983 --> 13:05.818 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so well."

13:05.852 --> 13:09.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Well, he does have
an 82 percent
approval rating, according to
the different

13:09.055 --> 13:10.890 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pollsters.

13:10.923 --> 13:14.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT LAUER: He's also a guy who
annexed Crimea
and, according to our
intelligence community,

13:14.894 --> 13:18.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
probably is the main suspect for
the hacking
of the DNC computers.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Well, nobody knows
that for
a fact.

13:20.767 --> 13:24.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But do you want me to start
naming some of
the things that President Obama
does?

13:24.704 --> 13:28.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:
Once again, he praised Russia's
strong man,

13:28.641 --> 13:37.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vladimir Putin, even taking the
astonishing
step of suggesting that he
prefers the Russian

13:37.517 --> 13:40.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president to our American
president.

13:40.420 --> 13:48.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was just thinking about all of
the presidents
that would just be looking at
one another

13:48.161 --> 13:50.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in total astonishment.

13:50.863 --> 13:57.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What would Ronald Reagan say
about a Republican
nominee who attacks America's
generals and

13:57.470 --> 14:00.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
heaps praise on Russia's
president?

14:00.039 --> 14:02.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think we know the answer.

14:02.041 --> 14:06.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more on how
the candidates
view U.S.-Russia relations, we
turn to representatives

14:06.479 --> 14:08.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of both campaigns.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Philip Gordon advises Hillary
Clinton.

14:10.516 --> 14:15.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was assistant secretary of
state for European
and Eurasian affairs when Mrs.
Clinton was

14:15.755 --> 14:17.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
secretary of state.

14:17.657 --> 14:20.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Boris Epshteyn, he advises
the Trump campaign.

14:20.793 --> 14:24.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He emigrated to the United
States from Russia
in the early 1990s.

14:25.031 --> 14:29.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a lawyer specializing in
investment banking
and finance and he worked for
John McCain's

14:30.002 --> 14:31.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
campaign for president.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the "NewsHour."

14:33.973 --> 14:35.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Boris Epshteyn, let me start
with you.

14:35.842 --> 14:41.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when Donald Trump says that
Vladimir Putin
has been very much of a leader,
a great leader,

14:41.247 --> 14:47.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he says he has got high poll
ratings, is he
endorsing what Putin's action
have been, annexing

14:47.754 --> 14:53.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Crimea, backing the Assad regime
in Syria,
cracking down on the press?

14:53.059 --> 14:54.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BORIS EPSHTEYN, Senior Adviser,
Trump Campaign:
Absolutely not.

14:54.894 --> 14:59.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Donald Trump said and what
he is saying
is that he will make sure that
America leads

14:59.365 --> 15:01.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and doesn't lead from behind.

15:01.300 --> 15:05.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he will make sure that he
works with Vladimir
Putin, but does it in a way
that's in the

15:05.104 --> 15:06.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
best interests of the United
States.

15:06.906 --> 15:10.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if he does disagree with
Vladimir Putin
-- let's look at the history of
Soviet-U.S.

15:10.676 --> 15:13.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
relations, U.S.-Russia
relations.

15:13.679 --> 15:19.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's some other presidents who
worked with
the Soviet Union and Russia,
FDR, JFK, Nixon,

15:19.285 --> 15:22.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush.

15:22.622 --> 15:25.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton herself
attempted a failed
reset with Russia.

15:25.558 --> 15:29.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Obama White House right now
is trying
to work with Russia on Syria.

15:29.328 --> 15:31.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's failing at doing so, but
it's trying.

15:31.731 --> 15:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, just because Hillary Clinton
failed doesn't
mean that Donald Trump won't
succeed.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He will succeed.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me turn to
Philip Gordon.

15:38.805 --> 15:45.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it possible to praise Mr.
Putin as a leader,
but to disagree with his policy?

15:45.411 --> 15:47.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PHILIP GORDON, Former U.S.
Assistant Secretary
of State: I don't know.

15:47.647 --> 15:54.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I personally found Mr. Trump's
praise for
Mr. Putin troubling or even
chilling, frankly.

15:54.620 --> 15:59.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a room full of military
veterans, to be
effusing about his great
leadership and how

15:59.725 --> 16:05.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strong he is and how popular he
is, while
disrespecting the American
president and American

16:05.932 --> 16:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
generals, I don't know.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was, I think, not just
troubling to me,
but to a lot of listeners and I
think, frankly,

16:10.837 --> 16:13.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a lot of Republican listeners
as well.

16:13.539 --> 16:18.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump said that he thinks he
can get along
very, very well with Mr. Putin
and have very,

16:18.311 --> 16:20.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very good relations with Russia.

16:20.413 --> 16:27.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sure he can, if he is
willing to turn
away from our NATO allies and
reconsider whether

16:27.553 --> 16:33.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eastern Ukraine is really part
of the country,
and do whatever he can to
accommodate Mr.

16:33.359 --> 16:34.560 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Putin's views.

16:34.594 --> 16:37.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm sure that would lead to good
relations
with Mr. Putin.

16:37.563 --> 16:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think that's not what the
American people
expect from our foreign policy.

16:40.499 --> 16:46.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Boris Epshteyn,
is that what
would be involved under a Trump
administration,

16:46.505 --> 16:53.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
closer ties with Russia, but
likely at the
expense of relationships, long
relationships

16:53.112 --> 16:54.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Europe, with Eastern
Europe?

16:54.547 --> 16:55.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BORIS EPSHTEYN: Absolutely not.

16:55.815 --> 16:57.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, again, let's look at some
facts here.

16:57.884 --> 17:02.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Bill Clinton received
half-a-million dollars
for a 90-minute speech in
Moscow.

17:02.321 --> 17:05.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He then received a personal call
from Vladimir
Putin thanking him.

17:05.558 --> 17:09.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is also a very famous
photograph of
the two of them grinning and
being very happy,

17:09.862 --> 17:11.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mr. Putin and President Clinton.

17:11.631 --> 17:15.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So let's not act as if the
Clintons don't
have a long history of palling
around with

17:15.801 --> 17:17.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Russia and Vladimir Putin.

17:17.637 --> 17:21.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also on Hillary Clinton's
watch as the
secretary of state that Russia
gained control

17:21.207 --> 17:24.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of one-fifth of the uranium
produced in the
United States of America.

17:24.443 --> 17:27.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's actually the Clintons
who have been
way too cozy with the Russians.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

17:29.749 --> 17:32.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BORIS EPSHTEYN: Donald Trump
will work with
Russia and will of course
continue the close

17:32.084 --> 17:35.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relationship we have with NATO,
as we well
as countries in Eastern Europe.

17:35.054 --> 17:38.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Philip Gordon,
what about the
point Mr. Epshteyn makes, that
other presidents,

17:38.791 --> 17:43.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including -- and secretaries of
state, including
Hillary Clinton, have talked
about a reset

17:43.796 --> 17:46.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Russia, for example, tried
to mend relations?

17:46.198 --> 17:47.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PHILIP GORDON: Right.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, look, the debate is not
whether we should
work with Russia.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's in our interest to do so.

17:52.438 --> 17:56.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Clinton for four years
was part
of a policy of resetting Russian
relations

17:56.242 --> 17:59.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with Russia in our interests.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BORIS EPSHTEYN: And she failed.

18:00.813 --> 18:04.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PHILIP GORDON: And we got a lot
of things
done under -- in that context.

18:04.150 --> 18:05.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We got the Iran sanctions done.

18:05.851 --> 18:12.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We got an agreement by Russia to
allow us
to use Afghanistan to transit
supplies for

18:12.158 --> 18:13.225 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our forces.

18:13.259 --> 18:16.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We got a Security Council
resolution on Libya.

18:16.128 --> 18:21.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We got Russia into the WTO to
bring in to
it a rules-based trading system.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All of those things were in our
interest.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The point is not whether we
should work with
Russia.

18:25.338 --> 18:30.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The point is whether we should
sacrifice other
important interests to do so.

18:30.309 --> 18:31.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And while we...

18:31.410 --> 18:32.378 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

18:32.411 --> 18:33.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PHILIP GORDON: Let me finish, if
I could.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let him finish
his point, and
I will come back.

18:35.581 --> 18:38.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP GORDON: While pursuing
those relations
with Russia, which are important
-- Russia

18:38.985 --> 18:44.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is an important country -- it is
also important
to stand by your friends and
allies in Europe,

18:44.991 --> 18:49.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
defend your treaty commitment to
NATO allies,
stand by the sovereignty and
territorial integrity

18:49.996 --> 18:51.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Ukraine.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that seems to be the
difference.

18:52.898 --> 18:57.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not whether we pursue
relations with
Russia when we need to, but what
we're willing

18:57.803 --> 19:02.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to give them in order to have
that very, very
good relationship that Mr. Trump
seems to

19:02.708 --> 19:04.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be talking about.

19:04.510 --> 19:07.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Boris Epshteyn,
what is it
that Donald Trump would be
prepared to give,

19:07.346 --> 19:10.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to trade Russia, to concede to
Russia?

19:10.149 --> 19:11.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

19:11.717 --> 19:14.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BORIS EPSHTEYN: Mr. Gordon
sounds a lot more
reasonable than his candidate.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But let's go again to the things
he mentioned.

19:16.756 --> 19:21.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Iran sanctions, the Iran
deal has been
a disaster for the United States
of America.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We now know there are secret
causes that are
allowing Iran to keep uranium.

19:24.930 --> 19:29.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As far as Russia being in the
WTO, again,
a negative for the United States
of America

19:29.368 --> 19:31.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and a positive for Russia.

19:31.237 --> 19:35.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, some of the examples that
you gave there
are actually again ways in which
Hillary Clinton

19:35.241 --> 19:40.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was too cozy to Russia, and did
things that
are in Russia's favor, not the
favor of the

19:40.046 --> 19:41.914 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
U.S.

19:41.947 --> 19:45.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump has said that he
will be absolutely
steadfast in his support for our
NATO allies,

19:45.384 --> 19:50.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as long as they keep to their
agreements of
paying 2 percent of their GDP to
the mutual

19:50.489 --> 19:53.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defense, which is exactly what
is in the original
NATO agreements.

19:53.592 --> 19:54.560 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

19:54.593 --> 19:56.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PHILIP GORDON: It's actually
not.

19:56.462 --> 19:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's in the agreement is a
treaty that says
we would come to their defense
if they are

19:59.932 --> 20:01.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attacked.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BORIS EPSHTEYN: And every
country is supposed
to spend 2 percent of their GDP.

20:03.869 --> 20:04.837 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

20:04.870 --> 20:06.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's let Mr.
Gordon respond.

20:06.572 --> 20:08.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's let Mr. Gordon respond.

20:08.074 --> 20:09.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BORIS EPSHTEYN: OK.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP GORDON: No, I was going
to the heart
of this matter, which is, the
issue of whether

20:12.011 --> 20:15.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europeans should contribute more
to NATO,
I think, is a matter of
consensus.

20:15.247 --> 20:20.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Secretary Clinton
believes that, and
a series of U.S. presidents and
secretaries

20:20.219 --> 20:22.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of defense and state have urged
our European
partners.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BORIS EPSHTEYN: So, what is
wrong with Mr.
Trump saying that?

20:24.690 --> 20:29.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP GORDON: None, not a
single one, Republican
or Democrat, candidate or
official, has ever

20:29.662 --> 20:38.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that, unless they do, our
solemn treaty
commitment to defend them is
open to question,

20:38.838 --> 20:41.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which is an invitation to
aggression in Europe.

20:41.907 --> 20:45.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what's so astonishing
about Mr. Trump's
position.

20:46.011 --> 20:46.979 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

20:47.012 --> 20:47.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BORIS EPSHTEYN: You're
completely incorrect.

20:48.013 --> 20:49.315 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And here's why.

20:49.348 --> 20:51.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Boris Epshteyn,
let me just
come back to you.

20:51.150 --> 20:56.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Donald Trump clearly says
he admires
Vladimir Putin, he thinks he's a
great leader,

20:56.422 --> 20:58.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what is it about him that he
admires?

20:58.157 --> 21:02.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BORIS EPSHTEYN: There are
specific things
about Vladimir Putin that Donald
Trump has

21:02.795 --> 21:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said are strong in terms of
leadership, in
terms of beating back radical
Islamic jihadism,

21:07.266 --> 21:11.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
radical Islamic terrorism, which
Vladimir
Putin has done throughout
greater Russia,

21:11.237 --> 21:15.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, again, the fact that Russia
does want
to work with the United States
in defeating

21:15.407 --> 21:16.342 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ISIS.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.210 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:18.244 --> 21:21.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But let me just
stop you there,
because, in Syria, haven't the
Russian forces

21:21.580 --> 21:26.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gone after the opponents of the
Assad regime,
rather than going after ISIS?

21:26.819 --> 21:29.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BORIS EPSHTEYN: Actually, Russia
has been
going after ISIS.

21:29.488 --> 21:33.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you look at the history
of the United
States in Syria, we have
absolutely no policy

21:33.526 --> 21:34.493 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Syria.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We had that red line that was
crossed.

21:36.428 --> 21:39.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton didn't have a
policy for Syria,
also didn't have a policy for
Libya, which

21:39.665 --> 21:42.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was another thing that Mr.
Gordon mentioned
working with Russia on.

21:42.801 --> 21:46.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our policy in Libya was cause
for an American
ambassador to be murdered and
for Libya to

21:46.705 --> 21:51.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a failed state run by ISIS,
again, another
place where we could be working
together with

21:51.243 --> 21:52.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
together Russia.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.979 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:54.013 --> 21:55.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, let me stop
you there,
because we only have about 30
seconds, and

21:55.614 --> 21:58.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to give Mr. Gordon a
final chance to
respond.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BORIS EPSHTEYN: Sure.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.119 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sure.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Philip Gordon.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP GORDON: Well, we're
mostly talking
about foreign policy, but I
would come back,

22:03.422 --> 22:07.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judy, to your question about Mr.
Trump's admiration
of Putin and his system.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BORIS EPSHTEYN: He never said
that.

22:09.328 --> 22:12.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP GORDON: And that, as I
said at the
beginning, was so troubling to
-- and one

22:12.631 --> 22:18.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even tries to figure out why
he's so admiring
of a leader who has cracked down
on journalists

22:18.270 --> 22:23.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and is suspected of using even
violence, cracked
down on civil society, ruling
with an iron

22:23.976 --> 22:26.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fist within Russia.

22:26.278 --> 22:31.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To look with admiration on that
sort of domestic
leadership, I think is just
really inconsistent

22:31.784 --> 22:32.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with American values.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BORIS EPSHTEYN: But Mr. Trump
never made those
comments.

22:34.220 --> 22:35.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You are putting those words in
his mouth,
Mr. Gordon.

22:35.988 --> 22:37.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's unfair to do so.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton tried to worked
with Russia.

22:39.325 --> 22:40.292 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She failed.

22:40.326 --> 22:41.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

22:41.660 --> 22:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PHILIP GORDON: ... flattery that
leads him
to say these things.

22:43.262 --> 22:44.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's hard to understand.

22:44.263 --> 22:45.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BORIS EPSHTEYN: You're
incorrect, my friend.

22:45.264 --> 22:46.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We are going to
leave it there.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gentlemen, we want to thank both
of you for
joining us, Boris Epshteyn,
Philip Gordon.

22:49.802 --> 22:50.769 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

22:50.803 --> 22:51.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PHILIP GORDON: Thank you.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BORIS EPSHTEYN: Thanks.

22:53.939 --> 22:59.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we turn now
from foreign
policy to an issue that
continues to grab

22:59.178 --> 23:05.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
headlines in the campaign:
Donald Trump's
taxes and so far his refusal to
make them

23:05.551 --> 23:07.386 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
public.

23:07.419 --> 23:11.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton says he must be
hiding something,
while Trump himself has pledged
to release

23:11.090 --> 23:14.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them, but only when IRS is
finished its audits.

23:14.660 --> 23:17.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is something that can last
seven years.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We want to get past all these
headlines.

23:19.999 --> 23:23.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And our Lisa Desjardins helps
put it all in
context.

23:23.335 --> 23:26.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Let's start
with basic facts.

23:26.205 --> 23:31.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far, Donald Trump has not
made his tax
returns or summaries on them
public.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he gives a consistent
explanation.

23:32.711 --> 23:34.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
And I am under audit, a routine
audit.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when the audit is complete,
I will release
my returns.

23:37.283 --> 23:38.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know when that is going
to be.

23:38.550 --> 23:40.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when the audit is complete,
I will release
my returns.

23:40.519 --> 23:41.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have no problem with it.

23:41.654 --> 23:42.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It doesn't matter.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But this is his
choice.

23:44.657 --> 23:49.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The IRS confirmed this year that
nothing prevents
Trump, or any of us, from
releasing personal

23:49.461 --> 23:51.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tax returns anytime.

23:51.397 --> 23:56.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, most of us don't have the
1,000-page
tower of returns that Trump
tweeted about

23:56.735 --> 23:59.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
last year, but that's important.

23:59.038 --> 24:04.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You see, Trump's personal taxes
are also the
taxes of his company.

24:04.076 --> 24:10.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump Organization, with its
500 associated
companies, files as a kind of
family business,

24:10.115 --> 24:15.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whose dealings are taxed as
Trump's personal
income, which brings us to the
bigger point:

24:15.888 --> 24:18.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What could Trump's taxes tell
us?

24:18.357 --> 24:20.225 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
A lot.

24:20.259 --> 24:24.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How successful the businessman
actually is,
what ties does he have abroad,
how his companies

24:24.496 --> 24:30.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
operate there, if and how much
he gives to
charity, and whether Trump pays
any taxes

24:30.269 --> 24:31.337 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at all.

24:31.370 --> 24:32.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump likes to bring that up
himself.

24:32.604 --> 24:35.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I pay as little as
possible.

24:35.174 --> 24:39.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I fight like hell to pay as
little as possible
for two reasons.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Number one, I'm a businessman.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the way you're
supposed to do it.

24:42.514 --> 24:44.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Now to
perspective.

24:44.850 --> 24:47.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How unusual is Trump's refusal
to release?

24:47.986 --> 24:50.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In modern politics, he is alone.

24:50.422 --> 24:56.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since 1980, every president from
Ronald Reagan
to Barack Obama has released
their returns

24:56.061 --> 24:57.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
publicly.

24:57.062 --> 24:58.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And so has each nominee.

24:58.530 --> 25:01.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John McCain released the fewest,
two years
of returns.

25:01.967 --> 25:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton has released the
most, 39
years of returns.

25:06.071 --> 25:08.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But was anyone else under audit?

25:08.374 --> 25:10.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yes, Richard Nixon.

25:10.175 --> 25:12.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD NIXON, Former President
of the United
States: People have got to know
whether or

25:12.211 --> 25:14.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not their president is a crook.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Well, I'm not a crook.

25:15.514 --> 25:19.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Nixon wasn't
talking about
Watergate there.

25:19.184 --> 25:24.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He was talking about his
finances after an
IRS audit in 1973 showed he owed
more than

25:24.890 --> 25:27.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
$400,000 in back taxes.

25:27.893 --> 25:33.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nixon eventually released four
years of returns,
sparking the modern tradition.

25:33.265 --> 25:37.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another option for Trump, like
fellow billionaire
politician Michael Bloomberg,
Trump could

25:37.803 --> 25:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
release a summary, or the first
pages of his
taxes.

25:41.407 --> 25:47.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or he could he release the taxes
that have
completed audits, those up to
the year 2008.

25:47.646 --> 25:49.014 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
His response?

25:49.047 --> 25:50.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The only one that
cares is the
press, I will tell you.

25:50.249 --> 25:52.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even the press, I tell you,
it's not a
big deal.

25:52.184 --> 25:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: You don't think there
are voters
out there who...

25:53.419 --> 25:54.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I don't think so,
no.

25:54.420 --> 25:55.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think people don't care.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But is that
true?

25:58.557 --> 26:03.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Actually, a recent poll found
two-thirds of
likely voters think seeing
candidates' tax

26:03.862 --> 26:05.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
returns is important.

26:05.531 --> 26:10.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, in this election,
two-thirds of voters
don't agree on much.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

26:12.204 --> 26:16.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump's
tax returns
aren't the only way to gain
insight into his

26:16.975 --> 26:18.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
financial dealings.

26:18.610 --> 26:21.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump's business record offers
another look.

26:21.647 --> 26:23.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that.

26:23.449 --> 26:27.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: To understand
Trump's vast
and varied business dealings,
we're joined

26:27.519 --> 26:31.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now by two men who've spent a
good deal of
time looking into those
businesses, as well

26:31.924 --> 26:35.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as talking with Trump at length
about his
career.

26:35.160 --> 26:40.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marc Fisher is a senior editor
at The Washington
Post and co-author of the book
"Trump Revealed:

26:40.199 --> 26:43.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An American Journey of Ambition,
Ego, Money
and Power."

26:43.969 --> 26:47.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Tim O'Brien is executive
editor of Bloomberg
View.

26:47.306 --> 26:50.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His book is called "Trump
nation: The Art
of Being the Donald."

26:50.576 --> 26:53.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gentlemen, thank you both very
much for being
her.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marc Fisher, I would like to
start with you.

26:56.081 --> 27:01.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump campaign is predicated
in large
part on the idea that Trump is a
magnificent

27:01.487 --> 27:05.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
businessman who can bring
America back to
prosperity.

27:05.123 --> 27:08.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And you have done a long
analysis of what
his business career is like.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that a fair characterization
of him?

27:11.196 --> 27:12.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Does he deserve that title?

27:12.865 --> 27:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC FISHER, The Washington
Post: Well, he's
certainly had a good deal of
success.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's also had some terrible
failures.

27:17.436 --> 27:19.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His business career has been a
roller coaster.

27:19.905 --> 27:21.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's been at great heights.

27:21.740 --> 27:27.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He dominated Atlantic City's
casino gambling
business for a time, but then he
overextended

27:27.112 --> 27:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
himself there and actually ended
up cannibalizing
his own business and ended up
with six corporate

27:32.584 --> 27:34.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bankruptcies there.

27:34.453 --> 27:38.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Similarly, around the world,
he's had a number
of successes, but he's really
changed his

27:38.924 --> 27:43.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whole business model in recent
years, so that
he's taking on less debt, less
risk, because

27:43.829 --> 27:45.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that had not been going well for
him.

27:45.731 --> 27:51.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he has really retreated
and found a
new avenue in recent years,
where he essentially

27:51.069 --> 27:57.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rents out his name and uses his
name to allow
others to take the risk, foreign
investors

27:57.042 --> 27:58.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and others.

27:58.977 --> 28:03.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So they take the risk on
projects and he merely
rents out his name and gets a
guaranteed income

28:03.081 --> 28:04.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stream from that.

28:04.550 --> 28:07.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tim O'Brien, I
would put
this same question to thank.

28:07.452 --> 28:10.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I should say, for the
record, you are
one of the few journalists in
the world who

28:10.656 --> 28:15.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have actually seen some of
Trump's tax returns,
but because of a court order of
a suit brought

28:15.627 --> 28:19.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Trump brought against you
for libel,
you are not allowed to talk
about them in

28:19.264 --> 28:21.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
too much detail.

28:21.233 --> 28:25.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But tell us what you can about
them and whether
or not they shed any light on
whether he deserves

28:25.804 --> 28:28.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this reputation for having a
tremendous business
acumen.

28:28.473 --> 28:32.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM O'BRIEN, Executive Editor,
Bloomberg View:
Well, I do think that the tax
returns are

28:32.611 --> 28:33.579 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
important.

28:33.612 --> 28:35.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think he will release
them.

28:35.447 --> 28:41.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the reason he won't
release them is
because I think they would go
towards offering

28:41.086 --> 28:47.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
substantiation around a bunch of
things that
Trump has made central to his
political campaign,

28:47.759 --> 28:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his track record as a business
person, how
charitable he is as a
philanthropist, his

28:55.133 --> 29:01.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
operations overseas, and the
kinds of business
and financial conflicts that
would potentially

29:01.106 --> 29:06.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come to bear on him should he
end up in the
Oval Office.

29:06.111 --> 29:12.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do think it does come back
to yet another
referendum on his business
career.

29:12.150 --> 29:18.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what's important to
remember about
him is that the Donald Trump of
the '80s and

29:18.056 --> 29:21.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the '90s was essentially a
creature of debt.

29:21.360 --> 29:29.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the last time he really
operated a large
business that involved, you
know, complex

29:29.735 --> 29:34.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
financial and managerial
decisions was when
he was running the Atlantic City
casinos,

29:34.640 --> 29:38.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which he essentially ended up
running into
the ground.

29:38.043 --> 29:40.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He put those through four
separate corporate
bankruptcies.

29:40.946 --> 29:46.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as we all know, he almost
went personally
bankrupt in the early 1990s.

29:46.785 --> 29:53.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Trump who emerged from
that is essentially
now a human shingle, as Marc
said.

29:53.225 --> 29:59.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He oversees a licensing
operation where he
puts his name on everything from
mattresses

29:59.998 --> 30:03.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and men's underwear to vodka and
buildings.

30:03.502 --> 30:09.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he's got a golf course
development
operation, and then essentially
a self-promotion

30:10.008 --> 30:15.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
publicity machine that made
itself the most
visible during "The Apprentice"
years.

30:15.881 --> 30:19.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Marc, let's
talk a little
more specifically about that
business, one

30:19.484 --> 30:22.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of those businesses that Tim
just mentioned,
the casino business.

30:22.654 --> 30:28.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As you know, the Clinton
campaign has been
making a lot of hay about
Trump's time as

30:28.460 --> 30:30.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a casino operator.

30:30.262 --> 30:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say he enriched himself,
left this trail
of bankruptcies and really
ruined a lot of

30:34.466 --> 30:35.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
small businesses.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's been a big part of their
argument against
him.

30:37.969 --> 30:39.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How true are those accusations?

30:39.271 --> 30:41.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARC FISHER: They're quite
accurate.

30:41.073 --> 30:46.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, he did have some early
success in
Atlantic City, but he had great
trouble making

30:46.578 --> 30:51.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the payments on the finance
notes that he
took out in order to build those
casinos.

30:51.616 --> 30:57.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He did have trouble paying and
in many cases
didn't pay some of his vendors
and contractors.

30:57.556 --> 31:00.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was a series of lawsuits
about that.

31:00.692 --> 31:04.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a number of such vendors
and contractors
who we quote in the books saying
that their

31:04.763 --> 31:10.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
small businesses were ruined by
Trump's failure
to pay them for work that they
did for his

31:10.168 --> 31:11.937 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
casinos.

31:11.970 --> 31:17.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's a huge gap between
what Donald
Trump was able to do for himself
in Atlantic

31:17.075 --> 31:22.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
City and what he -- the people
he ran roughshod
over in order to get there.

31:22.247 --> 31:24.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We asked him about this.

31:24.116 --> 31:29.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said: Look, I was looking
out for myself
and that other people took risks
to come along

31:29.087 --> 31:32.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with him and, if they failed,
that's their
problem.

31:32.390 --> 31:36.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We asked him, well, how does
that translate
into someone who needs to do
something for

31:36.428 --> 31:38.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the people as president of
the United
States?

31:38.797 --> 31:41.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said: Look, it's just a
completely
different phase of my life.

31:41.800 --> 31:47.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was doing this for Donald
Trump, and I didn't
likely care what was happening
to other people.

31:47.672 --> 31:53.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's a large trail of
destruction coming
out of the Atlantic City
experience.

31:53.945 --> 31:59.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he did at various points
manage to make
sure that he had a guaranteed
income stream,

31:59.050 --> 32:03.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he did manage to negotiate
with the banks
in such a way that he was able
to hold on

32:03.488 --> 32:09.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to those properties or at least
some portion
of them even after they had
essentially failed.

32:09.294 --> 32:13.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tim O'Brien,
you looked
at this career for a long period
of time.

32:13.532 --> 32:19.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are there any examples in
Trump's career that
do support his contention that
he is a strong,

32:19.905 --> 32:24.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smart, successful businessman
that might have
some bearing on him being
commander in chief?

32:24.442 --> 32:29.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM O'BRIEN: Well, I mean, this
all comes
back to, how do we want to
define success

32:29.581 --> 32:31.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and how do we want to define
business?

32:31.983 --> 32:39.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he has not been a
successful operator
of large enterprises.

32:39.524 --> 32:43.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump Organization now is
essentially
a boutique operation.

32:43.094 --> 32:49.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At times, when it's mattered the
most, he
hasn't demonstrated strong
financial discipline.

32:49.734 --> 32:53.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the campaign trail, already,
we have seen
a number of moments in which
he's actually

32:53.905 --> 32:59.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been financially unsophisticated
when he's
spoken about the debt markets,
the federal

32:59.811 --> 33:04.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debt, the Federal Reserve and
monetary policy,
fiscal policy.

33:04.149 --> 33:11.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a large degree of
ignorance around
someone who is saying that his
experience

33:11.089 --> 33:15.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a businessperson qualifies
him for the
Oval Office.

33:15.994 --> 33:21.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what he has been
successful as,
as a businessman, is
self-promotion.

33:21.066 --> 33:27.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's a very self-assured
self-promoter.

33:27.072 --> 33:29.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's very different from
being a great
entrepreneur.

33:29.307 --> 33:30.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is not a John Rockefeller.

33:30.709 --> 33:36.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's not a Henry Ford or a Steve
Jobs or a
Mark Zuckerberg.

33:36.114 --> 33:37.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's essentially a P.T.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.551 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Barnum.

33:39.584 --> 33:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a real skill and
street-smart
approach he has around keeping
himself in

33:46.224 --> 33:51.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the public eye, keeping a
certain perception
about who he is front and center
with the

33:51.696 --> 33:56.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
media, with his political
opponents, and with
voters.

33:57.002 --> 34:04.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the reality is, there is a
-- there is
a very "Wizard of Oz" truth
about a lot of

34:04.876 --> 34:09.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the things surrounding Donald
Trump, that
when you just look at the fact
pattern around

34:09.347 --> 34:15.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
his track record as a
businessperson and pull
the curtain back, you know,
there's a guy

34:15.520 --> 34:19.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there busily spinning the wheel
and myth-making.

34:19.090 --> 34:22.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Tim
O'Brien and
Marc Fisher, thank you both very
much for

34:22.861 --> 34:23.828 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being here.

34:23.862 --> 34:28.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARC FISHER: Thank you.

34:28.066 --> 34:37.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

34:37.242 --> 34:42.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
poet trying
to change the face of Scotland;
and a boy's

34:42.847 --> 34:48.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
struggle to read transformed
into a passion
for children's picture books.

34:48.153 --> 34:55.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: a different take on
the fallout
from trading, and particularly
with China.

34:55.226 --> 34:58.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That issue has been, of course,
one of the
major ones we have heard about
throughout

34:58.563 --> 35:00.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this election season.

35:00.365 --> 35:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
has the third in his series of
stories reported

35:05.670 --> 35:08.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the waves of the California
shore and
beyond.

35:08.907 --> 35:11.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's all part of Making Sense,
which airs
on Thursdays.

35:11.910 --> 35:19.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In San Clemente,
California,
Brad Parks and Shad Eischen,
confined to wheelchairs

35:19.818 --> 35:22.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
since their teens, about to
shred the surf.

35:22.587 --> 35:26.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAD EISCHEN, Surfer: I figured,
if I'm still
alive now, you know, this is the
least thing

35:26.324 --> 35:28.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's going to worry me.

35:28.259 --> 35:33.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: OK, sit-down
surfing on a waveski,
but plenty of challenge if
you're paraplegic.

35:33.064 --> 35:39.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD PARKS, Surfer: I'm having
just a blast
out here just meeting new guys
and being down

35:39.371 --> 35:41.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here and surfing.

35:41.206 --> 35:44.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: The man who
designed and shaped
their waveskis is surfing legend
Steve Boehne,

35:44.909 --> 35:50.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who regular viewers might recall
complaining
about unfair trade here on the
"NewsHour"

35:50.181 --> 35:51.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
three years ago.

35:52.017 --> 35:55.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVE BOEHNE, Infinity
Surfboards: Ninety-five
percent of the boards being sold
in the world

35:55.487 --> 35:59.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
weren't made by us in
California, who started
the surfboard industry.

35:59.124 --> 36:00.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're being made in other
countries.

36:00.892 --> 36:06.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so my workers are competing
for a job
against a guy in another country
who's making

36:06.531 --> 36:08.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a 10th of his wages.

36:08.233 --> 36:11.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: This has become a
main theme
of this year's presidential
campaign.

36:11.770 --> 36:16.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it turns out Steve Boehne
was ahead of
the curve, or at least ahead of
most economists,

36:16.975 --> 36:22.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who have argued since Adam Smith
that trade
is the key to economic growth by
spurring

36:23.014 --> 36:29.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
competition and thus lowering
prices, and
arguing that, in our era,
technology replaces

36:29.854 --> 36:31.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
jobs, not cheap foreign labor.

36:31.756 --> 36:35.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GORDON HANSON, Economist: But as
we went into
the 2000s, with the rise of
China, the situation

36:35.994 --> 36:37.829 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
changed.

36:37.862 --> 36:40.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It's what economist
Gordon Hanson
learned from a soon-to-be
published academic

36:40.198 --> 36:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
study he co-authored: that
Chinese imports
really did hurt U.S. wages and
employment,

36:45.970 --> 36:47.739 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
but selectively.

36:47.772 --> 36:53.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GORDON HANSON: What we were
surprised by was
that those effects were not
distributed kind

36:53.411 --> 36:58.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of broadly and evenly across
blue-collar workers
in the United States, but really
concentrated

36:59.017 --> 37:04.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on industries and workers and
communities
that produce goods that compete
in the same

37:04.823 --> 37:06.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
arenas that China does.

37:06.791 --> 37:13.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Clothes, furniture,
low-end electronics,
in blue-collar strongholds and
key battleground

37:13.131 --> 37:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
states like Pennsylvania and
Ohio.

37:15.433 --> 37:19.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GORDON HANSON: Those workers in
those regions
are the losers of globalization
in the United

37:19.604 --> 37:21.406 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

37:21.439 --> 37:25.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: You look as if
you're a painting
from the 1950s or something on
the floor.

37:25.510 --> 37:28.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVE NAYLOR, Surfboard Maker:
It's an abstract
that's created by accident.

37:28.146 --> 37:32.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And while our
surfboard makers
are a long way from trade's
losers in the

37:32.650 --> 37:35.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Rust Belt, they feel their pain.

37:35.253 --> 37:42.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dave Naylor, who coats the
boards with fiberglass,
told us back in 2013 that he was
earning less,

37:42.393 --> 37:45.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in real dollars, than he made 20
years before.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, Naylor says he's doing
better, but:

37:48.800 --> 37:52.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVE NAYLOR: Only for the reason
that, instead
of just working one job, I got a
little part-time

37:52.670 --> 37:53.872 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job too.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's -- I'm still not making
a lot more
money, you know?

37:56.508 --> 37:57.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And how much is
that?

37:57.509 --> 37:59.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVE NAYLOR: I make about 40 a
year.

37:59.344 --> 38:00.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have a tough time living on
it.

38:00.845 --> 38:02.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, I have a tough time.

38:02.514 --> 38:05.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What are you doing,
David?

38:05.283 --> 38:07.018 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:07.051 --> 38:09.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVE BOEHNE, Infinity
Surfboards: I'm Snapchatting
this monumental, historic
moment.

38:09.654 --> 38:15.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And while the boss'
sassy son
Dave is doing fine -- he's
Infinity's marketing

38:15.426 --> 38:17.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
manager -- most of his friends
are not.

38:17.862 --> 38:20.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVE BOEHNE: They have jobs now,
but it's
not nearly as what they were
making before.

38:20.498 --> 38:25.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, the future, I'm not sure.

38:25.670 --> 38:28.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has seemed to be that way for
quite a while.

38:28.506 --> 38:31.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So who did Dave
Boehne favor
for president?

38:31.342 --> 38:33.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVE BOEHNE: I was a Bernie guy.

38:33.044 --> 38:36.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that brings us
to the second
surprise of Gordon Hanson's
study.

38:36.748 --> 38:41.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GORDON HANSON: Areas that
initially leaned
Republican, when they were hit
harder by import

38:41.152 --> 38:43.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
competition from China, moved
hard to the
right.

38:43.254 --> 38:45.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Because China has our jobs.

38:45.790 --> 38:49.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GORDON HANSON: But areas that
leaned initially
Democratic leaned harder to the
left.

38:49.894 --> 38:51.362 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

38:51.396 --> 38:54.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS (I), Vermont: We
have lost
millions of decent-paying jobs.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That has got to end.

38:56.668 --> 39:03.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GORDON HANSON: So we're at this
complicated
moment in American history,
where economic

39:03.641 --> 39:06.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
polarization and political
polarization are
interacting.

39:06.844 --> 39:11.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Meanwhile, your
economics correspondent
was interacting with a wet suit,
prepping

39:11.916 --> 39:18.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a surf session with Steve
Boehne, a moderate
Republican until the advent of
Donald J. Trump.

39:18.623 --> 39:22.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE BOEHNE: Finally, all the
politicians
are talking about the free trade
agreements

39:22.460 --> 39:24.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and getting jobs back in
America.

39:24.596 --> 39:26.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Trump was the first guy.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I was pretty gung-ho Trump.

39:28.266 --> 39:31.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But on his social issues, I have
a few problems.

39:31.903 --> 39:37.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, you know, I voted for
someone else
in the primary.

39:37.242 --> 39:39.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Who did you vote
for in the primaries?

39:39.544 --> 39:40.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE BOEHNE: I voted for
Bernie.

39:40.878 --> 39:43.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, you can't
vote for Bernie
anymore.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE BOEHNE: No, so I'm voting
for Hillary.

PAUL SOLMAN: Seventy miles to
the southeast,
Bob Grande, founder and CEO of
Quality Controlled

39:51.356 --> 39:55.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Manufacturing in Santee,
California, remains
a Trump supporter.

39:55.827 --> 39:57.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BOB GRANDE, CEO, Quality
Controlled Manufacturing:
Absolutely.

39:57.629 --> 40:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't condone all the rhetoric
and everything
that goes along with it, but you
know what?

40:01.766 --> 40:09.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think our country needs a
little bit of
a wakeup to where we can really
start marching

40:09.407 --> 40:11.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and being more competitive in
the world.

40:11.542 --> 40:16.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fair trade is so important to
being a healthy
business nation.

40:16.481 --> 40:21.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: One casualty of
unfair trade,
says Grande, is the decline of
the American

40:21.552 --> 40:23.354 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
work force.

40:23.388 --> 40:28.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To find employees for his
high-end machine
shop, he has to train them,
since so few young

40:28.693 --> 40:32.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people have the skills or even
think of manufacturing
as a career option.

40:33.031 --> 40:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL NIEMEYER, Quality
Controlled Manufacturing:
Well, to be honest, machining
never came to

40:35.366 --> 40:37.135 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mind.

40:37.168 --> 40:40.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But Grande's
training academy,
six months and then a job
starting at $15

40:40.905 --> 40:44.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an hour, was better than Michael
Niemeyer's
(ph) alternatives.

40:44.075 --> 40:50.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL NIEMEYER: Before this, I
was bouncing
around minimum wage jobs,
cooking food, deliveries,

40:50.748 --> 40:53.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cleaning, maintenance type
stuff.

40:53.051 --> 40:55.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: James Halladay
worked in a rental
yard.

40:55.286 --> 40:58.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES HALLADAY, Quality
Controlled Manufacturing:
I was working from 7:30 in the
morning until

40:58.756 --> 41:01.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2:00 in them morning, sometimes
six days a
week.

41:01.059 --> 41:03.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Seven-thirty a.m.
to 2:00 a.m.?

41:03.861 --> 41:06.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How can you live like that?

41:06.097 --> 41:07.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES HALLADAY: You don't.

41:07.598 --> 41:10.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the problem is, is a lot of
the people
I know are working like that.

41:10.835 --> 41:16.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's just their day-to-day
life, get
up, go to work, go home, go to
bed.

41:16.107 --> 41:18.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Get up the next morning, do the
same thing.

41:18.142 --> 41:24.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Grande's machine
shop is booming,
but only, he says, by making
high-end parts

41:24.048 --> 41:28.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for airplanes, for example, that
foreign competitors
still can't match.

41:28.052 --> 41:34.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB GRANDE: The reason that
we're here now,
still in business, is because we
do the most

41:34.692 --> 41:36.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
complex machining there is.

41:36.994 --> 41:39.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And China isn't there yet.

41:39.130 --> 41:43.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Same story we heard
from the
king of custom surfdom, Steve
Boehne.

41:43.368 --> 41:47.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE BOEHNE: We do it by making
the latest
design.

41:47.705 --> 41:50.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The good surfer, you know, this
is his sport.

41:50.208 --> 41:54.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wants the best surfboard he
can buy, just
like the best golfer wants the
best golf clubs.

41:54.846 --> 41:57.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And it's not just
he, because
I'm looking out there and there
are an awful

41:57.348 --> 41:58.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lot of she's out there.

41:58.549 --> 41:59.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVE BOEHNE: That's right.

41:59.550 --> 42:01.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're all on boards made
overseas.

42:01.819 --> 42:03.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're all beginners.

42:03.654 --> 42:07.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, in a couple of years,
they're going
to be getting boards from me,
because they're

42:07.425 --> 42:09.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to want a better board.

42:09.260 --> 42:14.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Better boards, and
new ones like
the waveski, which work for the
disabled and

42:14.565 --> 42:19.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those of diminishing ability as
well.

42:19.670 --> 42:26.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not for nothing this
stretch of coast
is called Old Man's Beach.

42:26.044 --> 42:29.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But back to business.

42:29.280 --> 42:35.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How long can Steve Boehne
survive if trade
deals don't address supposedly
unfair advantages,

42:35.553 --> 42:41.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like cheap Chinese boards that
glide into
U.S. ports duty-free, while
other countries

42:41.626 --> 42:45.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
try to block U.S.-made boards
with tariffs?

42:45.396 --> 42:51.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The proposed Trans-Pacific
Partnership, a
giant free trade deal with
Pacific Rim countries,

42:51.202 --> 42:54.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but not China, would actually
kill those tariffs.

42:54.338 --> 43:01.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for now, Boehne says he's
forced to import
and sell cheap Chinese boards in
his shop,

43:01.312 --> 43:06.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and for export to Australia and
Japan, make
Infinity boards in Vietnam.

43:06.150 --> 43:09.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE BOEHNE: I'm playing the
game the way
I'm given it, given the rules.

43:09.320 --> 43:12.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, I put the
question to economist
Gordon Hanson.

43:13.024 --> 43:19.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trade barriers, tariffs against
Chinese goods
would preserve the jobs of
American workers,

43:19.297 --> 43:20.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wouldn't it?

43:21.032 --> 43:24.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GORDON HANSON: That would bring
manufacturing
production back to the United
States.

43:24.469 --> 43:27.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no guarantee it would
bring manufacturing
jobs back.

43:27.672 --> 43:31.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As that production came back, it
would be
much more automated, much more
capital-intensive.

43:31.909 --> 43:35.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So we're not going
to get the
jobs back, no matter what we do?

43:35.213 --> 43:37.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GORDON HANSON: Realistically,
we're not.

43:37.882 --> 43:42.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lower-end jobs in manufacturing,
jobs that
were part of the American middle
class in

43:42.687 --> 43:46.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 1950s, and 1960s and 1970s,
those jobs
are gone.

43:46.390 --> 43:48.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What we have got to be doing is
looking forward.

43:48.593 --> 43:52.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Riding the waves,
gingerly, from
Southern California.

43:52.063 --> 43:59.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you turn me into a surfer, I
will never
forgive you.

Paul Solman for the "PBS
NewsHour."

44:05.710 --> 44:12.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a Scottish
literary talent
whose work on identity and
belonging, among

44:12.717 --> 44:17.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other themes, has helped propel
her to a unique
role and a popular writer there.

44:17.955 --> 44:19.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our profile.

44:19.824 --> 44:24.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE KAY, Scottish National
Poet: "And this
is my country, says the
fisherwoman from Jura.

44:24.795 --> 44:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mine, too, says the child from
Canna and Iona.

44:29.033 --> 44:32.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mine, too, says the Brain
family.

44:32.270 --> 44:35.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And mine, says the man from the
Polish deli."

44:35.673 --> 44:41.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Jackie Kay wrote
her poem "Threshold"
for the Scottish Parliament and
a special

44:41.345 --> 44:43.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
guest, Queen Elizabeth.

44:43.080 --> 44:49.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE KAY: Let's blether some
more about
doors, revolving doors and
sliding doors.

44:49.153 --> 44:53.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the wake to of
the recent
Brexit vote to leave the
European Union, it

44:53.824 --> 44:58.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was a plea to keep doors and the
country open
to the outside world.

44:58.563 --> 45:01.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As Scotland's new national poet,
Kay made
it personal.

45:01.832 --> 45:05.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE KAY: Scotland's changing
faces -- look
at me!

45:06.003 --> 45:08.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I like the idea of trying to
change the face
of Scotland.

45:08.673 --> 45:14.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, traditionally, when
somebody thinks of
somebody Scottish, they see a
white man with

45:14.145 --> 45:18.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
red hair in a kilt and a -- and
they don't
see me.

45:18.082 --> 45:22.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Jackie is the
adopted daughter
of John and Helen Kay.

45:22.186 --> 45:23.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Her birth mother Scottish.

45:23.554 --> 45:27.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her father was then a Nigerian
student studying
in Scotland.

45:27.124 --> 45:29.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JACKIE KAY: I was an
illegitimate child.

45:29.594 --> 45:33.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And being picked to be a
national poet is
probably a pretty legitimate
thing.

45:33.965 --> 45:34.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:34.966 --> 45:37.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I will say.

45:37.168 --> 45:42.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She grew up in Glasgow in a
loving home, but
very unaware of her difference
in the outside

45:42.239 --> 45:43.641 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
society.

45:43.674 --> 45:47.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She told her story in a
bestselling memoir,
"Red Dust Road."

45:47.211 --> 45:49.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE KAY: There weren't many
positive stories
about adoption.

45:50.014 --> 45:54.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when I was growing up, we
just saw negative
stories about adoption.

45:54.118 --> 45:56.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Every story that you heard was
horrendous.

45:56.921 --> 45:59.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I wanted to try and tell a
positive story
about adoption.

45:59.457 --> 46:03.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I felt a bit like one of my
favorite writers,
Toni Morrison.

46:03.561 --> 46:06.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said she wrote the story she
wanted to
read.

46:06.163 --> 46:07.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I did that, too.

46:07.898 --> 46:12.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wrote the poems I wanted to
read and I wrote
about the experiences I wanted
to find.

46:12.169 --> 46:16.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: She began to
write as a student
at the University of Stirling
and, over the

46:16.807 --> 46:21.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years, has authored volumes of
poetry, novels,
children's books and more.

46:21.746 --> 46:27.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Often, the work speaks directly
to her own
experience, as in the poem "In
My Country."

46:27.652 --> 46:35.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE KAY: "A woman passed by
me in a full
watchful circle, as if I were a
superstition

46:35.459 --> 46:39.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or the worst dregs of her
imagination.

46:39.830 --> 46:49.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when she finally spoke, her
words spliced
into bars of an old wheel, a
segment of air.

46:49.540 --> 46:52.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where do you come from?

46:52.643 --> 46:54.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here, I said.

46:54.912 --> 46:57.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here, these parts."

46:57.214 --> 47:03.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Kay now has a
major public
role in this poetry-loving
country and she

47:03.421 --> 47:06.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intends to use it to expand the
voices of
Scotland.

47:06.524 --> 47:09.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE KAY: You could have a
real long, long,
long poem with all of the
different things

47:09.860 --> 47:11.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you come from, couldn't
you?

47:11.662 --> 47:14.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We joined her
recently on a
return to Stirling, where she
was working

47:14.999 --> 47:20.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with local high school students,
part of a
project called Out of Bounds,
giving a greater

47:20.471 --> 47:22.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voice to black and Asian British
poets.

47:22.873 --> 47:26.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE KAY: Want to have a
mixture of images
and metaphors as well.

47:26.977 --> 47:30.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Kay encouraged
the students
to play with language in her
poems, something

47:31.015 --> 47:32.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
she herself loves to do.

47:32.850 --> 47:40.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE KAY: I found the coin,
and I found
the (INAUDIBLE) in the sparking
granite June,

47:40.458 --> 47:45.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just as the (INAUDIBLE) was
coming (INAUDIBLE)
just as the coyotes (INAUDIBLE)
at the moon.

47:45.062 --> 47:48.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Her official
title is one she
clearly loves.

47:48.566 --> 47:51.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She is Scotland's Makar, rhymes
with lacquer,
she told me.

47:51.936 --> 47:53.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACKIE KAY: It's an old Scottish
word.

47:54.004 --> 47:56.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it means maker, maker of
words.

47:56.474 --> 47:59.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I mean, it's a
great word because
of this idea to make, right?

47:59.910 --> 48:04.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people -- I don't know if
people think
about poetry, as something
that's made.

48:04.415 --> 48:08.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE KAY: Well, a poem -- we
make a poem
in the way other people might
make a table.

48:08.953 --> 48:11.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A poem is a physical thing that
you make.

48:11.956 --> 48:13.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, for me, Makar fits
perfectly.

48:13.724 --> 48:17.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it seems to have kind of
captured people's
imagination, because people keep
stopping

48:17.628 --> 48:22.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
me and say, Makar,
congratulations, even in
other -- so, for some reason, it
just sort

48:22.933 --> 48:24.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of excited people.

48:24.935 --> 48:28.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's maybe -- it's
because there's
not been a black national poet
in this country

48:28.806 --> 48:29.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
before maybe.

48:29.807 --> 48:30.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Or I don't know.

48:30.908 --> 48:33.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, for some reason, here you
are.

48:33.611 --> 48:34.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are you doing here talking
to me?

48:34.779 --> 48:35.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

48:35.780 --> 48:36.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I don't know.

48:36.781 --> 48:37.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, I do know.

48:37.782 --> 48:38.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Because I wanted to talk to you.

48:38.883 --> 48:40.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:40.785 --> 48:47.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE KAY: Just as granite
comes (INAUDIBLE)
then there will be grown folks
search in vain,

48:47.358 --> 48:54.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tracking during the past in the
rain, for
as long as you would call a
stain a stain.

48:54.064 --> 48:59.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Jackie Kay will
take her infectious
love of poetry and country to
every corner

48:59.637 --> 49:00.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Scotland.

49:00.638 --> 49:03.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACKIE KAY: Come bend the living
room.

49:03.274 --> 49:05.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Come join our brilliant
gathering.

49:05.910 --> 49:16.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From Scotland,
I'm Jeffrey
Brown for the "PBS NewsHour."

49:16.387 --> 49:26.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next, to another
look at the
joy of opening up literature to
new audiences.

49:26.263 --> 49:31.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the latest in our Brief But
Spectacular
episodes, where we ask
interesting people

49:31.502 --> 49:33.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to describe their passions.

49:33.337 --> 49:38.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, we hear from
illustrator Christian
Robinson, so who works to ensure
that picture

49:38.242 --> 49:42.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
books become more inclusive and
empower all
children.

49:42.179 --> 49:45.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His new book is school's first
day of school.

49:45.416 --> 49:50.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIAN ROBINSON, "School's
First Day of
School": Growing up, I actually
-- I didn't

49:50.120 --> 49:52.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have that close of a
relationship with books.

49:52.890 --> 49:55.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I actually struggled to read.

49:55.125 --> 49:58.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I was definitely drawn to
books with
pictures.

49:58.295 --> 50:08.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just loved that, you know, so
much could
be communicated with just an
image.

50:08.672 --> 50:10.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was raised by my grandmother.

50:10.207 --> 50:15.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We didn't have a lot growing up,
but I at
least always had a pencil,
paper.

50:15.145 --> 50:20.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I couldn't control the
circumstances around
me, but I could at least decide
what I wanted

50:20.517 --> 50:23.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on that piece of paper, what
sort of world
I wanted to create.

50:23.654 --> 50:27.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Early on, my drawings were sort
of influenced
by whatever was around me.

50:27.291 --> 50:30.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, like most kids, I watched
"Aladdin" and
then I drew Aladdin.

50:30.828 --> 50:33.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I watched "Jurassic Park," and
then I drew
a dinosaur eating somebody.

50:33.931 --> 50:37.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know so much if I was
motivated by
people telling me that you're
talented or

50:37.935 --> 50:42.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're good at what you do, as
much as it
was really just like a form of
escape and

50:42.706 --> 50:45.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just sort of a passion of mine.

50:45.943 --> 50:51.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you look at a picture book,
you might
think story by the author and
illustrations

50:51.081 --> 50:53.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by the illustrator.

50:53.450 --> 50:56.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The story is actually something
that happens
when the author and the
illustrator come together.

50:56.387 --> 50:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's what happens on the page.

50:58.322 --> 51:03.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On my books, I like to have
written by or
words by the author and pictures
by the illustrator.

51:03.727 --> 51:07.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Illustrating an entire book can
be overwhelming
and scary.

51:07.164 --> 51:12.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what I like to do is start
small, tiny
doodles, which are a storyboard,
and I do

51:12.336 --> 51:14.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them on really tiny little
Post-it notes.

51:14.204 --> 51:19.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they sort of just help me
figure out how
I want to begin to tell the
story.

51:19.977 --> 51:23.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I go on to design and color and
figuring out
what I want the color -- the
characters to

51:23.280 --> 51:25.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look like, what I want the
backgrounds to
look like.

51:25.149 --> 51:30.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's important for me to tell
stories that
reflect the diverse world that
we live in.

51:30.187 --> 51:32.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Children need to see themselves
in books.

51:32.256 --> 51:33.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They need to see their gender.

51:33.824 --> 51:38.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They need to see their color,
hair texture,
their disability, themselves.

51:38.395 --> 51:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Picture books especially are
like many children's
first introduction to the world.

51:43.167 --> 51:45.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Seeing yourself is almost like a
message.

51:45.936 --> 51:52.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's saying, you matter, you are
visible,
and you're valuable.

51:52.409 --> 51:58.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Christian Robinson,
and this is
my Brief But Spectacular take on
telling stories

51:58.315 --> 52:00.017 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with pictures.

52:00.050 --> 52:04.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can watch
additional
Brief But Spectacular episodes
on our Web

52:04.388 --> 52:09.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
site, PBS.org/NewsHour/Brief.

52:09.460 --> 52:13.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now to our "NewsHour" shares,
something that
caught our eye that might be of
interest to

52:13.497 --> 52:15.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you, too.

52:15.299 --> 52:18.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two military veterans stepped
down from their
duties this summer, but they
weren't your

52:18.902 --> 52:20.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
typical soldiers.

52:20.637 --> 52:26.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Julia Griffin
reports on
a pair of Army horses that were
free to a

52:26.043 --> 52:27.811 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
good home.

52:27.845 --> 52:32.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Every morning,
rain or shine,
the Caisson horses of the Army's
Old Guard

52:32.716 --> 52:35.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fall in line at Arlington
National Cemetery.

52:35.786 --> 52:41.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Together, two teams of horses
and their human
counterparts execute eight
expertly choreographed

52:41.658 --> 52:47.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
funeral processions a day for
deceased military
officers and service members
killed in action.

52:48.032 --> 52:52.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a precise job that requires
a particular
kind of horse.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.404 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1ST LT.

52:53.437 --> 52:55.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUSTIN HATCH, U.S. Army: We're
looking more
for behavior.

52:55.205 --> 52:59.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Teamwork is a big part and then
being able
to stay calm with the flags
waving around

52:59.176 --> 53:01.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or loud sounds in the
background.

53:01.412 --> 53:06.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're trying to keep them as
calm as possible,
so that the processions go
smoothly.

53:06.083 --> 53:11.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Horses typically
serve a 10-year
tenure with the Caisson unit,
but when one

53:11.889 --> 53:17.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
horse, Kennedy, began to act out
and another
named Quincy acquired a painful
ailment in

53:17.094 --> 53:21.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his hoof, the Army decided it
was time the
two be retired from service.

53:21.331 --> 53:23.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1ST LT.

53:23.167 --> 53:26.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUSTIN HATCH: They have worked
extremely hard
for this country and honoring
its fallen,

53:26.203 --> 53:31.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so we look for the best homes
for them, retirement
homes, where they will be well
taken care

53:31.108 --> 53:32.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of after their service.

53:32.976 --> 53:34.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARROLL URZENDOWSKI, Former U.S.
Army Soldier:
They actually deserve the best
home that can

53:34.878 --> 53:36.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be provided for them.

53:36.447 --> 53:40.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I felt that my wife and
children and myself,
we could do that for them.

53:40.417 --> 53:44.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Carroll
Urzendowski, a former
platoon sergeant with the
Caisson unit, was

53:44.721 --> 53:49.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chosen to adopt Kennedy out of
dozens of applicants
from across the country.

53:49.760 --> 53:54.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Standardbred horse, who had
once served
as the iconic riderless horse,
will now live

53:54.765 --> 53:58.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
out his golden years at
Urzendowski's 85-acre
ranch in Roganville, Texas.

53:58.635 --> 54:05.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARROLL URZENDOWSKI: It's a
great honor to
know that every day, the horse
that I adopted,

54:05.209 --> 54:10.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he provided that service to his
country, and
then I could teach my children
as they get

54:10.280 --> 54:12.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
older what Kennedy actually
provided for the
nation.

54:12.983 --> 54:16.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRISTEN WHITTAKER, Adopted
Quincy: This was
a big, big honor for us.

54:16.854 --> 54:21.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Kristen Whittaker
and her husband,
Sean Sutton, a former sergeant
in the Army

54:21.425 --> 54:24.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
National Guard, were selected to
adopt Quincy.

54:24.928 --> 54:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heated stables and a trained
medical staff
await the Quarter Horse at their
farm just

54:29.600 --> 54:31.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
south of Boston.

54:31.368 --> 54:33.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTEN WHITTAKER: We are lucky
enough to
be able to provide some medical
intervention

54:33.871 --> 54:35.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for him and some corrective
shoeing.

54:35.739 --> 54:39.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the same responsibility
that I have to
any of my own horses, give them
a quality

54:39.843 --> 54:44.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of life and hopefully keep them
really happy
through their elder years.

54:44.081 --> 54:46.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he will go to his forever
home now.

54:46.283 --> 54:51.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Two horses who
served in the
most solemn service, the burial
of those killed

54:51.555 --> 54:55.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in war, now being offered new
homes by military
veterans.

54:55.993 --> 54:59.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Julia Griffin
in Fort Belvoir, Virginia.

54:59.730 --> 55:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What a lovely
story.

55:02.766 --> 55:09.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: The lionfish
was once an alluring pet, but
now it's a predatory

55:09.740 --> 55:12.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threat in the coral reefs of the
Atlantic
Ocean.

55:12.609 --> 55:16.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can track their rise, you
can look into
the belly of the predator and
learn how people

55:16.813 --> 55:20.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are trying to reverse this
human-made dilemma.

55:20.217 --> 55:24.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

55:24.888 --> 55:26.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

55:26.356 --> 55:28.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

55:28.058 --> 55:32.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening
with Mark Shields and David
Brooks.

55:32.196 --> 55:38.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
