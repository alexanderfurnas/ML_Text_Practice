00:10.711 --> 00:13.380
>> John Larson: ON THIS EDITION
FOR SUNDAY JULY 6...

00:13.447 --> 00:15.282
ISRAELI AUTHORITIES
MAKE SIX ARRESTS

00:15.349 --> 00:17.951
FOR WHAT THEY NOW BELIEVE WAS
THE REVENGE MURDER

00:18.018 --> 00:21.788
OF A PALESTINIAN TEENAGER BURNED
ALIVE.

00:21.855 --> 00:25.425
HARI SREENIVASAN REPORTS FROM
THE ASPEN IDEAS FESTIVAL.

00:25.492 --> 00:28.495
AND FROM CALIFORNIA,
A REPORT ABOUT A DEBILITATING

00:28.562 --> 00:31.298
AND DEADLY DISEASE--
VALLEY FEVER.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.200
YOU CAN'T FILTER OUT A SPORE.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.269
YOU KNOW, THOSE ARE GOING TO GO
AHEAD AND GET UP INTO THE AIR

00:35.335 --> 00:37.738
AND FIND ITS WAY TO NOSE OR
NOSTRILS.

00:37.804 --> 00:40.874
NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:40.941 --> 00:44.378
>> FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS
IN LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:44.444 --> 00:47.514
THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:47.581 --> 00:48.448
>> Larson: GOOD EVENING.

00:48.515 --> 00:49.850
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:49.917 --> 00:50.918
I'M JOHN LARSON.

00:50.984 --> 00:53.787
HARI SREENIVASAN WILL JOIN US
LATER FROM ASPEN, COLORADO.

00:53.854 --> 00:57.090
WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN ISRAEL,
WHERE AUTHORITIES TODAY ARRESTED

00:57.157 --> 00:59.893
SIX MEN THEY BELIEVE
ARE RESPONSIBLE

00:59.960 --> 01:03.230
FOR THE REVENGE MURDER
OF A PALESTINIAN TEENAGER.

01:03.297 --> 01:06.166
THE 16-YEAR-OLD WAS BEATEN
AND BURNED ALIVE--

01:06.233 --> 01:08.802
AN INCIDENT APPARENTLY SPARKED
BY THE KIDNAPPING

01:08.869 --> 01:11.838
AND MURDER OF THREE
ISRAELI TEENAGERS.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.374
THE ARRESTS WERE ONE OF SEVERAL
IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS

01:14.441 --> 01:16.376
IN ISRAEL TODAY.

01:16.443 --> 01:19.046
FOR MORE WE ARE JOINED ONCE
AGAIN TONIGHT VIA SKYPE

01:19.112 --> 01:22.816
IN JERUSALEM BY JOSEF FEDERMAN
OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.484
JOE, THANKS AGAIN FOR JOINING
US.

01:24.551 --> 01:28.422
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
THE ARRESTS TODAY?

01:28.488 --> 01:30.657
>> WELL, ISRAELI AUTHORITIES
HAVE JUST ANNOUNCED

01:30.724 --> 01:32.559
THEY ARRESTED SEVERAL SUSPECTS.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.094
THEY HAVEN'T GIVEN THE OFFICIAL
NUMBER,

01:34.161 --> 01:37.631
BUT OFFICIALS ARE SAYING THEY
HAVE SIX PEOPLE IN CUSTODY.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.733
THE ARRESTS TOOK PLACE THIS
MORNING

01:39.800 --> 01:42.769
AND EVERYBODY IS STILL BEING
INTERROGATED RIGHT NOW.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.504
WE DON'T KNOW THEIR
IDENTIFICATIONS YET--

01:44.571 --> 01:46.206
WE DON'T HAVE THEIR NAMES--

01:46.273 --> 01:48.241
BUT WE KNOW THAT
THEY ARE JEWISH,

01:48.308 --> 01:50.310
WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE YOUNG MEN,
IN FACT SOME OF THEM

01:50.377 --> 01:51.778
ARE EVEN BELOW THE AGE OF 18,

01:51.845 --> 01:53.981
THEY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED
AS MINORS

01:54.047 --> 01:56.383
AND THEY COME FROM
THE JERUSALEM AREA.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.918
>> Larson: WE DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT

01:57.985 --> 02:00.253
THEIR AFFILIATIONS OR WHAT MIGHT
BE BEHIND THIS,

02:00.320 --> 02:04.091
BUT 24 HOURS AGO THEY WEREN'T
EVEN SURE WHETHER OR NOT

02:04.157 --> 02:07.194
IT WAS NATIONALISTIC
IN ITS NATURE.

02:07.260 --> 02:08.295
>> EXACTLY.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.597
THAT IS WHY THIS IS SUCH A
SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGH,

02:10.664 --> 02:14.001
BECAUSE REALLY IT POINTS US IN
THE DIRECTION THAT PALESTINIANS

02:14.067 --> 02:17.304
CERTAINLY HAVE SUSPECTED AND
A LOT OF ISRAELIS HAD FEARED

02:17.371 --> 02:19.139
THAT IT WAS NATIONALISTIC.

02:19.206 --> 02:21.408
INITIALLY POLICE HAD BEEN
LOOKING INTO

02:21.475 --> 02:23.543
POSSIBLE CRIMINAL MOTIVES OR
PERSONAL MOTIVES

02:23.610 --> 02:26.613
BUT NOW THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED THE
DIRECTION FROM WHICH IT CAME.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.248
>> Larson:
JOE, I READ A DESCRIPTION

02:28.315 --> 02:30.884
OF THE PALESTINIAN MOTHER OF THE
PALESTINIAN BOY

02:30.951 --> 02:33.120
WHO WAS KILLED, OF HER REACTION

02:33.186 --> 02:35.889
SAYING THAT REGARDLESS OF WHO
WAS ARRESTED,

02:35.956 --> 02:39.359
SHE DIDN'T TRUST WHAT WAS GOING
TO HAPPEN AND SHE SAID,

02:39.426 --> 02:41.795
YOU KNOW, THEY SHOULD TREAT
WHOEVER IS ARRESTED,

02:41.862 --> 02:43.663
THEIR FAMILIES, LIKE THEY TREAT
OUR FAMILIES,

02:43.730 --> 02:44.865
BURN THEIR HOUSES.

02:44.931 --> 02:46.366
IT WAS AN ANGRY RESPONSE.

02:46.433 --> 02:50.203
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK
THIS ARREST WILL MATTER

02:50.270 --> 02:53.273
TO THE PALESTINIAN COMMUNITY?

02:53.340 --> 02:57.077
>> I THINK WHAT THE MOTHER
EXPRESSED IS A COMMON SENTIMENT.

02:57.144 --> 03:00.447
THERE IS A LOT OF DISTRUST
TOWARD THE ISRAELI AUTHORITIES.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.350
RELATIONS ARE BAD AND THEY HAVE
BEEN BAD FOR A LONG TIME.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.585
THAT SAID, THE SITUATION
ON THE GROUND

03:05.652 --> 03:07.387
SEEMS TO BE CALMING TODAY.

03:07.454 --> 03:10.924
YOU SEE A LOT OF EFFORTS
BY THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER

03:10.991 --> 03:14.261
WHO WENT ON NATIONAL TV JUST IN
THE PAST FEW MINUTES

03:14.327 --> 03:15.929
TO URGE CALM.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.965
ISRAEL'S PRESIDENT SHIMON PERES,
A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER,

03:19.032 --> 03:20.434
ALSO URGING CALM.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.035
AND THERE ARE ATTEMPTS BY
ISRAELI OFFICIALS

03:22.102 --> 03:24.304
TO WORK WITH ARAB LEADERS IN
NORTHERN ISRAEL,

03:24.371 --> 03:26.106
WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN
VIOLENT PROTESTS

03:26.173 --> 03:27.574
IN THE PAST FEW DAYS,

03:27.641 --> 03:30.577
ALSO WORKING TOGETHER TO GET
THINGS BACK TO NORMAL.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.146
IN ADDITION IN EAST JERUSALEM,
IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS

03:33.213 --> 03:35.816
THAT SAW HEAVIEST RIOTING,

03:35.882 --> 03:37.784
THINGS ARE MOVING BACK
TO NORMAL TODAY.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.986
WE SEE MARKETPLACES REOPENING,

03:40.053 --> 03:43.056
WE SEE THE STREETS ARE REOPENING
TO TRAFFIC

03:43.123 --> 03:45.225
AND PEOPLE GOING BACK TO THEIR
ROUTINES.

03:45.292 --> 03:47.694
SO THE SIGNS ARE THAT THINGS ARE
BEGINNING TO CALM DOWN.

03:47.761 --> 03:48.995
>> Larson: WHAT ABOUT
THE INVESTIGATION

03:49.062 --> 03:51.465
INTO THE MURDER OF THE THREE
ISRAELI TEENS?

03:51.531 --> 03:53.667
WHERE DOES THAT STAND?

03:53.733 --> 03:55.669
>> THAT CONTINUES, AND I KNOW IT
IS A HIGH PRIORITY

03:55.735 --> 03:57.003
FOR THE ISRAELIS.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.673
TODAY WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE
HAS BEEN ANOTHER ARREST.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.741
IT'S POSSIBLY A SIGNIFICANT
ARREST

04:01.808 --> 04:04.344
BECAUSE IT TOOK PLACE IN THE
SAME TOWN IN HEBRON,

04:04.411 --> 04:07.781
THE CITY OF THE WEST BANK WHERE
THE SUSPECTED KILLERS

04:07.848 --> 04:10.350
WERE STILL ON THE LOOSE,
WHERE THEY COME FROM,

04:10.417 --> 04:12.119
SO THERE IS SOME SPECULATION
THAT TODAY'S ARREST

04:12.185 --> 04:13.753
WAS SIGNIFICANT.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.890
THAT SAID, ISRAEL HAS ARRESTED
PROBABLY ABOUT 400 PEOPLE

04:16.957 --> 04:19.593
SO FAR IN ITS ONGOING
INVESTIGATION.

04:19.659 --> 04:22.262
SO NO IMMEDIATE SIGNS
OF A BREAKTHROUGH.

04:22.329 --> 04:23.597
>> I UNDERSTAND THERE MAY BE
DEVELOPMENTS

04:23.663 --> 04:26.633
IN ANOTHER INCIDENT, A BEATING
BY ISRAELI POLICE

04:26.700 --> 04:29.936
OF AN AMERICAN TEENAGER, THE
COUSIN OF THE PALESTINIAN TEEN

04:30.003 --> 04:31.138
WHO WAS KILLED.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.873
ANY NEWS ON THAT?

04:32.939 --> 04:34.541
>> ABSOLUTELY.

04:34.608 --> 04:38.311
HE ALSO IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD
FROM HIS COUSIN WHO WAS KILLED.

04:38.378 --> 04:41.281
HE WAS BEATEN VERY BAD BY
ISRAELI SECURITY TROOPS

04:41.348 --> 04:44.885
DURING ONE OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS
THE OTHER DAY.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.120
HE WAS RELEASED FROM ISRAELI
CUSTODY TODAY.

04:47.187 --> 04:50.457
HE WAS IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE--
TWO BLACK EYES,

04:50.524 --> 04:52.893
HIS MOUTH, HIS FACE IS ALL
SWOLLEN

04:52.959 --> 04:55.362
BUT HE HAS BEEN RELEASED
TO HOUSE ARREST.

04:55.428 --> 04:56.963
HE'S BEEN ORDERED TO STAY WITH
HIS FAMILY

04:57.030 --> 04:59.032
WHILE THIS INVESTIGATION
CONTINUES.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.801
WE SPOKE TO HIM VERY BRIEFLY AND
HE JUST SAID

05:01.868 --> 05:03.503
HE IS HAPPY TO BE HOME.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.238
>> Larson: JOSEF FEDERMAN
OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

05:05.305 --> 05:07.374
FROM JERUSALEM,
ONCE AGAIN WE THANK YOU.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.876
>> THANK YOU.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.077
>> Larson: FROM PAKISTAN
TONIGHT,

05:11.144 --> 05:13.914
WORD THAT THE FATHER OF A YOUNG
WOMAN WHO WAS STONED TO DEATH

05:13.980 --> 05:16.416
HAS NOW BEEN CHARGED
WITH HER KILLING.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.719
TWO BROTHERS, A COUSIN AND
ANOTHER MAN WERE ALSO CHARGED.

05:19.786 --> 05:21.721
THE 25-YEAR-OLD VICTIM
WAS KILLED

05:21.788 --> 05:24.391
BEFORE A CROWD OF ONLOOKERS
SIX WEEKS AGO

05:24.457 --> 05:26.793
IN A SO-CALLED HONOR KILLING.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.462
FAMILY MEMBERS WERE ANGERED THAT
SHE HAD REFUSED TO MARRY

05:29.529 --> 05:32.699
THE MAN THEY CHOSE FOR HER
AND INSTEAD HAD MARRIED

05:32.766 --> 05:34.501
ANOTHER MAN SHE LOVED.

05:34.568 --> 05:37.137
SHE WAS REPORTEDLY THREE MONTHS
PREGNANT AT THE TIME

05:37.204 --> 05:38.638
OF HER DEATH.

05:38.705 --> 05:41.408
TERRORISTS HAVE STRUCK AGAIN
IN EAST AFRICA.

05:41.474 --> 05:44.711
AUTHORITIES IN KENYA SAY AT
LEAST 29 PEOPLE WERE KILLED

05:44.778 --> 05:48.882
IN A SERIES OF ATTACKS THAT
ISLAMIC AL SHABAB EXTREMISTS

05:48.949 --> 05:52.152
FROM NEIGHBORING SOMALIA CLAIMED
THAT THEY WERE BEHIND.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.788
ONE KENYAN OFFICIAL SAID LATER,
"THEY WENT AROUND SHOOTING

05:54.854 --> 05:58.091
AT PEOPLE AND VILLAGES
INDISCRIMINATELY."

05:58.158 --> 06:01.194
FOR MORE, WE ARE JOINED NOW VIA
SKYPE FROM NAIROBI, KENYA,

06:01.261 --> 06:03.997
BY HEIDI VOGT OF THE
"WALL STREET JOURNAL."

06:04.064 --> 06:05.565
HEIDI, THANKS SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US,

06:05.632 --> 06:09.903
WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS
PARTICULAR INCIDENT?

06:09.970 --> 06:13.573
>> WELL, THIS WAS SORT OF TWIN
ATTACKS IN TWO AREAS,

06:13.640 --> 06:15.942
ABOUT 90 KILOMETERS APART.

06:16.009 --> 06:19.746
WE HAD GUNMEN GOING TO THESE
VILLAGES.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.782
WE DO HAVE SOME WITNESSES SAYING
THAT THEY WERE TARGETING

06:22.849 --> 06:25.151
CHRISTIAN MEN, WHICH IS
SOMETHING WE SAW IN ATTACKS

06:25.218 --> 06:26.886
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

06:26.953 --> 06:29.422
BUT WE ALSO HAVE REPORTS THAT
THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TRYING

06:29.489 --> 06:32.192
TO FREE PRISONERS OR JUST GOING
IN, AS YOUR WERE SAYING,

06:32.259 --> 06:33.760
SHOOTING.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.495
>> Larson: NOW THIS IS THE
LATEST IN A SERIES OF ATTACKS,

06:35.562 --> 06:36.930
CORRECT?

06:36.997 --> 06:37.964
I MEAN, WE ARE FAMILIAR
WITH THE HORRIBLE ATTACKS

06:38.031 --> 06:39.833
ON THE SHOPPING CENTER IN
NAIROBI

06:39.899 --> 06:41.368
BUT THERE HAS BEEN A SERIES NOW.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.003
>> YEAH.

06:43.069 --> 06:46.172
THE MOST RECENT ATTACK LIKE THIS
THAT DREW A LOT OF ATTENTION

06:46.239 --> 06:51.745
TO THIS EASTERN REGION OF KENYA
WAS JUST ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO

06:51.811 --> 06:55.849
AROUND MPEKETONI, WHERE WE HAD
SOME 60 PEOPLE KILLED,

06:55.915 --> 06:59.352
SLAUGHTERED, REALLY, AT NIGHT AS
ATTACKERS WENT DOOR TO DOOR

06:59.419 --> 07:01.621
ASKING IF PEOPLE WERE
MUSLIMS OR CHRISTIAN,

07:01.688 --> 07:05.492
SO IT REALLY IS SHOWING THAT
THESE AREN'T ISOLATED INCIDENTS.

07:05.558 --> 07:08.194
>> Larson: WE'VE ALWAYS HEARD
ABOUT KENYA BEING SORT OF

07:08.261 --> 07:10.330
THIS SHINING HOPE FOR DEMOCRACY.

07:10.397 --> 07:14.801
WE'VE SEEN WESTERN BUSINESSES,
LOTS OF TOURISM IN THE AREA.

07:14.868 --> 07:19.272
WHAT EFFECTS HAVE THESE ATTACKS
HAD ON THOSE?

07:19.339 --> 07:22.175
>> KENYA IS NOT JUST
THE SHINING HOPE,

07:22.242 --> 07:26.112
IT'S REALLY BEEN THE STABILIZING
FACTOR FOR THIS WHOLE REGION.

07:26.179 --> 07:27.947
I MEAN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT ITS
NEIGHBORS,

07:28.014 --> 07:32.052
YOU'VE GOT SOMALIA, SOUTH SUDAN,
AND KENYA HAS BEEN A COUNTRY

07:32.118 --> 07:35.088
THAT HAS GONE INTO NEGOTIATE,
THAT HAS SENT TROOPS IN

07:35.155 --> 07:36.723
IN SOME CASES,

07:36.790 --> 07:38.825
AND THAT WESTERN POWERS HAVE
USED AS A PARTNER

07:38.892 --> 07:42.962
TO TRY TO COMBAT THE TERRORIST
THREAT ACROSS EAST AFRICA.

07:43.029 --> 07:48.435
SO IF KENYA IS A PLACE THAT
SUDDENLY IS UNSAFE, UNCERTAIN,

07:48.501 --> 07:51.304
IT RAISES A LOT MORE QUESTIONS
FOR WHAT THAT MEANS

07:51.371 --> 07:53.406
FOR THE ENTIRE EAST AFRICAN
REGION.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.942
>> Larson: NOW, HOW GREAT A
THREAT IS AL SHABAB

07:56.009 --> 07:58.211
AND WHAT IS THEIR TIES TO OTHER
ISLAMIC EXTREMIST GROUPS

07:58.278 --> 08:00.613
AROUND THE WORLD?

08:00.680 --> 08:03.416
>> WELL, AL SHABAB IS AFFILIATED
WITH AL QAEDA

08:03.483 --> 08:06.753
AND IT HAS BEEN IN A MAJOR
DESTABILIZING FORCE

08:06.820 --> 08:08.722
IN THE REGION.

08:08.788 --> 08:11.491
THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING AGAINST
THE SOMALI GOVERNMENT,

08:11.558 --> 08:13.326
OBVIOUSLY, FOR YEARS.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.595
NOW A LOT OF THESE ATTACKS IN
KENYA

08:15.662 --> 08:18.198
THEY SAY ARE IN RETALIATION FOR
KENYAN FORCES

08:18.264 --> 08:23.737
GOING IN AND TRYING TO HELP PUT
DOWN THAT INSURGENCY IN SOMALIA.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.739
SO IT'S REALLY HAD AN EFFECT

08:25.805 --> 08:28.208
THROUGHOUT A LOT OF KENYA
AS WELL.

08:28.274 --> 08:29.676
>> Larson: HEIDI VOGT OF THE
"WALL STREET JOURNAL"

08:29.743 --> 08:32.078
FROM KENYA, THANKS SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.647
>> THANK YOU.

08:34.714 --> 08:37.784
>> Larson: NEW REVELATIONS ABOUT
NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY DATA

08:37.851 --> 08:41.087
LEAKED BY FORMER NSA ANALYST
EDWARD SNOWDEN.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.989
IN AN ARTICLE PUBLISHED TODAY,

08:43.056 --> 08:45.225
THE "WASHINGTON POST"
SAID IT REVIEWED

08:45.291 --> 08:49.963
MORE THAN 160,000 EMAILS AND
INSTANT MESSAGE CONVERSATIONS,

08:50.029 --> 08:52.665
AND ANOTHER 8,000 DOCUMENTS
THAT WERE COLLECTED

08:52.732 --> 08:55.869
BETWEEN 2009 AND 2012.

08:55.935 --> 08:59.005
THE PAPER SAYS "ORDINARY
INTERNET USERS,

08:59.072 --> 09:00.974
"AMERICAN AND NON-AMERICAN
ALIKE,

09:01.040 --> 09:04.210
"FAR OUTNUMBER LEGALLY TARGETED
FOREIGNERS

09:04.277 --> 09:06.079
"IN THE COMMUNICATIONS
INTERCEPTED

09:06.146 --> 09:08.948
BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY
AGENCY."

09:09.015 --> 09:11.785
THE PAPER REPORTS THAT NEARLY
HALF OF THE FILES CONTAINED

09:11.851 --> 09:15.922
DETAILS THAT THE NSA IDENTIFIED
AS BEING FROM U.S. CITIZENS

09:15.989 --> 09:17.524
OR RESIDENTS.

09:17.590 --> 09:21.060
THE REPORT ALSO FOUND THAT SOME
OF THE COMMUNICATIONS CAPTURED

09:21.127 --> 09:25.298
BY THE NSA DID CONTAIN
SIGNIFICANT INTELLIGENCE VALUE,

09:25.365 --> 09:28.835
INCLUDING "A SECRET OVERSEAS
NUCLEAR PROJECT,

09:28.902 --> 09:31.571
"DOUBLE-DEALING BY
AN OSTENSIBLE ALLY,

09:31.638 --> 09:34.441
"AND THE IDENTITIES OF
AGGRESSIVE INTRUDERS

09:34.507 --> 09:37.310
"INTO U.S. COMPUTER NETWORKS."

09:37.377 --> 09:39.679
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TODAY
ANNOUNCED NEW RULES

09:39.746 --> 09:42.215
THAT WILL REQUIRE PASSENGERS
FLYING TO THE UNITED STATES

09:42.282 --> 09:45.618
FROM SOME OVERSEAS AIRPORTS TO
POWER UP THEIR PHONES

09:45.685 --> 09:47.887
AND LAPTOPS BEFORE BOARDING.

09:47.954 --> 09:51.024
THE MOVE COMES AMIDST GROWING
CONCERN THAT TERRORISTS

09:51.090 --> 09:53.293
ARE TRYING TO FASHION
NEW KINDS OF BOMBS,

09:53.359 --> 09:56.863
POSSIBLY DISGUISED
AS ELECTRONIC DEVICES.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.332
THE NATION'S DIRECTOR OF
HOMELAND SECURITY TALKED ABOUT

09:59.399 --> 10:01.968
THE DECISION TODAY ON
"MEET THE PRESS."

10:02.035 --> 10:04.938
>> WE KNOW THAT THERE REMAINS
A TERRORIST THREAT

10:05.004 --> 10:07.073
TO THE UNITED STATES AND
AVIATION SECURITY

10:07.140 --> 10:09.275
IS A LARGE PART OF THAT.

10:09.342 --> 10:12.679
>> Larson: IT CONTINUES TO BE AN
EXCEPTIONALLY VIOLENT WEEKEND

10:12.745 --> 10:14.180
IN CHICAGO.

10:14.247 --> 10:18.084
CITY OFFICIALS SAY FIVE PEOPLE
WERE KILLED, 11 WOUNDED,

10:18.151 --> 10:20.854
IN A SERIES OF SHOOTINGS
OVERNIGHT.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.122
AT LEAST 37 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
SHOT THERE

10:23.189 --> 10:25.492
SINCE THE START
OF THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND,

10:25.558 --> 10:28.228
INCLUDING FIVE SHOT BY POLICE.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.197
SCIENTISTS IN PENNSYLVANIA
BELIEVE CHEMICAL DISCHARGES

10:31.264 --> 10:35.168
ARE BEHIND THE DISCOVERY OF
WHAT'S CALLED "INTERSEX FISH"--

10:35.235 --> 10:37.036
MALE FISH CARRYING EGGS.

10:37.103 --> 10:39.806
RESEARCHERS SAY THAT FISH IN
THREE MAJOR RIVERS--

10:39.873 --> 10:42.075
THE OHIO, DELAWARE, AND
SUSQUEHANNA--

10:42.141 --> 10:43.443
HAVE BEEN AFFECTED.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.845
A RESEARCHER FOR THE U.S.
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY

10:45.912 --> 10:48.515
SAYS THE CHEMICALS
APPARENTLY COME FROM

10:48.581 --> 10:52.218
BOTH AGRICULTURAL PESTICIDES
AND SEWAGE DISCHARGES.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.920
AND A SIGN OF THE TIMES--

10:53.987 --> 10:56.523
THE LIBRARY AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF SOUTH FLORIDA

10:56.589 --> 10:59.492
HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL SOON
START LENDING OUT DRONES

10:59.559 --> 11:01.027
TO STUDENTS.

11:01.094 --> 11:04.197
IT'S BELIEVED TO BE A FIRST
ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES.

11:04.264 --> 11:07.166
A SCHOOL OFFICIAL SAID EACH OF
THE FIVE-POUND DRONES,

11:07.233 --> 11:09.335
THAT COME WITH A VIDEO CAMERA,

11:09.402 --> 11:12.705
WILL BE USED TO MAP THE CAMPUS
AS WELL AS FOR ENGINEERING

11:12.772 --> 11:14.807
AND MARINE SCIENCE PROJECTS.

11:14.874 --> 11:17.243
IN CASE YOU ARE WONDERING,
THE STUDENTS WILL BE WORKING

11:17.310 --> 11:20.613
UNDER THE SUPERVISION
OF FACULTY.

11:31.891 --> 11:34.694
AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER,
HARI SREENIVASAN WAS AT

11:34.761 --> 11:37.830
THE ASPEN IDEAS FESTIVAL
IN COLORADO THIS WEEK.

11:37.897 --> 11:39.933
WHILE THERE, HE HAD A
CONVERSATION ABOUT

11:39.999 --> 11:43.937
A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF INTERNET
PRIVACY-- OR THE LACK OF IT--

11:44.003 --> 11:46.873
ABOUT ALL THE INFORMATION
COMPANIES ARE GATHERING

11:46.940 --> 11:49.042
ABOUT YOU AND HOW THEY USE IT.

11:49.108 --> 11:51.644
HIS INTERVIEW WAS WITH JULIA
ANGWIN,

11:51.711 --> 11:54.881
A SENIOR REPORTER AT PROPUBLICA
AND THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK

11:54.948 --> 11:56.716
"DRAGNET NATION."

11:56.783 --> 11:59.452
>> POST EDWARD SNOWDEN, HAS THE
CONVERSATION CHANGED?

11:59.519 --> 12:02.121
ARE MORE PEOPLE AWARE NOW
IN THE LAST YEAR

12:02.188 --> 12:05.592
OF NOT JUST NSA AND THE DATA
THEY ARE GATHERING,

12:05.658 --> 12:08.595
BUT ALL THE DATA ABOUT THEM
THAT EXISTS?

12:08.661 --> 12:10.863
>> YEAH, I THINK PEOPLE
ARE MORE AWARE.

12:10.930 --> 12:14.267
IT STILL SURPRISES ME, THOUGH,
HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE NOT AWARE,

12:14.334 --> 12:17.036
SO IT IS NOT JUST THE NSA,
ALL THESE COMPANIES

12:17.103 --> 12:19.606
OR EVEN WHEN YOU GO TO A
SHOPPING MALL

12:19.672 --> 12:21.841
THEY MAY BE SETTING UP THE WIFI
SNIFFERS

12:21.908 --> 12:25.211
THAT SORT OF PING YOUR PHONE TO
SEE WHO IS WALKING BY.

12:25.278 --> 12:29.415
THE UBIQUITY OF SURVEILLANCE IS
REALLY HARD FOR PEOPLE TO GRASP.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.618
>> IN THE INVESTIGATIONS YOU
HAVE DONE,

12:31.684 --> 12:34.220
THERE'S TONS OF RESEARCH BEING
DONE ABOUT US

12:34.287 --> 12:35.755
AND DATA BEING GENERATED.

12:35.822 --> 12:40.059
WHAT ARE THE WAYS THAT OUR DATA
IS BEING USED BY COMPANIES

12:40.126 --> 12:41.861
IN WAYS THAT WE DON'T KNOW
ABOUT?

12:41.928 --> 12:44.130
>> I MEAN, IT RANGES ALL THE WAY
FROM TOTALLY INNOCUOUS

12:44.197 --> 12:46.032
TO REALLY CREEPY.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.034
ONE THING THAT I LIKE TO POINT
OUT IS THAT, YOU KNOW,

12:48.101 --> 12:49.702
SOMETHING THAT SEEMS REALLY
INNOCUOUS,

12:49.769 --> 12:51.938
LIKE ONLINE AD TRACKING-- YOU
KNOW, THE ADS FOLLOW YOU AROUND

12:52.005 --> 12:53.172
FROM SITE TO SITE.

12:53.239 --> 12:54.540
THEY'RE TAILORED TO YOUR
INTERESTS.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.177
EVEN THAT CAN BE DISTURBING IN
THE WRONG CONTEXT,

12:58.244 --> 12:59.746
ONE STORY I TELL IN MY BOOK

12:59.812 --> 13:02.215
IS ABOUT A WOMAN WHO WAS NOT OUT
TO HER COLLEAGUES

13:02.281 --> 13:03.850
ABOUT HER SEXUAL ORIENTATION,

13:03.916 --> 13:05.551
BUT WHEN THEY SAW HER LOOKING AT
HER COMPUTER SCREEN

13:05.618 --> 13:08.521
AND EVERY SINGLE AD WAS FOR GAY
AND LESBIAN CRUISES,

13:08.588 --> 13:10.523
YOU KNOW,
SUDDENLY SHE WAS OUTED.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.258
SO EVEN THE MOST INNOCUOUS OF
DATA GATHERING

13:12.325 --> 13:15.261
CAN HAVE STRANGE IMPACTS
THAT ARE HARD TO PREDICT.

13:15.328 --> 13:18.798
>> DO WE AS CONSUMERS HAVE
RIGHTS TO LOOK AT THE DATA

13:18.865 --> 13:21.534
THAT A COMMERCIAL COMPANY MIGHT
HAVE ON US

13:21.601 --> 13:23.736
AND THEN DISPUTE THAT IF
THAT'S WRONG?

13:23.803 --> 13:24.937
>> NO, WE DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT.

13:25.004 --> 13:26.539
SO WE ARE ONE OF THE ONLY
WESTERN NATIONS

13:26.606 --> 13:30.443
THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LAW THAT
ALLOWS US TO SEE THE DATA

13:30.510 --> 13:32.045
THAT COMMERCIAL DATA
GATHERERS HAVE.

13:32.111 --> 13:34.213
SO MOST COUNTRIES DON'T LET YOU
SEE THE INFORMATION

13:34.280 --> 13:36.549
THAT INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE,
OBVIOUSLY,

13:36.616 --> 13:39.185
BUT COMMERCIAL DATA GATHERERS
IN MOST COUNTRIES--

13:39.252 --> 13:42.321
CANADA, EUROPE, THE UK--
YOU CAN GO TO THEM AND SAY,

13:42.388 --> 13:43.623
"SHOW ME THE INFORMATION."

13:43.690 --> 13:44.957
AND IF IT IS WRONG YOU CAN
CORRECT IT

13:45.024 --> 13:46.325
OR ASK FOR CORRECTION.

13:46.392 --> 13:47.794
AND THERE'S SORT OF
A DISPUTE PROCESS.

13:47.860 --> 13:50.697
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT HERE,
SO I TRIED TO FIND

13:50.763 --> 13:54.067
WHERE MY DATA WAS, IDENTIFIED
200 DATA BROKERS,

13:54.133 --> 13:56.936
AND I WAS ONLY ABLE TO SEE MY
FILES AT 13 OF THEM.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.706
>> OF THOSE 13,
WERE THEY ALL ACCURATE?

13:59.772 --> 14:01.808
>> NO, SO THAT'S THE OTHER
THING, IS THE 13,

14:01.874 --> 14:05.044
THERE WERE PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE
OR SIX THAT WERE VERY ACCURATE.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.080
THEY WERE ADDRESSES OF
EVERYWHERE I EVER LIVED.

14:07.146 --> 14:09.148
THEY HAD EVEN... EVEN ONE OF
THEM HAD THE NUMBER

14:09.215 --> 14:11.184
ON MY DORM ROOM IN COLLEGE,
WHICH I HAD FORGOTTEN,

14:11.250 --> 14:14.787
AND EVERY PHONE NUMBER,
AND MY RELATIVES,

14:14.854 --> 14:15.722
AND ALL SORT OF THINGS.

14:15.788 --> 14:16.823
THEY WERE VERY ACCURATE.

14:16.889 --> 14:18.558
THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER CATEGORY,
THOUGH,

14:18.624 --> 14:21.527
OF PEOPLE WHO BASICALLY
PEGGED ME

14:21.594 --> 14:23.529
BECAUSE I LIVE IN HARLEM,
IN MANHATTAN,

14:23.596 --> 14:28.301
AS A LOW-INCOME SINGLE MOTHER
WITH VERY LOW EDUCATION LEVELS,

14:28.367 --> 14:29.702
AND THAT'S NOT TRUE.

14:29.769 --> 14:32.805
>> AND IS THIS DATA BEING
PROTECTED

14:32.872 --> 14:37.744
OR IS PRIVATE INFORMATION ABOUT
US BEING TRADED ALL AROUND US?

14:37.810 --> 14:39.846
>> OUR PRIVATE INFORMATION IS
BEING TRADED ALL AROUND US.

14:39.912 --> 14:43.883
SADLY IT HAS BECOME A COMMODITY
SO THE DATA BROKERS,

14:43.950 --> 14:46.419
FOR INSTANCE, BUY AND SELL FROM
EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME,

14:46.486 --> 14:48.221
AND TRADE INFORMATION,

14:48.287 --> 14:49.722
SO IF ONE OF THEM HAS MAYBE YOUR
VOTING FILES,

14:49.789 --> 14:51.724
BUT THE OTHER ONE HAS MAYBE
YOUR HUNTING LICENSE,

14:51.791 --> 14:54.727
THEY MAY BUY AND TRADE THAT
INFORMATION.

14:54.794 --> 14:57.396
AND SIMILARLY THE PEOPLE WHO
TRACK YOU ONLINE ON ADS

14:57.463 --> 14:59.298
THAT FOLLOW YOU AROUND
FROM SITE TO SITE,

14:59.365 --> 15:00.900
THEY ALSO TRADE INFORMATION
ABOUT YOU

15:00.967 --> 15:03.603
ON ACTUAL MARKETS LIKE THE NEW
YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.

15:03.669 --> 15:08.508
THERE ARE ACTUALLY INSTANT...
MILLISECOND LEVEL TRANSACTIONS.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.210
SO WHEN YOU ARRIVE AT A WEBSITE,
A LITTLE SIGNAL GOES OUT

15:11.277 --> 15:14.380
TO THE AUCTION, OH, THIS PERSON
HAS ARRIVED,

15:14.447 --> 15:15.414
WHO WANTS TO BID ON HIM?

15:15.481 --> 15:17.483
THERE IS LIKE A BIDDING IN
MILLISECONDS

15:17.550 --> 15:19.585
AND THEN YOU GET THE AD FOR
THE PERSON WHO BID THE MOST.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.254
>> SO WHAT'S OUR RECOURSE?

15:21.320 --> 15:24.690
WITH CREDIT REPORTS,
IF WE GET A BAD ONE,

15:24.757 --> 15:27.059
TECHNICALLY THERE IS A WAY FOR
US TO CHALLENGE IT

15:27.126 --> 15:28.728
OR FIND THE INFORMATION.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.696
BUT THAT IS A VERY
SPECIFIC SILO.

15:30.763 --> 15:31.931
>> RIGHT.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.533
>> YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
INFORMATION,

15:33.599 --> 15:35.902
ANYTHING FROM OUR HEALTHCARE
DATA TO OUR SHOPPING HISTORY.

15:35.968 --> 15:37.236
>> RIGHT.

15:37.303 --> 15:38.604
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE
A PERFECT SOLUTION

15:38.671 --> 15:40.206
BUT I WOULD SAY
THAT CREDIT REPORTS

15:40.273 --> 15:41.741
ARE A GOOD STARTING PLACE.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.310
BECAUSE THE TWO THINGS THAT WE
ARE GIVEN RIGHTS OVER

15:44.377 --> 15:46.712
WITH OUR CREDIT REPORT
IS WE GET TO SEE THEM

15:46.779 --> 15:48.047
AND WE GET TO DISPUTE THEM.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.216
AND THAT HAS BEEN THE BASELINE
FOR THE PRIVACY LAWS

15:50.283 --> 15:51.851
IN OTHER COUNTRIES
THAT I WAS MENTIONING

15:51.918 --> 15:53.553
THAT GIVE PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO
SEE THE DATA ABOUT THEM

15:53.619 --> 15:54.987
AND DISPUTE IT.

15:55.054 --> 15:56.923
AND IF THAT DATA IS BEING
USED TO MAKE A DECISION

15:56.989 --> 15:59.759
OF ANY SIGNIFICANCE,
I FEEL LIKE THE VERY MINIMUM

15:59.826 --> 16:02.695
THAT I WANT TO SEE IT
AND DISPUTE IT.

16:02.762 --> 16:05.464
SO THAT IS WHAT THE FTC AND THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

16:05.531 --> 16:08.668
HAVE BOTH CALLED FOR LEGISLATION
WHICH WOULD ALLOW THAT,

16:08.734 --> 16:11.504
WHICH IS BASICALLY THEY CALL IT
THE PRIVACY BILL OF RIGHTS.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.673
BUT THERE'S BEEN NO ACTION
IN CONGRESS ON THAT.

16:13.739 --> 16:14.907
>> JULIE ANGWIN,
THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.542
>> THANK YOU.

16:27.653 --> 16:31.357
>> Larson: OUR COLLEAGUES AT
PUBLIC TELEVISION STATION KVIE

16:31.424 --> 16:33.159
IN SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA,

16:33.226 --> 16:36.095
RECENTLY PRODUCED A DOCUMENTARY
ABOUT A DISEASE

16:36.162 --> 16:39.765
FOUND IN SEVEN SOUTHWESTERN AND
WESTERN STATES--

16:39.832 --> 16:43.236
A DISEASE THAT SCIENTISTS
AREN'T EVEN SURE HOW TO TREAT.

16:43.302 --> 16:46.405
IT'S CALLED VALLEY FEVER, AND
THE NUMBER OF DIAGNOSED CASES

16:46.472 --> 16:49.809
HAS RISEN DRAMATICALLY
IN THE PAST 15 YEARS.

16:49.876 --> 16:52.144
THIS EXCERPT IS FROM
THE DOCUMENTARY

16:52.211 --> 16:54.647
"DEADLY DUST--
VALLEY FEVER IN THE WEST."

16:54.714 --> 16:58.017
JASON SHOULTZ REPORTS.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.820
>> IT WAS THE VERY FIRST WEEKEND
OF MAY,

17:00.887 --> 17:05.191
AND SHE WOKE UP FROM HER SLEEP
JUST NOT FEELING GOOD.

17:05.258 --> 17:08.261
AND THEN SHE WAS
JUST REALLY TIRED

17:08.327 --> 17:12.064
AND SHE HAD A COUGH THAT
WOULDN'T GO AWAY.

17:12.131 --> 17:17.270
FINALLY, THERE WAS A DOCTOR
THAT SAID THIS ISN'T PNEUMONIA.

17:17.336 --> 17:20.539
BUT HE KNEW JUST BY LOOKING AT
THE SPOT ON THE X-RAY

17:20.606 --> 17:23.609
HE RECOGNIZED IT RIGHT AWAY
THAT IT WAS VALLEY FEVER.

17:23.676 --> 17:26.112
>> 40 PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO COME
DOWN WITH SYMPTOMS

17:26.178 --> 17:29.615
ARE ABLE TO KEEP THE FUNGUS
IN CHECK IN THEIR LUNGS.

17:29.682 --> 17:33.352
BUT FOR OTHERS, THE COCCI FUNGUS
DOES NOT STAY PUT.

17:33.419 --> 17:35.054
IT CAN SPREAD TO OTHER PARTS
OF THE BODY,

17:35.121 --> 17:37.256
CAUSING ANYTHING
FROM SKIN LESIONS

17:37.323 --> 17:40.393
TO SERIOUS JOINT PAIN OR WORSE.

17:40.459 --> 17:42.161
>> AND IF IT SPREADS,

17:42.228 --> 17:44.330
PARTICULARLY IF IT SPREADS TO
THE BRAINS OR THE MENINGES,

17:44.397 --> 17:48.334
THE COVER AROUND THE BRAIN,
THEN THAT IS A DISEASE

17:48.401 --> 17:51.270
THAT IS GOING TO HAVE HUGE
CONSEQUENCES

17:51.337 --> 17:53.539
FOR THAT PERSON
FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIFE.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.175
>> BUT VALLEY FEVER
IN ITS EARLY STAGES

17:56.242 --> 17:58.277
ISN'T ALWAYS TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

17:58.344 --> 18:03.015
EVEN IN COMMUNITIES IN ARIZONA
OR CALIFORNIA SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY

18:03.082 --> 18:08.087
WHERE THE FUNGUS IS FOUND
THROUGHOUT THE SOIL.

18:08.154 --> 18:09.956
>> WHAT THEY'VE HEARD IS JUST,
"OH, IT IS JUST LIKE THE FLU

18:10.022 --> 18:11.991
"AND YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN
FIGHT IT

18:12.058 --> 18:14.727
UNLESS YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM
IS LOW."

18:14.794 --> 18:15.962
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.731
THERE ARE VERY HEALTHY PEOPLE
WHO GET IT

18:18.798 --> 18:20.733
AND CAN'T FIGHT IT OFF.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.969
>> KATHY TERRELL'S BROTHER MAX
WAS A HEALTHY,

18:23.035 --> 18:26.238
ACTIVE 56-YEAR-OLD WHO
CONTRACTED VALLEY FEVER.

18:26.305 --> 18:28.841
IT WAS MISDIAGNOSED AS
TUBERCULOSIS

18:28.908 --> 18:31.043
AND SPREAD THROUGHOUT HIS BODY.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.145
HE DIED FIVE MONTHS LATER.

18:33.212 --> 18:36.682
>> I WOULD NOT WISH THIS DISEASE
ON ANYONE.

18:36.749 --> 18:39.852
>> FOR THOSE FEW PEOPLE THAT ARE
GOING TO GET SEVERE ILLNESS,

18:39.919 --> 18:42.788
THE FASTER THEY GET THE CORRECT
DIAGNOSIS,

18:42.855 --> 18:46.392
THEY HAVE THE BETTER CHANCE OF
HAVING A BETTER RECOVERY

18:46.459 --> 18:48.961
RATHER THAN A PROLONGED RECOVERY
IF IT TAKES TWO OR THREE MONTHS

18:49.028 --> 18:50.296
TO GET THE DIAGNOSIS.

18:50.363 --> 18:55.634
>> MISDIAGNOSIS IS JUST ONE OF
THE CHALLENGES OF VALLEY FEVER

18:55.701 --> 18:58.204
BECAUSE PEOPLE RESPOND SO
DIFFERENTLY TO THE DISEASE

18:58.270 --> 19:02.208
AND ANTI-FUNGAL DRUGS CAN HAVE
NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS,

19:02.274 --> 19:05.111
THERE IS ACTUALLY DISAGREEMENT
ON TREATMENT.

19:05.177 --> 19:07.046
>> WE TREAT BASICALLY ALMOST
EVERYONE,

19:07.113 --> 19:09.448
WHEREAS IN ARIZONA
THEY ARE MORE SELECTIVE.

19:09.515 --> 19:12.051
THEY TRY AND LOOK FOR PEOPLE
THAT SEEM TO HAVE RISK FACTORS

19:12.118 --> 19:15.888
FOR DOING POORLY BEFORE THEY
INITIATE THERAPY.

19:15.955 --> 19:23.763
WE DON'T HAVE DATA THAT PROVES
WHOSE APPROACH IS ACTUALLY BEST.

19:23.829 --> 19:28.167
>> WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF EARLY
TREATMENT ALTERS THE COURSE.

19:28.234 --> 19:29.702
WE HAVE LONG SPECULATED THAT,
BUT IT'S NEVER BEEN PROVEN

19:29.769 --> 19:31.437
IN A RANDOMIZED TRIAL
THE WAY WE KNOW

19:31.504 --> 19:33.639
THAT BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA
RESPONDS TO ANTIBIOTICS.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.775
PATIENTS GET BETTER FASTER.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.943
FOR COCCI, SOME PEOPLE THINK
THAT EARLY TREATMENT

19:38.010 --> 19:40.046
ACTUALLY MAY ALTER THE IMMUNE
RESPONSE ENOUGH

19:40.112 --> 19:42.481
THAT SYMPTOMS ARE PROLONGED.

19:42.548 --> 19:45.551
>> ATTENTION IN RESEARCH FUNDING
GIVEN TO VALLEY FEVER

19:45.618 --> 19:49.388
PALES IN COMPARISON TO OTHER
HIGH PROFILE DISEASES.

19:49.455 --> 19:52.258
FROM 1999 TO 2012,

19:52.324 --> 19:55.961
THERE WERE ABOUT 37,000 WEST
NILE VIRUS CASES,

19:56.028 --> 20:00.766
BUT IN ONE YEAR ALONE-- 2011--
THERE WERE 22,000 REPORTED CASES

20:00.833 --> 20:04.303
OF VALLEY FEVER, ALMOST
TWO-THIRDS AS MANY.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.206
DESPITE THAT, THE NATIONAL
INSTITUTES OF HEALTH FUNDING

20:07.273 --> 20:12.445
FOR VALLEY FEVER RESEARCH IS
JUST FOUR PERCENT OF WEST NILE.

20:12.511 --> 20:13.813
BECAUSE THERE IS NO CURE,

20:13.879 --> 20:16.916
PATIENTS WHO HAVE SURVIVED
VALLEY FEVER END UP

20:16.982 --> 20:19.385
REGULARLY TAKING ANTI-FUNGAL
MEDICATIONS

20:19.452 --> 20:22.455
TO PREVENT IT FROM SPREADING
AGAIN.

20:22.521 --> 20:25.157
>> I SAY IT SWELLED
LIKE A WATERMELON.

20:25.224 --> 20:29.028
>> THE COCCI FUNGUS ATTACKED
JACK MILLER'S ANKLE IN 2004.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.864
JACK DIDN'T EVEN LIVE IN THE
ENDEMIC VALLEY FEVER AREA

20:31.931 --> 20:34.166
WHEN HE CAUGHT THE DISEASE.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.168
IT TURNS OUT HE BREATHED IN THE
SPORES

20:36.235 --> 20:39.572
WHILE SIMPLY DRIVING THROUGH
THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.

20:39.638 --> 20:41.841
>> WINDOW HALFWAY CRACKED
OR WHATEVER,

20:41.907 --> 20:44.310
YOU CAN'T FILTER OUT A SPORE.

20:44.376 --> 20:46.011
IT'S GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GET
UP IN THE AIR

20:46.078 --> 20:50.816
AND FIND ITS WAY TO MY NOSE
OR NOSTRILS, YOU KNOW.

20:50.883 --> 20:54.120
>> A DECADE AFTER THAT FATEFUL
BREATH IN THE CAB OF HIS TRUCK,

20:54.186 --> 20:58.390
JACK NOW DRIVES 1,700 MILES
ROUND-TRIP FROM IDAHO

20:58.457 --> 21:00.459
TO UC DAVIS MEDICAL CENTER

21:00.526 --> 21:03.629
SEVERAL TIMES EACH YEAR
FOR TREATMENT.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.464
HE WILL TAKE ANTI-FUNGAL
MEDICATION

21:05.531 --> 21:07.900
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

21:07.967 --> 21:11.504
>> I AM FORTUNATE THAT MY
EMPLOYER COVERS THE COST

21:11.570 --> 21:14.440
OF MY MEDICINE,
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,

21:14.507 --> 21:18.010
I THINK IT'S ABOUT $3,500,
$4,000 A MONTH.

21:18.077 --> 21:21.313
THE MEDICINE I'M ON, THEY JUST
GO AHEAD AND KEEP IT SQUASHED.

21:21.380 --> 21:24.383
>> MY DREAM WOULD BE IF YOU WALK
IN THE DOOR WITH PNEUMONIA

21:24.450 --> 21:27.786
OR EVEN JUST WITH FEVER
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS,

21:27.853 --> 21:29.355
YOU ARE NOT QUITE SURE
WHAT IT IS,

21:29.421 --> 21:31.590
THAT THERE IS A SIMPLE,
INEXPENSIVE TEST

21:31.657 --> 21:35.060
THAT WILL SAY, OKAY, YOU HAVE
GOT VALLEY FEVER, YOU DON'T.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.863
WE DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.698
>> Larson: VALLEY FEVER ALSO
RUNS RAMPANT

21:39.765 --> 21:43.502
INSIDE SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S SAN
JOAQUIN VALLEY PRISONS.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.638
THE DISEASE HAS BEEN BLAMED FOR
THE DEATHS OF DOZENS

21:45.704 --> 21:49.074
OF PRISONERS
AND SOME PRISON STAFF.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.244
CALIFORNIA SPENDS ABOUT $23
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

21:52.311 --> 21:55.714
CARING FOR PRISONERS
WITH VALLEY FEVER.

DOCUMENTARY

VISIT NEWSHOUR.PBS.ORG.

22:10.496 --> 22:18.170
>> THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND,
SUNDAY.

22:18.237 --> 22:19.605
>> Larson:
AN OPERA THAT IS OPENING

22:19.672 --> 22:21.473
AT THE LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL
IN NEW YORK ON THURSDAY

22:21.540 --> 22:24.944
HAD ITS U.S. PREMIERE AT THE
HOUSTON GRAND OPERA

22:25.010 --> 22:27.446
THIS PAST JANUARY, WHERE OUR
SISTER STATION,

22:27.513 --> 22:30.115
HOUSTON PUBLIC MEDIA,
SPOKE WITH SOME OF THE PEOPLE

22:30.182 --> 22:31.917
INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.852
IT'S CALLED "THE PASSENGER"

22:33.919 --> 22:37.223
AND IT'S BASED ON A RADIO PLAY
AND NOVEL OF THE SAME NAME

22:37.289 --> 22:40.960
BY A CONCENTRATION CAMP
SURVIVOR, ZOFIA POSMYSZ.

22:41.026 --> 22:46.832
THE OPERA TELLS THE STORY OF TWO
WOMEN DURING THE HOLOCAUST...

22:46.899 --> 22:52.838
ONE, A PRISONER AT AUSCHWITZ;
THE OTHER, HER SS OVERSEER.

22:52.905 --> 22:56.242
>> IT'S INTERESTING THAT ZOFIA
POSMYSZ HERSELF SAID

22:56.308 --> 22:58.811
WHEN SHE FIRST HEARD THE OPERA
THAT SHE DIDN'T THINK

22:58.877 --> 23:03.182
ANYONE COULD EVER CAPTURE
THE EXPERIENCE OF WHAT,

23:03.249 --> 23:06.418
NOT A DAY IN AUSCHWITZ WAS LIKE,

23:06.485 --> 23:09.421
BUT WHAT 15 MINUTES IN AUSCHWITZ
WAS LIKE.

23:09.488 --> 23:14.126
SHE SAID YOU DIDN'T TRY TO THINK
ABOUT SURVIVING FOR A DAY.

23:14.193 --> 23:17.796
YOU TRIED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO
GET THROUGH THE NEXT 15 MINUTES.

23:17.863 --> 23:22.668
>> THE FACT THAT WHAT YOU'RE
WITNESSING IS A HUMAN STORY

23:22.735 --> 23:26.572
ABOUT TWO YOUNG GIRLS,
AND THESE GIRLS SHOULD HAVE MET

23:26.639 --> 23:30.109
IN A UNIVERSITY CANTEEN AND
SQUABBLED ABOUT A BOYFRIEND

23:30.175 --> 23:33.145
AND HELPED ONE ANOTHER WITH
THEIR ESSAY,

23:33.212 --> 23:34.880
BUT THIS UNIVERSITY IS CALLED
AUSCHWITZ

23:34.947 --> 23:36.448
AND ONE IS ON ONE SIDE
OF THE LINE

23:36.515 --> 23:41.920
AND THE OTHER'S ON THE OTHER,
EVEN THIS HELL IS A HUMAN STORY.

23:41.987 --> 23:43.989
IT'S A STORY ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS.

23:44.056 --> 23:47.893
>> I CANNOT BEAR THIS
SEPARATION.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.496
I DREAM CONSTANTLY OF YOU.

23:50.562 --> 23:53.165
>> IT DOESN'T ASK US TO TELL
EACH OTHER WHY

23:53.232 --> 23:55.601
OR HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?

23:55.668 --> 24:00.072
ALL IT ASKS OF US IS THAT WE
REMEMBER THAT THIS HAPPENED.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.674
ONE QUESTION.

24:01.740 --> 24:03.575
ONE-ONE THING.

24:03.642 --> 24:04.910
ONE DEMAND.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.979
REMEMBER.

24:17.389 --> 24:19.925
>> Larson: SOME LATE NEWS BEFORE
WE LEAVE YOU TONIGHT.

24:19.992 --> 24:22.361
A PROMINENT HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER
IN SAUDI ARABIA

24:22.428 --> 24:25.497
WAS SENTENCED TODAY TO 15 YEARS
IN PRISON.

24:25.564 --> 24:28.667
HE WAS TRIED FOR SEDITION
FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

24:28.734 --> 24:31.970
SHOWING DISRESPECT TOWARD
AUTHORITIES.

24:32.037 --> 24:35.107
AUTHORITIES IN CALIFORNIA SAY
A WILDFIRE THAT BURNED

24:35.174 --> 24:37.643
MORE THAN 4,000 ACRES
IN NAPA COUNTY

24:37.710 --> 24:40.279
IS NOW 80 PERCENT CONTAINED.

24:40.346 --> 24:43.449
AND FORMER U.S. SENATOR ALAN
DIXON HAS DIED.

24:43.515 --> 24:46.118
THE ILLINOIS DEMOCRAT WAS 86.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.287
JOIN US ON AIR AND ONLINE
TOMORROW.

24:48.354 --> 24:49.688
I AM JOHN LARSON.

24:49.755 --> 24:50.889
GOOD NIGHT.
