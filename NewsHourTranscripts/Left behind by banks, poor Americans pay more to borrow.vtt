Now Hari Sreenivasan takes a
broader look
at the problems lower-income
Americans face

00:05.639 --> 00:07.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when it comes to getting the
money they need.

00:07.975 --> 00:13.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: South Dakota
isn't the only
place where payday loans are
such a big problem.

00:13.347 --> 00:18.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While a few states have banned
or imposed
strict regulations on these
fringe lenders,

00:18.185 --> 00:23.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're ubiquitous in most of
the country.
In fact, there are more payday
lending storefronts

00:23.624 --> 00:27.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than there are Starbucks and
McDonald's combined.

00:27.194 --> 00:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In her book "How the Other Half
Banks," Mehrsa
Baradaran explores the booming
industry providing

00:32.799 --> 00:39.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
financial services to the poor
at exorbitant
costs and offers some more
equitable solutions.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

00:41.208 --> 00:45.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, why -- where is this gap
created? And
why isn't there an incentive for
all banks

00:45.779 --> 00:47.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to reach out to all people with
money?

00:47.514 --> 00:49.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEHRSA BARADARAN, Author, "How
the Other Half
Banks": The gap is fairly new.

00:49.449 --> 00:54.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, starting in the 1980s, a lot
of community
banks started shutting down
branches in lower-income

00:54.521 --> 00:59.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
areas, inner-city neighborhoods,
areas where
their profit margins were lower
than in other

00:59.159 --> 01:05.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
areas. And so part of it is,
it's higher cost
to lend to someone or to take a
small deposit

01:05.399 --> 01:10.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than it is to get a big deposit.
Right? Your
overhead is the same whether
you're, you know,

01:10.637 --> 01:18.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking in $100,000 vs. taking in
$500, but
your revenue off of that
$100,000 is much

01:18.178 --> 01:20.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
higher than it is off of that
small deposit.

01:20.714 --> 01:25.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so these banks started
leaving these areas.
And part of it is that the
government deregulatory

01:26.019 --> 01:30.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces allowed them to merge and
form these
huge conglomerates such as Bank
of America.

01:30.590 --> 01:35.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as these banks leave, they
leave this
void for banking service. And
this is a void

01:35.429 --> 01:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that quickly is filled by these
fringe lenders,
so payday loans, check cashing.

01:40.167 --> 01:43.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, when you
go through
certain cities, just like there
are food deserts

01:43.437 --> 01:46.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where you don't have a grocery
store, it seems
like there are almost bank
deserts, where

01:46.673 --> 01:49.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's populated primarily with
these lenders
that you're talking about.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much money is there to be
made?

01:51.678 --> 01:57.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEHRSA BARADARAN: It's an $89
billion industry
yearly. And it doesn't seem that
way.

01:57.617 --> 02:01.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you go into these
neighborhoods,
these check cashers or payday
lenders, they

02:01.188 --> 02:07.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seem like neighborhood joints.
But they're
really sort of multinational
corporations.

02:07.594 --> 02:10.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're large, very profitable
organizations.

02:10.464 --> 02:15.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have this, what I call
a facade of
informality, right? So it seems
as though,

02:15.402 --> 02:19.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look, they speak your language.
They're in
your neighborhood, but, really,
behind them,

02:19.072 --> 02:23.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there is a lot of bank
financing. These are
very sort of corporate, big, big
firms.

02:23.210 --> 02:27.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: These
companies are going
to say, look, I'm taking a
greater risk. This

02:27.547 --> 02:31.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a person that is not as
creditworthy as
someone who maybe walks into a
Bank of America

02:32.019 --> 02:37.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a much larger amount of
assets, right,
so shouldn't I be able to charge
a higher

02:37.224 --> 02:39.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interest rate to get them this
money fast?

02:39.326 --> 02:43.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MEHRSA BARADARAN: It is
certainly a higher
risk to lend to someone who's
low-income.

02:43.563 --> 02:47.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, there's a lot of
studies to show
that the price that they're
actually charging

02:47.801 --> 02:52.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
isn't the cost of the loan. It's
also fairly
misleading when you compare it
to the credit

02:52.672 --> 02:56.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
markets that the middle class
and higher income
have access to.

02:56.343 --> 03:02.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the big points of the
book is,
even assuming that this is a
market price

03:02.149 --> 03:06.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they're charging and it is
the cost of
credit because of the risks and
the defaults,

03:06.753 --> 03:11.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
et cetera, the rest of us don't
pay market
prices for credit.

03:11.792 --> 03:16.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The credit markets, whether it's
for our mortgages,
our student loans, any sort of
bank credit

03:16.296 --> 03:18.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you get is heavily subsidized by
the federal
government.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The book is
called "How
the Other Half Banks."

03:21.268 --> 03:22.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mehrsa Baradaran, thanks so much
for joining
us.

03:22.769 --> 03:22.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEHRSA BARADARAN: Thank you.
