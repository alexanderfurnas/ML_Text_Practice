MISSILE LAUNCH IS ABSOLUTELY

01:40.267 --> 01:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTOLERABLE.

01:41.933 --> 01:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ADVISER STEPHEN MILLER SAID

01:57.400 --> 01:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICAN SECURITY PARTNERS IN

01:58.600 --> 02:01.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASIA ARE CRITICAL.

02:01.767 --> 02:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE MESSAGE IS THAT WE ARE

02:02.967 --> 02:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO REINFORCE AND

02:03.900 --> 02:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRENGTHEN OUR VITAL ALLIANCES

02:05.033 --> 02:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE PACIFIC REGION AS PART OF

02:06.533 --> 02:08.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR STRATEGY TO DETER AND

02:08.667 --> 02:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREVENT THE INCREASING HOSTILITY

02:11.433 --> 02:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS

02:12.833 --> 02:15.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME.

02:15.967 --> 02:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THE SENATE'S

02:16.733 --> 02:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC MINORITY LEADER SAID

02:17.733 --> 02:19.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TODAY-- THE U.S. SHOULD CALL ON

02:19.067 --> 02:19.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHINA TO KEEP NORTH KOREA IN

02:19.767 --> 02:24.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LINE.

02:24.067 --> 02:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMICALLY-- 90% OF IMPORTS

02:24.900 --> 02:26.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND EXPORTS GO THROUGH CHINA,

02:26.167 --> 02:26.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO TELL THE

02:26.967 --> 02:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHINESE THAT THEY HAVE TO PUT

02:28.167 --> 02:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WOOD TO NORTH KOREA IN A

02:30.300 --> 02:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH MORE SERIOUS WAY THAN

02:31.200 --> 02:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE DONE SO FAR.

02:33.733 --> 02:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: TO DISCUSS THE

02:34.933 --> 02:36.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPLICATIONS OF NORTH KOREA'S

02:36.067 --> 02:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LATEST MISSILE TEST, I'M JOINED

02:37.233 --> 02:38.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM WASHINGTON BY JOHN

WOLFSTHALL, A FELLOW AT HARVARD

02:39.467 --> 02:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNIVERSITY AND A FORMER SPECIAL

02:40.567 --> 02:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT OBAMA.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, FIRST, HOW SIGNIFICANT WAS

02:47.233 --> 02:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS TEST, THIS PROVOCATION?

02:49.200 --> 02:51.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I DON'T VIEW THIS ONE TEST AS

02:51.167 --> 02:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A MAJOR CHANGE IN NORTH KOREA'S

02:53.500 --> 02:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAPABILITIES.

02:54.500 --> 02:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS PART OF A SERIES OF

02:55.633 --> 02:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TESTS THAT NORTH KOREA'S BEEN

02:57.100 --> 02:58.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PURSUING FOR MANY YEARS.

02:58.367 --> 02:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THEY'RE SEEKING TO DO IS

02:59.733 --> 03:03.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVELOP A RELIABLE RANGE OF

03:03.067 --> 03:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MISSILE DELIVERY SYSTEMS THAT

03:03.933 --> 03:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN CAN DELIVER NUCLEAR WEAPONS

03:05.233 --> 03:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL OVER THE REGION, AND

03:06.400 --> 03:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVENTUALLY TO THE UNITED STATES.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT TAKES A LOT OF TESTS.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I DON'T THINK THIS ONE TEST

03:10.200 --> 03:11.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS A MAJOR ELEVATION OF THEIR

03:11.467 --> 03:12.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAPABILITY.

03:12.167 --> 03:13.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT'S ANOTHER STEP IN THE

03:13.667 --> 03:14.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WRONG DIRECTION.

03:14.167 --> 03:14.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT'S THE

03:14.967 --> 03:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORLD TO DO HERE?

03:15.633 --> 03:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, I JUST RETWEETED A NOTE

03:17.600 --> 03:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL.

03:20.967 --> 03:25.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SAYS:

03:25.967 --> 03:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BESIDES STRONG CONDEMNATION WHAT

03:28.033 --> 03:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN THE WORLD DO?

03:28.900 --> 03:30.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS WE

03:30.967 --> 03:32.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE LOTS OF OPTIONS.

03:32.267 --> 03:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BAD NEWS IS THEY'RE ALL

03:33.900 --> 03:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY POOR OPTIONS.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE CAN EITHER SQUEEZE AND

03:37.000 --> 03:38.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESSURE NORTH KOREA, TRY TO

03:38.467 --> 03:39.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIGHTEN SANCTIONS BY WORKING

03:39.567 --> 03:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH CHINA AND THE INTERNATIONAL

03:40.733 --> 03:41.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITY, IN THE HOPES THAT

03:41.767 --> 03:43.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'LL GIVE UP THEIR PROGRAMS

03:43.167 --> 03:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR NEGOTIATE THEM AWAY.

03:44.033 --> 03:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR WE CAN PREPARE OURSELVES

03:46.433 --> 03:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARILY TO SHOOT DOWN

03:47.533 --> 03:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MISSILES, WHICH IS AN IMPERFECT

03:49.800 --> 03:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCIENCE, AT BEST, AND TO DEFEND

03:51.200 --> 03:52.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND PROTECT OUR ALLIES.

03:52.367 --> 03:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK WHAT WE'LL END UP DOING

03:54.100 --> 03:55.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS PROBABLY A COMBINATION OF

03:55.167 --> 03:55.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOTH.

03:55.767 --> 03:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT SOUTH

03:58.500 --> 04:00.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CORIA AND JAPAN ARE WITH US.

04:00.667 --> 04:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE NEED TO KEEP CHINA ON POINT

04:03.200 --> 04:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND PRESSURING NORTH KOREA TO

04:04.800 --> 04:05.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STOP THESE DANGEROUS ACTIONS,

04:05.667 --> 04:07.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE NEED TO PREPARE OURSELVES

MILITARILY IN THE INEVITABLE

04:08.467 --> 04:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASE THAT NORTH KOREA IS JUST

04:09.500 --> 04:12.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO KEEP MARCHING FORWARD.

04:12.467 --> 04:13.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: PRIME MINISTER

04:13.367 --> 04:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE A

04:15.333 --> 04:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PHOTO-OP YESTERDAY EVENING WHERE

04:17.300 --> 04:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY SOLIDIFIED THEIR ALLEGIANCE

04:19.300 --> 04:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO ONE ANOTHER, THAT THE UNITED

04:20.533 --> 04:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES STANDS WITH JAPAN.

04:22.867 --> 04:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOUTH KOREA, RIGHT ON THE

04:23.733 --> 04:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BORDER, HAS A LOT MORE TO LOSE.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH ON OUR

04:28.333 --> 04:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLIANCE, OR AT LEAST OUR

04:29.333 --> 04:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTEREST TO SUPPORT THE SOUTH

04:30.500 --> 04:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT NOW.

04:31.600 --> 04:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S TRUE.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THAT WAS AN

04:33.800 --> 04:34.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVERSIGHT BY THE PRESIDENT.

04:34.567 --> 04:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T THINK IT WAS

04:35.967 --> 04:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTENTIONAL.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR SECRETARY OF DEFENSE,

04:38.200 --> 04:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTIS, WAS JUST IN SOUTH KOREA

04:40.433 --> 04:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MADE CLEAR THAT WE WILL

04:42.200 --> 04:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEFEND SOUTH KOREA WITH

04:42.800 --> 04:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYTHING WE HAVE, IF

04:43.900 --> 04:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NECESSARY.

04:44.500 --> 04:45.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK GENERALLY SPEAK THE

04:45.867 --> 04:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLIANCE IS RELATIVELY STRONG.

04:47.233 --> 04:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THIS IS PART OF THE LEARNING

04:48.833 --> 04:50.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CURVE THAT EVERY NEW PRESIDENT

04:50.267 --> 04:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS.

04:50.900 --> 04:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE

04:53.100 --> 04:55.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCLUSIVE OF ALL OF OUR ALLIES,

04:55.367 --> 04:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT YOU DON'T LEAVE ANY GAPS SO

04:57.733 --> 04:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS THAT THERE'S NO ROOM FOR

04:58.833 --> 05:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORTH KOREA TO TRY TO SEPARATE

05:01.200 --> 05:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNITED STATES FROM ITS

05:02.400 --> 05:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY INTERESTS IN THE

05:03.400 --> 05:03.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGION.

05:03.767 --> 05:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHY ARE WE

05:04.933 --> 05:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE OR AT THIS POINT?

05:07.400 --> 05:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSIDERING THAT YOU WERE AT THE

05:08.500 --> 05:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBAMA WHITE HOUSE, AND YOU

05:09.167 --> 05:10.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKED ON THESE ISSUES.

05:10.267 --> 05:12.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WAS THE STUMBLING BLOCK?

05:12.067 --> 05:13.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY COULDN'T WE GET NORTH KOREA

05:13.767 --> 05:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO AT LEAST ROLL BACK TOWARDS

05:17.300 --> 05:18.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISARMAMENT?

05:18.267 --> 05:19.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I THINK THERE ARE A

05:19.267 --> 05:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBER OF CHALLENGES.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN

05:22.333 --> 05:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERPLEXING ADMINISTRATIONS SINCE

05:23.533 --> 05:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LATE 1980s.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I SPENT TIME IN NORTH KOREA IN

05:27.433 --> 05:28.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE 1990s, WHEN THEIR NUCLEAR

05:28.867 --> 05:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROGRAM WAS FROZEN UNDER

05:30.200 --> 05:30.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT CLINTON.

05:30.967 --> 05:32.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MAJOR CHALLENGE IS RIGHT NOW

05:32.067 --> 05:33.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHINA VIEWS A COLLAPSE OF NORTH

05:33.067 --> 05:35.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KOREA AS A GREATER THREAT THAN

05:35.867 --> 05:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DO A NUCLEAR NORTH KOREA.

05:37.733 --> 05:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND UNTIL THAT CALCULATION

05:39.633 --> 05:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGES, CHINA IS NEVER GOING TO

05:41.167 --> 05:42.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUT THE TYPE OF PRESSURE ON

05:42.267 --> 05:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORTH KOREA NEEDED TO GINS THEM

05:43.700 --> 05:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GIVE UP THEIR NEARLY MISSILE

05:45.800 --> 05:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAPABILITIES.

05:46.933 --> 05:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND RIGHT NOW, KIM JONG-UN, THE

05:49.733 --> 05:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIVELY UNTESTED LEADER OF

05:50.933 --> 05:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORTH KOREA, VIEWS THEM AS THE

05:52.100 --> 05:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCEPT THOR OF POWER, THAT IF HE

05:54.100 --> 05:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIVES THOSE UP, HIS CHANCES OF

05:55.900 --> 05:56.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURVIVAL ARE EXTREMELY LIMITED

05:56.867 --> 05:58.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HE'S GOING TO HOLD ON TO THEM

05:58.567 --> 05:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS TIGHTLY AS HE CAN.

05:59.833 --> 06:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WOULD THEY

06:00.800 --> 06:02.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY RESPOND OR WOULD THEY

06:02.667 --> 06:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEEL THE IMPACT OF, SAY, GREATER

06:04.733 --> 06:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SANCTIONS, PLACED ON THEM BY THE

06:05.700 --> 06:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORLD COMMUNITY?

06:06.500 --> 06:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I THINK THEY ALREADY

06:08.033 --> 06:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE FEELING TIGHT SANCTIONS

06:09.700 --> 06:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDER THE PREVIOUS

06:10.300 --> 06:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION WHERE I WORKED.

06:11.433 --> 06:12.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE WERE ABLE TO SEVERELY

06:12.967 --> 06:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTRAIN FINANCIAL FLOWS, THE

06:14.033 --> 06:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLOW OF COAL INTO NORTH KOREA,

06:16.500 --> 06:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS A NEEDED COMMODITY.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK THERE IS AN

06:19.233 --> 06:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY CONTRADICT

06:21.833 --> 06:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTRICT THE ECONOMIC FLOW

06:24.233 --> 06:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO THE NORTH.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT AS I SAID, THE PROBLEM IS

06:26.667 --> 06:28.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNTIL CHINA BELIEVES THAT A

06:28.267 --> 06:30.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLLAPSE OF NORTH KOREA IS IN

06:30.067 --> 06:31.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ITS INTEREST, THEY'RE NOT GOING

06:31.267 --> 06:33.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO SQUEEZE THEM TIGHTLY ENOUGH.

06:33.167 --> 06:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, JON

WHAT'S GOING TO BE ON THE PLATE,

09:11.633 --> 09:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

MINISTER FOR THIS MEETING?

09:15.333 --> 09:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:19.567 --> 09:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DOWN HIS MOST SENIOR AIDES TO

MOST SENIOR PEOPLE IN THE NEW

ADMINISTRATION.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, THE TWO MEN COULDN'T

09:31.967 --> 09:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE MORE UNALIKE IN MANY

09:35.100 --> 09:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPECTS.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUDEAU CONSTANTLY DESCRIBES

09:36.867 --> 09:38.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIMSELF AS BEING A FEMINIST.

09:38.767 --> 09:40.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S A CHAMPION OF OPEN

09:40.867 --> 09:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMIGRATION.

09:41.867 --> 09:43.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS FIRST MOVE WAS TO BRING MORE

09:43.567 --> 09:45.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYRIAN REFUGEES INTO CANADA.

09:45.867 --> 09:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEY'VE DECIDE THAT THEY'VE

09:47.467 --> 09:49.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOT TO MAKE NICE WITH THIS

09:49.267 --> 09:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THERE'S

09:51.233 --> 09:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST-- JUST TOO MUCH AT STAKE.

09:52.200 --> 09:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU KNOW, I

09:52.933 --> 09:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REMEMBER THE TWEET THAT I'M

09:55.000 --> 10:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINDING HERE:

10:00.733 --> 10:02.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS IN RESPONSE TO THE

10:02.267 --> 10:03.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXECUTIVE ORDER ON IMMIGRATION

10:03.867 --> 10:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT TRUMP HAD PUT OUT.

10:06.200 --> 10:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES.

10:06.833 --> 10:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT, AGAIN, ALL THOSE RESPONSES

10:08.933 --> 10:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN VERY CAREFUL NOT TO

10:11.333 --> 10:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRITICIZE TRUMP.

10:12.233 --> 10:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUDEAU WILL STATE WHAT CANADA'S

10:13.933 --> 10:16.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VALUES ARE, BUT HE WON'T BE

10:16.067 --> 10:17.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DRAWN OUT AS NEWS CONFERENCES.

10:17.667 --> 10:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE JUST DID A SORT OF NATIONWIDE

10:21.333 --> 10:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOUR WHERE HE'S DOING TOWN

10:23.833 --> 10:24.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HALLS.

10:24.267 --> 10:25.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S JUST WRAPPING UP IN THE

10:25.667 --> 10:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARCTIC.

10:26.433 --> 10:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S NEVER DRAWN OUT WHEN PEOPLE

10:27.733 --> 10:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASK HIM QUESTIONS ABOUT TRUMP.

10:28.933 --> 10:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE DECIDED, I THINK, THAT

10:30.200 --> 10:31.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY AND MAKE

10:31.167 --> 10:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICE.

10:31.733 --> 10:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO POKE

10:33.700 --> 10:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MR. TRUMP IN THE EYE, BUT IF

10:35.533 --> 10:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MR. TRUMP PUNCHES CANADA,

10:36.500 --> 10:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE GOING TO PUNCH BACK.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU KNOW,

10:39.100 --> 10:40.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEAKING OF PUNCHING, THE BIG

10:40.667 --> 10:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE IS

10:42.200 --> 10:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INTEREST IN

10:44.633 --> 10:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RENEGOTIATE, NAFTA.

10:47.033 --> 10:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANADA IS WHAT $670 BILLION

10:49.400 --> 10:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRADING PARTNER.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DOES CANADA WALK INTO THIS

10:53.033 --> 10:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATION AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT,

10:54.500 --> 10:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERHAPS, IF THERE IS A WAY TO

10:55.500 --> 10:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEGOTIATE A BETTER DEAL?

10:56.367 --> 10:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> CANADA'S GOT ITS OWN

10:58.633 --> 11:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLAINTS ABOUT NAFTA.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO TRUDEAU'S RESPONSE HAS BEEN

11:02.000 --> 11:02.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY WELCOME THE

11:02.867 --> 11:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPORTUNITY TO RENEGOTIATE IT.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, WE'LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT

11:07.033 --> 11:08.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORM IT TAKES.

11:08.867 --> 11:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NAFTA HAS, BY SOME COUNTS, BEEN

11:11.200 --> 11:13.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALREADY HAD 11 MAJOR CHANGES

11:13.467 --> 11:14.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE TO IT OVER THE COURSE OF

11:14.667 --> 11:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ITS HISTORY.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THIS ISN'T PARTICULARLY NEW.

11:17.533 --> 11:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ONE TRICKY ISSUE TRUDEAU IS

11:20.333 --> 11:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO FACE IS IF TRUMP'S CALL

11:22.533 --> 11:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT NAFTA IS MOSTLY ONE

11:25.200 --> 11:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIRECTED AT MEXICO, AND THE

11:27.433 --> 11:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNALS PUT OUT THAT THEY'LL

11:28.833 --> 11:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAVE CANADA ALONE, DO THEY SELL

11:30.433 --> 11:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEXICO DOWN THE RIVER?

11:32.533 --> 11:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, THEY'LL BE IN A VERY,

11:34.933 --> 11:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY TIGHT SPOT THERE, BECAUSE

11:36.200 --> 11:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRADE WITH THE UNITED STATES IS

11:38.233 --> 11:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF CANADA'S

11:39.833 --> 11:40.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMY.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE

11:42.100 --> 11:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESSURE BEING PUT ON PRIME

11:44.900 --> 11:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINISTER TRUDEAU FROM DIFFERENT

11:46.200 --> 11:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WINGS OF HIS PARTY TO PERHAPS

11:48.200 --> 11:49.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STAND UP TO TRUMP FOR CANADIAN

11:49.767 --> 11:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VALUES THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT

11:51.033 --> 11:51.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN DONALD TRUMP'S VISION OF

11:51.967 --> 11:53.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WORLD, AND AT THE SAME TIME,

11:53.867 --> 11:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO MAKE NICE AND MAKE SURE THAT

11:55.133 --> 11:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

11:56.233 --> 11:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIONSHIP THAT NEEDS TO GET

11:57.400 --> 11:59.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALONG AND DON'T POKE THE BEAR?

11:59.467 --> 12:01.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, I THINK-- WELL, I MEAN,

12:01.867 --> 12:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S BEEN VERY INTERESTING THAT

12:04.600 --> 12:05.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CANADIAN PARLIAMENTARY

12:05.867 --> 12:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYSTEM, OF COURSE, MEMBERS OF

12:07.800 --> 12:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARLIAMENT ARE OSTENSIBLY

12:09.833 --> 12:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
