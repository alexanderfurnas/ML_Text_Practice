00:54.221 --> 00:56.189
OF THE YEAR, UNLESS CONGRESS

00:56.189 --> 00:58.325

00:58.325 --> 01:00.193
>> EVERY DAY THAT I WAIT WE'RE

01:00.193 --> 01:01.561
MISALLOCATING RESOURCES, WE'RE

01:01.561 --> 01:02.829
DEPORTING PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T

01:02.829 --> 01:03.864
BE DEPORTED, WE'RE NOT DEPORTING

01:03.864 --> 01:04.598
FOLKS THAT ARE DANGEROUS AND

01:04.598 --> 01:07.567
NEED TO BE DEPORTED.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.202
SO JOHN, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU

01:11.038 --> 01:12.172
IT DONE BEFORE THE END OF THE

01:12.172 --> 01:13.273
YEAR I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE

THE STEPS THAT I CAN.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.277

01:22.282 --> 01:24.117
DURING THE SAME INTERVIEW ON

01:24.117 --> 01:25.819

01:25.819 --> 01:27.187

OUT SENDING MORE TROOPS TO IRAQ

01:28.989 --> 01:30.324
BEYOND THE ADDITIONAL 1,500

01:30.324 --> 01:31.792
HE SAID FRIDAY HE WOULD DEPLOY

01:31.792 --> 01:33.060

01:33.060 --> 01:34.428
>> SHOULD WE EXPECT THAT MORE

01:34.428 --> 01:36.063
TROOPS MAY BE NEEDED BEFORE THIS

01:36.063 --> 01:37.064
IS OVER?

01:37.064 --> 01:38.832
>> YOU KNOW AS COMMANDER IN

01:38.832 --> 01:41.768
CHIEF I'M NEVER GOING TO SAY

01:41.768 --> 01:42.803
NEVER.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.671
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT THE

01:44.671 --> 01:46.306
COMMANDERS WHO PRESENTED THE

01:46.306 --> 01:47.641
PLAN TO ME SAY IS THAT WE MAY

01:47.641 --> 01:49.242
ACTUALLY SEE FEWER TROOPS OVER

01:49.242 --> 01:50.644
TIME BECAUSE NOW WE ARE SEEING

01:50.644 --> 01:51.912
COALITION MEMBERS STARTING TO

AND ASSIST EFFORT.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.484

COMMUNITY LEADERS CALLED A

02:05.892 --> 02:07.094
GENERAL STRIKE.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.628
THEY WERE REACTING TO VIDEO

02:08.628 --> 02:09.863
TAKEN FROM A SECURITY CAMERA.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.898
A WARNING: IT IS GRAPHIC.

02:11.898 --> 02:18.372
IT SHOWS THE MAN REPEATEDLY

02:18.372 --> 02:23.043
POUNDING A POLICE PATROL CAR

02:23.043 --> 02:26.079
WITH SOME SORT OF OBJECT, THEN

02:26.079 --> 02:28.081
BEING SHOT AS HE RETREATED ONCE

02:28.081 --> 02:29.583
AN OFFICER CONFRONTED HIM

02:29.583 --> 02:30.617

02:30.617 --> 02:31.618
THE MAN IS THEN DRAGGED INTO THE

02:35.522 --> 02:40.794
THIS WAY:

02:40.794 --> 02:41.895
>> (translated): I HAVE

02:41.895 --> 02:43.063
INSTRUCTED THE INTERIOR MINISTER

02:43.063 --> 02:44.097
TO USE ALL MEANS TO STOP THIS,

02:44.097 --> 02:45.098
INCLUDING EVALUATING THE

02:45.098 --> 02:45.966
POSSIBILITY OF REVOKING THE

02:45.966 --> 02:46.900
CITIZENSHIP OF THOSE WHO CALL

02:46.900 --> 02:47.667
FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE STATE

02:47.667 --> 02:49.636
OF ISRAEL.

02:49.636 --> 02:50.537

03:00.147 --> 03:01.415
ALONG WITH A SUICIDE BOMBER.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.250
ANOTHER BOMB WENT OFF NEAR A BUS

03:03.250 --> 03:03.884
CARRYING SOLDIERS.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.152
NO ONE WAS KILLED IN THAT

03:16.863 --> 03:18.198
PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED BY EAST

03:18.198 --> 03:19.433
GERMAN BORDER GUARDS AS THEY

03:19.433 --> 03:21.368
TRIED TO CROSS FROM EAST TO WEST

03:21.368 --> 03:23.637
DURING THE NEARLY THIRTY YEARS

03:23.637 --> 03:27.808
THE WALL STOOD.

03:27.808 --> 03:28.942
>> (translated): THE FALL OF

03:28.942 --> 03:29.943
THE WALL SHOWED US THAT DREAMS

03:29.943 --> 03:30.610
CAN BECOME REALITY.

03:30.610 --> 03:31.812
NOTHING HAS TO STAY AS IT IS, NO

03:31.812 --> 03:32.546
MATTER HOW HIGH THE BARRICADES

03:32.546 --> 03:33.513
ARE.

03:33.513 --> 03:34.748
>> Sreenivasan: EARLIER THIS

WEEKEND, THE FORMER SOVIET

03:36.116 --> 03:37.317

03:37.317 --> 03:38.418
SPEAKING IN BERLIN, WARNED THAT

03:38.418 --> 03:39.786
EAST-WEST RELATIONS ARE ONCE

03:39.786 --> 03:44.191
AGAIN DETERIORATING.

03:44.191 --> 03:45.392
>> (translated): THE WORLD IS

03:45.392 --> 03:46.560
ON THE BRINK OF A NEW COLD WAR,

03:46.560 --> 03:47.360
SOME ARE EVEN SAYING THAT IT HAS

03:47.360 --> 03:50.230
ALREADY BEGUN.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.231
>> Sreenivasan: BACK IN THIS

03:51.231 --> 03:52.265
COUNTRY, A NEW GOVERNMENT REPORT

03:52.265 --> 03:53.934
SAYS HOMELESSNESS IS DECLINING.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.035
THE STUDY BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:55.035 --> 03:56.169
HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT

03:56.169 --> 03:57.370
ESTIMATES THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS

03:57.370 --> 03:58.438
AT 578,000.

03:58.438 --> 03:59.372
THAT REPRESENTS A 25% DROP FROM

03:59.372 --> 04:00.707
2010.

04:00.707 --> 04:02.008
HOMELESSNESS AMONG VETERANS

04:02.008 --> 04:03.276
REPORTEDLY DROPPED 33 PERCENT

04:03.276 --> 04:05.312
DURING THE SAME PERIOD.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.780
AND SCHOOL CAFETERIA FOOD MIGHT

04:06.780 --> 04:08.281
NOT ALWAYS BE TASTY BUT IT IS

04:08.281 --> 04:10.684
NUTRITIOUS.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.886
VIRGINIA TECH RESEARCHERS

04:12.886 --> 04:14.488
SAMPLED 1,300 LUNCHES AND FOUND

04:14.488 --> 04:16.356
THAT SCHOOL FOOD SERVED TO

04:16.356 --> 04:17.791
PRESCHOOLERS AND KINDERGARTNERS

04:17.791 --> 04:20.427
WAS HEALTHIER THAN LUNCHES

04:20.427 --> 04:21.394
PACKED BY THE KIDS' PARENTS.

04:21.394 --> 04:25.198
MORE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN

04:25.198 --> 04:26.366
THE SCHOOL LUNCHES, MORE CHIPS

04:26.366 --> 04:27.167
AND SUGARY DRINKS IN THOSE

04:27.167 --> 04:36.309
BROUGHT FROM HOME.

04:36.309 --> 04:37.477
>> Sreenivasan: THE ASIA PACIFIC

04:37.477 --> 04:39.045
ECONOMIC COOPERATION SUMMIT IS

04:39.045 --> 04:40.313
ABOUT TO GET UNDERWAY IN

04:40.313 --> 04:41.982
BEIJING.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.083
AND EARLIER TODAY, THE PRESIDENT

04:43.083 --> 04:44.050
LEFT FOR CHINA.

04:44.050 --> 04:45.285
WHILE THERE, HE WILL BE MEETING

04:45.285 --> 04:46.486
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 18 MONTHS

04:46.486 --> 04:47.954
WITH CHINESE PRESIDENT XI

04:47.954 --> 04:49.289
JINPING.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.924
IT'S PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FIRST

04:50.924 --> 04:53.193
VISIT TO CHINA SINCE 2009.

04:53.193 --> 04:54.327
WHAT IS THE STATE OF CHINA'S

04:54.327 --> 04:55.195
RELATIONSHIPS WITH WORLD POWERS

04:55.195 --> 04:55.896
INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES,

04:55.896 --> 04:56.830
JAPAN AND RUSSIA?

04:56.830 --> 04:57.597
FOR MORE ABOUT ALL THIS, WE ARE

04:57.597 --> 04:58.398
JOINED NOW FROM SAN FRANCISCO BY

04:58.398 --> 04:59.065
ORVILLE SCHELL.

04:59.065 --> 04:59.933
HE IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER

04:59.933 --> 05:01.601
ON U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS AT THE

05:01.601 --> 05:04.738
ASIA SOCIETY.

05:04.738 --> 05:05.672
>> THIS IS A REGION THAT'S

05:05.672 --> 05:06.673
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT 40% OF THE

05:06.673 --> 05:08.108
WORLD'S POPULATION, MORE THAN

05:08.108 --> 05:09.376
50% OF THE TRADE THAT'S COMING

05:09.376 --> 05:10.944
OUT INTO THE WORLD NOW RIGHT?

05:10.944 --> 05:14.514
>> INDEED AND I THINK THIS APEC

05:14.514 --> 05:17.117
MEETING IS A VERY BIG MOMENT FOR

05:17.117 --> 05:21.288
A TREMENDOUS NUMBER RATHER

05:21.288 --> 05:21.888
CONTENTIOUS ISSUES.

05:21.888 --> 05:25.225
ONE THAT HAVE HAD A RELATIVELY

05:25.225 --> 05:32.499
SALUTARY CONCLUSION, IT LOOKS

05:32.499 --> 05:35.535
LIKE, ABE MAY MEET WITH XI

05:35.535 --> 05:37.604
JINPING AND THEY'VE WORKED OUT

05:37.604 --> 05:39.873
AN AGREEMENT WHICH ACTUALLY SORT

05:39.873 --> 05:41.908
OF RETURNS IT TO THE STATUS QUO,

05:41.908 --> 05:43.877
WHICH IS THAT THEY WILL AGREE TO

05:43.877 --> 05:45.378
DISAGREE AND NOT LET THESE

05:45.378 --> 05:48.548
ISLANDS SORT OF BEDEVIL THEIR

05:48.548 --> 05:49.649
LARGER RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS

05:49.649 --> 05:50.383
VERY GOOD.

05:50.383 --> 05:52.452
IT IS SOMEWHAT OF A MODEL FOR

05:52.452 --> 05:56.256
THE U.S. AND CHINA WHICH SHOWS

05:56.256 --> 05:59.659
WE CAN TAKE THE ISSUES WHICH

05:59.659 --> 06:03.029
DIVIDE US AND PUT THEM IN THE

06:03.029 --> 06:04.998
PARALLEL UNIVERSE AND SEE IF

06:04.998 --> 06:07.968
COMMON INTERESTS CAN BE

06:07.968 --> 06:09.336
RESOLVED.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.338
HELP US UNDERSTAND, SOME SAY

06:11.338 --> 06:13.506
IT'S A POTENTIAL FOR OIL AND

06:13.506 --> 06:15.609
NATURAL GAS THAT'S SURROUNDING

06:15.609 --> 06:17.811
UNDERNEATH THESE WATERS AND BOTH

06:17.811 --> 06:18.912
THESE ECONOMIES ARE VERY HUNGRY

06:18.912 --> 06:22.649
FOR FUEL.

06:22.649 --> 06:28.955
>> I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY IS

06:28.955 --> 06:36.930
THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THESE ISSUES.

06:36.930 --> 06:45.672
IT APPEARED THAT DENG XIAOPING

06:45.672 --> 06:47.774
INCREDIBLY CONSERVATIVE

06:47.774 --> 06:53.480
GOVERNOR OF TOKYO ISHIHARA

06:53.480 --> 06:55.782
THREATENED TO BUY THREE OF THEM

06:55.782 --> 06:58.885
PERMLY AND IS HE A VERY --

06:58.885 --> 07:02.122
PERSONALLY, AND HE IS A ARE VERY

07:02.122 --> 07:08.928
XENOPHOBIC INDIVIDUAL.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.664
SO THEY ARE OFF TO THE RACES.

07:10.664 --> 07:13.733
AND NOW I THINK WITH ABE GOING

07:13.733 --> 07:16.202
TO BEIJING AND PROBABLY MEETING

07:16.202 --> 07:17.771
WITH XI JINPING WE PAY SEE

07:17.771 --> 07:19.939
SOMETHING OF A RETURN TO THAT

07:19.939 --> 07:21.641
AGREEMENT TO DISAGREE AND GET

07:21.641 --> 07:22.942
ALONG WITH THE LARGER AND VERY

07:22.942 --> 07:23.777
IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.378
>> ALSO AT THIS CONFERENCE WE'RE

07:25.378 --> 07:30.917
NOT THE ONLY NONASIA SUPERPOWER.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.686
I'VE HEARD RUSSIAN PRESIDENT

07:32.686 --> 07:34.487
VLADIMIR PUTIN IS THERE.

07:34.487 --> 07:38.124
HE'S HAD AN IMPACTFUL YEAR.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.893
WHAT DOES THAT DO TOT MEETING?

07:39.893 --> 07:41.761
>> THAT THE MEETING IS

07:41.761 --> 07:43.596
SUPERCHARGED WITH RADIO CIFER

07:43.596 --> 07:44.564
TENSIONS.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.766
ONE THING THAT'S VERY

07:46.766 --> 07:49.402
CHARACTERISTIC FOR CHINA AND THE

07:49.402 --> 07:51.004
CHINESE LEADERSHIP, IF THEY HOST

07:51.004 --> 07:52.005
SOMETHING THEY WANT IT TO BE

07:52.005 --> 07:52.839
SUCCESSFUL.

07:52.839 --> 07:55.842
SO I THINK YOU WILL FIND THEM

07:55.842 --> 07:58.511
STRIVING MIGHTILY TO COME OUT OF

07:58.511 --> 08:00.914
IT WITH MAJOR AGREEMENTS BOTH

08:00.914 --> 08:01.948
WITH JAPAN AND HOPEFULLY WITH

08:01.948 --> 08:02.782
THE UNITED STATES.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.818
AND I THINK THEY ALREADY HAVE

08:04.818 --> 08:06.986
THEIR $400 BILLION GAS AND OIL

08:06.986 --> 08:07.787
DEAL WITH PUTIN.

08:07.787 --> 08:10.023
SO HE MAY BE SOMETHING OF A

08:10.023 --> 08:13.326
LITTLE LESS CRITICAL THAN OBAMA,

08:13.326 --> 08:14.127
ABE AND XI JINPING.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.830
>> AND ARE YOU EVER IMPRESSED BY

08:16.830 --> 08:17.997
HOW THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS

08:17.997 --> 08:19.432
ABLE TO CLEAR THE AIR WHEN THEY

08:19.432 --> 08:22.001
WANT OVER THE SKIES OF BEIJING?

08:22.001 --> 08:24.304
IT TURNS OUT THAT THEY SHUT DOWN

08:24.304 --> 08:27.941
FACTORIES, THEY PULL CARS OFF

08:27.941 --> 08:29.642
ROADS, THEY TRY TO GET BLUE

08:29.642 --> 08:30.543
SKIES FOR THIS MEETING.

08:30.543 --> 08:32.712
>> THIS JUST TELLS US HOW

08:32.712 --> 08:34.180
IMPORTANT APPEARANCES ARE TO

08:34.180 --> 08:35.215
CHINA.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.617
HOW MUCH CHINA REALLY WANTS TO

08:37.617 --> 08:39.219
BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY, HOW MUCH

08:39.219 --> 08:43.223
THEY WANT TO BE RESPECTED AN

08:43.223 --> 08:45.091
HAVE RATHER SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS

08:45.091 --> 08:47.660
IN THEIR COUNTRY APPRECIATED AND

08:47.660 --> 08:49.162
TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

08:49.162 --> 08:55.034
>> ORVILLE SCHELL FROM SAN SAN

08:55.034 --> 08:55.935
FRANCISCO, THANKS VERY MUCH.

08:55.935 --> 09:10.450
>> PLEASURE.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.384
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO OUR

09:11.384 --> 09:13.153
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

09:13.153 --> 09:13.953
YOU'VE NO DOUBT SEEN HEADLINES

09:13.953 --> 09:14.854
LIKE THIS ONE, DESCRIBING HUGE

09:14.854 --> 09:15.655
AWARDS MADE TO PEOPLE CONVICTED

09:15.655 --> 09:17.323
OF CRIMES THEY DIDN'T COMMIT.

09:17.323 --> 09:18.258
BUT THOSE HEADLINES MIGHT

09:18.258 --> 09:19.459
ACTUALLY CREATE A MISIMPRESSION.

09:19.459 --> 09:20.460
BECAUSE, AS WE DISCOVERED, MANY

09:20.460 --> 09:21.561
STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY DON'T

09:21.561 --> 09:22.662
COMPENSATE THE WRONGLY CONVICTED

09:22.662 --> 09:24.030
AT ALL.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.165
AND EVEN WHEN SOME FORMER

09:25.165 --> 09:26.166
INMATES SUCCESSFULLY SUE, THE

09:26.166 --> 09:27.801
PROCESS CAN TAKE YEARS.

09:27.801 --> 09:28.968
ON ANY GIVEN AFTERNOON IN

09:28.968 --> 09:30.503
BRADDOCK PENNSYLVANIA ON THE

09:30.503 --> 09:32.038
OUTSKIRTS OF PITTSBURGH YOU'LL

09:32.038 --> 09:34.140
FIND DREW WHITLEY IN STAMBOLIS

09:34.140 --> 09:35.175
MEAT SHOP HELPING TO CLEAN UP.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.176
IT'S ABOUT ALL HE CAN DO NOW.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.277
HE TAKES VALIUM FOR AN ANXIETY

09:37.277 --> 09:39.012
THAT IS VERY REAL FOR HIM.

09:39.012 --> 09:39.846
WHAT'S YOUR LIFE BEEN LIKE?

09:39.846 --> 09:40.847
>> SOME DAYS I WAKE UP WITH

09:40.847 --> 09:41.881
NIGHTMARES FROM THE NIGHT

09:41.881 --> 09:43.316
BEFORE.

09:43.316 --> 09:49.222
YOU KNOW I STILL HAVE NIGHTMARES

09:49.222 --> 09:50.623
ABOUT BEING LOCKED UP.

09:50.623 --> 09:51.791
IF THEY LOCKED YOU UP FOR... FOR

09:51.791 --> 09:58.064
GETTING LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE FOR

09:58.064 --> 09:59.532
SOMETHING YOU THEY KNOW YOU

09:59.532 --> 10:00.633
DIDN'T DO, AIN'T NO TELLING WHAT

10:00.633 --> 10:01.668
THEY MIGHT DO, FAR AS I'M

10:01.668 --> 10:03.169
CONCERNED.

10:03.169 --> 10:04.270
>> Sreenivasan: SO YOU ARE STILL

10:04.270 --> 10:05.738
LIVING IN FEAR OF THE JUSTICE

10:05.738 --> 10:07.307
SYSTEM?

10:07.307 --> 10:08.374
>> OH, YES.

10:08.374 --> 10:09.976
I THINK I'LL BE THAT WAY FOR THE

10:09.976 --> 10:11.344
REST OF MY LIFE.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.512
WHITLEY'S FEAR AND ANXIETY ARE

10:12.512 --> 10:16.082
BASED ON FACT.

10:16.082 --> 10:16.850
IN 1989, WHITLEY, WHO HAD TWO

10:16.850 --> 10:19.285
PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS FOR THEFT

10:19.285 --> 10:20.720
AND RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY,

10:20.720 --> 10:21.688
WAS CONVICTED IN THE HIGH

10:21.688 --> 10:24.224
PROFILE MURDER OF NOREEN MALLOY,

10:24.224 --> 10:26.192
A 22-YEAR-OLD McDONALD'S

10:26.192 --> 10:28.528
MANAGER IN DUQUESNE,

10:28.528 --> 10:30.930
PENNSYLVANIA, ANOTHER TOWN NEAR

10:30.930 --> 10:33.867
PITTSBURGH.

10:33.867 --> 10:34.667
ALTHOUGH HE ALWAYS MAINTAINED

10:34.667 --> 10:35.235
HIS INNOCENCE,

10:35.235 --> 10:39.138
>> I'M HOPING THE JUDGE WILL

10:39.138 --> 10:40.173
GRANT THE D.N.A. TEST SO THE

10:40.173 --> 10:41.007
WHOLE CITY OF PITTSBURGH CAN SEE

10:41.007 --> 10:42.642
THAT THEY GOT ANOTHER INNOCENT

10:42.642 --> 10:43.910
MAN.

10:43.910 --> 10:47.747
>> Sreenivasan: HE SERVED 18

10:47.747 --> 10:49.182
YEARS IN PRISON BEFORE D.N.A.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.751
TESTING PROVED THAT HAIRS FOUND

10:51.751 --> 10:53.152
IN THE KILLER'S SKI MASK DID NOT

10:53.152 --> 10:53.786
BELONG TO HIM.

10:53.786 --> 10:55.722
IN 2006, HE WAS SET FREE.

10:55.722 --> 10:56.923
EIGHT YEARS LATER, DREW

10:56.923 --> 10:57.757
WHITLEY'S EXONERATED LIFE IS

10:57.757 --> 10:58.925
ANYTHING BUT EASY.

10:58.925 --> 10:59.692
HE GETS A DISABILITY CHECK FOR

10:59.692 --> 11:00.226
$700 A MONTH.

11:00.226 --> 11:01.461
JUST LAST YEAR AT AGE 58 HE

11:01.461 --> 11:02.395
MOVED OUT OF HIS MOTHER'S HOME

11:02.395 --> 11:03.329
INTO A TINY TWO ROOM APARTMENT

11:03.329 --> 11:04.163
WHICH COSTS HIM NEARLY HALF HIS

11:04.163 --> 11:05.098
CHECK

11:05.098 --> 11:06.132
DID PEOPLE ASSUME THAT AS SOON

11:06.132 --> 11:06.866
AS YOU WERE EXONERATED THAT YOU

11:06.866 --> 11:07.767
WOULD BE PAID MONEY?

11:07.767 --> 11:08.334
>> OH, YES. I DID TOO.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.168
(LAUGHS)

11:09.168 --> 11:10.803
ME TOO.

11:10.803 --> 11:11.738
YES.

11:11.738 --> 11:13.006
AND IT SHOULD BE LIKE THAT IN

11:13.006 --> 11:21.014
EVERY STATE.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.582
BUT FOR ALL HIS TIME SPENT

11:22.582 --> 11:23.816
WRONGFULLY IN PRISON ALL DREW

11:23.816 --> 11:25.585
WHITLEY GOT WAS $100 THAT HE

11:25.585 --> 11:26.352
EARNED WORKING IN THE PRISON

11:26.352 --> 11:27.053
LAUNDRY.

11:27.053 --> 11:28.288
HE DIDN'T GET ANOTHER PENNY FROM

11:28.288 --> 11:29.756
THE STATE.

11:29.756 --> 11:31.124
WHILE 30 STATES DO OFFER

11:31.124 --> 11:32.592
COMPENSATION TO THE WRONGFULLY

11:32.592 --> 11:33.660
CONVICTED, PENNSYLVANIA, ALONG

11:33.660 --> 11:35.028
WITH 19 OTHERS, OFFERS NOTHING.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.330
BUT EVEN WHERE THERE IS

11:37.330 --> 11:39.065
COMPENSATION AVAILABLE, IT IS

11:39.065 --> 11:41.100
FAR FROM EQUAL.

11:41.100 --> 11:46.105
FOR EXAMPLE, TEXAS, PAYS ALL

11:46.105 --> 11:47.640
EXONEREES $80,000 FOR EACH YEAR

11:47.640 --> 11:49.008
THEY WERE WRONGFULLY IMPRISONED

11:49.008 --> 11:50.276
AND THE STATE IS ONE OF THE FEW

11:50.276 --> 11:51.311
THAT ALSO OFFERS SOME MEDICAL

11:51.311 --> 11:52.612
CARE, LIFE SKILLS, AND

11:52.612 --> 11:53.613
VOCATIONAL TRAINING ONCE THEY

11:53.613 --> 11:56.316
GET OUT.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.084
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE HOWEVER, THE

11:58.084 --> 12:03.356
MAXIMUM AMOUNT AN EXONEREE IS

12:03.356 --> 12:05.291
ENTITLED TO IS $20,000, NO

12:05.291 --> 12:06.492
MATTER HOW LONG THE INNOCENT

12:06.492 --> 12:08.194
PERSON SPENT IN PRISON.

12:08.194 --> 12:11.497
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS IT'S

12:11.497 --> 12:13.166
OWN STANDARD, OFFERING $50,000

12:13.166 --> 12:14.367
FOR EACH YEAR OF WRONGFUL

12:14.367 --> 12:15.935
INCARCERATION

12:15.935 --> 12:17.870
BUT WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN

12:17.870 --> 12:20.006
EFFORTS SINCE AT LEAST 2009 IN

12:20.006 --> 12:21.274
THE PENNSYLVANIA LEGISLATURE TO

12:21.274 --> 12:22.775
INTRODUCE A COMPENSATION

12:22.775 --> 12:23.743
STATUTE, IT'S GONE NOWHERE.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.744
THOSE WHO OPPOSE A PROPOSED

12:24.744 --> 12:25.845
COMPENSATION STATUTE IN

12:25.845 --> 12:26.946
PENNSYLVANIA SAY THAT THERE IS

12:26.946 --> 12:27.647
LACK OF REGARD FOR INNOCENT

12:27.647 --> 12:28.281
VICTIMS.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.248
THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWN NO EVIDENCE

12:29.248 --> 12:30.783
OF THE NEED FOR SUCH A LAW.

12:30.783 --> 12:31.551
>> IF ANYBODY HAD ANY KIND OF

12:31.551 --> 12:32.518
MORALS IN THE GOVERNMENT, WHEN

12:32.518 --> 12:33.286
SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENED,

12:33.286 --> 12:34.087
THEY SHOULD REACH OUT AND FIX

12:34.087 --> 12:34.687
IT.

12:34.687 --> 12:35.455
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS.

12:35.455 --> 12:36.122
THEY FIGHT.

12:36.122 --> 12:37.457
THEY DON'T FIX.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.092
>> Sreenivasan: BILL MOUSHEY IS

12:39.092 --> 12:40.259
A JOURNALISM PROFESSOR AT POINT

12:40.259 --> 12:41.227
PARK UNIVERSITY IN PITTSBURGH

12:41.227 --> 12:42.128
AND A PULITZER PRIZE NOMINATED

12:42.128 --> 12:43.096
REPORTER.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.697
FOR YEARS HE AND HIS STUDENTS

12:44.697 --> 12:45.898
HAVE INVESTIGATED CASES OF THE

12:45.898 --> 12:46.699
WRONGFULLY CONVICTED IN

12:46.699 --> 12:48.201
PENNSYLVANIA.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.802
HIS REPORTING IN THE PITTSBURGH

12:49.802 --> 12:53.773
POST GAZETTE HELPED GET DREW

12:53.773 --> 12:54.874
WHITLEY EXONERATED, AND HE STILL

12:54.874 --> 12:56.676
UPSET BY CASES LIKE WHITLEY'S

12:56.676 --> 12:58.111
>> THEY USED TO HAVE HOPELESS

12:58.111 --> 13:00.947
LOOKS IN THEIR EYES WHEN I'D

13:00.947 --> 13:03.182
LOOK AT THEM ACROSS THE TABLE IN

13:03.182 --> 13:04.851
A PRISON.

13:04.851 --> 13:05.551
BUT NOW THEY HAVE HELPLESS

13:05.551 --> 13:08.388
LOOKS.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.389
AND I THINK THE HELPLESS IS A

13:09.389 --> 13:10.223
LOT WORSE.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.090
>> Sreenivasan: WHY?

13:11.090 --> 13:12.325
>> BECAUSE THEY WORKED THEIR

13:12.325 --> 13:13.159
WHOLE LIVES IN PRISON TO GET OUT

13:13.159 --> 13:14.060
OF PRISON BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T DO

13:14.060 --> 13:14.727
WHATEVER IT WAS THEY WERE

13:14.727 --> 13:15.528
CHARGED WITH.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.196
AND THEN THEY GET OUT AND

13:17.196 --> 13:18.031
NOTHING IS THE WAY THEY APPEAR--

13:18.031 --> 13:20.099
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

13:20.099 --> 13:21.701
THEY ARE JUST THROWN ON THE

13:21.701 --> 13:22.869
SCRAPHEAP OF LIFE LIKE THEY WERE

13:22.869 --> 13:25.271
THE DAY THEY WALKED INTO PRISON.

13:25.271 --> 13:26.873
AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS, IS

13:26.873 --> 13:29.075
THAT THEY'RE ONLY PRISONERS OF

13:29.075 --> 13:30.243
THEIR OWN HOMES NOW AND NOT OF

13:30.243 --> 13:33.513
THE STATE.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.347
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT KIND OF

13:34.347 --> 13:35.114
SUPPORT SERVICES EXIST FOR THEM

13:35.114 --> 13:36.049
AFTER THEY'RE OUT?

13:36.049 --> 13:39.886
>> NONE.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.387
>> Sreenivasan: IN FACT, MOUSHEY

13:41.387 --> 13:42.755
SAYS THAT WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED

13:42.755 --> 13:44.457
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED

13:44.457 --> 13:45.625
ARE IN MANY WAYS BETTER OFF THAN

13:45.625 --> 13:47.326
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED

13:47.326 --> 13:48.428
BUT ARE LATER CLEARED.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.462
>> IF YOU GET PAROLED IN

13:49.462 --> 13:50.496
PENNSYLVANIA OR ANY STATE,

13:50.496 --> 13:51.731
YOU'RE PUT UNDER A VERY

13:51.731 --> 13:52.732
RESTRICTIVE SERIES OF COVENANTS

13:52.732 --> 13:54.033
WHERE, YOU KNOW, THEY BLOOD TEST

13:54.033 --> 13:55.501
YOU FOR DRUGS, THEY MAKE YOU GO

13:55.501 --> 13:56.736
GET A JOB, THEY LEAD YOU TO JOB

13:56.736 --> 13:57.603
SEARCH AGENCIES, THEY SHOW YOU

13:57.603 --> 13:58.805
HOW TO BUILD A RESUME, THEY SHOW

13:58.805 --> 13:59.639
YOU A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS

13:59.639 --> 14:00.640
THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU

14:00.640 --> 14:02.608
MELD BACK INTO SOCIETY.

14:02.608 --> 14:04.477
WHEN YOU GET EXONERATED, THEY

14:04.477 --> 14:07.180
OPEN THE DOOR AND SAY, "SEE YA

14:07.180 --> 14:08.614
LATER!"

14:08.614 --> 14:09.882
THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION TO TRY

14:09.882 --> 14:10.650
TO GET COMPENSATED: SUING.

14:10.650 --> 14:11.417
THAT'S WHAT JEFFREY DESKOVIC

14:11.417 --> 14:16.022
DID.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.290
LIKE DREW WHITLEY, DESKOVIC WAS

14:17.290 --> 14:18.558
ALSO WRONGFULLY CONVICTED OF

14:18.558 --> 14:20.159
MURDER AND EVEN HAD AN

14:20.159 --> 14:21.360
ADDITIONAL CHARGE FOR RAPE IN

14:21.360 --> 14:22.462
NEW YORK STATE AND SERVED ALMOST

14:22.462 --> 14:24.097
AS MUCH TIME IN PRISON BEFORE HE

14:24.097 --> 14:26.299
WAS ALSO EXONERATED IN 2006 BY

14:26.299 --> 14:27.467
D.N.A.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.102
BUT HE SUED AND WAS AWARDED MORE

14:29.102 --> 14:30.803
THAN $13 MILLION BY THE STATE OF

14:30.803 --> 14:32.572
NEW YORK AND THE OTHER

14:32.572 --> 14:35.108
MUNICIPALITIES INVOLVED IN HIS

14:35.108 --> 14:36.542
CONVICTION.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.243
AND JUST LAST MONTH HE WON

14:37.243 --> 14:38.845
ANOTHER MULTIMILLION DOLLAR

14:38.845 --> 14:39.946
JUDGMENT.

14:39.946 --> 14:42.348
NOW DESKOVIC IS WORKING IN HIS

14:42.348 --> 14:43.950
OWN WAY TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE

14:43.950 --> 14:44.884
DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHAT HE

14:44.884 --> 14:45.785
DID.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.520
HE SET UP A FOUNDATION WITH HIS

14:47.520 --> 14:49.322
SETTLEMENT MONEY TO HELP

14:49.322 --> 14:50.823
INVESTIGATE OTHER POSSIBLE

14:50.823 --> 14:52.959
WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS ACROSS THE

14:52.959 --> 14:54.627
COUNTRY AS WELL AS OFFER

14:54.627 --> 14:56.028
FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL SUPPORT TO

14:56.028 --> 14:58.030
OTHER EXONERATE SOMETIMES WITH

14:58.030 --> 14:59.799
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A REGULAR

14:59.799 --> 15:01.501
KARAOKE NIGHT WITH OTHER GUYS

15:01.501 --> 15:02.969
WHO ARE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED.

15:02.969 --> 15:03.903
>> IT'S CATHARTIC FOR ME.

15:03.903 --> 15:04.971
AND I FEEL LIKE I'M MAKING A

15:04.971 --> 15:07.373
DIFFERENCE.

15:07.373 --> 15:08.608
AND I'M TRYING TO MAKE MY

15:08.608 --> 15:11.778
SUFFERING COUNT FOR SOMETHING.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.012
>> I MEAN IT TOOK LESS THAN A

15:13.012 --> 15:14.947
YEAR FOR ME TO GET... GET TO A

15:14.947 --> 15:16.549
TRIAL AND TO BE WRONGFULLY

15:16.549 --> 15:20.953
CONVICTED ON THE CRIMINAL SIDE.

15:20.953 --> 15:22.255
AND IN TERMS OF GETTING A

15:22.255 --> 15:24.323
SETTLEMENT, IT TOOK FIVE YEARS.

15:24.323 --> 15:26.726
AND THEN TO EVEN GET A... GET TO

15:26.726 --> 15:31.364
A CIVIL RIGHTS TRIAL-- EIGHT

15:31.364 --> 15:33.666
YEARS.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.934
AND THEN NO SOCIAL SERVICES IN

15:34.934 --> 15:37.003
THE MEANTIME.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.838
>> Sreenivasan: DREW WHITLEY

15:38.838 --> 15:40.373
SUED IN FEDERAL COURT ALLEGING

15:40.373 --> 15:41.240
THAT HIS CIVIL RIGHTS WERE

15:41.240 --> 15:44.310
VIOLATED.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.678
BUT THE BAR FOR PROVING

15:45.678 --> 15:46.846
MISCONDUCT IS HIGH.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.114
EVEN THOUGH A FEDERAL JUDGE

15:48.114 --> 15:49.048
AGREED THAT POLICE OFFICERS WERE

15:49.048 --> 15:53.352
NEGLIGENT, SHE RULED AGAINST HIS

15:53.352 --> 15:55.054
LAWSUIT SAYING, "A REASONABLE

15:55.054 --> 15:56.923
OFFICER IN 1989 WOULD NOT HAVE

15:56.923 --> 15:58.191
FAIR WARNING THAT CONDUCTING A

15:58.191 --> 15:59.592
RECKLESS INVESTIGATION WAS

15:59.592 --> 16:01.360
UNCONSTITUTIONAL."

16:02.929 --> 16:04.630
THERE ARE ADMISSIONS OF MISTAKES

16:04.630 --> 16:05.998
AND OF SHODDY POLICE WORK, DREW

16:05.998 --> 16:06.833
WHITLEY IS UNLIKELY TO GET PAID

16:06.833 --> 16:11.537
BY PENNSYLVANIA.

16:11.537 --> 16:12.638
>> WELL, NOT UNLIKELY.

16:12.638 --> 16:13.673
HE'S NOT GONNA GET PAID.

16:13.673 --> 16:14.507
HE SUED.

16:14.507 --> 16:15.575
THE JUDGE THREW THE CASE OUT.

16:15.575 --> 16:16.475
AND THERE'S REALLY NO RECOURSE,

16:16.475 --> 16:17.743
UNLESS WE HAD A COMPENSATION

16:17.743 --> 16:19.679
PACKAGE.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.113
AND WE DON'T.

16:21.113 --> 16:22.381
>> Sreenivasan: IF ALL OF THIS

16:22.381 --> 16:23.883
STRIKES YOU AS ARBITRARY THAT

16:23.883 --> 16:32.091
ONE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED PERSON

16:32.091 --> 16:32.992
IS PAID WHILE ANOTHER IS NOT,

16:32.992 --> 16:34.126
IT'S BECAUSE OUR CRIMINAL

16:34.126 --> 16:35.228
JUSTICE SYSTEM IS LARGELY

16:35.228 --> 16:35.928
DECIDED BY EACH INDIVIDUAL

16:35.928 --> 16:37.430
STATE.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.365
>> WE'RE DEALING WITH, YOU KNOW,

16:39.365 --> 16:41.901
50 DIFFERENT STATES PLUS THE

16:41.901 --> 16:46.439
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, RIGHT.

16:46.439 --> 16:47.773
AND THEY TAKE DIFFERENT VIEWS

16:47.773 --> 16:48.941
ABOUT THESE MATTERS.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.309

UNIVERSITY WHO STUDIES

16:52.712 --> 16:53.913
PUNISHMENT IN THE CRIMINAL

16:53.913 --> 16:55.014
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.349
HE SAYS THAT WHILE COMPENSATION

16:56.349 --> 16:57.550
PACKAGES MAY BE THE MORE

16:57.550 --> 16:58.718
IMMEDIATE AND CERTAIN ROUTE FOR

HELPING EXONEREES, MULTIMILLION

16:59.652 --> 17:00.786
DOLLAR LAWSUITS COULD HAVE A

17:00.786 --> 17:02.288
LARGER IMPACT.

17:02.288 --> 17:03.723
>> ONE OF MY FEARS REALLY IS

17:03.723 --> 17:04.757
THAT IF YOU HAVE A TOO

17:04.757 --> 17:05.591
STRAIGHTFORWARD SYSTEM WHERE

17:05.591 --> 17:10.229
ANYONE WHO IS WRONGFULLY

17:10.229 --> 17:11.697
CONVICTED GETS $50,000 A YEAR,

17:11.697 --> 17:13.299
WE STOP PAYING ATTENTION YOU

17:13.299 --> 17:14.333
LOSE THE IMPETUS TO REALLY TRY

17:14.333 --> 17:15.935
TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE

17:15.935 --> 17:19.605
ACTUALLY GOES THROUGH THIS.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.073

17:21.073 --> 17:22.475
THROUGH IT HIMSELF, DESKOVIC

17:22.475 --> 17:23.442
SAYS THAT PREVENTING WRONGFUL

17:23.442 --> 17:24.377
CONVICTIONS IS EVEN MORE

17:24.377 --> 17:25.578
IMPORTANT THAN COMPENSATING

17:25.578 --> 17:27.280
EXONEREES AFTER THE FACT.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.381
>> IT COULD NEVER GIVE ME MY

17:28.381 --> 17:29.482
YEARS BACK.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.483
I WOULD BE WILLING TO NOT ONLY

17:30.483 --> 17:31.951
GIVE THE MONEY BACK.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.119
I'D BE WILLING TO GO INTO DEBT

17:33.119 --> 17:40.660
FOR THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY, MAYBE

17:40.660 --> 17:41.594
EVEN DOUBLE IT, TO HAVE HAD MY

17:41.594 --> 17:48.301
YEARS BACK, TO HAVE HAD A

17:48.301 --> 17:49.735
LIFE.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.170
>> Sreenivasan: A NORMAL LIFE IS

17:51.170 --> 17:52.538
ALL DREW WHITLEY WAS HOPING FOR

17:52.538 --> 17:53.806
WHEN HE WAS EXONERATED.

17:53.806 --> 17:54.807
WHAT WERE YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR

17:54.807 --> 17:57.376
YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU GOT OUT?

17:57.376 --> 17:59.412
>> A GOOD PLACE TO STAY, FOOD TO

17:59.412 --> 18:02.882
EAT AND TRANSPORTATION.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.251
THAT'S ALL I REALLY WANT OUT OF

18:05.251 --> 18:07.553
LIFE.

18:07.553 --> 18:13.159
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.394
I DON'T WANT TO BE FILTHY RICH

18:15.394 --> 18:16.562
OR A MILLIONAIRE, OR WHATEVER.

18:16.562 --> 18:17.763
I JUST WANT A PLACE TO STAY.

18:17.763 --> 18:18.664
ROOF OVER MY HEAD AND

18:18.664 --> 18:22.501
TRANSPORTATION.

VETERAN'S DAY, A DAY TO HONOR

18:24.270 --> 18:25.137
THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED.

18:25.137 --> 18:25.838
BUT SINCE THE DRAFT ENDED IN

18:25.838 --> 18:26.739
1973, THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS

18:26.739 --> 18:27.440
WHO SERVE HAS DECREASED

18:27.440 --> 18:28.107
DRAMATICALLY LEADING TO WHAT

18:28.107 --> 18:28.874
SOME FEAR IS A LACK OF

18:28.874 --> 18:29.508
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN OUR

18:29.508 --> 18:30.176
MILITARY AND CIVILIAN

18:30.176 --> 18:30.943
POPULATIONS.

18:30.943 --> 18:31.744
NOW, SOME YOUNG VETERANS HAVE

NAVY, CO-FOUNDED WORDS AFTER WAR

19:02.641 --> 19:03.576

>> YOU WERE 18 WHEN YOU

19:05.511 --> 19:07.313
ENLISTED?

19:07.313 --> 19:10.416
>> I WAS.

19:10.416 --> 19:14.086
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HIGH

19:14.086 --> 19:17.256
SCHOOL WHEN I ENLISTED.

19:17.256 --> 19:19.291
IT WAS-- SHORTLY AFTER 9/11.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.093
AT THE TIME, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS

19:21.093 --> 19:21.894
A REAL GRAVITY TO THE SITUATION.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.062
AND IT FELT VERY IMMEDIATE. AND

19:23.062 --> 19:24.230
I FELT LIKE I HAD TO DO

19:24.230 --> 19:24.897
SOMETHING.

19:24.897 --> 19:25.798
AND THAT WAS THE ONLY THING I

19:25.798 --> 19:26.899
COULD THINK OF TO DO WAS TO JOIN

19:26.899 --> 19:27.867
THE MILITARY.

19:27.867 --> 19:28.901
>> WILLITTS DEPLOYED OVERSEAS IN

19:35.074 --> 19:36.409
TO PURSUE A COLLEGE DEGREE. BUT

19:36.409 --> 19:37.710
AT SCHOOL, HE SAYS, HE FELT LIKE

19:37.710 --> 19:38.911
AN OUTSIDER.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.413
>> I THINK IT'S LIKE BEING A

19:40.413 --> 19:41.547
UNICORN, WHAT I IMAGINE WHAT

19:41.547 --> 19:47.086
BEING LIKE A UNICORN WOULD BE IS

19:47.086 --> 19:48.154
THAT, THEY'RE LIKE, "OH THAT'S

19:48.154 --> 19:49.088
SO INTERESTING BUT YET WE SHOULD

19:49.088 --> 19:50.423
PROBABLY KEEP OUR DISTANCE

19:50.423 --> 19:53.726
BECAUSE IT'S SO FOREIGN TO US

19:53.726 --> 19:54.860
AND SO ALIEN TO US."

19:54.860 --> 19:56.395
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS LIKE BEING A

19:56.395 --> 19:58.497
VETERAN ON A SMALL, LIBERAL ARTS

19:58.497 --> 19:59.432
CAMPUS IN NEW ENGLAND.

>> Sreenivasan: NEW RESEARCH

22:25.344 --> 22:26.545
BEING CONDUCTED ON TWINS IN

22:26.545 --> 22:28.280
BRITAIN SHOWS A CLOSE CONNECTION

22:28.280 --> 22:29.381
BETWEEN THE BACTERIA IN YOUR

22:29.381 --> 22:30.449
STOMACH AND THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT

22:30.449 --> 22:31.483
YOU GAIN OR LOSE.

22:31.483 --> 22:32.384
ITN'S SCIENCE EDITOR TOM CLARKE

22:32.384 --> 22:40.626
REPORTS.

22:40.626 --> 22:42.728
>> CHAT HAS VOLUNTEERED TO TAKE

22:42.728 --> 22:49.602
PART IN A VOLUNTEER EXPERIMENT,

22:49.602 --> 22:52.671
ABOUT, UNIQUE BECAUSE SHE HAS AN

22:52.671 --> 22:54.306
IDENTICALLY TWIN ROSIE INVOLVED

22:54.306 --> 22:56.475
IN THE STUDY TOO.

22:56.475 --> 22:59.011
THEY'RE PART OF THE MOST WELL

22:59.011 --> 23:00.746
RESEARCHED GROUP OF ADULT TWINS

COLLEGE IN LONDON.

23:09.955 --> 23:11.390
THEY ARE CONDUCTING EXPERIMENTS

23:11.390 --> 23:14.393
ON WEIGHT, AND MOST IMPORTANT,

23:14.393 --> 23:15.394
GUT BACTERIA.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.030
WHAT THEY JUST FOUND, ACCORDING

23:18.030 --> 23:20.299
TO LEAD RESEARCHER TIM SPECTER,

23:20.299 --> 23:21.200
IS QUITE REMARKABLE.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.802
>> HOW WE RESPOND TO FOODS IN

23:23.802 --> 23:25.604
VERY DIFFERENT WAYS AND WHY SOME

23:25.604 --> 23:27.573
PEOPLE GET FAT ON THE DIET AND

23:27.573 --> 23:28.574
OTHERS LOSE IT.

23:28.574 --> 23:31.477
>> DNA IN STOOL SAMPLES FOR 416

23:31.477 --> 23:33.612
PAIRS OF TWINS, THEY DISCOVERED

23:33.612 --> 23:35.114
A LITTLE KNOWN GROUP OF ANCIENT

23:35.114 --> 23:38.484
BACTERIA, MORE PROBABLE IN

23:38.484 --> 23:40.219
SKINNIER INDIVIDUALS THAN FATTER

23:40.219 --> 23:44.990
INDIVIDUALS.

23:44.990 --> 23:47.459
>> THE OPPOSITE TWIN WHO DIDN'T

23:47.459 --> 23:51.030
WE PUT THOSE INTO MICE AND FOUND

23:51.030 --> 23:52.698
THAT THE ONE WITH THE LOTS OF

23:52.698 --> 23:54.600
MICROBES WOULD PREVENT THAT

23:54.600 --> 23:56.435
MOUSE FROM BECOMING FAT AND THE

23:56.435 --> 23:58.170
OTHER ONE WHO DIDN'T HAVE IT

23:58.170 --> 24:02.174
BECAME OBESE.

24:02.174 --> 24:10.683
>> PRO-BIOTIC MATERIAL, DOSES

24:10.683 --> 24:12.451
WOULD HAVE TO BE TAILORED TO

24:12.451 --> 24:15.754
MATCH THE RECIPIENT'S GENES.
