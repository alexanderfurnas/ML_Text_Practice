JUDY WOODRUFF: After years
of recession, skyrocketing
inflation, and hardship,
the oil-rich country

00:06.600 --> 00:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Venezuela is spiraling into
social and economic collapse.

00:09.766 --> 00:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of its people have been
taking to the streets on an
almost daily basis for the last

00:13.933 --> 00:18.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
two months to demand
that President Nicolas
Maduro step down.

00:18.166 --> 00:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With the support of the Pulitzer
Center for Crisis Reporting,
special correspondent Nadja

00:22.566 --> 00:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Drost and videographer Bruno
Federico went to Caracas to find
out how the wave of uprisings

00:29.033 --> 00:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is creating a political crisis.

00:36.500 --> 00:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Venezuela
today, an economy in
freefall, triple-digit
inflation, dire shortages

00:46.866 --> 00:50.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of nearly everything,
from food to medicine.

00:50.466 --> 00:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The social and economic crisis
that started intensifying
after President Nicolas Maduro

00:57.466 --> 01:01.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
took over from his
iconic predecessor Hugo
Chavez is tailspinning
into a political one,

01:03.100 --> 01:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as anti-government protests
rock the capital, Caracas.

01:10.100 --> 01:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chavismo, the populist form of
socialism branded by Chavez that
provided services for the poor

01:16.900 --> 01:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paid for by profits from the
world's largest oil reserves,
is teetering on the verge of

01:24.966 --> 01:26.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
collapse.

01:26.933 --> 01:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Behind us is a sea of angry
Venezuelans who have been taking
to the streets since early

01:30.600 --> 01:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
April, protesting the government
and its handling of this
country's deepening crisis.

01:35.233 --> 01:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now that President
Maduro is pushing ahead
with his controversial
plan to convene a citizens

01:42.733 --> 01:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assembly and write up
a new constitution,
opposition protesters say
that a new constitution

01:48.966 --> 01:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will consolidate government
power and severely shrink
the political space
for the opposition.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
need a solution to problems
that Venezuelans confront every

01:56.766 --> 01:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
day, like shortages, insecurity.

01:59.066 --> 02:03.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NADJA DROST: The streets
have turned violent.

02:03.066 --> 02:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since early April, over
60 people have been killed
and 1,000 injured as a
result of protest-related

02:09.166 --> 02:11.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
violence.

02:11.700 --> 02:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most protesters march
peacefully, but a violent
minority has prompted
the government to call

02:17.000 --> 02:18.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them terrorists.

02:18.500 --> 02:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
An intensifying crackdown has
led to more than 2,500 arrests.

02:24.733 --> 02:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of them are represented by
attorney Jorge Ramos, who runs
a legal assistance group called

02:29.900 --> 02:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Venezuelan Penal Forum.

02:31.433 --> 02:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ramos says there's a benefit for
the government to detain people.

02:35.466 --> 02:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JORGE RAMOS, Venezuelan Penal
Forum: And the benefit is
intimidating this specific group

02:41.066 --> 02:41.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of society.

02:41.666 --> 02:43.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

02:43.200 --> 02:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Not to demonstrate, not to say
things against the government.

02:46.433 --> 02:51.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NADJA DROST: But even
intimidation tactics
can't seem to quell the
discontent of so many

02:53.033 --> 02:57.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Venezuelans, as the
crisis bleeds into
every aspect of life.

02:59.266 --> 03:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisbeth Vieras has worked for
nine years as a taxi driver
shuttling passengers to and

03:03.166 --> 03:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the Caracas Airport
to support herself, her
son and daughter Glorybeth.

03:10.066 --> 03:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was never a fan of Chavez
nor Maduro, but now that
tourism and business travel has

03:15.900 --> 03:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plummeted, she blames the
government for sending
the economy down the tube.

03:20.866 --> 03:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISBETH VIERAS, Venezuela
(through translator): There
are a lots of changes.

03:22.700 --> 03:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Two years ago, we could
make three to four daily
runs, today, only one.

03:26.466 --> 03:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Now, Vieras can
barely cover the cost of food
and her daughter's law studies

03:30.900 --> 03:32.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at university.

03:32.333 --> 03:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But her daughter's still
studying, luckier than others.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLORYBETH PARRA VIERAS,
Venezuela (through
translator): I have
peers who can't pay their

03:37.833 --> 03:39.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tuition.

03:39.366 --> 03:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's more important to eat in
this situation than to study.

03:42.033 --> 03:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: As Venezuela's
crisis deepens, the chorus of
voices calling for change grows.

03:50.166 --> 03:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael Penfold, a university
professor in Caracas and a
fellow at the Woodrow Wilson

03:54.733 --> 03:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Center, says that Chavismo
is failing to understand
that political and
economic conditions have

04:00.466 --> 04:02.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
changed.

04:02.433 --> 04:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL PENFOLD, Woodrow Wilson
Center: But the problem is
that this revolution, which

04:04.533 --> 04:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right now holds a minority, is
trying to run the country as
if they still held a majority

04:12.133 --> 04:17.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and as if they still had
this hegemonic sort of
impulse of controlling
society and controlling

04:20.533 --> 04:22.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
institutions.

04:22.700 --> 04:26.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NADJA DROST: Opponents
have protested delayed
regional elections and
the attempt to strip

04:27.866 --> 04:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
authority from the
opposition-held Congress.

04:31.333 --> 04:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Maduro's decree to create
a constituent assembly to draft
a new constitution, a move

04:40.633 --> 04:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they fear will favor only his
priorities, was the last straw.

04:47.500 --> 04:50.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This resident of a Caracas
barrio says it is yet another
political distraction.

04:50.566 --> 04:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
You see a lot of problems
here, and we know that this man

04:56.300 --> 04:58.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is inventing fictions.

04:58.366 --> 05:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead of looking for
solutions, he's looking to
entrench himself in power.

05:01.266 --> 05:02.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't want this.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What we want are solutions.

05:04.433 --> 05:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In my family, five people
have left the country.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Fleeing what?

05:09.100 --> 05:10.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There's crime.

05:10.533 --> 05:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You don't know when you leave
when you will come back.

05:12.600 --> 05:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I spent 18 hours to buy four
pounds of corn flour, 18 hours.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's not human.

05:20.366 --> 05:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: It isn't, but she
has a roof over head, which
is more than this group of

05:26.366 --> 05:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who find themselves
living on the streets,
scavenging for food
amidst the garbage.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is a desperate, but
organized activity.

05:32.333 --> 05:37.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They know the schedule
of the garbage truck,
and wait at restaurants
exactly when the garbage

05:39.200 --> 05:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is taken out, carry the
bags over to the riverside,
and comb through it.

05:42.100 --> 05:47.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Pedro, who didn't want
to be identified by his
full name, used to work
as a graphic designer,

05:48.166 --> 05:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but can't find work.

05:50.633 --> 05:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEDRO, Venezuela (through
translator): I found
myself short of money
when I was renting a

05:52.066 --> 05:53.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
room, and the solution
was the streets.

05:53.833 --> 05:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NADJA DROST: He says more and
more people join them every day.

05:58.333 --> 06:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEDRO (through translator):
Everyone who comes here
arrives skinny, and
gains weight because,

06:04.066 --> 06:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in reality, we eat.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People may say that we
eat garbage, but now
many of them envy us
because we have something

06:09.033 --> 06:11.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in our stomachs.

06:11.100 --> 06:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: As more and more
Venezuelans find themselves
in dire situations, more are

06:17.266 --> 06:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pulled towards political groups
in the opposition coalition,
in search of a response to the

06:20.900 --> 06:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
crisis, like the
Voluntad Popular Party.

06:24.733 --> 06:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At its helm is Freddy Guevara,
one of several young opposition
members of Congress who are

06:31.133 --> 06:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
playing a key role in organizing
the anti-government marches.

06:33.233 --> 06:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FREDDY GUEVARA, Voluntad Popular
Party (through translator): We
have reached the point where

06:35.166 --> 06:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all constitutional doors
have been closed on us.

06:37.933 --> 06:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's pushed everyone to
head out into the streets.

06:40.566 --> 06:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: For Guevara and
other hard-line government
opponents, it all comes down to

06:46.733 --> 06:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one central demand:
that Maduro leave.

06:48.733 --> 06:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FREDDY GUEVARA (through
translator): There is no way to
solve all these problems with

06:51.866 --> 06:54.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Maduro at the head.

06:54.200 --> 06:59.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NADJA DROST: At home
in a high-rise complex
of free housing built
under Chavez, Darwuin

07:01.133 --> 07:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hernandez fears a new government
would turn their back on
the interests of the poor in

07:04.833 --> 07:07.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
particular.

07:07.266 --> 07:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARWUIN HERNANDEZ, Venezuela
(through translator):
What has the revolution
and socialism given

07:10.266 --> 07:12.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me?

07:12.300 --> 07:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, this humble home where
I am, thanks to God first
and to Chavez, and to Maduro.

07:15.933 --> 07:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's what I always wanted,
a decent home, nothing else.

07:20.533 --> 07:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Professor
Penfold says the opposition
shouldn't underestimate
the power of Chavismo.

07:27.766 --> 07:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL PENFOLD: I don't think
that you can move out of this
situation without an important

07:34.233 --> 07:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fracture happening within
the government coalition.

07:37.300 --> 07:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Guevara and the
opposition are counting on
government dissidents to help

07:43.033 --> 07:44.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bring down Maduro.

07:44.966 --> 07:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FREDDY GUEVARA (through
translator): That is to say
that, every day, there are more

07:47.400 --> 07:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
players inside the regime
that move away from Maduro.

07:50.166 --> 07:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This way, he won't have the
power to impose his will.

07:54.166 --> 07:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: But until and
if that happens, Venezuela is
stuck in political deadlock.

08:01.166 --> 08:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL PENFOLD: It's also a
country -- and I have to say
this -- with horror, that cannot

08:11.566 --> 08:15.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stay in the situation
it is for a longer time.

08:15.233 --> 08:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Taxi driver Vieras
can hardly cope with worries
over the chaos and insecurity,

08:21.333 --> 08:23.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and her kids.

08:23.300 --> 08:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISBETH VIERAS (through
translator): She, for example,
she escapes and goes off to the

08:28.300 --> 08:30.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
marches.

08:30.233 --> 08:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says, "Mama, if I tell
you I'm going to the protest,
you won't let me go."

08:33.733 --> 08:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Vieras knows that
when her daughter runs off to
marches, she always takes her

08:38.333 --> 08:39.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cap.

08:39.966 --> 08:41.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's become her way
of checking in on her
daughter's whereabouts.

08:41.933 --> 08:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISBETH VIERAS (through
translator): I call her brother
and I say, go to her room and

08:46.300 --> 08:48.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
see if her hat is there.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLORYBETH PARRA VIERAS (through
