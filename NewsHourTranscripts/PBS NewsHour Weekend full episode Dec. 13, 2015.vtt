HERE IN NEW YORK.

02:01.233 --> 02:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE BIG QUESTION IS, WHAT IS

02:02.100 --> 02:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS MEAN FOR UNITED STATES?

02:03.700 --> 02:06.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> FOR THE UNITED STATES, THIS

02:06.167 --> 02:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEANS THAT WE ARE DONE WITH 20

02:08.600 --> 02:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS OF FIGHTING OVER THE BASIC

02:14.100 --> 02:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARCHITECTURE AGREEMENT AND IF WE

02:15.067 --> 02:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLESH THIS OUT RIGHT WE WILL

02:16.433 --> 02:18.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE A FRAMEWORK SO WE CAN HAVE

02:18.767 --> 02:19.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE FRAME OF WORK INTO WHAT

02:19.967 --> 02:21.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER COUNTRIES ARE DOING,

02:21.167 --> 02:22.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGULAR PROCESS FOR PRESSING

02:22.567 --> 02:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM TO DO MORE, AND SOME

02:25.400 --> 02:26.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREATER CERTAINTY ABOUT THE

02:26.367 --> 02:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERNATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT WE

02:27.267 --> 02:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE WORKING IN.

02:28.733 --> 02:31.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sreenivasan: THESE ARE BIG

02:31.067 --> 02:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPROMISES MADE FROM A LOT OF

02:32.700 --> 02:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT DID THE UNITED STATES WANT

02:34.900 --> 02:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IT DID NOT GET.

02:40.733 --> 02:42.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDGE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE

02:42.567 --> 02:43.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING

02:43.767 --> 02:44.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRIES.

02:44.667 --> 02:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS HAS BEEN THE FIGHT FOR

02:45.700 --> 02:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WOULD HAVE LIKED EXACTLY THE

02:47.800 --> 02:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAME LANGUAGE ABOUT OBLIGATION

02:49.900 --> 02:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

UPDATING THEY'RE COMMITMENTS,

02:56.867 --> 02:59.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF A DEAL.

02:59.867 --> 03:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY GOT A LOT OF THESE

03:01.933 --> 03:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISTINCTIONS REMOVED BUT THERE

03:02.900 --> 03:04.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE BITS AND PIECES IN THE

03:04.467 --> 03:07.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGREEMENT AND THERE WILL BE A

03:07.367 --> 03:10.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGN WE'LL CONTINUE TO FIGHT

03:10.067 --> 03:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER THOSE IN THE COMING YEARS.

03:12.633 --> 03:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> A SCUFFLE OVER THE AGREEMENT,

03:16.000 --> 03:19.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER THE WORD, WHETHER IT SHALL

03:19.567 --> 03:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR SHOULD, COUNTRIES SHALL OR

03:23.900 --> 03:26.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULD, MAKE IT'S GONE TOWARDS

03:26.867 --> 03:28.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULD AND EVERYTHING SEEMS

03:28.567 --> 03:29.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RATHER VOLUNTARY.

03:29.267 --> 03:30.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ULTIMATELY ALL OF THESE STEPS

03:30.867 --> 03:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE VOLUNTEER.

03:31.700 --> 03:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE SAW IN THE KYOTO PROTOCOL,

03:38.400 --> 03:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRIES DIDN'T ADHERE TO

03:39.800 --> 03:40.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYHOW.

03:40.867 --> 03:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE CAN GET OVERLY OBSESSED WITH

03:43.600 --> 03:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULD OR SHALL.

03:45.000 --> 03:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION THE

03:45.700 --> 03:46.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES WAS FOCUSED ON

03:46.967 --> 03:48.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS THAT SHALL WOULD HAVE

03:48.767 --> 03:50.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENT THE AGREEMENT TO THE SENATE

03:50.567 --> 03:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR RATIFICATION WHERE IT WOULD

03:51.800 --> 03:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE DIED AND SHOULD ALLOWS TO

03:53.833 --> 03:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT ACTUALLY EXIST.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO BETTER TO HAVE AN AGREEMENT

03:57.600 --> 03:59.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY PERFECT

03:59.967 --> 04:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT EXISTS BUT ONE THAT YOU LOVE

04:01.733 --> 04:05.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT CAN NEVER SUPPLY.

04:05.467 --> 04:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHAT ARE THE

04:06.400 --> 04:07.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMITMENTS THAT THE UNITED

04:07.667 --> 04:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES HAS TO MAKE, EVEN THOUGH

04:09.200 --> 04:10.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO GO TO

04:10.467 --> 04:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESS?

04:11.200 --> 04:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL WE HAVE TO CREATE LAUDS

04:14.033 --> 04:15.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING, THIS IS HOW WE WILL

04:15.367 --> 04:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECREASE OUR EMISSIONS?

04:16.733 --> 04:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE ARE TWO BASIC ELEMENTS

04:18.200 --> 04:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST THE UNITED STATES HAS MADE

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A PLEDGE TO REDUCE ITS EMISSIONS

04:24.000 --> 04:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
26 TO 28% BELOW ITS LEVELS BY

04:28.433 --> 04:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2025.

04:28.933 --> 04:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHOUT NEW POLICIES WE ARE NOT

04:30.233 --> 04:32.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO GET THERE.

04:32.067 --> 04:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHETHER THERE NEED TO BE NEW

04:35.033 --> 04:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAWS OR NEW QUALIFICATIONS UNDER

04:40.567 --> 04:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CURRENT LAWS, REMAINS TO BE
