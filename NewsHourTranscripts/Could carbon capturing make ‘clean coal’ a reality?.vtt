JUDY WOODRUFF: The future
of coal is very much at the
center of debate right now when

00:04.766 --> 00:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it comes to the politics
and business of energy.

00:07.933 --> 00:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whatever you may think about
those questions, the U.S.
still uses a lot of coal.

00:12.900 --> 00:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About 30 percent of our
energy, of our electricity
is generated by it.

00:17.366 --> 00:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For some, the Holy Grail is
new technology that captures
some of coal's worst problems

00:23.133 --> 00:25.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with greenhouse gases.

00:25.400 --> 00:29.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien reports
on the largest facility
trying to do so.

00:29.133 --> 00:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our weekly
series on the Leading Edge
of science and technology.

00:33.300 --> 00:38.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: At the
W.A. Parish power plant
southwest of Houston,
they are piling up coal,

00:40.333 --> 00:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting ready for another
long, hot, aggressively
air-conditioned summer.

00:46.933 --> 00:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the largest fossil fuel
power plants in the country,
Parish can generate about

00:49.733 --> 00:54.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
one-fifth of the city's
electricity using coal-
and gas-fired turbines.

00:56.400 --> 01:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it is leading the
nation down a promising,
yet problematic path.

01:01.133 --> 01:06.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Here, they are trying
to make clean coal more
than a political slogan.

01:07.566 --> 01:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mauricio Gutierrez is CEO
of NRG, owner of the plant.

01:11.733 --> 01:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAURICIO GUTIERREZ, President
and CEO, NRG: We built the
world's largest carbon capture

01:14.900 --> 01:18.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
system on an existing
coal-fired power plant.

01:18.233 --> 01:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the first commercial
scale facility of this
kind in the United States.

01:22.800 --> 01:27.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: They are
capturing and storing
carbon dioxide, the
greenhouse gas that is

01:28.966 --> 01:31.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the main driver
of global warming.

01:31.200 --> 01:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is prompting some
unexpected support from members
of the Trump administration.

01:35.700 --> 01:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Listen to Energy Secretary
Rick Perry at the ceremonial
opening in April.

01:39.766 --> 01:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK PERRY, U.S. Secretary of
Energy: I think the solutions
to many of the challenges that

01:43.333 --> 01:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have in the world today
are displayed behind me.

01:50.333 --> 01:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The same Rick
Perry who wrote a book calling
climate scientists members

01:53.233 --> 01:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a secular carbon cult who
manipulate data and climate
science a contrived, phony mess,

02:00.500 --> 02:02.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
but not here.

02:02.566 --> 02:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK PERRY: It shows we don't
have to pit the environment
on one side weighing and the

02:07.600 --> 02:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
economy on the other side.

02:10.266 --> 02:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We can and we will be
good stewards of both.

02:14.833 --> 02:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The steward of
this project for NRG is David
Greeson, the vice president

02:20.733 --> 02:22.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of development.

02:22.733 --> 02:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID GREESON, Vice President
of Development, NRG: We're
interested in doing more carbon

02:24.700 --> 02:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
capture as a part of our overall
sustainable energy future
plan, and so we're going to

02:30.700 --> 02:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
see how this one works.

02:32.800 --> 02:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They call the
billion-dollar carbon capture
and storage system Petra Nova.

02:38.833 --> 02:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NRG built it in partnership
with the Japanese oil company
JX Nippon using a $190 million

02:44.933 --> 02:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grant from the Department
of Energy doled out during
the Obama administration.

02:49.233 --> 02:54.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID GREESON: So we're
capturing about 200
tons of CO2 per hour.

02:56.100 --> 03:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On an annual basis, that's
about 1.6 million tons per year.

03:00.533 --> 03:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the equivalent of 350,000
cars being taken off the road.

03:04.800 --> 03:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: While it may
be the world's largest carbon
capture facility, it is still

03:09.300 --> 03:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only removing about 10 percent
of the CO2 created by the
four coal-fired generators

03:14.966 --> 03:16.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

03:16.166 --> 03:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The only obstacle to
capturing more is money.

03:18.966 --> 03:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID GREESON: We're just now
reaching the point where this
technology is mature enough

03:23.266 --> 03:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be considered for rollout
to the broad coal-fired fleet
in the United States and

03:30.433 --> 03:31.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the world.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN:
Here's how it works.

03:33.733 --> 03:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Flue gas, with carbon dioxide
in it, flows through a duct to
the carbon capture facility.

03:40.333 --> 03:44.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
One vessel contains
amine, an ammonia-based
chemical in liquid form.

03:45.766 --> 03:48.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It naturally binds
with carbon dioxide.

03:48.033 --> 03:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With the carbon now in solution,
the liquid goes to another
vessel, where it is heated

03:52.733 --> 03:54.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

03:54.766 --> 03:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As that happens, the
process is reversed and
the CO2 pops out as a gas.

04:00.800 --> 04:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is captured, and, after
it is compressed, ready
for underground storage.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL WEBBERÑMD-BOÑ,
University of Texas at Austin:
I think Petra Nova is a shining

04:06.866 --> 04:11.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
example of what technology
offers, and so, as an engineer,
I'm very enthusiastic about

04:11.066 --> 04:12.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

04:12.066 --> 04:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it's very exciting.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Michael Webber
is deputy director of the Energy
Institute at the University

04:16.800 --> 04:18.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Texas at Austin.

04:18.633 --> 04:22.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He says the energy
sector is watching this
project very closely.

04:22.933 --> 04:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL WEBBER: We're getting a
lot of scrutiny because people
want to know if carbon capture

04:26.800 --> 04:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and sequestration will work.

04:28.866 --> 04:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are examples around
the nation, around the world
where it hasn't really quite

04:31.300 --> 04:33.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
come together the
way people want.

04:33.333 --> 04:36.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really expensive and hard
to do, so you wouldn't do it
unless you had to, or it's

04:36.266 --> 04:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in your economic favor to do so.

04:38.200 --> 04:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And a
coincidence of geography
has made that possible here.

04:42.500 --> 04:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The CO2 from the Petra Nova
facility is sent 80 miles to
the southwest, to the West Ranch

04:48.866 --> 04:50.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
oil field.

04:50.400 --> 04:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here, the gas is as good as
gold, black gold, Texas tea.

04:54.833 --> 04:58.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JILL FISK, Senior Vice
President, Hilcorp: That
was the hope, if you
marry up a partnership

04:58.866 --> 05:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between a CO2 emitter where
they can capture the CO2 and
reduce their CO2 emissions, but

05:05.533 --> 05:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then that CO2 can be used
to increase oil production.

05:10.033 --> 05:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's really a win-win.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Jill Fisk is
a senior vice president for
Hilcorp, the current operator

05:15.900 --> 05:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of this oil field, which
first opened in the 1930s.

05:20.166 --> 05:24.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
At its peak in the
'70s, it produced 50,000
barrels of oil a day.

05:24.833 --> 05:28.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Today, it's down to less
than 300 barrels a day.

05:28.533 --> 05:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Normally, it would be time
to cap the wells here.

05:31.900 --> 05:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, instead, they're drilling
new ones, getting ready to pump
a lot more oil by injecting

05:37.766 --> 05:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
carbon dioxide deep underground.

05:40.466 --> 05:45.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Liquid CO2 has been used to
liberate the most stubborn
oil for about 40 years.

05:47.500 --> 05:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JILL FISK: Essentially, what's
happening is the oil is stuck
to rock, if you can imagine

05:50.633 --> 05:52.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

05:52.666 --> 05:56.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The CO2 is injected,
it dissolves into that
oil that's stuck to the
rock, loosens up the

05:58.600 --> 06:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oil, lightens it up, which --
so it can then flow toward a
producer and produce additional

06:02.700 --> 06:04.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
oil.

06:04.766 --> 06:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At West Ranch, we're expecting
to recover an additional 60
million barrels of oil that

06:07.933 --> 06:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would otherwise be left in the
ground and be unrecoverable
without a project of this

06:11.966 --> 06:14.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
type.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Right now,
with oil prices so low, Petra
Nova is breaking even, but,

06:17.333 --> 06:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the next decade, they
expect to make a tidy profit
capturing and burying carbon

06:22.800 --> 06:24.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dioxide.

06:24.833 --> 06:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But doesn't this just transfer
greenhouse gas emissions
from a power plant smokestack

06:29.300 --> 06:31.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to automobile tailpipes?

06:31.400 --> 06:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JILL FISK: So, I think that
demand for oil is either going
to be met by foreign oil that

06:37.733 --> 06:41.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the United States has
to purchase or by our
own production that
we're able to supply.

06:41.166 --> 06:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So this project is breathing
new life into a field in the
U.S. to help supply that demand

06:46.666 --> 06:48.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for oil.

06:48.700 --> 06:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But how
can we be certain buried
CO2 will stay underground?

06:54.700 --> 06:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Scientists from the University
of Texas are running tests at
22 monitoring wells at West

06:58.533 --> 07:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ranch, getting baseline data
so they will know later if
the injected CO2 triggers some

07:05.500 --> 07:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unintended consequences, like
earthquakes or the release
of deep dwelling salt water,

07:10.733 --> 07:13.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
minerals, or chemicals.

07:13.066 --> 07:17.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At this test site in Austin,
they are finding new ways
to monitor the buried CO2.

07:17.866 --> 07:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUE HOVORKA, University of Texas
at Austin: You ready to start?

07:20.433 --> 07:23.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: They pump
the gas into groundwater
to simulate leaks.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They use a sensor
that measures light.

07:26.800 --> 07:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is coated with a polymer that
thins when it reacts with CO2.

07:31.466 --> 07:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there's any trouble,
the sensor detects more
light, and an alarm is
transmitted automatically.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Geologist Sue Hovorka
leads this effort.

07:40.166 --> 07:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUE HOVORKA: We need to get
good enough to provide value
to the atmosphere, and we need

07:44.333 --> 07:46.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to avoid unacceptable
consequences.

07:46.600 --> 07:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Hovorka analyzes
deep rock core samples stored
in a cavernous warehouse

07:52.933 --> 07:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the Bureau of Economic
Geology in Austin.

07:55.800 --> 08:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says there are ample places
to bury carbon dioxide produced
by all types of fossil fuel

08:02.033 --> 08:04.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
power plants, not
just coal burners.

08:04.466 --> 08:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That would be a
monumental step toward
addressing climate change.

08:08.033 --> 08:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUE HOVORKA: If consumers want
to use coal and want to reduce
the carbon from that, the

08:12.900 --> 08:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
system to do that
is ready to go.

08:14.233 --> 08:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have to pay for it.

08:16.433 --> 08:18.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not outrageous.

08:18.366 --> 08:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's totally possible,
but it's not free.

08:20.500 --> 08:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Up until now,
clean coal has been nothing
more than a marketing myth.

08:27.333 --> 08:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It could become a reality at
no small cost, but at a small
fraction of the toll if the

08:32.000 --> 08:34.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
industry does nothing
to stop global warming.

08:34.300 --> 08:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Richmond, Texas, I'm Miles
O'Brien for the "PBS NewsHour."

08:38.166 --> 08:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And as Miles
just said, costs are just one
of the questions about whether

08:44.300 --> 08:46.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this model could be
replicated more widely.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Miles joins me
now from Boston.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Miles, tell us more
about why -- and so this is
the first plant of its kind.

08:53.533 --> 08:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What are the challenges
in trying to replicate
this somewhere else and
getting the same results?

09:00.600 --> 09:03.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well,
Judy, the secret sauce
of this one, according
to the innovators behind

09:05.366 --> 09:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it, is, they reduced the cost
of creating the carbon capture.

09:11.433 --> 09:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
When I say cost,
the cost in power.

09:14.233 --> 09:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Normally, what the assumption
is, that it reduces the output
of any given power plant

09:20.800 --> 09:24.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
by as much as 30 percent
in order to run the
carbon capture system.

09:24.466 --> 09:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What they did in this case was
they decided not to use the
actual turbines which light

09:31.933 --> 09:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the lights that I'm using
right now, but rather a
separate co-generation
plant air, a smaller

09:35.966 --> 09:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
power plant on site that can
be run much more efficiently.

09:38.033 --> 09:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they say that they -- it's
costing them about 15 percent
of the power-generating capacity

09:44.066 --> 09:45.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of that plant.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that's a big hurdle
that they have gotten over.

09:47.500 --> 09:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, 15 percent is still a
big number, and unless you
have some commodity or the CO2

09:53.300 --> 09:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has some value, the business
model doesn't add up just yet.

09:56.900 --> 10:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you were
telling us, Miles, there are
also some physical challenges as

10:01.566 --> 10:03.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

10:03.633 --> 10:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, being 80
miles near an old oil field that
could use that CO2 to capture

10:09.466 --> 10:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and recover a lot of
stubborn oil from the
ground makes it all work.

10:11.833 --> 10:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is, could a
fossil fuel plant of any kind
that's a long way away from an

10:15.733 --> 10:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
oil field, could it avail itself
of this kind of transaction?

10:20.733 --> 10:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And CO2 can be pumped in
pipelines for an indefinite
amount of distance, as long as

10:27.300 --> 10:30.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you recompress every now
and then, sort of have
a booster system in.

10:30.333 --> 10:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, again, that's going
to be a significant cost.

10:33.366 --> 10:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is not an insurmountable
thing technologically,
and it could be done.

10:37.533 --> 10:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We already have significant CO2
pipelines in the oil sector.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You could extend it out, if
you were determined to do this.

10:44.266 --> 10:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, just
quickly, you were also saying
other practical limits.

10:48.233 --> 10:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, yes.

10:50.333 --> 10:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's -- the limits on this are
-- there are some concerns,
for example, about putting

10:56.733 --> 10:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CO2 in seismically active
places, for example.

10:59.933 --> 11:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You wouldn't want to put
buried CO2 underneath San
Francisco, for example.

11:04.133 --> 11:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, having said all that, when
you consider all the places
that it can be stored, the

11:11.133 --> 11:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
experts tell me, we have enough
storage capacity underneath the
continental United States to

11:13.900 --> 11:16.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
last about 900 years
of CO2 production.

11:16.933 --> 11:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's just a question of
societal priorities and whether
we want to pay a little more for

11:20.633 --> 11:23.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
power to get the
carbon dioxide out.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Miles
O'Brien, thanks very much.

11:25.533 --> 11:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN:
You're welcome, Judy.
