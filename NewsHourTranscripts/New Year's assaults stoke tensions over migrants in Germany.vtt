JUDY WOODRUFF: But, first, in
the German city
of Cologne, more than 100 women
have filed

00:03.904 --> 00:09.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
complaints about being sexually
molested by
men described as being of --
quote -- "North

00:09.409 --> 00:11.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
African or Arab origin."

00:11.612 --> 00:16.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attacks have polarized
public opinion
in Germany over its open door
policy, which

00:16.583 --> 00:21.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has seen it take in more than a
million asylum
seekers amid the refugee crisis.

00:21.588 --> 00:25.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Cologne, special
correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports.

00:25.826 --> 00:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Dominated by
its magnificent
cathedral, Cologne has a
reputation for great

00:33.233 --> 00:38.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tolerance. But the city's
open-mindedness
has been stretched to the limit
by what happened

00:38.238 --> 00:43.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beneath the spires and near the
railway station
as the new year fireworks were
let off in

00:43.277 --> 00:47.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an aggressive manner by some of
those in the
crowd.

00:47.314 --> 00:59.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It took several days for the
full extent of
the criminal activity to be
revealed. This

00:59.059 --> 01:04.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
young woman, who asked to remain
anonymous,
was one of more than 100 who
were assaulted.

01:04.531 --> 01:09.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): All
of a sudden,
these men around us began
groping us. They

01:09.169 --> 01:13.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
touched our behinds and grabbed
between our
legs. They touched us
everywhere. So, my girlfriend

01:13.974 --> 01:18.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted to get out of the crowd.
When I turned
around, one guy grabbed my bag
and ripped

01:18.045 --> 01:22.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it off my body. I thought to
myself that,
if we stay here in this crowd,
they could

01:22.115 --> 01:25.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kill us, they could rape us, and
nobody would
notice.

01:25.218 --> 01:29.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought we simply had to
accept it. There
was no one around us who helped
or was in

01:29.356 --> 01:35.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a position to help. All I wanted
was to get
out. I was scared that I
wouldn't leave this

01:35.629 --> 01:39.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crowd alive. I was scared that
if someone
showed up with a knife, I could
be raped in

01:39.166 --> 01:42.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the middle of the street.

01:42.035 --> 01:46.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have nightmares at night and I
can't sleep
anymore. I am too scared to go
outside on

01:46.173 --> 01:49.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my own. And, of course, I'm now
scared to
go to big cities.

01:49.343 --> 01:54.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Writer Alice
Schwarzer is
regarded as one of Germany's
leading women's

01:54.715 --> 01:59.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rights activists. She believes
what happened
in Cologne marks a line in the
sand in the

01:59.586 --> 02:01.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
debate over immigration.

02:01.488 --> 02:05.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALICE SCHWARZER, Women's Rights
Activist (through
translator): In the last 40
years, we have

02:05.158 --> 02:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very successfully fought for our
rights as
women, for our freedom, for our
access to

02:09.296 --> 02:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world, and that we are free
to move around
in it. And it's going to stay
that way, of

02:13.533 --> 02:15.435 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
course.

02:15.469 --> 02:18.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If someone has to change, then
it's the men
who come from cultures where
women are traditionally

02:18.271 --> 02:23.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
robbed of their rights, where
they are repressed
and the victims of violence.
These men have

02:23.043 --> 02:27.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been brutalized by the violence
and trauma
of war. They have problems, and
I don't want

02:27.047 --> 02:31.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us to have problems because of
that. They
have to change and recognize the
values and

02:31.551 --> 02:33.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
laws of our states
unconditionally.

02:33.387 --> 02:38.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Parts of this
city have been
described as being as no-go
zones for women,

02:38.425 --> 02:42.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but some have been out on the
streets demanding
that they should be free to move
where they

02:42.229 --> 02:47.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wish without fear of being
attacked. They
demanded action from Chancellor
Angela Merkel,

02:47.567 --> 02:51.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who gave her first reaction to
the events
in Cologne and elsewhere.

02:51.104 --> 02:56.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through
translator): What happened at
New Year is

02:56.076 --> 03:00.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
completely unacceptable. Those
are despicable
criminal acts which a state will
not accept,

03:00.847 --> 03:05.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including Germany. That's why an
intensive
investigation by the relevant
institutions

03:05.552 --> 03:09.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is under way. This investigation
must be supported.

03:09.289 --> 03:13.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The feeling women had in this
case of being
completely defenseless and at
mercy is, for

03:13.860 --> 03:18.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me, personally intolerable, and
so it is important
that everything that happened
must come out

03:18.231 --> 03:22.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the open. It's right and
it's good that
there are a lot of police
reports being filed.

03:23.003 --> 03:27.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: These two young
Germans,
both with immigrant backgrounds,
are deeply

03:27.574 --> 03:32.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
troubled by what happened. The
man with the
glasses, Mimoun Berrissoun,
whose parents

03:32.412 --> 03:37.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are from Morocco, heads a group
dedicated
to deradicalizing young Muslims
and promoting

03:37.751 --> 03:39.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
integration.

03:39.619 --> 03:44.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIMOUN BERRISSOUN, Turn 180
Degrees (through
translator): When groups of
people from other

03:44.591 --> 03:48.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries come here, the first
thing they
have to do is learn the rules.
They have to

03:48.829 --> 03:52.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
develop a sense of what they can
and can't
do.

03:52.065 --> 03:56.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's possible they had the idea
in their heads
that it would be easier to get
with European

03:56.536 --> 04:01.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women than it actually is, and
that they had
brought this idea with them from
home, and

04:01.675 --> 04:06.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tried to make it reality here.
But I also
believe this is a very small
group of people

04:06.146 --> 04:10.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who behaved this way in that
moment.

04:10.383 --> 04:16.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Talha Evran,
who is of Turkish
ancestry, is worried about the
impact these

04:16.256 --> 04:19.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacks will have on immigrants
who abide
by German laws.

04:19.626 --> 04:22.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TALHA EVRAN, Germany: The right
wing is going
to use that as a big argument.
They have been

04:22.863 --> 04:28.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
waiting for that. And that is so
sad, because
there is big issue, this
conversation, this

04:28.201 --> 04:30.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
discussion.

04:30.070 --> 04:36.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we Germans are trying to
talk good about
them. Like, we're trying to
welcome refugees.

04:36.943 --> 04:44.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if there are people
harassing people on
New Year's Eve being asylum
seekers or refugees,

04:44.050 --> 04:50.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you know, that's just
endangering all of that
welcoming, welcome culture.
That's what we

04:50.090 --> 04:51.925 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
call it.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Tonight,
outside the scene
of the New Year's Eve assaults,
the right-wing

04:55.295 --> 04:59.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group known as Alternative for
Germany was
out canvassing for support.
Their polling

04:59.733 --> 05:01.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
numbers are on the rise.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Supporter Helmut Vanichek:

05:03.136 --> 05:08.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HELMUT VANICHEK, Germany
(through translator):
Those guilty of crimes, but also
those whose

05:08.074 --> 05:12.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
asylum applications are
rejected, must leave
the country, in accordance with
German law.

05:12.879 --> 05:17.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: When the scale
of the attacks
first emerged, senior government
officials

05:17.417 --> 05:22.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were at pains to separate the
issue of the
refugee crisis from the criminal
activity.

05:22.923 --> 05:28.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now the German authorities
say they are
18 asylum seekers among the 31
people suspected

05:28.962 --> 05:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of involvement in the troubles
on New Year's
Eve. Some of those people could
be deported

05:33.867 --> 05:35.669 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
if convicted.

05:35.702 --> 05:39.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the perceived lack of
control has
led to Cologne's police chief
being relieved

05:39.839 --> 05:44.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his duties. The officers
union believes
that he's been made a scapegoat,
claiming

05:44.177 --> 05:48.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that government policies have
undermined their
ability to police properly.

05:48.548 --> 05:52.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
