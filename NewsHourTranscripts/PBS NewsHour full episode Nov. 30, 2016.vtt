JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
President-elect Donald Trump
appoints senior

00:10.777 --> 00:12.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
members of his economic team.

00:13.013 --> 00:18.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We look at who the men he wants
to run the
Treasury and Commerce
Departments are and

00:18.418 --> 00:20.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what changes they may make.

00:20.254 --> 00:23.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Wednesday,
former Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright

00:23.857 --> 00:28.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and former National Security
Adviser Stephen
Hadley are here to discuss the
future of the

00:28.462 --> 00:30.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Middle East under a Trump
presidency.

00:30.364 --> 00:36.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And bringing
Silicon Valley
to Salinas Valley -- how a poor
farming community

00:36.470 --> 00:40.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in California is using
technology to revive
its economy.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK ZELAYA, Co-Founder,
HeavyConnect:
We believe that, when it comes
to ag-tech,

00:42.776 --> 00:46.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you can make it in the
Salinas Valley,
you're going to be able to have
a product

00:46.346 --> 00:47.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that will be adopted globally.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:50.717 --> 00:54.955 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:54.988 --> 01:08.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As the picture of
the Cabinet
president-elect Trump wants is
filled in,

01:08.035 --> 01:13.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're seeing more figures who
reflect deep
ties to Washington or Wall
Street.

01:13.240 --> 01:18.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a contrast with his
campaign, during
which he disparaged the power
centers as corrupt

01:18.812 --> 01:21.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and out of touch with ordinary
Americans.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has our report.

01:23.517 --> 01:27.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Two fronts for
the transition
of power today.

01:27.154 --> 01:31.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Washington, vice
president-elect Mike Pence
worked on alliances with
Republican leaders

01:31.758 --> 01:37.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Capitol Hill, as, in New
York, team Trump
offered more Cabinet nominees
for Congress

01:37.497 --> 01:43.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to consider, including the
highest ranking
yet, financier Steven Mnuchin
for treasury

01:43.603 --> 01:45.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
secretary.

01:45.405 --> 01:46.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVE MNUCHIN, Treasury
Secretary Nominee:
I couldn't be more excited about
the opportunity

01:46.273 --> 01:48.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to work with him in the
administration.

01:48.108 --> 01:54.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And our number one priority is
going to be
the economy, get back to 3 to 4
percent growth.

01:54.314 --> 01:56.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We believe that's very
sustainable.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And focus on things for the
American worker.

01:58.986 --> 02:00.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's absolutely our priority.

02:00.787 --> 02:05.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Mnuchin's
resume is full
of Wall Street experience,
including 17 years

02:05.659 --> 02:07.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Goldman Sachs.

02:07.260 --> 02:09.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has no government experience.

02:09.763 --> 02:14.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the election, he headed
up fund-raising
operations for the Trump
campaign, and had

02:14.167 --> 02:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a hand in shaping candidate
Trump's message
on taxes.

02:18.305 --> 02:23.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If confirmed, he'd be tasked
with turning
that rhetoric into reality.

02:23.176 --> 02:28.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alongside him this morning on
CNBC, billionaire
investor Wilbur Ross, who is Mr.
Trump's pick

02:28.782 --> 02:32.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be the commerce secretary and
a point person
on trade policy.

02:32.819 --> 02:36.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILBUR ROSS, Commerce Secretary
Nominee: The
real trick is going to be
increase American

02:36.156 --> 02:37.691 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exports.

02:37.724 --> 02:42.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Get rid of some of the tariff
and non-tariff
barriers to American exports.

02:42.129 --> 02:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Ross is known
for turning
around troubled companies, where
he cuts costs

02:46.533 --> 02:49.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and sometimes worker benefits to
boost profits.

02:49.770 --> 02:56.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also owned the Sago coal mine
in West Virginia,
where a collapse killed 12
miners in 2006.

02:56.243 --> 02:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, "It was the worst week
of my entire
life."

02:59.713 --> 03:05.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump also picked out a
deputy for Ross,
Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd
Ricketts, a prominent

03:05.552 --> 03:11.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican donor who, at one
point in the
campaign, spoke out against
candidate Trump.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Trump made other jobs news
today, too.

03:14.494 --> 03:18.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Overnight, there was word that
he had cut
a deal with the air conditioner
maker Carrier

03:18.899 --> 03:21.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to keep 1,000 jobs in Indiana.

03:22.002 --> 03:26.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is most, but not all of the
jobs that
the company said it was going to
eliminate.

03:26.973 --> 03:31.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also today, there were questions
about Mr.
Trump's own business future when
he's president.

03:31.445 --> 03:36.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Twitter, he said he would
take himself
-- quote -- "completely out of
business operations,"

03:36.983 --> 03:41.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and indicated he will explain
how in a news
conference in two weeks.

03:41.521 --> 03:45.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also still unknown, who will be
Mr. Trump's
secretary of state.

03:45.392 --> 03:49.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect met a second
time with
one candidate, Mitt Romney, last
night in

03:49.629 --> 03:50.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
New York.

03:50.831 --> 03:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Afterwards, Mr. Trump's former
critic had
warm words.

03:54.034 --> 03:58.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MITT ROMNEY (R), Former
Presidential Candidate:
These discussions I have had
with him have

03:58.238 --> 04:00.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been enlightening, and
interesting, and engaging.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have enjoyed them very, very
much.

04:02.109 --> 04:07.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All this as
Green Party candidate
Jill Stein officially filed a
hand recount

04:07.414 --> 04:12.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
request in Michigan, the third
of three states
she has pledged to verify.

04:12.285 --> 04:14.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

04:14.454 --> 04:19.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will have
more on president-elect
Trump's picks right after our
news summary.

04:19.759 --> 04:23.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
The North Carolina police
officer who fatally

04:23.463 --> 04:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shot a black man in September
will not face
criminal charges.

04:26.933 --> 04:31.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The shooting of Keith Lamont
Scott, whose
family at first insisted he
wasn't armed,

04:31.104 --> 04:33.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sparked days of protests across
Charlotte.

04:33.440 --> 04:37.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the county prosecutor
said there was
evidence Scott was holding a
gun, and ignored

04:37.577 --> 04:39.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
repeated requests to drop it.

04:39.412 --> 04:42.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW MURRAY, District
Attorney: The central
issue is whether Officer Vinson
was lawful

04:42.249 --> 04:45.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in using deadly force against
Mr. Scott.

04:45.519 --> 04:49.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anyone is justified in using
deadly force
if he reasonably believed, and,
in fact, believed

04:49.222 --> 04:54.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he or someone else was in
imminent danger
of great bodily injury or death.

04:54.594 --> 04:58.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Scott's family
insisted
today's decision will not end
their inquiry.

JUDY WOODRUFF: The death toll

Mountains rose to seven today.

05:05.772 --> 05:11.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

injured and more
than 700 buildings were damaged
or destroyed.

05:11.211 --> 05:16.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heavy rain brought some relief
today, but,
at points, more than 200
firefighters were

05:16.583 --> 05:18.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
still fighting the flames.

05:18.318 --> 05:22.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GREG MILLER, Gatlinburg,
Tennessee, Fire Chief:
We have all seen how fires
rekindle.

05:22.956 --> 05:27.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whatever rain we got, and
these structures
may dry out and they could start
back.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have crews that are
monitoring those
and going back in those areas.

05:30.764 --> 05:34.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are driving through and
they're checking
and looking for hot spots.

05:34.100 --> 05:38.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Officials are
still investigating
what started the fires, but they
believe they

05:38.805 --> 05:40.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were likely caused by humans.

05:40.707 --> 05:44.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Powerful
storms soaked the
tinder-dry South overnight,
spawning tornadoes

05:44.945 --> 05:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that left five people dead.

05:46.880 --> 05:51.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The twisters tore through
Northeastern Alabama,
damaging buildings and killing
three people.

05:51.451 --> 05:55.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Across the border in Southern
Tennessee, two
others died, and dozens more
were injured.

05:55.355 --> 05:59.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some roads in the South were
drenched with
up to two feet of water, after
two months

05:59.793 --> 06:01.561 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
without rain.

06:01.595 --> 06:04.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There is word
today that the
pilot of the charter plane that
slammed into

06:04.864 --> 06:10.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colombia's Andes Mountains told
air traffic
controllers that he ran out of
fuel moments

06:10.971 --> 06:12.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before the crash.

06:12.472 --> 06:16.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is according to a leaked
recording of
the flight's final minutes.

06:16.309 --> 06:19.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All but six of the 77 people on
board died.

06:19.946 --> 06:22.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most were members of a Brazilian
soccer team.

06:22.182 --> 06:26.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Syria,
opposition activists
claimed nearly 50 civilians were
killed by

06:26.453 --> 06:31.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regime forces today as they fled
rebel-held
Eastern Aleppo.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most of the victims were women
and children.

06:33.426 --> 06:37.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Activists estimate more than
50,000 people
have been displaced by the
fighting in the

06:37.964 --> 06:39.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
past four days.

06:39.766 --> 06:44.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The director of
the CIA has
decried president-elect Donald
Trump's plan

06:44.304 --> 06:47.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to scrap the nuclear deal with
Iran.

06:47.340 --> 06:52.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a BBC interview, John Brennan
said -- quote
-- "I think it would be
disastrous.

06:52.379 --> 06:56.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it would be the height
of folly if
the next administration were to
tear up that

06:56.950 --> 06:58.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agreement."

06:58.752 --> 07:02.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brennan argued such a move would
open the
door for still other countries
to pursue nuclear

07:02.956 --> 07:04.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weapons.

07:07.193 --> 07:12.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, in response to its fifth,
and largest,
nuclear test in September.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The council unanimously approved
the resolution,
which will slash North Korea's
biggest export,

07:15.935 --> 07:18.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
coal, by at least 62 percent.

07:18.505 --> 07:22.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also bans the regime from
exporting metals
like copper, nickel, and silver.

07:22.942 --> 07:27.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democrats in the

of Representatives reelected
California's

07:27.247 --> 07:29.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nancy Pelosi as their leader
today.

07:29.816 --> 07:33.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The congresswoman has led the
party in the
House since 2002.

07:33.386 --> 07:41.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

07:41.528 --> 07:46.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Her win came despite
disenchantment from some
in her caucus after a
disappointing showing

07:46.766 --> 07:47.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in this month's elections.

07:49.536 --> 07:53.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader:
We have a responsibility, and we
embrace the

07:53.073 --> 07:56.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opportunity that is presented.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We know how to win elections.

07:57.711 --> 07:58.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have done it in the past.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will do it again.

08:01.081 --> 08:06.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Maryland
Congressman Steny
Hoyer was also reelected as
House Democratic

08:06.419 --> 08:08.288 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
whip.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The oil cartel
OPEC is decreasing
oil production for the first
time in eight

08:11.891 --> 08:13.660 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

08:13.693 --> 08:16.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Member nations agreed to a deal
that will
cut production by more than a
million barrels

08:16.463 --> 08:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a day, from its current daily
output of over
33 million barrels.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's all part of an effort to
boost lagging
oil prices.

08:24.003 --> 08:28.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That news sent
energy stocks
soaring on Wall Street today,
but markets

08:28.708 --> 08:30.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ended the day mixed.

08:30.210 --> 08:35.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained two
points to close at 19123.

08:35.849 --> 08:40.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq tumbled 56, and the
S&amp;P 500 slipped
nearly six.

08:40.720 --> 08:48.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the men who
will shape Trump's economic
agenda; on the

08:48.395 --> 08:53.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ground in a rapidly changing
Cuba; Madeleine
Albright and Stephen Hadley on
what to do

08:53.900 --> 09:01.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
next in the Mideast; and much
more.

09:01.841 --> 09:12.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, as we have been reporting,
the president-elect
began fleshing out his economic
team today

09:12.385 --> 09:16.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by announcing his choices to run
the Departments
of Treasury and Commerce.

09:16.723 --> 09:22.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In doing so, the candidate, who
campaigned
with a heavy dose of populism,
elevated individuals

09:22.128 --> 09:26.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
mainly known for their
connections to Wall
Street and high finance.

09:26.332 --> 09:30.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Wessel of the Brookings
Institution
and a contributing columnist to
The Wall Street

09:30.637 --> 09:32.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Journal joins me now.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome back to the program.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL, The Wall Street
Journal: Thank
you.

09:36.042 --> 09:38.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David, fill
out this picture
a little bit more of who --
let's start with

09:38.344 --> 09:39.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Steve Mnuchin.

09:39.712 --> 09:42.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's the pick to head the
Treasury Department.

09:42.882 --> 09:44.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What more do we know about him?

09:44.717 --> 09:48.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Well, it's just
wonderfully
ironic that Donald Trump, who
railed against

09:48.221 --> 09:53.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the elite, lambasted Hillary
Clinton for giving
paid speeches to Goldman Sachs,
turned to

09:53.393 --> 09:58.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a guy who not only was at
Goldman Sachs for
17 years, but is the son of a
Goldman Sachs

09:58.765 --> 10:02.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lifer and has a brother who is
at Goldman
Sachs.

10:02.135 --> 10:05.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so he's going -- he went to
Yale.

10:05.071 --> 10:06.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Wilbur Ross went to Yale.

10:06.840 --> 10:10.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems to a very anti-populist
kind of move
to pick these financiers for
these jobs.

10:11.010 --> 10:11.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

10:12.011 --> 10:13.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Excuse me.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're seeing some comments
from liberal
Democrats today who put out
statements saying

10:16.249 --> 10:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is somebody who made a lot
of money at
Goldman Sachs when the banks
were bailed out

10:21.120 --> 10:24.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the federal government, and
then he went
on and there was another -- he
left Goldman,

10:24.557 --> 10:28.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
went on and bought a bank, was
involved in
buying a bank in California.

10:28.561 --> 10:29.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us about that.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As you know, some of the
Democrats, Elizabeth
Warren and Bernie Sanders, think
anybody who

10:33.800 --> 10:37.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has ever worked for a bank
shouldn't be the
treasury secretary.

10:37.136 --> 10:40.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think other people feel -- I'm
among them
-- that really having some
experience on Wall

10:40.807 --> 10:43.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Street might be a good thing for
treasury
secretary.

10:43.343 --> 10:47.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the reason Mr. Mnuchin
is controversial
is not only that he comes from
Goldman Sachs,

10:47.847 --> 10:52.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is kind of the -- has been
the centerpiece
of a lot of criticism, but he
made a lot of

10:52.585 --> 10:55.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
money buying IndyMac when it was
in trouble.

10:55.121 --> 10:56.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is the bank
in California.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: The bank in
California.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then selling it, making a
bundle.

10:59.959 --> 11:04.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in between, he got a lot of
grief because
the bank was accused by consumer
groups of

11:04.597 --> 11:07.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
being very aggressive on
foreclosures.

11:07.066 --> 11:11.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it looks like he is a guy who
profited
off of the financial crisis that
caused so

11:11.204 --> 11:12.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
much harm elsewhere.

11:12.739 --> 11:15.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that clear
that he did profit
off the financial crisis?

11:15.575 --> 11:17.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: No.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he profited because he
bought a bank that
was in trouble cheap, fixed it
up and sold

11:21.014 --> 11:22.348 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, to that extent, he did make
money off
of the financial crisis.

11:24.417 --> 11:29.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he didn't -- he comes from
the mortgage
business, but he was not at
Goldman during

11:29.422 --> 11:31.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the worst of the abuses.

11:31.291 --> 11:35.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So in terms of
the accusation
that he was aggressively pushing
foreclosures?

11:35.395 --> 11:37.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: I don't know
enough about the
detail.

11:37.897 --> 11:38.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's accused of that.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There were a lot of protests.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clearly, the bank foreclosed on
a lot of people.

11:43.736 --> 11:45.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Lots of banks did that.

11:45.471 --> 11:48.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether he did more than other
people or his
bank did more than other people,
I really

11:48.107 --> 11:49.075 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
don't know.

11:49.108 --> 11:50.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, let's talk about the
Commerce Department.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wilbur Ross is
the pick to
be secretary of commerce.

11:54.113 --> 11:55.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.

11:55.848 --> 11:58.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I think Commerce is
interesting, but much
less important than Treasury in
general.

11:58.918 --> 12:04.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What makes Wilbur Ross so
important is that
he was close to President Trump
for the whole

12:04.390 --> 12:06.192 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

12:06.225 --> 12:09.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Steve Mnuchin joined relatively
late in the
campaign, only six months before
the election,

12:09.662 --> 12:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raised a lot of money, kind of
bought a lottery
ticket by betting on Donald
Trump, and won.

12:14.233 --> 12:19.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wilbur Ross has been very
influential in talking
about Donald Trump and to Donald
Trump and

12:19.839 --> 12:23.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seems to have strong feelings,
as does Donald
Trump, about trade.

12:23.810 --> 12:28.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Commerce Department does
have some
responsibilities for trade and
tariffs, which

12:28.348 --> 12:33.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump has threatened to
raise if our
trading partners don't play
ball.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Wilbur Ross,
a billionaire,
made his money how?

12:36.956 --> 12:38.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Correct.

12:38.791 --> 12:43.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By buying companies that were in
bad shape,
fixing them up, laying off
workers, and selling

12:43.096 --> 12:45.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them and making money, some of
it overseas,
and some of it here.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's made a lot of money doing
business in
China, which is kind of ironic,
since the

12:49.969 --> 12:52.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump people seem to look at
China as the
enemy now.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as you say,
talking about
trade.

12:54.474 --> 12:59.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, number two at Commerce,
Donald Trump
named Todd Ricketts, co-owner of
the Chicago

12:59.979 --> 13:01.014 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Cubs.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

13:02.048 --> 13:03.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.617 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

13:04.651 --> 13:05.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I guess that means that
Donald Trump will
get good seats at Wrigley Field.

13:05.852 --> 13:07.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, at least he comes from the
Middle West.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He doesn't come from New York.

13:09.489 --> 13:10.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He didn't go to Yale or Harvard.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He went to Loyola.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His family money comes from
Ameritrade and
the finance business.

13:15.261 --> 13:18.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He actually owns a high-end bike
shop.

13:18.231 --> 13:21.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what is interesting about
them, as I think
you said earlier, is his family
was very much

13:21.634 --> 13:25.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against Donald Trump, and then
jumped on the
bandwagon and got in it.

13:25.038 --> 13:28.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, these are all card-carrying
capitalists.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're from the elite of the
American business
community.

13:31.144 --> 13:35.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not who you would have
expected a
populist, run-against-the-elites
president

13:35.882 --> 13:37.016 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to appoint.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the other hand, they do have
some experience.

13:39.018 --> 13:42.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And having somebody who knows
something about
business and finance in these
jobs can be

13:42.955 --> 13:44.924 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a plus.

13:44.957 --> 13:48.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, finally,
David Wessel,
I want to ask you about this
deal that president-elect

13:48.061 --> 13:50.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump talked about today with
the Carrier
Corporation.

13:50.363 --> 13:57.203 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
This is the air
conditioning-making company,
subsidiary of United
Technologies.

13:57.236 --> 14:02.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They were saying -- they
announced months
ago they were going to ship,
what, 2,100 jobs

14:02.709 --> 14:04.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of United States to Mexico
from Indiana.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Twenty-one hundred
jobs from
Indiana.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump
immediately during
the campaign said: I'm going to
do something

14:08.414 --> 14:09.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about this.

14:09.415 --> 14:10.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.

14:10.416 --> 14:12.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Donald Trump clearly leaned
on them.

14:12.418 --> 14:16.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carrier, like any company that
has a consumer
brand -- and this one is owned
by United Technologies,

14:16.222 --> 14:20.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which has a lot of defense
contracts -- didn't
want to be crosswise with the
new president

14:20.626 --> 14:22.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

14:22.462 --> 14:26.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the state of Indiana, Mike
Pence, still
the governor, the vice
president-elect, clearly

14:26.099 --> 14:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
put some money on the table.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't know what the deal was.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They saved 1,000 jobs.

14:31.003 --> 14:34.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ironically, in Indianapolis,
there's another
company that you have never
heard of called

14:34.440 --> 14:37.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rexnord, which makes ball
bearings.

14:37.977 --> 14:39.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're moving a plant to
Mexico.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are laying off 300 people.

14:41.447 --> 14:43.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald Trump doesn't seem to
be able to
save their jobs.

14:43.950 --> 14:46.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's hugely symbolically
significant.

14:46.986 --> 14:51.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He manages to say to his
constituents: I did
something, I accomplished
something.

14:51.591 --> 14:55.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it puts the business
community
on warning that this is not a
conventional

14:55.261 --> 14:56.729 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republican.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is going to try to muscle
companies that
haven't been muscled before.

14:58.931 --> 15:03.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Can he go
individually from
company to company that is
thinking of shipping

15:03.336 --> 15:04.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
jobs out and say...

15:04.637 --> 15:08.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: We create 180,000
jobs a month.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have something like 12
million people in
manufacturing.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a drop in the bucket.

15:12.211 --> 15:14.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think the question -- no, he
can't do that.

15:14.046 --> 15:16.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're not going to -- every
company is going
to threaten to move to Mexico,
and he is going

15:16.749 --> 15:18.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to put money on the table to
keep them?

15:18.785 --> 15:20.520 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think it puts business on
notice that
this president is willing to use
the bully

15:23.089 --> 15:25.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pulpit to embarrass them.

15:25.491 --> 15:30.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, secondly, it suggests that
he and some
of his advisers may be more
willing to restrict

15:30.363 --> 15:34.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the freedom of companies to
close plants and
move than has been the case in
the previous

15:35.001 --> 15:36.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democratic and Republican
administrations.

15:37.003 --> 15:40.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Wessel with
the Brookings
Institution, columnist with The
Wall Street

15:40.106 --> 15:45.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Journal, we thank you.

15:45.778 --> 15:51.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: You're welcome.

15:51.450 --> 15:58.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The ashes of
the late Cuban
dictator Fidel Castro began a
long procession

15:58.591 --> 16:03.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across the island nation today,
from Havana
to Santiago, where Castro
declared victory

16:03.963 --> 16:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the revolution he led in
1959.

16:07.633 --> 16:12.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His funeral will be held there
Sunday, ending
nine days of mourning since his
death last

16:12.872 --> 16:14.707 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Friday.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour" special correspondent
Nick Schifrin
is in Havana reporting for us
this week, joins

16:17.276 --> 16:18.244 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me now.

16:18.277 --> 16:19.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nick, let's talk a little bit
about the route.

16:19.445 --> 16:21.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why is it so significant?

16:21.180 --> 16:26.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Yes, Hari, it's
the same route
that he took in 1959, only in
reverse.

16:26.786 --> 16:32.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's really that trip that
cemented Fidel
Castro as a kind of heroic
figure in Cuba,

16:32.158 --> 16:34.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
almost a destined savior of the
country.

16:34.327 --> 16:38.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's certainly the image that
he tried to
portray, came in on a boat,
descended from

16:38.865 --> 16:44.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the mountains, won battles and
won over people
with his speeches, tried to
really portray

16:44.170 --> 16:46.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
himself as a messiah for the
country.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at least along the route
today, that image
of him really survives.

16:49.976 --> 16:53.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There aren't a
lot of freedoms
to speak out against the
government, but what

16:53.546 --> 16:55.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are people along the route
saying?

16:55.114 --> 16:56.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Yes.

16:56.582 --> 17:00.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Along the route, people use the
same exact
words, my leader, my father.

17:00.286 --> 17:05.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even critics of Fidel Castro
say that
those sentiments are genuine
after so many

17:05.391 --> 17:06.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
decades of his rule.

17:06.726 --> 17:10.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, Hari, I talked to
one family,
three generations.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The uncle used to be a Castro
bodyguard.

17:12.698 --> 17:17.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The grandmother told me that
Castro gave her
more opportunities.

17:17.336 --> 17:20.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An aunt told me that he really
believed in
human rights.

17:20.539 --> 17:25.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the granddaughter,
23-year-old Gizelle
Gallego (ph), said that the
revolution should

17:25.144 --> 17:30.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go on, the ideals should go on,
and that there
shouldn't be drastic change in
Cuba, even

17:30.182 --> 17:31.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
though the father of the
revolution has now
died.

17:31.951 --> 17:34.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Did you hear
any voices
of dissent?

17:34.186 --> 17:35.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Yes.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are few and far between,
but they are
important to listen to.

17:37.757 --> 17:41.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I spoke to one dissenter, as
he calls
himself, just a few hours ago.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His name is Carlos Miraros
Falcon (ph).

17:43.863 --> 17:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says there is no freedom of
speech and
no freedom of multiple parties.

17:47.867 --> 17:54.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what that means, Hari, is
that the criticism
of the government remains rare
and that the

17:54.640 --> 17:57.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opposition remains fractured.

17:57.410 --> 18:01.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I asked him whether there is
any chance
of change now that Fidel Castro
is dead.

18:01.547 --> 18:03.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He said most likely not.

18:03.316 --> 18:06.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's because Fidel's younger
brother Raul
has been running the country as
president

18:06.786 --> 18:08.421 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
since 2008.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he did point to one date,
2018.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is the year that Raul
Castro promises
to step down.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of two things could happen
there.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will step down, but he will
remain head
of the party.

18:17.129 --> 18:18.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That means more status question.

18:18.931 --> 18:23.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Or it is possible, this
dissident said, that
Raul could step down and there
could be an

18:23.369 --> 18:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opposition leader who emerges.

18:25.171 --> 18:28.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: When you talk
to people
on the route, they're very
quickly aware that

18:28.374 --> 18:29.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you're an American.

18:29.909 --> 18:33.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does the conversation walk into
the territory
of the new president-elect?

18:33.846 --> 18:38.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Look, I think
that there have
been changes over the last few
years.

18:38.951 --> 18:42.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And more Americans have been
here, so they're
more used to us.

18:42.088 --> 18:47.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, there is some fear of
president-elect
Trump, most specifically because
there is

18:47.093 --> 18:52.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mostly unanimity over the deal
that Raul Castro
and President Obama struck in
the last couple

18:52.865 --> 18:57.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, a kind of detente, and
they don't want
president-elect Trump to take
that away.

18:57.269 --> 19:01.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But critics do point out one
thing, that there
have been four times as many
detentions this

19:01.407 --> 19:04.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
year already as in all of 2010.

19:04.610 --> 19:08.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's according to the Cuban
Human Rights
and National Reconciliation
Commission.

19:08.581 --> 19:13.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those people who point that
out point
to president-elect Trump's
tweets saying that

19:13.152 --> 19:16.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he would terminate the deal
unless Cuba is
willing to improve it.

19:16.655 --> 19:21.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are some people who are
hoping he actually
does that, but, in general,
people want the

19:21.060 --> 19:22.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trend of the last few years to
continue.

19:22.728 --> 19:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Nick Schifrin
joining us
from Havana tonight, thank you.

19:27.666 --> 19:36.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Thanks, Hari.

19:36.108 --> 19:41.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

19:41.147 --> 19:46.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
leading Republican
senator on bringing a divisive
Congress together

19:46.318 --> 19:52.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to work with Donald Trump;
high-tech innovations
from the salad bowl of the
world; and coping

19:52.925 --> 19:58.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with parents who divorce later
in life.

19:58.130 --> 20:03.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we are joined by former
Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who served
in the Clinton

20:03.702 --> 20:05.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
administration, and Stephen
Hadley.

20:05.538 --> 20:09.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was a national security
adviser to President
George W. Bush.

20:09.408 --> 20:14.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Together, they have chaired an
ambitious project
called the Middle East Strategy
Task Force

20:14.647 --> 20:21.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that spent nearly two years
looking at that
troubled region's problems and
devising potential

20:21.220 --> 20:23.189 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
solutions.

20:23.222 --> 20:27.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From its base at the Atlantic
Council, a Washington
think tank, the task force
released its final

20:27.259 --> 20:29.061 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
report today.

20:29.095 --> 20:32.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we welcome you both of you
back to the
"NewsHour."

20:32.131 --> 20:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Secretary Albright, to you
first.

20:33.599 --> 20:36.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ambitious goal, doing something
about the
Middle East.

20:36.635 --> 20:38.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remind us what you thought you
were going
to accomplish here.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT, Former U.S.
Secretary
of State: Well, we were looking
at region

20:40.739 --> 20:46.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we know is very important
to the United
States and obviously to the
world, and trying

20:46.479 --> 20:51.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take a much deeper look at
the Middle East,
instead of kind of doing
Band-Aids or fire

20:51.851 --> 20:59.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drills, and looking at what can
be done to
make things less dangerous, to
deal with America's

20:59.792 --> 21:05.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national interests, which have
to do with
our friends and allies, nuclear
proliferation,

21:05.297 --> 21:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how to deal with terrorism.

21:07.266 --> 21:12.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm very proud of what we
did, because
we spent a lot of time looking
at the local

21:12.705 --> 21:17.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situation, instead of telling
them what to
do and doing kind of what
Western powers have

21:17.977 --> 21:22.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done for a hundred years, is to
get a better
sounding of what's happening in
the region

21:22.948 --> 21:24.450 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
itself.

21:24.483 --> 21:26.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stephen Hadley,
you're calling
it a new strategic approach.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's different about it from
what's happening
now?

21:28.854 --> 21:31.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN HADLEY, Former U.S.
National Security
Adviser: Well, as Madeleine
said, we have

21:31.657 --> 21:35.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had a century where outside
parties have tried
to arrange things in the Middle
East, and

21:35.861 --> 21:37.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
generally not very successfully.

21:37.663 --> 21:42.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What We have tried to do was
listen to voices
in the Middle East as to what
their vision

21:42.101 --> 21:44.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was for the future.

21:44.136 --> 21:49.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we found was, they had a
vision that there
are people, entrepreneurs, both
social entrepreneurs,

21:49.608 --> 21:53.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
business entrepreneurs, that are
making change
from the bottom up.

21:53.078 --> 22:00.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are governments like
the UAE and
Tunisia and Saudi Arabia and
Jordan that are

22:00.186 --> 22:05.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually trying to move in a
direction and
take initiative for themselves.

22:05.591 --> 22:11.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the new strategic approach
is, let's follow
the lead of governments and
people in the

22:11.931 --> 22:16.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
region and have a supporting
role from the
outside, rather than the
reverse.

22:16.035 --> 22:19.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the first
things you
recommend, Secretary Albright,
is a new security

22:19.438 --> 22:25.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approach to the four countries
that have civil
wars under way right now, hot
wars going on.

22:26.011 --> 22:31.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You call, among other things,
for a stepped-up
military presence on the part of
the United

22:31.450 --> 22:33.285 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

22:33.319 --> 22:38.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why do you think something like
this can happen,
given President Obama's
reluctance to do this

22:38.290 --> 22:40.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over the last eight years?

22:40.259 --> 22:43.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, I
think it's been
evident that we can't just do
things diplomatically.

22:43.896 --> 22:49.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do want to have a political
solution to
many of the issues, obviously
Syria.

22:49.401 --> 22:54.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there has to be some way to
resolve the
civil wars.

22:54.106 --> 23:01.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And some of it may take
additional American,
not ground forces, but, in fact,
greater support

23:01.447 --> 23:08.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the rebel groups through
special forces,
maybe some standoff approach to
it, working

23:08.220 --> 23:15.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the allies, with the
coalition on some
issues from the air,
establishing a safe zone,

23:15.294 --> 23:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that you can't just decide,
at least we
thought, working with our
advisers, that the

23:20.399 --> 23:25.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States can just turn its
back on the
place, because the shorthand for
it is, there

23:25.638 --> 23:30.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a crisis in the Middle East,
but it's also
from the Middle East, that's
affecting us

23:31.010 --> 23:32.711 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
all.

23:32.745 --> 23:35.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you have
reason to believe,
Stephen Hadley, that the
president-elect,

23:35.447 --> 23:38.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, is going to be
interested in
an approach like this?

23:38.851 --> 23:42.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, given what he said on
the campaign
trail, that's not at all clear,
is it?

23:42.288 --> 23:46.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN HADLEY: Well, one of the
things he
said was that we need to do more
to defeat

23:46.425 --> 23:50.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS and al-Qaida, Da'esh and
al-Qaida.

23:50.429 --> 23:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was critical of the past
administration,
thought they had not done
enough.

23:54.366 --> 23:59.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We recommend expanding and
accelerating what
we're doing against Da'esh and
al-Qaida.

23:59.672 --> 24:02.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was very critical of what
Iran has done
in the region.

24:02.875 --> 24:08.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We believe that, if we step up
what we're
doing against Da'esh and al
Qaeda in both

24:08.113 --> 24:13.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraq and Syria, that will put
some limitations
on what the Iranians can, quite
frankly, some

24:13.385 --> 24:16.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
limitations on what the Russians
can do.

24:16.088 --> 24:21.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with that new leverage, you
may be in
a situation to move over time to
the kinds

24:21.327 --> 24:24.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of political solutions that
we're looking
for both in Iraq and in Syria.

24:24.863 --> 24:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you have
reason to believe,
Secretary Albright, that Donald
Trump is going

24:28.200 --> 24:29.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be interested in an approach
like this?

24:29.902 --> 24:33.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, we
have to see,
frankly.

24:33.138 --> 24:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that my own view here is
that we have
to -- he is the president-elect.

24:39.945 --> 24:46.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that, as he sees
what the issues
are, I am hopeful that he will
understand

24:46.151 --> 24:51.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the value of this approach,
which is that
we can't -- I mean, frankly, the
suggestions

24:51.523 --> 24:57.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have been made during the
campaign don't
make much sense, because it's
either having

24:57.262 --> 25:04.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nothing to do with them or
bombing them to
-- he used an unspeakable word
-- but that

25:04.603 --> 25:07.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's not consistent.

25:07.139 --> 25:11.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, therefore, what we're
advocating is that
we can't turn our back on the
Middle East,

25:11.877 --> 25:16.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that that is not good for
American national
interest, and that one does have
to deal with

25:16.815 --> 25:23.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Da'esh, but also to try to deal
with the civil
problems that are there,
especially in Syria,

25:23.489 --> 25:25.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
given what Assad is doing to his
own people.

25:26.024 --> 25:31.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So my feeling -- my hope, I have
to say, is
that he will pay attention to
this.

25:31.630 --> 25:33.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is a bipartisan effort.

25:33.265 --> 25:36.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm very proud to have been able
to work with
Steve Hadley on this.

25:36.568 --> 25:41.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we have taken a rational
approach
to a very, very difficult
problem.

25:41.273 --> 25:45.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You also call,
Steve Hadley,
for unleashing what you say is
the region's

25:45.411 --> 25:50.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
human and economic potential,
hand in hand
with the security measures.

25:50.749 --> 25:54.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are the kinds of things,
education,
engaging the youth of the
region, getting

25:54.920 --> 25:59.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- giving opportunities to
women, these are
kinds of things that call for a
lot of money

25:59.892 --> 26:05.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and frankly some different both
religious
and cultural changes, don't
they?

26:05.130 --> 26:07.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN HADLEY: I don't think
they call for
a lot of money.

26:07.366 --> 26:11.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's one of the things I
think that we
are proud of this report,
because when you

26:11.770 --> 26:17.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talk in Washington about the
Middle East,
it's all about Iraq and Syria
and Iran.

26:17.176 --> 26:22.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we have found is that
there's positive
things going on, activity at the
local level,

26:22.648 --> 26:26.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government policies that are
moving in the
right direction of empowering
their people,

26:26.819 --> 26:31.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of getting rid of regulations
that are in
the way of the kind of
entrepreneurial activity

26:31.523 --> 26:32.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we're seeing.

26:32.524 --> 26:34.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is some good news there.

26:34.393 --> 26:38.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is something that we can
work with in
order to try to get a more
peaceful and stable

26:38.163 --> 26:39.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Middle East.

26:39.965 --> 26:42.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there
receptivity there
in each one of these countries
for what you're

26:42.501 --> 26:44.236 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
calling for?

26:44.269 --> 26:46.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because you're talking about
these countries
working together in many ways,
which they

26:46.839 --> 26:48.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
haven't been willing to do.

26:48.607 --> 26:52.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, we
notice there
is kind of different levels of
receptivity.

26:52.511 --> 26:57.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think that many of the
countries' leaders
know that they have problems and
that they

26:57.583 --> 27:04.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need to deal with their growing
youth population,
that the youth is actually an
asset, instead

27:04.156 --> 27:11.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a problem, and that there is
money in the
region, and that they can help
each other.

27:11.530 --> 27:16.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the other things that
I think we
also made a point about is that
new institutions

27:16.835 --> 27:18.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will make a difference,
parliaments.

27:18.670 --> 27:21.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, let me just say, we have
spent a lot
of time on this.

27:21.974 --> 27:25.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a lot it may kind of seem
too idealistic.

27:25.811 --> 27:31.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the issue here is that
there does
need to be some humility in
dealing with this,

27:31.483 --> 27:32.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
taking a long-term approach.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the part of
the Americans?

27:33.552 --> 27:35.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that what you're saying?

27:35.354 --> 27:39.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Yes,
absolutely, in terms
of knowing how difficult it is,
and deciding

27:39.525 --> 27:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to take kind of a step-by-step
approach.

27:41.527 --> 27:43.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a road map, really.

27:43.328 --> 27:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it involves using what is
going on in
those countries, obviously, the
leadership,

27:48.267 --> 27:55.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the civil society, their young
people, women,
and really seeing their
resources as being

27:55.974 --> 28:01.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their own populations, instead
of kind of
complaining that the outside
world is telling

28:01.680 --> 28:06.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them what to do, knowing that,
if they take
steps forward, the outsiders
will help.

28:06.485 --> 28:09.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just in 20
seconds, Steve
Hadley, what happens next?

28:09.655 --> 28:11.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you advance these ideas?

28:11.557 --> 28:17.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN HADLEY: Well, we are
going to take
this on the road, if you will.

28:17.062 --> 28:18.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We want to talk to the new
administration.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We want to talk to the Congress.

28:20.198 --> 28:22.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We will talk to the
administration in power.

28:22.200 --> 28:27.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we hope, though, is that
this will actually
provoke a conversation in the
region about

28:27.139 --> 28:32.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what the region needs to be
doing to lay a
foundation for a more hopeful
future.

28:32.244 --> 28:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we thank
you very much
for coming to talk to us.

28:35.247 --> 28:40.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will be wanting to talk
to you as you
take these next steps and seeing
where it

28:40.319 --> 28:42.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
goes, Steve Hadley, Secretary
Madeleine Albright.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Thank you
for your interest,
Judy.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's very important.

28:45.223 --> 28:49.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

28:49.161 --> 28:56.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN HADLEY: Nice to be with
you.

28:56.068 --> 29:01.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For more on
the latest Cabinet
nominations, their potential
conflicts of

29:01.907 --> 29:06.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interest and the Republican
Party's priorities
under a President Trump, I'm
joined by the

29:06.211 --> 29:09.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number three Senate Republican,
Senator John
Thune.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you for joining us.

29:10.449 --> 29:12.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Quick order of business.

29:12.317 --> 29:15.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the Senate goes into the
confirmation
process for the new commerce
secretary, Wilbur

29:15.420 --> 29:21.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ross, will the Senate ask Mr.
Ross to put
all his assets into a blind
trust and perhaps

29:21.326 --> 29:23.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
step off the board of the
world's largest
steel company?

29:23.729 --> 29:24.997 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

29:25.030 --> 29:26.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN THUNE (R), South Dakota:
Yes, well, good
evening, Hari.

29:26.798 --> 29:30.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, obviously, the Commerce
Committee, which
I chair, will be processing his
paperwork

29:30.435 --> 29:34.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the confirmation of the next
commerce
secretary, as well as DOT and a
few others.

29:34.973 --> 29:41.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we obviously be looking at
his background
and have those discussions as we
begin to

29:41.380 --> 29:46.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of drill down a little bit
and ask the
questions not only prior to, but
at the confirmation

29:46.551 --> 29:49.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
hearing, about what his
intentions are with
respect to his business
dealings.

29:49.988 --> 29:55.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as has been the case, at
least with most
Cabinet secretaries, they find a
way to insulate

29:55.360 --> 29:59.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
themselves from their business
world and to
focus on the jobs at hand.

29:59.431 --> 30:03.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As you know,
the International
Trade Administration, which sits
under commerce,

30:03.435 --> 30:08.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sets the tariff policies to make
sure that
companies aren't dumping
products into -- onto

30:08.707 --> 30:10.676 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our soil.

30:10.709 --> 30:15.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he still has stakes in
companies, the person,
couldn't he profit personally
from the policies

30:15.414 --> 30:17.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he as commerce secretary
could set?

30:17.449 --> 30:19.184 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

30:19.217 --> 30:21.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: Well, those are
questions that
we will be looking at and he
will have to

30:21.053 --> 30:23.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
answer before our committee.

30:23.221 --> 30:28.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, Penny Pritzker, the
current secretary
of commerce, when she went
through the confirmation

30:28.660 --> 30:31.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
process, we asked a lot of these
questions.

30:31.163 --> 30:35.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she ended up taking some
steps with respect
to her business that made sure
that there

30:35.667 --> 30:37.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wouldn't be those types of
conflicts of interest.

30:37.302 --> 30:39.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would expect the same
thing to happen
here.

30:39.271 --> 30:43.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, now
if Mr. -- Mr.
Ross has also indicated a fairly
nationalist

30:43.141 --> 30:44.376 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
trade policy.

30:44.409 --> 30:47.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this lines up quite welcome
with the president-elect.

30:47.546 --> 30:51.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump has said that he wants
to withdraw
from the Trans-Pacific
Partnership on day

30:51.550 --> 30:52.684 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
one.

30:52.718 --> 30:55.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's criticized NAFTA repeatedly
on the campaign
trail.

30:55.620 --> 31:01.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What would the impact of
withdrawing from
NAFTA or putting 35 percent
trade tariffs

31:01.460 --> 31:05.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against Chinese products, what
kind of impact
would that have on your state
and other states

31:05.897 --> 31:06.865 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
like it?

31:06.898 --> 31:08.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

31:08.667 --> 31:11.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: Well, I'm certainly
not somebody
who is a fan of those types of
measures.

31:11.737 --> 31:15.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, I think we have to be
engaged in
the global marketplace.

31:15.407 --> 31:19.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Representing an agriculture
state that's very
dependent upon exports, I want
us to have

31:19.277 --> 31:24.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
robust trading relationships,
where we can
interact with other countries
around the world

31:24.216 --> 31:25.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and get access to that
marketplace.

31:25.917 --> 31:29.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, how the new administration
decides to
do that remains to be seen.

31:29.955 --> 31:36.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have talked about undoing
TPP and instead
engaging in a number of
bilateral-type trade

31:36.061 --> 31:37.796 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agreements.

31:37.829 --> 31:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However they decide to go about
it, I think
the important thing is that we
be engaged

31:41.266 --> 31:46.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the global marketplace, not
only for economic
reasons, for trade, for the
vitality of our

31:47.005 --> 31:51.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economy in places like the
Midwest, but also
for national security reasons.

31:51.510 --> 31:56.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that we need to be
engaged in these
places in the world on an
economic basis,

31:56.148 --> 32:00.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because it does lead to so many
other issues
where we have issues and
concerns in some

32:00.418 --> 32:01.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of these regions.

32:01.953 --> 32:03.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And you are
part of the
congressional leadership now.

32:03.688 --> 32:05.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You all sort of run the board,
so to speak.

32:05.791 --> 32:06.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have got the Senate.

32:06.792 --> 32:07.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have got the House.

32:07.793 --> 32:08.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have got the White House.

32:08.794 --> 32:09.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What are the legislative
priorities?

32:09.995 --> 32:11.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are the things that we can
expect quick
action on?

32:11.963 --> 32:13.665 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

32:13.698 --> 32:15.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: Well, I think the
one thing that
we will probably be most focused
on early

32:16.001 --> 32:17.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on is the economy.

32:17.936 --> 32:21.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What can we do to get the growth
rate back
up to 3 or 4 percent?

32:21.306 --> 32:25.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the first administration
where we
haven't had a single year where
economic growth

32:25.377 --> 32:26.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has exceeded 3 percent.

32:26.478 --> 32:28.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the worst recovery in 60
years.

32:28.446 --> 32:33.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the exit polling in the
election this
year, 62 percent of Americans
said the country

32:33.051 --> 32:36.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is on the wrong track, and 52
percent of them
said the economy should be the
number one

32:36.922 --> 32:38.456 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're going to be looking at
things that
we can do to unleash the
economy.

32:40.392 --> 32:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that, I think, means dealing
with a regulatory
burden that's making it more
expensive and

32:44.596 --> 32:51.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more difficult to create jobs,
repealing and
replacing Obamacare, tax reform
that is pro-growth

32:51.837 --> 32:56.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and looks at what we can do to
unleash entrepreneurs
in our economy to get the growth
rate back

32:56.775 --> 32:58.510 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up and wages up.

32:58.543 --> 33:01.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are a series of things
that I think
you will see a very intense
focus on right

33:01.746 --> 33:03.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Speaking of
reform, I know
you're an advocate for reform
when it comes

33:05.183 --> 33:08.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to federal retirement benefits,
Social Security,
Medicare.

33:08.119 --> 33:09.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Any action on that likely?

33:09.120 --> 33:10.088 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

33:10.121 --> 33:12.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: It's hard to say.

33:12.057 --> 33:16.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it wasn't something that
the president-elect,
at least early on in his agenda,
articulated

33:16.962 --> 33:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as something that he wanted to
accomplish.

33:18.730 --> 33:24.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think we all recognize
that, if you
look at the actuarial balances
of some of

33:24.269 --> 33:28.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these programs, Social Security,
Medicare,
for example, we have to make
them sustainable

33:28.640 --> 33:30.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for future generations.

33:30.075 --> 33:32.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that means we have got to
take steps to
strengthen them today.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the sooner we get
started on that,
the better.

33:34.813 --> 33:37.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not saying when that is
going to happen.

33:37.382 --> 33:42.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, as I mentioned before,
early on,
this new incoming president has
an agenda

33:42.087 --> 33:43.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he wants to accomplish.

33:43.121 --> 33:45.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We look forward to working with
him.

33:45.056 --> 33:50.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I hope that we engage on
this issue of
entitlement reform at some point
in a way

33:50.595 --> 33:54.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that preserves those programs,
not just for
people who depend upon them
today, but for

33:54.833 --> 33:56.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
future generations of Americans
as well.

33:56.401 --> 34:00.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Senator John
Thune, thanks so much.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.940 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

34:01.973 --> 34:09.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: Thanks, Hari.

34:09.080 --> 34:16.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: California's
Salinas Valley
is often called the salad bowl
of the world.

34:16.554 --> 34:20.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Roughly 70 percent of the
nation's lettuce
crop is grown there, along with
plenty of

34:20.892 --> 34:22.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other produce.

34:22.694 --> 34:26.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Cat Wise
traveled to
the region to take a look at
some high-tech

34:26.665 --> 34:29.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
innovations being used to
improve production.

34:29.935 --> 34:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her story is part of our weekly
series covering
the Leading Edge of science and
technology.

34:35.307 --> 34:42.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: As the sun rose over
the fertile
land of Salinas Valley,
California, one recent

34:42.380 --> 34:46.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
morning, a group of farmworkers
waited to
sign in for their shift, not on
paper, as

34:46.851 --> 34:52.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they normally do, but on an
iPad, where an
app has their name and job
assignments already

34:52.123 --> 34:53.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
programmed in.

34:53.992 --> 34:58.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are using HeavyConnect, a
new mobile
communication app designed to
help farm managers

34:58.596 --> 35:02.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
keep better track of equipment
and personnel.

35:02.867 --> 35:06.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the team that developed it
were out bright
and early to check in one of
their newest

35:06.805 --> 35:11.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
customers, farm manager Sam
Brigantino, who
works for a large grower called
Tanimura and

35:11.676 --> 35:12.978 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Antle.

35:13.011 --> 35:15.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Co-founder Jessica Gonzalez
walked him through
a new update.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSICA GONZALEZ, Co-Founder,
Tanimura and
Antle: You see the times they
worked, and

35:17.215 --> 35:20.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they had any breaks and
meals, it would
be in between there.

35:20.518 --> 35:22.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The jobs they did here, the
legal statement.

35:22.320 --> 35:26.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM BRIGANTINO, Tanimura and
Antle: Yes, I
like the pulldowns much better
on this one.

35:26.358 --> 35:29.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSICA GONZALEZ: Basically, the
functionality
and flow is all the same.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just an update to the U.I.

35:31.997 --> 35:36.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: An app's U.I., or user
interface,
is not a typical topic of
conversation on

35:36.468 --> 35:38.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
most farms.

35:38.203 --> 35:43.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But scenes like this are
becoming more common
throughout Salinas.

35:43.908 --> 35:47.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's because there's a effort
under way
by many in the community to make
this valley

35:48.013 --> 35:51.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a bit more like a certain
high-tech valley
to the north.

35:51.616 --> 35:56.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A very visible sign of that
effort is this
new Silicon Valley-esque office
space.

35:56.955 --> 36:01.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an incubator for ag-focused
startups
that opened last December in
downtown Salinas.

36:01.426 --> 36:06.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's where HeavyConnect and
a number of
other small companies are now
coding away,

36:06.197 --> 36:10.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hoping to break into the $50
billion-a-year
fresh produce industry.

36:10.101 --> 36:11.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's just in California.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK ZELAYA, Co-Founder,
HeavyConnect:
We believe that, when it comes
to ag-tech,

36:13.638 --> 36:16.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you can make it in the
Salinas Valley,
you're going to be able to have
a product

36:16.941 --> 36:18.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that will be adopted globally.

36:18.743 --> 36:23.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: HeavyConnect
co-founder Patrick
Zelaya is a former John Deere
sales manager

36:23.915 --> 36:26.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who has spent a lot of time with
farmers.

36:26.217 --> 36:29.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says he started the company
because he
saw a big need for a product
that would help

36:29.988 --> 36:32.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
farmers get back something they
have very
little of: time.

36:32.690 --> 36:38.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK ZELAYA: In large-scale
farming, the
job is a 14-hour-a-day six days
a week.

36:38.596 --> 36:43.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's not commonly known is
that farmers
spend more time on the
administration, managing

36:43.835 --> 36:46.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the operation, than they do
farming.

36:46.237 --> 36:51.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, HeavyConnect provides
farmers the ability
to know what's going on in their
farm operationally

36:51.176 --> 36:52.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
without having to be there.

36:53.011 --> 36:56.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Other companies here
are working
on a host of new products for
soil testing,

36:56.848 --> 36:58.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
food safety, crop monitoring.

36:58.450 --> 37:01.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And on the day we visited, water
was the focus.

37:01.553 --> 37:06.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Good afternoon, and
welcome to Western
Growers Center for Innovation
and Technology

37:06.925 --> 37:09.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tech talk, with our guest, SWIIM
System.

37:09.327 --> 37:11.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KEVIN FRANCE, SWIIM System:
Thank you, Lisa.

37:11.262 --> 37:15.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Kevin France is
heading up a company
that aims to help farmers
monitor and manage

37:15.600 --> 37:17.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their water usage.

37:17.268 --> 37:21.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Water management is a hot area
for innovation,
given California's ongoing
drought.

37:21.272 --> 37:22.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEVIN FRANCE: So what is SWIIM?

37:22.841 --> 37:24.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are your on-farm water
accountant.

37:25.009 --> 37:27.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are like the QuickBooks for
ag water.

37:27.212 --> 37:31.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Dave Puglia is an
executive with
the Western Growers Association,
a large trade

37:31.816 --> 37:34.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group which is funding and
running the new
center.

37:34.486 --> 37:38.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says farmers want these
innovations to
succeed as much as the
developers do.

37:38.423 --> 37:40.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVE PUGLIA, Western Growers
Association:
Farmers have been innovative
from the dawn

37:40.758 --> 37:45.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of time, but our own members
recognized that
the collision of forces that are
impacting

37:45.196 --> 37:50.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
their ability to stay in
business, the regulatory
pressures, resource pressures --
we have less

37:50.368 --> 37:51.870 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
water available.

37:51.903 --> 37:54.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have less of a work force
available to
us.

37:54.172 --> 38:00.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this center is designed to
bring the best
of Silicon Valley, the best
minds in technology

38:00.111 --> 38:06.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and innovation, closer to the
best farmers
in the world, and speed the
innovation that

38:06.651 --> 38:08.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can solve those problems.

38:08.419 --> 38:13.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The scenic Salinas
Valley is less
than an hour's drive from
Silicon Valley,

38:13.091 --> 38:14.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the innovation hub of the
country.

38:14.792 --> 38:19.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in many ways, the two areas
could not
be more different.

38:19.264 --> 38:24.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unlike the high-income, mostly
white and Asian
population of Silicon Valley,
Salinas Valley

38:24.402 --> 38:27.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is about 75 percent Hispanic.

38:27.138 --> 38:31.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many here work in the fields or
packaging
plants, jobs that are often
hourly and low-paying.

38:31.609 --> 38:36.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are pockets of extreme
poverty, high
crime, and poorly performing
schools.

38:36.447 --> 38:40.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for the area's many young
people, there
are few economic opportunities.

38:40.185 --> 38:44.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RAY CORPUZ, Salinas City
Manager: There aren't
the jobs yet for them.

38:44.622 --> 38:46.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we want to create that
opportunity.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Ray Corpuz is the city
manager of
Salinas.

38:49.994 --> 38:54.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He and other community leaders
are very supportive
of the new focus on technology,
but he wants

38:54.766 --> 38:56.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more of it to be home grown.

38:56.601 --> 39:01.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAY CORPUZ: We're looking for
our citizens,
our community, the people that
live here to

39:01.472 --> 39:08.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually run the new machines,
provide the
new applications, to make
technological innovations.

39:08.813 --> 39:10.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we have to have a skilled
work force.

39:10.748 --> 39:24.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: That future tech-savvy
work force
is now being developed in this
classroom.

39:25.029 --> 39:28.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These college students are
enrolled in a new,
unique program.

39:28.066 --> 39:32.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will be earning a computer
science degree
in just three years.

39:32.370 --> 39:36.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Half of that time is spent at
the Salinas
community college, called
Hartnell College,

39:36.708 --> 39:40.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they finish up at a nearby
state university,
CSU Monterey Bay.

39:40.945 --> 39:46.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The highly competitive program
is called CSin3,
and the students attend classes
year-round.

39:46.918 --> 39:50.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many in the program are the
first in their
families to attend college, and
thanks to

39:50.755 --> 39:55.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a local, well-known grower who
has established
a large scholarship, their
tuition is paid

39:55.393 --> 39:57.362 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZAHI ATALLAH, Dean of Academic
Affairs, Hartnell
College: Only 6 percent of the
computer industry

39:58.830 --> 39:59.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is women.

39:59.831 --> 40:03.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Only 3 percent are Hispanic.

40:03.434 --> 40:04.402 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Our classrooms?

40:04.435 --> 40:05.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Majority Hispanic.

40:05.470 --> 40:08.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At least 50 percent of our
students are women.

40:08.206 --> 40:11.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Zahi Atallah is a dean
of academic
affairs at Hartnell.

40:11.943 --> 40:15.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says that while there is a
big push to
get more students into
higher-paying tech

40:15.813 --> 40:20.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jobs, the school is also trying
to encourage
local youth to pursue other
good-paying careers,

40:20.885 --> 40:22.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like welding and farm equipment
maintenance.

40:22.887 --> 40:26.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But regardless of what they end
up doing,
Atallah says the students'
understanding of

40:27.025 --> 40:30.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this community, and the overall
ag business,
will be a big benefit.

40:31.029 --> 40:36.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZAHI ATALLAH: Many of those
students are farmworkers
themselves and kids of
farmworkers.

40:37.001 --> 40:43.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Imagine what they're bringing to
the table,
having the background of
farming, having lived

40:43.708 --> 40:48.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it themselves, because they can
create and
innovate faster and most
effectively.

40:48.980 --> 40:55.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: One of those using her
past experiences
in her new career is
HeavyConnect's Rivka

40:55.053 --> 40:56.988 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Garcia.

40:57.021 --> 41:00.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was born and raised in
Salinas, and worked
in a produce processing plant,
before graduating

41:00.792 --> 41:04.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
earlier year from the CSin3
program.

41:04.896 --> 41:12.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Garcia is now using all her
skills, including
coding, to help make the
company's app more

41:12.136 --> 41:14.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intuitive for those who will be
using it.

41:14.372 --> 41:17.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIVKA GARCIA, HeavyConnect: I
worked with
a lot of people that didn't
understand how

41:17.508 --> 41:19.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to use technology.

41:19.344 --> 41:22.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And creating an app that is easy
to use, that
won't confuse them and will get
the job done,

41:22.847 --> 41:26.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and will be really similar to
what they do
on paper, but is more efficient,
is, I think,

41:26.751 --> 41:28.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a big thing that I bring to the
table.

41:28.619 --> 41:33.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The HeavyConnect team
is now working
on a new app feature that will
allow farmers

41:33.358 --> 41:38.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to monitor their equipment using
Bluetooth
sensors, and Garcia is leading
that project.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And Cat's report
is also part
of our Breakthroughs coverage of

HARI SREENIVASAN: We will be
back in a moment
with a look at the challenges of
facing divorced

42:03.154 --> 42:04.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
parents as an adult.

42:04.722 --> 42:08.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, take a moment to
hear from your
local PBS station.

42:08.326 --> 42:13.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which

Tonight, writer Carmen Machado
shares her
perspective as one whose parents

42:29.781 --> 42:33.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when she was an adult.

CARMEN MARIA MACHADO, Author:
Two years ago,
when I moved home to the East
Coast, my parents

42:53.271 --> 42:58.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
announced to me and my brother
and sister
that they were getting divorced
after 31 years

42:58.776 --> 42:59.911 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of marriage.

42:59.944 --> 43:03.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was both surprised and not
surprised.

43:03.748 --> 43:11.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My parents had many fraught,
fragile years
under their belts, but they'd
seemed to weather

43:11.289 --> 43:12.957 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

43:12.990 --> 43:18.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It'd been bad, but I had assumed
they had
survived the worst of it, that
their lives

43:18.596 --> 43:21.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would mellow now that their kids
were grown.

43:21.632 --> 43:27.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have many friends with
divorced parents,
but all of them had experienced
the process

43:27.738 --> 43:30.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as children and adolescents.

43:30.475 --> 43:39.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After my own parents told me the
news, I learned
that, instead of being an
anomaly, they're

43:39.150 --> 43:40.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the new norm.

43:40.485 --> 43:44.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So-called late-life divorce is
increasingly
common.

43:44.822 --> 43:49.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One recent study showed that,
since 1990,
the divorce rate for people over
50 has doubled.

43:49.994 --> 43:51.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In a way, it was simpler.

43:51.929 --> 43:59.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, there were assets to
divide, but my siblings
and I were grown, so there was
no discussion

43:59.770 --> 44:05.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of custody, no decision about
living one place
or another, no shuttling back
and forth between

44:05.309 --> 44:06.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
houses.

44:06.310 --> 44:08.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I was happy for them, in a
way.

44:08.346 --> 44:11.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They could now independently
live the lives
they couldn't live together.

44:11.849 --> 44:15.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My parents announced their
divorce right before
my fiancee and I got engaged.

44:15.987 --> 44:21.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She asked if I wanted to put off
the engagement
just until the dust settled.

44:21.192 --> 44:22.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My initial reaction was
forceful.

44:22.827 --> 44:26.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I told her, no, I just wanted to
move on.

44:26.130 --> 44:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My parents' problems were not
mine.

44:28.566 --> 44:32.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But then I found myself
overwhelmed with anxiety.

44:32.303 --> 44:35.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wasn't that I suddenly had
large, cosmic
doubts about love.

44:35.773 --> 44:42.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rather, I worried that my
parents' divorce
was some kind of harbinger, a
bad example

44:42.446 --> 44:45.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rather, I worried that my
parents' divorce
was some kind of harbinger, a
bad example

45:08.105 --> 45:19.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I, genetically yoked to
them as I was,
would be forced to follow.

45:19.350 --> 45:25.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took a few months to figure
out that the
answer was somewhere in between.

45:25.790 --> 45:29.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took a few months to figure
out that the
answer was somewhere in between.

45:51.616 --> 46:01.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I realized I had been given a
gift, that my
adult self had a perspective
that my teenage

46:01.659 --> 46:06.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I realized I had been given a
gift, that my
adult self had a perspective
that my teenage

46:06.831 --> 46:16.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
self would have never been able
to conjure,
that you have

46:16.874 --> 46:27.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
self would have never been able
