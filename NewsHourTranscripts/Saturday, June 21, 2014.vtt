13:42.933 --> 13:44.233
IT SEEMS TO WORK QUITE WELL.

13:44.233 --> 13:49.000
AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE STAT

RIGHT TO TRY BILLS REALLY ADD TO

13:51.033 --> 13:51.700
THAT

13:51.700 --> 13:56.733
IN FACT, I THINK MIGHT TAKE AWAY

IT IS GENIUS WHAT HE DID

18:56.833 --> 18:57.167
THEY SURVIVED 300 YEARS AN

18:57.167 --> 19:06.867
STILL SOUND GLORIOUS

EXPECTING THE INSTRUMENT AND

19:17.600 --> 19:18.433
EXPECTS TO SELL IT FOR MORE THAN

19:18.433 --> 19:24.000
$45 MILLION.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.033
TO CARPENTER IT IS WORTH IT.

19:26.033 --> 19:26.600

SPEND OVER $100 MILLION.

19:28.267 --> 19:28.867
A GREAT DA VINCI PAINTING, I PUT

19:28.867 --> 19:29.700
THIS IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE

19:29.700 --> 19:30.033
MASTER WORKS AND I THINK THESE

19:30.033 --> 19:31.133
HAVE ESCAPED OUR CIVILIZATIO

19:31.133 --> 19:32.533
AND CULTURE WITHOUT THEM

19:32.533 --> 19:32.867
WE WOULD HAVE THE SAME

THAT STRADIVARIUS IS EXPECTED TO

COST

20:00.600 --> 20:08.033
>> WHAT MAKES A STRAT GREAT?

20:08.033 --> 20:17.967
I FIND THAT IT ASSUMES THAT AL

20:17.967 --> 20:22.533
STRATS ARE GREAT

20:22.533 --> 20:25.133
>> HE MAKES HIS VIOLINS BY HAND,

20:25.133 --> 20:25.433

HE THINKS THE SOUND QUALITY AR

20:30.800 --> 20:31.933
AS GORGEOUS.

20:31.933 --> 20:32.533

20:33.367 --> 20:34.200
I HAD TO ADMIT I PREFERRED M

20:34.200 --> 20:37.867

20:37.867 --> 20:38.567
AND THEN SOME OF MY CLIENTS WERE
