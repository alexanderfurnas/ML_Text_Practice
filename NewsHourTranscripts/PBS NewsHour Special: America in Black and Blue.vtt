OF THOSE IDENTITIES, HAS THAT

17:11.167 --> 17:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COST YOU IN YOUR CAREER?

17:14.200 --> 17:15.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

17:15.667 --> 17:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACED WITH BECAUSE WE ARE

17:16.833 --> 17:18.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPECTED TO DO WHATEVER IS

NECESSARY TO BE THAT OFFICER OF

THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE UP IN

17:49.867 --> 17:50.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

18:14.867 --> 18:16.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DO YOU CHANGE THAT?

18:16.067 --> 18:17.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S SAD THAT WE'VE GOTTEN TO

THIS POINT, BUT IT IS A FIXABLE

18:18.267 --> 18:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEM.

18:21.267 --> 18:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

COMMIT THE HEINOUS ACTS BEING

18:28.333 --> 18:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROSECUTED.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT'S FIXABLE BY ALWAYS

18:30.833 --> 18:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIVING PEOPLE A FORUM TO GO IN

18:32.500 --> 18:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MAKE A COMPLAINT, AND

18:33.933 --> 18:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

MINE.

18:55.333 --> 18:57.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT DOESN'T SAY THAT I HAVE TO

AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S

18:58.833 --> 18:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID.

18:59.133 --> 19:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THAT IS SAID IS TRUE.

19:01.867 --> 19:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

IN AMERICAN POLICING IN

19:53.200 --> 19:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PROBLEMS.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMONG OUR RANKS, ARE RACISTS

19:59.400 --> 20:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRUTAL PEOPLE ARE CRIMINALS.

20:01.967 --> 20:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK MUCH LESS OF THAT

20:03.833 --> 20:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN THERE WAS WHEN I WAS FIRST

20:05.433 --> 20:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE PROGRESSION, I CAN

20:08.100 --> 20:08.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FOR EXAMPLE.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE TEN AREAS OF PURPOSE

20:22.967 --> 20:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY ARE DEMANDING CHANGE.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS I LOOK AT THOSE TEN POINTS,

20:28.267 --> 20:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MAJORITY WE'RE ALREADY DOING

CONCERNS.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE CONCERN I HAVE IN THE

ORGANIZATION THAT SEEKS TO

20:42.233 --> 20:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEREOTYPE US, DEFINE US, THE

GERM THAT ALLOWS RACISM IS GROW

20:47.067 --> 20:48.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THE STEREOTYPE THE PAINTING

OF A WIDE BRUSH OF A RACE OR

RACISTS, ALL POLICE ARE RACISTS

20:56.967 --> 20:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT COPS ARE COLD BLOODED

20:58.100 --> 20:59.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KILLERS UP THE SAME CONSTRUCT.

20:59.967 --> 21:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> EXACTLY.

21:03.133 --> 21:05.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TO CONTINUE THAT QUOTE FROM

21:05.967 --> 21:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MY PRESS YESTERDAY, I TALKED

21:07.533 --> 21:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THAT WOULD BE LIKE US WITH

COUNTRY, UNFORTUNATE REALITY

21:14.400 --> 21:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S SO MUCH CRIME IN THAT

21:16.233 --> 21:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITY, BUT THEY ARE THE

21:18.400 --> 21:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VICTIMS OF THAT CRIME.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO WE DEFINE ALL 40 MILLION

21:20.700 --> 21:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BLACKS AS CRIMINALS BECAUSE THEY

21:22.233 --> 21:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE CRIMINALS IN THEIR FLANKS

21:24.000 --> 21:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO, WE SEEK TO FOCUS ON THOSE

21:27.233 --> 21:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO ARE COMMITTING THOSE ACTS.

21:29.133 --> 21:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH

21:30.633 --> 21:32.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BLACK LIVES MATTER, I DON'T HAVE

21:32.867 --> 21:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

34:42.667 --> 34:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TROUBLE.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

34:44.933 --> 34:47.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING,

34:47.867 --> 34:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS THE PROBLEM.

34:48.433 --> 34:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO WHEN A POLICE OFFICER

34:49.733 --> 34:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PULLED HIM OVER I JUST HAPPENED

34:51.467 --> 34:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE WITH HIM.

34:53.133 --> 34:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

35:00.867 --> 35:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

35:04.033 --> 35:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WASN'T DISRESPECTFUL.

35:05.900 --> 35:07.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MY SON KEPT ASKING HIM, WHAT DID

35:07.767 --> 35:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DO.

35:09.533 --> 35:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT

35:12.100 --> 35:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN MY MIND THAT HAD I NOT BEEN

35:14.433 --> 35:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE THAT SITUATION WOULD HAVE

35:16.800 --> 35:18.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

I HOPE I NEVER FORGET THE TIME

35:37.533 --> 35:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT WITH OUR

35:41.467 --> 35:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST SON.

35:41.833 --> 35:43.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MY HUSBAND AND I WERE SO

35:43.267 --> 35:44.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXCITED, WE WERE WALKING INTO

35:44.967 --> 35:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE, BUT I

35:46.600 --> 35:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STOPPED IN MY TRACKS, I SEE A

35:49.700 --> 35:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN ABOUT 12

35:52.400 --> 35:54.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR 13 YEARS OLD.

35:54.067 --> 35:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS HANDS WERE IN HANDCUFFS AND

35:56.833 --> 35:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS FEET WERE SHACKLED.

35:59.633 --> 36:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT JUST BROKE MY HEART

36:01.533 --> 36:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WIDE OPEN, TO HAVE A BLACK BOY

36:03.933 --> 36:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROWING INSIDE OF MY BODY, THAT

36:06.433 --> 36:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS SORT OF A FIRST AWAKENING

36:09.833 --> 36:12.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR ME ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN

36:12.867 --> 36:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO RAISE A BLACK BOY IN THE

36:14.700 --> 36:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

36:19.933 --> 36:22.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> FOR SO MANY WHITE PEOPLE,

36:22.067 --> 36:24.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE OF HAVING THE PRIVILEGE

36:24.067 --> 36:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF WHITE SKIN, WHICH AFFORDS

36:26.133 --> 36:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE GIVEN

36:28.133 --> 36:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT NOT THE

36:29.700 --> 36:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMED TO BE

36:31.100 --> 36:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSPICIOUS OR GUILTY OR UP TO NO

36:32.433 --> 36:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOOD.

36:35.533 --> 36:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE UNAWARE OF THE WAYS IN

36:37.700 --> 36:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH BLACK PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF

36:39.333 --> 36:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLOR ARE AT FIRST GLANCE

36:42.000 --> 36:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERCEIVED IN THAT WAY.

36:47.933 --> 36:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING COLOR

36:49.500 --> 36:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BLIND, BUT RATHER OUR SONS

36:59.067 --> 37:00.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, AS MY CHILDREN ARE GETTING

37:00.567 --> 37:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OLDER, GRADUALLY WE'RE GOING TO

37:03.433 --> 37:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE THESE TALKS WITH THEM,

37:05.200 --> 37:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE YOU ARE AN AFRICAN

37:06.700 --> 37:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICAN, PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BE

37:08.800 --> 37:11.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TEENAGER.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT MIGHT FIRST BELIEVE THAT YOU

37:17.600 --> 37:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE UP TO SOMETHING NO GOOD AND

37:19.300 --> 37:20.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT WILLING TO GIVE YOU THE

37:20.367 --> 37:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

37:24.133 --> 37:25.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MY HUSBAND AND ARE I ARE IN THAT

HAVE TO PREPARE THEIR CHILDREN

37:38.033 --> 37:39.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE POSSIBILITY THAT AN

37:39.367 --> 37:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENCOUNTER WITH THE POLICE COULD

37:41.667 --> 37:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO WRONG.

37:42.033 --> 37:44.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT COULD ALSO GO WRONG FOR

37:44.167 --> 37:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OFFICERS WHO HAVE TO PREPARE

37:44.900 --> 37:47.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR DANGER AND FACE THEIR OWN

43:53.833 --> 43:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

43:56.733 --> 43:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY THE SKILL, HIGHLY TRAINED

43:59.333 --> 44:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS DO THAT

44:00.833 --> 44:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TYPE OF THING.

44:03.033 --> 44:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REGULAR OFFICER ON THE

44:04.033 --> 44:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STREET WITH JUST HANDGUN, THEY

44:06.733 --> 44:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE GOING TO SHOOT FOR CENTER

44:09.167 --> 44:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASS OF THE TARGET THAT THEY

44:10.733 --> 44:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE AVAILABLE AND THEY ARE

44:12.433 --> 44:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOOTING TO ELIMINATE THE

44:14.067 --> 44:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREAT.

44:14.400 --> 44:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE ON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING

44:15.767 --> 44:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE THAT.

44:16.900 --> 44:20.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NONE MUCH US DO.

44:20.267 --> 44:21.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFTENTIMES WE GOT TO BE MORE

44:21.667 --> 44:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REACTIVE THAN PRO-ACTIVE

44:22.933 --> 44:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAINLY IN THIS TYPE OF

44:24.233 --> 44:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATION.

44:24.600 --> 44:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I GOT TO SEE WHAT THAT IS, SEE

44:26.033 --> 44:27.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THAT

44:27.467 --> 44:27.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THING.

44:27.767 --> 44:28.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET THE WHOLE STORY.

44:28.867 --> 44:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T ASSUME THAT SOMETHING IS

44:30.333 --> 44:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IT APPEARED TO BE.

44:32.200 --> 44:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY SELDOM IS.

44:35.433 --> 44:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE LOOK TRYING TO REESTABLISH

44:36.600 --> 44:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEACE AND WE'RE TRYING TO

44:38.033 --> 44:39.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY BUILD THE RELATIONSHIP

44:39.267 --> 44:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN POLICE AND COMMUNITY,

44:41.067 --> 44:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT YET HERE WE ARE OUT HERE

44:42.500 --> 44:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOOTING THE POLICE.

44:44.100 --> 44:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE CAN'T DO.

44:44.700 --> 44:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DEAL

44:46.500 --> 44:49.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE PROCESS SO IT WAS A

44:49.167 --> 44:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WATCH IN 1999, TRAINED TEAMS ALL

45:37.067 --> 45:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AROUND ABOUT HOW TO MONITOR THE

POLICE.

45:40.633 --> 45:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WANT TO KNOW FROM YOU, WHAT

45:42.867 --> 45:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS THE HARDEST THING TO GET

45:44.200 --> 45:46.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOUR HEAD AROUND AFTER THE

45:46.267 --> 45:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVENTS THAT HAPPENED IN TEXAS,

45:48.467 --> 45:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINNEAPOLIS AND IN LOUISIANA.

45:51.233 --> 45:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT WAS ALMOST SURREAL WHEN WE

45:53.933 --> 45:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST STARTED DOING COP WATCH

45:55.500 --> 45:57.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND VIDEOTAPING POLICE, CELL

45:57.167 --> 45:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PHONES DIDN'T EXIST, VIRAL VIDEO

45:58.933 --> 45:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS NOT AROUND.

45:59.833 --> 46:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WASN'T EVEN FACEBOOK IN

46:01.067 --> 46:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1999.

46:02.633 --> 46:04.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THIS IDEA THAT PEOPLE COULD

46:04.767 --> 46:07.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE VIDEO AND IT COULD GO VIRAL

46:07.767 --> 46:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN IT COULD BE RAPID

46:10.200 --> 46:10.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSE TO INCIDENCE IN THE WAY

46:10.967 --> 46:12.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT TOOK A LONG TIME BEFORE.

46:12.767 --> 46:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE IS JUST LIKE REALLY POWERFUL

46:14.500 --> 46:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THIS WAY OF ACTIVISM HAS

46:17.000 --> 46:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY DEVELOPED AND EXPLODED IN

46:19.400 --> 46:21.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY WAYS AS WE'VE SEEN IN THESE

46:21.467 --> 46:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITIES.

46:21.800 --> 46:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER PIECE I THOUGHT ABOUT

46:22.933 --> 46:24.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS THIS NEW TALK NOW THAT WE

46:24.967 --> 46:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE WITH OUR CHILDREN AS

46:26.100 --> 46:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARENTS.

46:26.433 --> 46:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS ABOUT WATCHING VIDEOS

46:30.733 --> 46:31.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER AND OVER.

46:31.167 --> 46:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I FOUND MYSELF EACH MORNING WHEN

46:32.900 --> 46:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE VIDEOS CAME OUT WAS THE

46:34.300 --> 46:37.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KILLING OF THE MAN IN LOUISIANA

46:37.267 --> 46:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN MINNESOTA, WANTED TO

46:39.300 --> 46:41.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HURRY UP GET TO MY CHILDREN SAY

46:41.267 --> 46:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S A VIDEO OUT, IT WILL BE

46:42.700 --> 46:44.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON SNAPCHAT, IN YOUR NEWS FEED

46:44.967 --> 46:46.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT YOU NEED TO PREPARE YOURSELF

46:46.567 --> 46:48.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A WAY THAT WE DIDN'T

46:48.367 --> 46:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPERIENCE WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER,

46:49.600 --> 46:50.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST

46:50.967 --> 46:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RETRAUMATIZING.

46:51.433 --> 46:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AS A RETIRED POLICE OFFICER,

46:53.233 --> 46:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WAS HARD TO RECONCILE FOR

46:54.900 --> 46:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU AFTER THE EVENTS OF THE PAST

46:56.300 --> 46:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO WEEKS?

46:57.300 --> 47:00.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I TELL YOU, IT WASN'T -- NOT

47:00.167 --> 47:03.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE.

47:03.267 --> 47:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE -- I EXPECT THEM AT

47:05.300 --> 47:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS POINT GIVEN THE TRAGIC

47:07.333 --> 47:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HISTORY OF EVENTS, GIVEN THE

47:09.200 --> 47:11.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAGIC HISTORY OF POOR POLICE

47:11.667 --> 47:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITY RELATIONS GIVEN THE

47:13.833 --> 47:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACT THAT I REALIZE THAT WE LIVE

47:15.133 --> 47:16.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A WORLD WE HAVE CRAZY FOLK

47:16.167 --> 47:17.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT THERE.

47:17.767 --> 47:19.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SOMETIMES THOSE CRAZY PEOPLE

47:19.667 --> 47:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL ENGAGE IN ALL TYPES OF

47:21.000 --> 47:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIOLENT ACTS.

47:22.467 --> 47:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND EVEN SOMETIMES AGAINST

47:24.333 --> 47:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AUTHORITY OR GOVERNMENT, FOR

47:25.000 --> 47:28.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXAMPLE.

47:28.367 --> 47:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THERE IS NOTHING SHOCKING.

47:29.400 --> 47:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS, HOWEVER, QUITE TRAUMATIC

47:31.533 --> 47:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS MONIFA END DIETED WATCH,

47:34.333 --> 47:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBSERVE THESE VIDEOS OVER AND

OVER AGAIN AND TRAUMATIC TO HAVE

47:38.533 --> 47:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO LIVE THROUGH, EXPLAIN,

47:40.400 --> 47:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RATIONALIZE MANY OF THE EVENTS

47:43.633 --> 47:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE VIDEOS DEPICT.

47:44.633 --> 47:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WEEKS STRUCK A CHORD WITH YOU?

47:53.933 --> 47:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NONE OF THESE EVENTS SEEM

47:54.967 --> 47:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULARLY UNEXPECTED.

47:59.233 --> 48:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIVEN WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE

48:00.600 --> 48:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAST TWO YEARS.

48:04.300 --> 48:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNFORTUNATELY.

48:04.733 --> 48:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNFORTUNATELY ALSO I THINK WE'VE

48:07.567 --> 48:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN UNWILLING TO SORT OF

48:09.233 --> 48:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISAGGREGATE WHAT ARE TO A

CERTAIN EXTENT DIFFERENT EVENTS,

48:14.800 --> 48:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEED TO BE SORT OF PROPERLY

48:16.633 --> 48:23.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTEXTUALIZEED, IN THE DEATHS WE

48:23.067 --> 48:25.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE A CERTAIN TYPE OF VIOLENCE

48:25.967 --> 48:28.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AS MOW FEE FA POINTS OUT WE

48:28.767 --> 48:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE INSTANT ACCESS TO THAT --

48:30.633 --> 48:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THE FLIP SIDE OF

48:33.800 --> 48:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCOUNTABILITY IS SNAP JUDGMENT.

48:37.533 --> 48:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH AS WE SAW IN THE CASE OF

48:39.433 --> 48:40.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BROWN OR READY GREY,

48:40.967 --> 48:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THESE OTHER CASES, MANY

48:43.200 --> 48:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF KNOWS SNAP JUDGMENTS TURN OUT

48:45.000 --> 48:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE WRONG, TURN OUT TO BE

48:47.133 --> 48:47.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNJUSTIFIABLE.

48:47.567 --> 48:49.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE AS IN DALLAS WE HAD VERY

48:49.267 --> 48:50.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBVIOUS CASE OF WHAT WAS

48:50.967 --> 48:54.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EFFECTIVELY DOMESTIC TERROR.

48:54.867 --> 48:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, IT'S SIMPLY IMPORTANT IN THE

48:57.133 --> 48:59.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTEXT OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT

48:59.667 --> 49:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAGEDIES TO ALSO BE

49:01.000 --> 49:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENTIATING THE

49:02.500 --> 49:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THESE

49:04.000 --> 49:06.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVENTS AND BY DOING THAT, I

49:06.467 --> 49:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK WE CAN FIGURE OUT MORE

49:07.500 --> 49:09.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTRUCTIVE WAYS TO ADDRESS ALL

49:09.667 --> 49:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THEM.

49:10.033 --> 49:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE OUGHT TO KEEP IN CONTEXT,

49:12.400 --> 49:14.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEEP IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT

49:14.367 --> 49:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFTENTIMES, AS WAS INDICATED THE

49:16.333 --> 49:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REACTION, THE RESPONSE, SOME

49:18.533 --> 49:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIMES VISCERAL RESPONSE, IS NOT

49:21.967 --> 49:24.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF RUSH TO JUDGMENT, PER SE.

49:24.667 --> 49:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT IS A REACTION TO WHAT

49:26.400 --> 49:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE SEE AND OBSERVE AND

49:28.033 --> 49:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RECOGNIZE TO BE A SYSTEM THAT IS

49:30.400 --> 49:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN NEED OF REFORM.

49:32.300 --> 49:33.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS

49:33.667 --> 49:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT THERE WHO ACT, UNDER THE

49:36.100 --> 49:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLOR OF LAW, PERPETRATE CERTAIN

49:38.533 --> 49:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFENSES AGAINST CIVILIAN

49:40.133 --> 49:41.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POPULATION, AT LEAST TO THEIR

49:41.567 --> 49:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUESS.

49:41.867 --> 49:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN THE ARGUMENT BECOMES,

49:43.733 --> 49:46.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSTEAD OF WHAT CAUSED THIS, HOW

49:46.467 --> 49:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DID THIS HAPPEN, WAS IT

49:47.733 --> 49:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AVOIDABLE.

49:48.300 --> 49:49.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT NOW BECOMES A SITUATION WHERE

49:49.667 --> 49:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE SAY, WAS IT JUSTIFIED OR

49:52.400 --> 49:52.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT JUSTIFIED.

49:52.867 --> 49:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE

49:54.300 --> 49:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO REACT IMMEDIATELY.

49:56.600 --> 49:58.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO REALLY

49:58.367 --> 49:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREN'T THAT INTERESTED,

49:59.400 --> 50:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED

50:00.433 --> 50:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE LOSS OF LIFE AND FEEL

50:02.400 --> 50:03.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAIN AND SADNESS ABOUT THAT,

50:03.467 --> 50:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT, REALLY ARE

50:05.333 --> 50:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN DEEPLY INVOLVED AS

50:06.633 --> 50:08.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTIVISTS ARE.

50:08.067 --> 50:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOESN'T AFFECT THEIR DAILY

50:09.300 --> 50:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIVES, DOESN'T COME TO THEIR

50:10.033 --> 50:11.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRONT DOOR, AREN'T REALLY

50:11.567 --> 50:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTED IN POLICE REFORM.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THOSE

50:14.000 --> 50:15.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE, THIS IS JUST A HEADLINE

50:15.367 --> 50:16.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY READ IN THE NEWS THEN MOVE

50:16.367 --> 50:17.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON WITH THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

50:17.767 --> 50:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE STEP

50:19.300 --> 50:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S SHOES.

50:21.300 --> 50:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE

50:22.000 --> 50:23.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO COME UP WITH A

50:23.067 --> 50:25.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLLECTIVE SOLUTION.

50:25.467 --> 50:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING

50:26.333 --> 50:29.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE ABLE TO ACTUAL LIES THE

50:29.067 --> 50:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFFIRMATION THAT BLACK LIVES

50:30.933 --> 50:31.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTER.

50:31.267 --> 50:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYONE HAS TO STEP OUTSIDE OF

50:34.233 --> 50:34.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE AND TAKE A

50:34.967 --> 50:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK AT THIS.

50:36.333 --> 50:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE RIGHT

50:37.033 --> 50:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEXT TO THEM THAT CAN'T STEP OUT

50:38.733 --> 50:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE SITUATION.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE

50:42.500 --> 50:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REMOVED FROM THIS SITUATION.

50:44.633 --> 50:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT

50:45.400 --> 50:46.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS WHITE PEOPLE.

50:46.667 --> 50:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BLACK PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO BE

50:48.300 --> 50:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOTALLY REMOVED FROM THE

50:49.533 --> 50:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATION.

50:49.900 --> 50:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'VE HEARD COUNTLESS STORIES NO

50:51.733 --> 50:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTER THE SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS,

50:53.100 --> 50:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE, WHO

50:54.533 --> 50:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU ARE, THIS IS YOUR REALITY

50:57.233 --> 50:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS,

50:59.200 --> 51:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADDRESS IT AT SOME POINT.

51:01.200 --> 51:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST TO BE CLEAR, BLACK FOLK

51:02.600 --> 51:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN'T AFFORD TO BE READ MOVED

51:03.700 --> 51:06.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE SITUATION AT ANY LEVEL.

51:06.367 --> 51:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IAN, YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT

51:07.400 --> 51:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BLACK LIVES MATTER AND

51:08.900 --> 51:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLIMENTARY ABOUT SOME PARTS

51:10.333 --> 51:13.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE MOVEMENT AND CRITICISMS.

51:13.267 --> 51:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELL ME ONE THING YOU THINK OF

51:14.233 --> 51:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MOVEMENT IS REALLY

51:16.133 --> 51:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCOMPLISHING THAT'S POSITIVE

51:16.833 --> 51:18.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SOMETHING ABOUT THE MOVEMENT

51:18.067 --> 51:18.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT TROUBLES YOU.

51:18.967 --> 51:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK MONIFA LAID OUT WHAT

51:22.433 --> 51:25.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEMS LIKE PHILOSOPHICAL COMMON

51:25.467 --> 51:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROUND, THE BLACK LIVES MATTER

51:26.800 --> 51:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN MY READING IS PREDICATED ON

51:28.833 --> 51:31.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS SORT OF IMAGINATIVE ACT OF

51:31.767 --> 51:33.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPASSION WHICH IS STEP OUT OF

51:33.667 --> 51:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOURSELF, PEOPLE WHO DON'T

51:35.600 --> 51:37.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTAND THE PAIN AND THE FEAR

51:37.567 --> 51:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT DOES EXIST IN THE BLACK

51:39.600 --> 51:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITY.

51:40.700 --> 51:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEP OUT OF YOUR LIVES AND INTO

51:42.733 --> 51:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT POSITION AND TRY TO

51:44.500 --> 51:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTAND IT.

51:44.933 --> 51:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THAT'S A WAY -- THAT'S

51:47.633 --> 51:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN BE VERY POWERFUL WAY TO

51:50.133 --> 51:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISSOLVE BARRIERS.

51:52.433 --> 51:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT I'M CRITICAL OF IS THAT A

51:54.167 --> 51:55.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF BLACK LIVES MATTER

51:55.367 --> 51:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTIVIST DON'T SEEM TO BE

WILLING TO DO THAT FOR LAW

51:58.667 --> 51:59.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENFORCEMENT.

51:59.067 --> 52:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UPLOOK AT A SITUATION LIKE WE

52:00.700 --> 52:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD SHORTLY AFTER DALLAS.

52:04.500 --> 52:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE YOU TALKED TO POLICE

52:06.000 --> 52:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICERS, I HAVE POLICE OFFICERS

52:08.600 --> 52:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN MY FAMILY WHO TALKED ABOUT

52:10.500 --> 52:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS AS WELL.

52:11.533 --> 52:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICE OFFICERS ACROSS THE

52:12.433 --> 52:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY WERE FRIGHTENED, THEY

52:13.633 --> 52:16.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE VERY SCARED, PERHAPS MORE

52:16.167 --> 52:20.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFRAID THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN

52:20.767 --> 52:21.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS.

52:21.067 --> 52:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE ACT OF A LOT OF BLACK

52:22.733 --> 52:25.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIVES MATTER DEMONSTRATORS WAS

52:25.067 --> 52:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO RATCHET UP TENSIONS.

52:27.233 --> 52:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN PLACES LIKE BATON ROUGE

52:29.233 --> 52:31.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ST. PAUL AND CHICAGO, TO

52:31.267 --> 52:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECOME VIOLENT.

52:32.900 --> 52:35.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT TO ME SAYS THAT A LOT OF

52:35.467 --> 52:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTIVISTS ARE DEMANDING

52:38.333 --> 52:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T

52:41.667 --> 52:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTAND THE FEAR IN THE BLACK

52:42.433 --> 52:43.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE NOT

52:43.667 --> 52:46.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
