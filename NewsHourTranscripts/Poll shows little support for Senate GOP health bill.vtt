JUDY WOODRUFF: The "NewsHour,"
in partnership with the Marist
Institute for Public Opinion

00:04.766 --> 00:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and NPR, is out with a new
poll that looks at Americans'
opinions on President Trump,

00:10.933 --> 00:13.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
health care, the
economy and more.

00:13.200 --> 00:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining me now to dig into
the results are Lee Miringoff
of Marist and Amy Walter of

00:19.066 --> 00:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Cook Political Report.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

00:22.066 --> 00:24.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lee, I'm going to
start with you.

00:24.066 --> 00:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's look at one of the
questions, first, about the
Republican health care plan...

00:26.700 --> 00:27.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LEE MIRINGOFF, Director,
Marist Institute for
Public Opinion: Sure.

00:27.900 --> 00:29.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
... in the Senate.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the plan the
president is pushing for.

00:30.933 --> 00:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You asked people their
assessment of the Senate plan.

00:34.066 --> 00:35.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did you find?

00:35.633 --> 00:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEE MIRINGOFF: Well, it was very
poor in terms of public opinion.

00:39.166 --> 00:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what's fascinating in the
numbers is even a plurality of
Republicans around the nation

00:45.933 --> 00:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are unsure on terms of the
Senate health care plan.

00:49.400 --> 00:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the Republicans took a very
big risk going forward with
something when they didn't even

00:55.800 --> 00:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have their core following
solidly behind them.

00:57.933 --> 01:00.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think the proof
is in the results.

01:00.633 --> 01:04.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Democrats,
obviously, were opposed.

01:04.333 --> 01:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Independents have been scurrying
away from the Republicans
and questioning President

01:10.733 --> 01:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump and Republicans in
Congress in greater numbers.

01:13.500 --> 01:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, as far as the health care
proposal is concerned, it
clearly didn't have the kind

01:20.500 --> 01:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of support that you would want
to go forward with if you're
trying to make such a major

01:25.766 --> 01:27.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

01:27.833 --> 01:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just to quickly
go over the numbers, approval
overall, 17 percent of the

01:29.900 --> 01:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senate plan,
disapproval, 55 percent.

01:33.200 --> 01:37.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then when you ask
people if they approved
of the way Republicans
in Congress are handling

01:37.533 --> 01:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
health care, it was 21
percent approval, 65
percent disapproval.

01:43.700 --> 01:44.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Amy, what does
all this tell you?

01:44.966 --> 01:47.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER, The Cook
Political Report: Yes.

01:47.033 --> 01:49.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, Lee makes a very
good point that, even
among Republicans,
there's not a tremendous

01:49.766 --> 01:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
amount of support, not only
for the bill, but for the way
that Republicans in Congress

01:53.833 --> 01:55.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are handling it.

01:55.966 --> 02:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think a very small plurality
of Republicans said they like
the job that Republicans in

02:00.966 --> 02:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Congress are doing on this.

02:02.966 --> 02:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Quite frankly, Republicans
have not done a very good job
shaping and defining this bill.

02:06.533 --> 02:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's being defined by what it
isn't as much as by what it is.

02:10.066 --> 02:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's pretty clear
in the polling data
that we're seeing here.

02:14.633 --> 02:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other interesting thing that
I found in this poll was that,
when they asked the question

02:19.333 --> 02:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about who would you blame
if this all falls apart, if
there's no repeal of Obamacare,

02:26.333 --> 02:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and most Americans -- this is
true of Democrat, Republican,
independent -- they don't blame

02:30.133 --> 02:32.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They either blame Republicans
-- independents and Democrats
say they would blame Republicans

02:34.900 --> 02:36.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Congress.

02:36.633 --> 02:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans say they
blame Democrats mostly.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But Trump gets
very little blame.

02:40.700 --> 02:43.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEE MIRINGOFF: What is really
interesting is that although
Obamacare really doesn't

02:43.766 --> 02:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a champion right now, most
of the talk has been how to
replace and repeal, it remains

02:50.166 --> 02:52.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
popular with Americans.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think -- so the
Republican proposal not
only wasn't well-organized.

02:56.400 --> 03:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It really flew in the face
of what public opinion is, so
really going uphill on this.

03:02.966 --> 03:04.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think that's why
they have had such a
difficult time with it.

03:04.900 --> 03:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lee, you
also asked the generic question,
what do people think of

03:07.833 --> 03:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the job the president is doing?

03:10.333 --> 03:15.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think, not
surprising, along party
lines, a large majority
of Republicans like what

03:15.333 --> 03:17.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he's doing.

03:17.266 --> 03:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A large majority of Democrats
dislike it, but among
independents, some interesting,

03:21.233 --> 03:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
interesting results.

03:23.333 --> 03:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEE MIRINGOFF: Yes, and the
independents are the group,
of course, in the middle.

03:27.200 --> 03:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, they're much more
like Democrats right now than
Republicans in terms of their

03:33.566 --> 03:35.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attitude.

03:35.600 --> 03:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they have grown in their
disapproval of President Trump
since the first poll right

03:40.300 --> 03:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after he took office.

03:42.300 --> 03:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now almost 60 percent
of independents have a
negative view of him.

03:47.166 --> 03:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And those numbers have gone
up, the negative numbers have.

03:50.300 --> 03:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there's a real question on
their part about the direction
the country is going in and

03:55.066 --> 04:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of other concerns that
they have on an issue-by-issue
basis, health care being

04:00.000 --> 04:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one, but others of concern
to independents as well.

04:04.666 --> 04:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They were willing to
give him the benefit
of the doubt initially,
but that has certainly

04:08.833 --> 04:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
evaporated, and whatever
political capital he
had with this group,
that's been well spent

04:13.833 --> 04:15.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
- - or it has been
spent, I should say.

04:15.866 --> 04:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, what do
you see in these numbers,
especially among independents?

04:19.966 --> 04:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, Lee framed it
perfectly, which is whatever
benefit of the doubt they

04:26.933 --> 04:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may be giving -- they may have
been giving the president in
January, and it was a very

04:29.866 --> 04:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thin benefit, it's been
dried up pretty well by now.

04:34.400 --> 04:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you're also looking, if
you just think historically
or look historically, at what

04:38.433 --> 04:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it means to have support for
independents this low, and if
you look at the last midterm

04:45.433 --> 04:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elections where a president
had low approval ratings with
independents at this number,

04:48.233 --> 04:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
somewhere between 30 percent,
35 percent approval rating among
independents, they went on to

04:52.833 --> 04:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lose a very large number of
seats in that midterm election.

04:56.500 --> 05:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that really could be the
tipping point for a lot of
these Republicans, too, who are

05:00.666 --> 05:02.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up in 2018.

05:02.733 --> 05:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They may sit in districts that
a Republican carried or that
are Republican-leaning, but

05:06.200 --> 05:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they count on independents
coming over and supporting
the Republican in the November

05:12.366 --> 05:14.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

05:14.833 --> 05:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If those independents are
feeling dissatisfied or
they're feeling dispirited,
or, quite frankly,

05:20.266 --> 05:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're feeling angry --
that's the other important
thing to note about this poll.

05:22.633 --> 05:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not just that independents
felt like they didn't
approve of Donald Trump.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their strong disapproval
ratings of Donald Trump are
somewhere -- for President Trump

05:31.666 --> 05:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - are somewhere in the 40
percent range vs. just I think
it's in the teens that strongly

05:37.500 --> 05:40.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
support him.

05:40.100 --> 05:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that intensity of
disapproval is a real - -
should be a real warning
sign for all Republicans,

05:45.266 --> 05:47.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
especially those
who are up in 2018.

05:47.300 --> 05:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly,
Lee, you also asked a question
I hadn't seen before, and

05:51.133 --> 05:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that was comparing who is a
more effective leader, President
Trump or former President

05:56.000 --> 05:57.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Obama?

05:57.600 --> 06:01.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Thirty-four percent
President Trump, 58
percent President Obama.

06:01.266 --> 06:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I guess that mirrors overall
support for this president.

06:04.966 --> 06:07.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LEE MIRINGOFF: Yes.

06:07.033 --> 06:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, and former presidents
always look do better after
they have completed their term

06:13.300 --> 06:16.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in office, but at this
point in President
Obama's administration
in '09, his numbers

06:18.033 --> 06:20.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were in the mid-50s.

06:20.100 --> 06:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Contrast that with the low
to mid-30s with Donald Trump,
and you see the answer to the

06:24.366 --> 06:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
question, why is this president
having such a difficult time
in the court of public opinion?

06:30.733 --> 06:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
fascinating numbers.

06:32.266 --> 06:33.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's more there.

06:33.466 --> 06:34.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I know everybody
will want to dig in.

06:34.666 --> 06:36.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can find it all
on our Web site.

06:36.733 --> 06:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the meantime, Lee Miringoff
of Marist, Amy Walter of The
Cook Political Report, thank

06:37.400 --> 06:38.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you both.

06:38.333 --> 06:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

06:39.266 --> 06:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEE MIRINGOFF: Thank you, Judy.
