10,000 TO 20,000, DEPENDING ON

06:20.981 --> 06:22.616
HOW YOU COUNT, SHOULD HAVE A

06:22.616 --> 06:23.950
REASONABLE CHANCE OF PUSHING

06:23.950 --> 06:24.718
THEM OUT.

06:24.718 --> 06:25.685
AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

THOSE DETAILS THAT EVEN WE ARE

06:33.193 --> 06:34.427
TALKING ABOUT, THERE'S BEEN

06:37.030 --> 06:38.798
SAYING WE JUST TELEGRAPHED OUR

06:40.533 --> 06:41.968
THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTING

06:41.968 --> 06:43.336
DISPUTE ABOUT WHY DID THIS

06:43.336 --> 06:43.970
HAPPEN?

06:43.970 --> 06:45.505
WHY WAS CENTCOM TALKING ABOUT

06:45.505 --> 06:46.206
IT?

06:46.206 --> 06:47.741
WHY ARE THE IRAQIS NOT TALKING

06:47.741 --> 06:49.342
ABOUT IT, RATHER THAN THE

06:49.342 --> 06:50.610
AMERICANS?

06:50.610 --> 06:52.312
SENATOR GRAHAM AND SENATOR

06:52.312 --> 06:53.747
McCAIN ARE CLEARLY A LITTLE BIT

06:53.747 --> 06:55.815
UPSET ABOUT TIPPING OUR HAND.

06:55.815 --> 06:57.651
AND THERE'S A LOT OF BAFFLEMENT

ESTABLISHMENT.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.721
YOU KNOW, WAS THIS SOME MILITARY

07:01.721 --> 07:02.922
OFFICER FREELANCING?

07:02.922 --> 07:04.791
DID THE WHITE HOUSE WANT THIS TO

07:04.791 --> 07:05.358
HAPPEN?

07:05.358 --> 07:07.560
JUST EXACTLY HOW AND WHY DID

07:07.560 --> 07:08.395
THIS HAPPEN?

07:08.395 --> 07:09.429
OR IS THIS SOME PART OF SOME

07:09.429 --> 07:11.231
GRAND INFORMATION PLANT, THE

07:11.231 --> 07:12.666
"WASHINGTON POST" IS REPORTING,

07:12.666 --> 07:14.801
TO DOWNGRADE THE MORALE OF THE

07:14.801 --> 07:16.336
FIGHTERS IN MOSUL AND TRY TO

07:16.336 --> 07:17.837
MAKE IT LESS OF A SPECTACULAR

07:17.837 --> 07:18.805
BATTLE THAN IT MIGHT OTHERWISE

07:18.805 --> 07:19.572
BE?

07:19.572 --> 07:20.307
>> Sreenivasan: WELL, HOW

07:20.307 --> 07:21.341
DIFFICULT IS IT TO FIGHT WITH

07:21.341 --> 07:23.009
10,000 TO 20,000 PEOPLE AGAINST

07:23.009 --> 07:24.911
A POPULATION OF 1,000 OR 2,000

07:24.911 --> 07:27.514
IN A LARGE CITY, OR A CITY OF

07:27.514 --> 07:28.815
MAYBE A MILLION, TWO MILLION

07:28.815 --> 07:29.549
PEOPLE?

07:29.549 --> 07:31.685
>> IT COULD BE VERY DIFFICULT.

07:31.685 --> 07:32.619
AND HERE'S THE ISSUE WITH THE

07:32.619 --> 07:34.421
BATTLE OF MOSUL THAT'S GOING TO

07:34.421 --> 07:35.522
COME.

07:35.522 --> 07:37.157
IT COULD BE SO VERY, VERY

07:37.157 --> 07:38.024
DIFFERENT.

07:38.024 --> 07:39.559
AGAIN, THE "WASHINGTON POST"

07:39.559 --> 07:41.061
STORY SAYS WE WANT IT TO BE MORE

07:41.061 --> 07:42.562
LIKE THE LIBERATION OF PARIS

07:42.562 --> 07:44.698
THAN LIKE STALINGRAD.

07:44.698 --> 07:45.632
AND THAT IS A DISTINCT

07:45.632 --> 07:46.566
POSSIBILITY.

07:46.566 --> 07:48.034
AGAIN, IF THERE'S ONLY 1,000 OR

07:48.034 --> 07:49.703
2,000 ISLAMIC STATE FIGHTERS IN

07:49.703 --> 07:51.371
MOSUL IN A POPULATION OF ONE

07:51.371 --> 07:53.840
MILLION, IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE

07:53.840 --> 07:56.476
THAT AS THE IRAQI FORCES CLOSE

07:56.476 --> 07:58.611
THAT THERE COULD BE A LOT OF

07:58.611 --> 08:00.847
GUERILLAS INSIDE THE CITY WHO

08:00.847 --> 08:02.349
ASSASSINATE KEY LEADERS, WHO

08:02.349 --> 08:03.683
BREAK DOWN DEFENSES, WHO DESTROY

08:03.683 --> 08:05.885
THEIR SUPPLIES, AND THAT

08:05.885 --> 08:07.487
THEREFORE THE BATTLE OF MOSUL

08:07.487 --> 08:09.723
IS LESS A BANG THAN A WHIMPER.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.491
ON THE OTHER HAND, IT COULD LOOK

08:11.491 --> 08:12.859
LIKE STALINGRAD, AND IT COULD

08:12.859 --> 08:14.728
LOOK LIKE ANYTHING IN BETWEEN.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.663
AND SO, IT'S JUST VERY DIFFICULT

08:16.663 --> 08:18.264
TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW THIS BATTLE

08:18.264 --> 08:19.265
WILL UNFOLD.

08:19.265 --> 08:20.033
>> Sreenivasan: SO, DOES THIS

08:20.033 --> 08:21.134
CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR THE

08:21.134 --> 08:22.602
DIFFERENT ISIL FACTIONS IN THE

08:22.602 --> 08:24.371
REGION TO BAND TOGETHER AND TRY

08:24.371 --> 08:25.572
TO DEFEND MOSUL?

08:25.572 --> 08:27.006
OR, POSSIBLY, FOR THESE PEOPLE,

08:27.006 --> 08:28.208
THESE 1,000 OR 2,000, TO SAY,

08:28.208 --> 08:29.409
"HERE'S MY TICKET OUT, LET ME GO

08:29.409 --> 08:31.277
NOW TO ISIL IN SYRIA"?

08:31.277 --> 08:32.212
>> WELL, THAT'S A GREAT

08:32.212 --> 08:33.446
QUESTION, AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S

08:33.446 --> 08:35.482
THE PROBLEM WITH WAR IS, IT'S

08:35.482 --> 08:36.883
VERY MULTIVARIANT AND THINGS CAN

08:36.883 --> 08:38.218
GO EITHER WAY.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.652
SO, YOU CAN SEE EITHER OF THOSE

08:39.652 --> 08:40.687
OUTCOMES HAPPENING.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.455
THIS COULD WORK IN THE SENSE OF

08:42.455 --> 08:45.425
MAKING THE FIGHTERS IN MOSUL,

08:45.425 --> 08:46.626
PARTICULARLY AS THEY ARE

08:46.626 --> 08:47.727
BECOMING MORE ISOLATED.

08:47.727 --> 08:49.996
THE KURDS ARE PUTTING IN THIS

08:49.996 --> 08:52.799
PERIMETER AROUND THE NORTH AND

08:52.799 --> 08:54.367
NORTHWEST OF MOSUL, STARTING TO

08:54.367 --> 08:56.302
CUT THEM OFF FROM SYRIA AND

08:56.302 --> 08:57.604
MAKING THEM MORE ISOLATED.

08:57.604 --> 08:58.605
AND THEY MAY START TO FEEL THAT

08:58.605 --> 09:00.173
AND DECIDE IT'S BETTER TO LIVE

09:00.173 --> 09:01.708
AND FIGHT ANOTHER DAY SOMEPLACE

09:01.708 --> 09:02.575
ELSE.

09:02.575 --> 09:03.743
ON THE OTHER HAND, IT COULD GO

09:03.743 --> 09:05.011
THE OPPOSITE WAY, AND THEY COULD

09:05.011 --> 09:06.546
DIG IN AND DECIDE TO FIGHT.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.981
AND WE JUST DON'T KNOW.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.449
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH WAR.

09:09.449 --> 09:10.383
>> Sreenivasan: SO, DO WE HAVE

09:10.383 --> 09:12.419
GREATER CONFIDENCE NOW IN THE

09:12.419 --> 09:14.020
IRAQI FORCES THAT THEY'RE UP TO

09:14.020 --> 09:14.988
THIS TASK?

09:14.988 --> 09:15.755
>> WE SEEM TO.

09:15.755 --> 09:16.523
IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE MORE

09:16.523 --> 09:18.358
RELIABLE UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN

09:18.358 --> 09:20.193
PUSHED UP FROM THE SOUTH THAT

09:20.193 --> 09:21.761
ARE GETTING EXTRA TRAINING FROM

09:21.761 --> 09:24.397
THE AMERICAN TRAINERS WHO HAVE

09:24.397 --> 09:25.832
BEEN IN COUNTRY FOR ABOUT SIX

09:25.832 --> 09:27.367
MONTHS NOW, AND THAT THERE IS A

09:27.367 --> 09:28.535
LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE THAT THESE

09:28.535 --> 09:30.336
FORCES MAY BE READY TO DO THE

09:30.336 --> 09:32.872
TYPE OF HARD, IN-THE-CITY

09:32.872 --> 09:34.641
FIGHTING THAT'S REQUIRED.

09:34.641 --> 09:35.842
OF COURSE, THERE ARE DOUBTERS.

09:35.842 --> 09:37.544
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD SAY

09:37.544 --> 09:38.645
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

09:38.645 --> 09:40.246
BUT I THINK MAINSTREAM OPINION

09:40.246 --> 09:41.881
IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

09:41.881 --> 09:42.749
READY.

09:42.749 --> 09:43.483
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

09:43.483 --> 09:44.350
DOUGLAS OLLIVANT, THANKS SO

09:44.350 --> 09:44.851
MUCH.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.352
>> THANK YOU.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.695
>> Sreenivasan: EUROPEAN UNION

09:55.695 --> 09:57.230
REGULATORS ANNOUNCED THIS WEEK

09:57.230 --> 09:58.498
THEY'RE DEVELOPING NEW RULES

09:58.498 --> 09:59.365
THAT COULD FORCE BIG

09:59.365 --> 10:01.067
MULTINATIONALS TO PAY HIGHER

10:01.067 --> 10:02.669
TAXES IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE

10:02.669 --> 10:04.304
THEY OPERATE, COMPANIES LIKE

10:04.304 --> 10:06.840
AMAZON IN COUNTRIES LIKE FRANCE.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.274
AMAZON HAS ALREADY COME UNDER

10:08.274 --> 10:09.809
FIRE THERE BY BOOKSELLERS WHO

10:09.809 --> 10:11.678
BELIEVE THE WAY IT SELLS BOOKS

10:11.678 --> 10:13.913
IS THREATENING THEIR BUSINESSES

10:13.913 --> 10:15.448
AND EVEN UNDERMINING THE FRENCH

10:15.448 --> 10:17.450
WAY OF LIFE, CHARGES THAT DON'T

10:17.450 --> 10:19.185
SIT ESPECIALLY WELL WITH THE

10:19.185 --> 10:20.086
COMPANY.

10:20.086 --> 10:20.954
THE NEWSHOUR'S MEGAN THOMPSON

10:20.954 --> 10:22.455
TRAVELED TO FRANCE RECENTLY AND

10:22.455 --> 10:24.424
FILED THIS REPORT.

10:25.725 --> 10:26.559
>> Reporter: THE FRENCH ARE

10:26.559 --> 10:27.627
PROUD OF THEIR GREAT CULTURAL

10:27.627 --> 10:30.196
TRADITIONS-- LINGERING AT CAFES,

10:30.196 --> 10:32.198
CELEBRATING THEIR ARCHITECTURE

10:32.198 --> 10:33.533
AND FINE ART.

10:33.533 --> 10:34.834
AND THEN, THERE'S THE FRENCH

10:34.834 --> 10:36.202
LOVE OF BOOKS.

10:36.202 --> 10:38.004
THIS IS THE NATION OF VOLTAIRE,

10:38.004 --> 10:40.807
VICTOR HUGO, EMILE ZOLA AND

10:40.807 --> 10:42.075
JULES VERNE.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.877
>> BOOKS ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN

10:43.877 --> 10:44.611
FRANCE.

10:44.611 --> 10:47.313
FRANCE IS A VERY OLD LITERARY

10:47.313 --> 10:48.348
NATION.

10:48.348 --> 10:49.349
>> Reporter: PIERRE ASSOULINE IS

10:49.349 --> 10:50.650
A WELL-KNOWN FRENCH AUTHOR WHO'S

10:50.650 --> 10:52.352
WRITTEN 30 BOOKS.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.720
SO, THEY TALK ABOUT BOOKS AND

10:53.720 --> 10:55.588
LITERATURE THE WAY WE AMERICANS

10:55.588 --> 10:57.090
MIGHT TALK ABOUT SPORTS OR

10:57.090 --> 10:57.857
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

10:57.857 --> 10:58.958
>> ABOUT BASEBALL.

10:58.958 --> 10:59.659
>> Reporter: ABOUT BASEBALL.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.593
>> YES.

11:00.593 --> 11:01.294
>> Reporter: BOOKS HAVE A

11:01.294 --> 11:02.595
SPECIAL STATUS IN FRANCE.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.531
A CONCEPT CALLED THE CULTURAL

11:04.531 --> 11:06.399
EXCEPTION MEANS CUSTOMERS BUYING

11:06.399 --> 11:08.434
BOOKS PAY THE SAME LOW SALES TAX

11:08.434 --> 11:10.036
RATE AS THEY DO ON THINGS LIKE

11:10.036 --> 11:11.704
FOOD AND ELECTRICITY, BECAUSE

11:11.704 --> 11:13.139
THEY'RE ALL CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL

11:13.139 --> 11:14.240
GOODS.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.375
AND, IT TURNS OUT, THE FRENCH

11:15.375 --> 11:17.043
LOVE THEIR BOOKSTORES AS MUCH AS

11:17.043 --> 11:18.378
THEIR BOOKS.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.680
>> READERS ARE FAITHFUL AND

11:20.680 --> 11:22.749
LOYAL TO THE WRITER, IT'S

11:22.749 --> 11:23.483
OBVIOUS.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.885
BUT MAINLY TO A BOOK SELLER, TO

11:25.885 --> 11:27.820
THE OWNER OF A BOOKSTORE.

11:27.820 --> 11:28.855
>> Reporter: SO, IT'S PERSONAL.

11:28.855 --> 11:29.756
IT'S A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP.

11:29.756 --> 11:31.257
>> YES, IT'S VERY PERSONAL.

11:31.257 --> 11:32.392
>> Reporter: BUT NOW, SOME HERE

11:32.392 --> 11:33.693
FEAR THE FUTURE OF FRANCE'S

11:33.693 --> 11:36.462
2,500 OR SO BOOKSTORES MAY BE

11:36.462 --> 11:37.830
THREATENED AS MORE AND MORE

11:37.830 --> 11:39.032
CUSTOMERS BUY THEIR BOOKS

11:39.032 --> 11:39.966
ONLINE.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.267
AND THEY'RE BUYING FROM ONE

11:41.267 --> 11:43.269
ONLINE GIANT IN PARTICULAR:

11:43.269 --> 11:44.604
AMAZON.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.306
AMAZON NOW ACCOUNTS FOR AROUND

11:46.306 --> 11:48.174
10% OF ALL NEW BOOK SALES IN

11:48.174 --> 11:50.043
FRANCE AND IS ON TRACK TO BECOME

11:50.043 --> 11:51.344
THE BIGGEST BOOKSELLER HERE

11:51.344 --> 11:52.278
SOON.

11:52.278 --> 11:53.780
BUT SOME CRITICS THINK AMAZON'S

11:53.780 --> 11:55.148
GOTTEN THERE IN PART BY NOT

11:55.148 --> 11:57.016
PLAYING FAIRLY.

11:57.016 --> 11:58.318
>> (translated): IT IS, I

11:58.318 --> 11:59.886
WOULD SAY, A THUG.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.021
IT'S A THUG, SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T

12:02.021 --> 12:04.123
RESPECT THE LAWS IN PLACE WITHIN

12:04.123 --> 12:05.391
A COUNTRY AND A COUNTRY'S

12:05.391 --> 12:06.759
ECOSYSTEM.

12:06.759 --> 12:07.694
>> Reporter: RENNY AUPETIT OWNS

12:07.694 --> 12:09.896
A BOOKSTORE IN EASTERN PARIS.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.264
HE SAYS HE HAS A PROBLEM WITH

12:11.264 --> 12:13.132
THE WAY AMAZON TRIES TO MAXIMIZE

12:13.132 --> 12:14.867
PROFITS, INCLUDING ITS

12:14.867 --> 12:16.736
INTERPRETATION OF A LAW THAT'S

12:16.736 --> 12:18.571
HELPED SMALL BOOKSTORES COMPETE

12:18.571 --> 12:20.940
WITH BIG CHAINS FOR DECADES.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.308
IN 1981, THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT

12:22.308 --> 12:23.943
PASSED WHAT'S CALLED THE LANG

12:23.943 --> 12:25.712
LAW, WHICH ESSENTIALLY FIXED THE

12:25.712 --> 12:27.146
PRICE OF BOOKS.

12:27.146 --> 12:28.915
THE PUBLISHER PRINTS THE PRICE

12:28.915 --> 12:30.783
ON THE BACK AND NO ONE CAN SELL

12:30.783 --> 12:33.586
IT FOR MORE THAN A 5% DISCOUNT.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.221
SO, NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO-- TO

12:35.221 --> 12:36.656
A SMALL INDEPENDENT STORE, A

12:36.656 --> 12:38.858
LARGE CHAIN-- THE PRICE IS GOING

12:38.858 --> 12:41.227
TO BE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME.

12:41.227 --> 12:42.195
BUT WHAT THE AUTHORS OF THE LAW

12:42.195 --> 12:43.796
DIDN'T NECESSARILY FORESEE IN

12:43.796 --> 12:45.331
THE EARLY '80s WAS THE COMING OF

12:45.331 --> 12:47.700
THE INTERNET AND AMAZON.

12:47.700 --> 12:48.901
WHEN THE COMPANY LAUNCHED IN

12:48.901 --> 12:50.737
FRANCE 15 YEARS AGO, LIKE

12:50.737 --> 12:52.038
EVERYONE ELSE, IT COULD OFFER A

12:52.038 --> 12:53.873
DISCOUNT OF 5%.

12:53.873 --> 12:55.675
BUT AMAZON ALSO OFFERED FREE

12:55.675 --> 12:57.010
SHIPPING.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.478
THE FRENCH SAID THAT AMOUNTED TO

12:58.478 --> 12:59.979
AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OVER

12:59.979 --> 13:01.614
INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORES,

13:01.614 --> 13:03.016
ESPECIALLY WHEN COUPLED WITH THE

13:03.016 --> 13:04.250
CONVENIENCE OF SHOPPING FROM

13:04.250 --> 13:05.084
HOME.

13:05.084 --> 13:06.753
SO, THE FRENCH ASSEMBLY PASSED A

13:06.753 --> 13:09.555
BILL IN 2013 FORBIDDING ANY

13:09.555 --> 13:11.090
ONLINE RETAILER FROM OFFERING

13:11.090 --> 13:13.059
BOTH A DISCOUNT AND FREE

13:13.059 --> 13:14.027
SHIPPING.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.094
IN AN EMAIL TO NEWSHOUR, A

13:15.094 --> 13:16.896
REPRESENTATIVE FOR AMAZON

13:16.896 --> 13:18.898
DECLINED COMMENT ON THE LAW.

13:18.898 --> 13:20.400
BUT WHEN IT FIRST PASSED, THE

13:20.400 --> 13:22.168
COMPANY WAS QUOTED IN NEWS

13:22.168 --> 13:24.170
REPORTS SAYING: "ALL MEASURES

13:24.170 --> 13:25.371
THAT AIM TO RAISE THE PRICE OF

13:25.371 --> 13:27.073
BOOKS SOLD ONLINE WILL CURB THE

13:27.073 --> 13:28.775
ABILITY OF FRENCH PEOPLE TO BUY

13:28.775 --> 13:30.877
CULTURAL WORKS AND DISCRIMINATES

13:30.877 --> 13:33.112
AGAINST THOSE WHO BUY ONLINE."

13:33.112 --> 13:34.380
WHEN THE LAW WENT INTO EFFECT

13:34.380 --> 13:36.015
LAST YEAR, AMAZON AGREED TO

13:36.015 --> 13:38.384
CHARGE FOR SHIPPING, SORT OF.

13:38.384 --> 13:39.919
IT IMPOSED A SHIPPING CHARGE OF

13:39.919 --> 13:41.521
ONE CENT.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.588
SOME OF AMAZON'S OTHER BUSINESS

13:42.588 --> 13:44.123
TACTICS HAVE ALSO PROMPTED

14:20.126 --> 14:21.627
GOING TO SELL BOOKS IN FRANCE,

14:21.627 --> 14:23.863
IT SHOULD PAY TAXES HERE, TOO,

14:23.863 --> 14:25.131

18:38.284 --> 18:39.552

18:39.552 --> 18:41.620
AREAS OF FOCUS IN THIS REPORT?

18:41.620 --> 18:42.989
>> WELL, THE MAJOR AREA OF FOCUS

18:42.989 --> 18:44.857
WAS THAT WE SHOULD REALLY BE

18:44.857 --> 18:46.892
THINKING ABOUT THE WHOLE DIET, A

18:46.892 --> 18:48.427
DIETARY PATTERN, AND NOT JUST

18:48.427 --> 18:49.862
INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS, BECAUSE

18:49.862 --> 18:51.564
WE KNOW WHEN ONE COMPONENT OF

18:51.564 --> 18:52.765
THE DIET GOES UP, ANOTHER

18:52.765 --> 18:54.500
COMPONENT OF THE DIET GOES DOWN.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.635
DIFFERENT IS THAT FROM THE

19:00.873 --> 19:02.074
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THESE AREN'T

19:02.074 --> 19:02.675
RECOMMENDATIONS.

19:02.675 --> 19:03.909
REMEMBER, THIS IS JUST A SUMMARY

19:03.909 --> 19:05.678
OF AN EVIDENCE, A REPORT.

19:05.678 --> 19:08.414
AND I WOULD SAY SOME OF THE

19:08.414 --> 19:10.616
DIFFERENCES ARE THAT WE PUT LESS

19:10.616 --> 19:12.918
EMPHASIS ON RESTRICTING DIETARY

19:12.918 --> 19:14.787
CHOLESTEROL BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE

19:14.787 --> 19:16.789
DIDN'T SUPPORT IT.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.025
WE ADDRESSED ISSUES RELATED TO

19:19.025 --> 19:20.326
SODIUM, WHICH HAS BEEN QUITE

19:20.326 --> 19:22.361
CONTROVERSIAL, INDICATING THAT

19:22.361 --> 19:24.664
THE IMPORTANT THING TO FOCUS ON

19:24.664 --> 19:26.599
IS REDUCING SODIUM INTAKE.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.068
WE RECOMMENDED PUTTING A LIMIT

19:29.068 --> 19:31.237
ON THE AMOUNT OF ADDED SUGAR

19:31.237 --> 19:33.806
THAT ANYONE CONSUMES AT ONE

19:33.806 --> 19:34.640
TIME.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.942
AND THEN, ALSO ADDRESSED ISSUES

19:36.942 --> 19:39.512
RELATED TO COFFEE, INDICATING

19:39.512 --> 19:43.315
THAT COFFEE CONSUMPTION PER SE

19:43.315 --> 19:44.917
DOES NOT HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.118
IT MAY ACTUALLY HAVE BENEFICIAL

19:46.118 --> 19:47.386
EFFECTS, ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE TO BE

19:47.386 --> 19:49.355
CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF

19:49.355 --> 19:50.689
CREAM AND SUGAR THAT'S ADDED.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.490

19:51.490 --> 19:52.725
ALREADY GOTTEN PUSHBACK FROM THE

19:54.460 --> 19:55.394
SUGAR LOBBY, THE BEVERAGE

19:55.394 --> 19:56.729
INDUSTRY, BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF

19:56.729 --> 19:57.563
THE FIRST TIMES THAT I REMEMBER

19:57.563 --> 19:58.831
WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY SAYING

19:58.831 --> 20:00.966
CONSUME LESS OF SOMETHING, LIKE

20:00.966 --> 20:02.168
LESS RED MEAT.

20:02.168 --> 20:03.869
>> IN TERMS OF THE RED MEAT FROM

20:03.869 --> 20:05.304
THE MEAT INDUSTRY, I THINK THERE

20:05.304 --> 20:06.005
IS SOMEWHAT OF A

20:06.005 --> 20:07.006
MISUNDERSTANDING.

20:07.006 --> 20:10.209
WE DO SAY DIETS HIGH IN RED AND

20:10.209 --> 20:11.644
PROCESSED MEATS ARE ASSOCIATED

20:11.644 --> 20:14.380
WITH INCREASED ADVERSE HEALTH

20:14.380 --> 20:15.014
OUTCOMES.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.782
HOWEVER, WE ALSO CLEARLY STATE

20:16.782 --> 20:19.852
THAT CONSUMING A LIMITED AMOUNT

20:19.852 --> 20:22.521
OF LEAN RED MEAT IS... CAN FIT

20:22.521 --> 20:24.256
INTO A HEALTHY DIETARY PATTERN.

20:24.256 --> 20:25.091
>> Sreenivasan: AND YOU'VE ALSO

20:25.091 --> 20:27.226
ADDED A SUSTAINABILITY COMPONENT

20:27.226 --> 20:28.494
TO THIS, SAYING THAT CERTAIN

20:28.494 --> 20:30.362
FOODS LIKE PLANT-BASED FOODS ARE

20:30.362 --> 20:32.498
MORE SUSTAINABLE AND PERHAPS WE

20:32.498 --> 20:34.166
SHOULD CHOOSE IN THAT DIRECTION.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.201
AND THAT'S GOTTEN SOME PUSHBACK

20:35.201 --> 20:36.202
FROM FOLKS SAYING, "YOU KNOW

20:36.202 --> 20:36.969
WHAT?

20:36.969 --> 20:38.404
THAT'S A POLITICAL AND AN

20:38.404 --> 20:39.338
IDEOLOGICAL DISTINCTION.

20:39.338 --> 20:40.806
IT HAS NO BEARING ON WHAT TYPE

20:40.806 --> 20:42.441
OF FOOD WE SHOULD BE EATING."

20:42.441 --> 20:43.609
>> WELL, I THINK THERE'S MORE

20:43.609 --> 20:47.680
NUANCE THERE, THAT IF THE

20:47.680 --> 20:49.048
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAKES CERTAIN

20:49.048 --> 20:50.483
RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT EATING

20:50.483 --> 20:52.151
MORE OF SOMETHING, THEN WE HAVE

20:52.151 --> 20:53.252
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S GOING TO

20:53.252 --> 20:54.553
BE AVAILABLE AND THAT THERE'S

20:54.553 --> 20:56.355
NOT GOING TO BE ANY ADVERSE

20:56.355 --> 20:58.190
EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.158
AND I THINK WE SAW THAT WITH

20:59.158 --> 20:59.825
FISH.

20:59.825 --> 21:01.093
WHEN WE... THERE WAS A

21:01.093 --> 21:02.895
RECOMMENDATION QUITE A FEW YEARS

21:02.895 --> 21:04.196
AGO TO INCREASE FISH

21:04.196 --> 21:05.131
CONSUMPTION.

21:05.131 --> 21:06.332
THERE WAS A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT

21:06.332 --> 21:08.434
DEPLETING THE STOCKS OF WILD-

21:08.434 --> 21:10.569
CAUGHT FISH, SO THE INDUSTRY

21:10.569 --> 21:11.837
REALLY STEPPED IN AND DEVELOPED

21:11.837 --> 21:13.239
SOME VERY SUSTAINABLE AND

21:13.239 --> 21:15.174
ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE WAYS

21:15.174 --> 21:16.275
OF FARMING FISH.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.043
AND I THINK WE CAN USE THAT AS A

21:18.043 --> 21:19.245
MODEL FOR SOME OF THE OTHER

21:19.245 --> 21:21.981
CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.315
I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE

21:23.315 --> 21:25.684
VIEWED NECESSARILY AS NEGATIVE

21:25.684 --> 21:29.255
OR TRYING TO IMPEDE ANY ONE

21:29.255 --> 21:29.922
INDUSTRY.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.457
I THINK WE SHOULD VIEW IT AS AN

21:31.457 --> 21:33.125
OPPORTUNITY TO BE CREATIVE.

21:33.125 --> 21:33.926
>> Sreenivasan: SO, HELP ME

21:33.926 --> 21:35.528
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS REPORT

21:35.528 --> 21:38.030
IMPACTS THE BUDGET DECISIONS

21:38.030 --> 21:40.099
THAT ARE MADE ON, SAY, SCHOOL

21:40.099 --> 21:41.867
LUNCHES OR NUTRITION PROGRAMS.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.169
>> ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL

21:43.169 --> 21:45.404
LEGISLATION, ANY FEEDING PROGRAM

21:45.404 --> 21:47.339
THAT IS SUPPORTED BY FEDERAL

21:47.339 --> 21:48.874
DOLLARS HAS TO ADHERE TO THE

21:48.874 --> 21:50.209
DIETARY GUIDELINES.

21:50.209 --> 21:51.911
SO, IF THE DIETARY GUIDELINES

21:51.911 --> 21:54.280
THAT ARE GOING TO COME OUT AT

21:54.280 --> 21:56.081
THE END OF THIS YEAR INDICATE

21:56.081 --> 21:57.016
THAT LESS THAN 10% OF CALORIES

21:57.016 --> 21:59.151
SHOULD COME FROM SUGAR, THAT

21:59.151 --> 22:00.920
MEANS FEEDING PROGRAMS, WHETHER

22:00.920 --> 22:02.521
IT BE IN MILITARY OR THE SCHOOL

22:02.521 --> 22:05.658
LUNCH, WOULD HAVE TO LIMIT THE

22:05.658 --> 22:06.759
AMOUNT OF SUGAR THAT'S ACTUALLY

22:06.759 --> 22:07.960
IN THOSE MEALS.

22:07.960 --> 22:08.794
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, ALICE

22:08.794 --> 22:09.728
LICHTENSTEIN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR

22:09.728 --> 22:10.696
YOUR TIME.

22:10.696 --> 22:11.797
>> YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

22:11.797 --> 22:12.798
THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

22:12.798 --> 22:14.533
COMMENT.

22:15.601 --> 22:17.803
>>THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND,

22:17.803 --> 22:19.505
SATURDAY.

22:21.740 --> 22:22.741
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO

22:22.741 --> 22:24.243
"VIEWERS LIKE YOU," YOUR CHANCE

22:24.243 --> 22:25.911
TO COMMENT ON OUR WORK.

22:25.911 --> 22:27.813
TONIGHT, YOUR LARGELY ONE-SIDED

22:27.813 --> 22:29.114
RESPONSES TO LAST SATURDAY'S

22:29.114 --> 22:30.449
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

22:30.449 --> 22:32.084
IN IT, WE REPORTED ON THE STATE

22:32.084 --> 22:33.919
OF NEBRASKA SUING THE STATE OF

22:33.919 --> 22:35.921
COLORADO OVER THE LEGALIZATION

22:35.921 --> 22:37.823
OF MARIJUANA, AND HOW THAT HAS

22:37.823 --> 22:39.258
INCREASED THE COSTS OF LAW

22:39.258 --> 22:40.960
ENFORCEMENT IN THE CORNHUSKER

22:40.960 --> 22:41.760
STATE.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.029
THERE WAS THIS FROM READMORE:

22:44.029 --> 22:45.331
"THESE STATES NEED TO STOP

22:45.331 --> 22:47.333
WHINING AND MOVE INTO THE 21st

22:47.333 --> 22:49.235
CENTURY WITH THE REST OF US.

22:49.235 --> 22:50.569
'HAVE SUFFERED DIRECT AND

22:50.569 --> 22:52.371
SIGNIFICANT HARM ARISING FROM

22:52.371 --> 22:53.572
THE INCREASED PRESENCE OF

22:53.572 --> 22:55.941
COLORADO-SOURCED MARIJUANA.'

22:55.941 --> 22:56.942
LMAO!

22:56.942 --> 22:57.810
RIGHT."

22:57.810 --> 23:01.013
AND THIS FROM LORELEI LEE87:

23:01.013 --> 23:02.381
"WHILE I AGREE THAT MARIJUANA

23:02.381 --> 23:04.016
SHOULD BE LEGAL IN ALL 50

23:04.016 --> 23:05.217
STATES, I HAVE TO SAY THAT THOSE

23:05.217 --> 23:06.919
PEOPLE TRYING TO TRANSPORT IT

23:06.919 --> 23:08.621
FROM COLORADO ARE NOT THE

23:08.621 --> 23:09.822
BRIGHTEST BULBS.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.023
OF COURSE THEY'RE WATCHING THE

23:11.023 --> 23:11.624
BORDER.

23:11.624 --> 23:12.625
YOU SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT

23:12.625 --> 23:14.326
THE MOMENT IT BECAME LEGAL

23:14.326 --> 23:14.994
THERE."

23:14.994 --> 23:16.629
MIKEPARENT COMMENTED ON THE

23:16.629 --> 23:18.230
LOCAL POLICE AUTHORITY: "IT'S

23:18.230 --> 23:19.999
HIS CHOICE TO RAMP UP

23:19.999 --> 23:21.700
ENFORCEMENT, THEN HE COMPLAINS

23:21.700 --> 23:23.335
ABOUT INCREASED WORKLOAD.

23:23.335 --> 23:24.803
WE'D ALL BE BETTER OFF IF THE

23:24.803 --> 23:26.805
POLICE WOULD FOCUS ON CRIMES

23:26.805 --> 23:28.607
THAT HAVE ACTUAL VICTIMS."

23:28.607 --> 23:30.976
MIRKO SANSAN SAID, "REALLY?

23:30.976 --> 23:32.444
JUST STOP FISHING FOR THE POT

23:32.444 --> 23:33.679
WHEN YOU PULL PEOPLE OVER FOR

23:33.679 --> 23:34.880
'SPEEDING.'"

23:34.880 --> 23:37.316
AND FROM DAVESLC: "I FIND IT

23:37.316 --> 23:38.784
HYPOCRITICAL THAT THESE SAME RED

23:38.784 --> 23:40.419
STATES WHERE CONSERVATIVES

23:40.419 --> 23:42.354
CONTINUALLY CLAMOR ABOUT STATES'

23:42.354 --> 23:44.657
RIGHTS ARE NOW WANTING FEDERAL

23:44.657 --> 23:46.859
INTERVENTION IN COLORADO."

23:46.859 --> 23:48.360
ANTHONY J. COSTA ADDED, "ARE

23:48.360 --> 23:50.329
THEY SEIZING AND CONFISCATING

23:50.329 --> 23:52.097
THESE HARMLESS PEOPLE'S DORITOS,

23:52.097 --> 23:53.032
TOO?"

23:53.032 --> 23:54.733
JAVIER ALICEA NOTED: "IF IT'S

23:54.733 --> 23:56.702
ILLEGAL IN YOUR STATE, DON'T

23:56.702 --> 23:57.636
SMOKE POT.

23:57.636 --> 23:58.904
WAIT TILL YOUR STATE LEGALIZES

23:58.904 --> 23:59.672
IT."

23:59.672 --> 24:01.106
AND THERE WAS THIS FROM BARBARA

24:01.106 --> 24:03.542
REEDY: "GET OVER IT, NEBRASKA."

24:03.542 --> 24:05.778
AND K.A. BERRY SAID SIMPLY: "NO

24:05.778 --> 24:07.313
ONE SAW THIS COMING?"

24:07.313 --> 24:08.614

24:23.329 --> 24:24.296
BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU TONIGHT.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.297
A STRIKE AT SOME OF THE NATION'S

24:25.297 --> 24:27.066

24:27.066 --> 24:28.100

REFINERY WALKED OFF THE JOB
