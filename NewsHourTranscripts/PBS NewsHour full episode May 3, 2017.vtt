JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.766 --> 00:07.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.166 --> 00:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the "NewsHour"
tonight: in the hot seat.

00:09.333 --> 00:14.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FBI Director James Comey
defends his decision to
reopen an investigation
into Hillary Clinton's

00:15.766 --> 00:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
e-mails, days before last
year's presidential election.

00:19.900 --> 00:22.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then, bridging the
health care divide.

00:22.700 --> 00:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans try to win over
no votes in their own ranks by
putting more money on the table

00:28.833 --> 00:31.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to cover those with
preexisting conditions.

00:31.666 --> 00:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in our final report from
South Sudan, how violence
against women is being used as

00:37.300 --> 00:39.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a weapon of war.

00:39.300 --> 00:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WINNIE BYANYIMA, Oxfam
International: They told
me that: We long for peace.

00:43.066 --> 00:47.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We want to be able to
walk freely and farm
and feed our families.

00:47.566 --> 00:50.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the solution lies in
resolving the conflict.

00:50.433 --> 00:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:57.433 --> 00:59.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:59.833 --> 01:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A tense time
today for the man who runs the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

01:11.600 --> 01:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
James Comey spent hours before
the Senate Judiciary Committee
rejecting criticism that

01:16.566 --> 01:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he has mishandled
investigations of Hillary
Clinton or Donald Trump.

01:21.433 --> 01:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has the story.

01:23.566 --> 01:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES COMEY, FBI Director: I
have lived my entire career
by the tradition of that, if

01:26.833 --> 01:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can possibly avoid it, you
avoid any action in the run-up
to an election that might have

01:31.233 --> 01:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an impact, whether it's
a dogcatcher election or
president of the United States.

01:34.466 --> 01:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But, today,
FBI Director James Comey
faced the charges that he did

01:38.900 --> 01:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
impact the 2016 presidential
election, when he sent this
letter to Congress on October

01:45.933 --> 01:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
28, 11 days before Election
Day, revealing new steps in
an investigation into Hillary

01:50.533 --> 01:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Clinton's e-mail practices.

01:51.533 --> 01:53.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:53.733 --> 01:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D),
California: I have one
question, and I view
it as a most important

01:56.400 --> 01:59.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
question.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Ranking
Democrat Dianne Feinstein
asked today why he broke
normal FBI protocol.

02:01.233 --> 02:05.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JAMES COMEY: I could
see two doors, and
they were both actions.

02:05.833 --> 02:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One was labeled speak, and
the other was labeled conceal.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Look, this was terrible.

02:10.600 --> 02:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It makes me mildly nauseous
to think that we have had
some impact on the election.

02:14.233 --> 02:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, honestly, it wouldn't
change the decision.

02:17.600 --> 02:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everybody who disagrees with
me has to come back to October
28 with me, and stare at this

02:21.766 --> 02:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and tell me what you would do.

02:23.166 --> 02:24.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: You
took an enormous gamble.

02:26.900 --> 02:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The gamble was that there
was something there that
would invalidate her
candidacy, and there

02:34.266 --> 02:36.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wasn't.

02:36.266 --> 02:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Democrats
also pointed out that Comey had
been silent at the time about

02:38.900 --> 02:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the ongoing investigation into
Trump campaign ties to Russia.

02:42.866 --> 02:47.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He argued there was a
difference, that he had
previously told Congress
the Clinton probe

02:47.366 --> 02:50.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was closed and he
needed to reverse that.

02:50.666 --> 02:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he insisted to Hawaii
Democrat Mazie Hirono
that he was impartial:

02:54.666 --> 02:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: I wasn't thinking
of what effect it might have
on a political campaign.

02:58.633 --> 03:00.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:00.766 --> 03:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAZIE HIRONO (D), Hawaii: I
find that hard to believe that
you didn't contemplate that

03:03.466 --> 03:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there would be political
ramifications to your comments.

03:07.533 --> 03:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm just wondering why...

03:09.033 --> 03:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: I knew there
would be ramifications.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I just tried not
to care about them.

03:12.266 --> 03:15.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Texas
Republican John Cornyn
defended Comey and
pointed back at Clinton.

03:15.933 --> 03:18.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN CORNYN (R), Texas: You
are not the one who made the
decision to handle classified

03:20.533 --> 03:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
information on a
private e-mail server.

03:22.533 --> 03:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The hearing
was full of other news as well.

03:25.766 --> 03:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lindsey Graham of South Carolina
pressed Comey on Russia.

03:28.066 --> 03:30.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:30.100 --> 03:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: Is it fair to say
that the Russian government is

03:31.366 --> 03:33.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
still involved in
American politics?

03:33.433 --> 03:37.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES COMEY: Yes, well,
certainly, in my view,
the greatest threat of
any nation on Earth,

03:39.166 --> 03:41.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
given their intention
and their capability.

03:41.200 --> 03:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And on
issues of privacy, Comey said
encryption has blocked the FBI

03:46.100 --> 03:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from getting data off devices
in nearly half its cases.

03:49.533 --> 03:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JAMES COMEY: None of
us want backdoors.

03:51.733 --> 03:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't want access to
devices built in, in some way.

03:55.733 --> 03:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we want to work with
manufacturers on is to figure
out, how can we accommodate both

03:59.933 --> 04:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
interests in a sensible way?

04:01.533 --> 04:03.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS:
One more hot topic?

04:03.533 --> 04:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump's proposed
ban on immigrants from
some Muslim countries.

04:06.766 --> 04:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy:

04:08.000 --> 04:09.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:09.466 --> 04:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PATRICK LEAHY (D), Vermont: Does
that make America less safe?

04:10.466 --> 04:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: Senator, thank you.

04:12.533 --> 04:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not going to comment on
the particular statement, but
I do agree that a perception

04:16.400 --> 04:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or reality of hostility towards
any community, but in this --
particularly the Muslim American

04:22.333 --> 04:24.300 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
community, makes
our jobs harder.

04:24.300 --> 04:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As for his
own job, Comey's 10-year
term runs out in 2023.

04:28.033 --> 04:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins at the U.S. Capitol.

04:32.266 --> 04:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: The U.S. House of
Representatives easily approved

04:36.433 --> 04:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a compromise bill to fund the
government through September.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's the end of
this fiscal year.

04:41.866 --> 04:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It totals $1.1 trillion, and
it includes an increase in
defense spending, but it ignores

04:48.666 --> 04:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
several other of President
Trump's priorities, including
money for a border wall.

04:55.266 --> 04:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Leaders on both sides
praised the rare example
of cooperation between
Republicans and Democrats.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House: This is a
bipartisan piece of legislation.

05:02.800 --> 05:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so each side doesn't get
everything they want, but we
are able to come together and

05:08.600 --> 05:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
find a package that advances
many of our important goals.

05:10.666 --> 05:13.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STENY HOYER (D-MD),
Minority Whip: Democratic
members' participation
is absolutely essential

05:15.200 --> 05:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if we're going to pass fiscal
bills and appropriation bills.

05:19.066 --> 05:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm glad that the Republican
leadership and negotiators
came to that conclusion and

05:23.000 --> 05:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worked with us to advance
this omnibus to the floor.

05:26.166 --> 05:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The legislation
now heads to the Senate for
approval before this week is

05:31.100 --> 05:33.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

05:33.666 --> 05:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A revised Republican plan
to repeal and replace
Obamacare gained key
endorsements in the House

05:37.633 --> 05:39.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

05:39.666 --> 05:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Moderate Republican Fred Upton
and conservative Billy Long
said they will support the bill.

05:45.633 --> 05:48.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They spoke after meeting
with President Trump
on their amendment to
help cover people with

05:48.300 --> 05:49.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
preexisting conditions.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:51.866 --> 05:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED UPTON (R), Michigan: He
said that this bill would be
just as strong on preexisting

05:55.200 --> 05:58.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
illnesses as Obamacare.

05:58.366 --> 06:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want him to keep that pledge.

06:01.600 --> 06:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This amendment allows that to
happen, and cover those that
otherwise might have been

06:07.966 --> 06:09.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
excluded.

06:09.900 --> 06:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The amendment
adds $8 billion to the
bill over five years.

06:15.900 --> 06:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Leaders of the House
conservative Freedom
Caucus endorsed the
proposal, and said that

06:18.500 --> 06:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the vast majority of their
members will support it.

06:21.833 --> 06:25.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But as of the time we
went on the air, no
vote has been scheduled.

06:25.966 --> 06:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Eastern Missouri, another
wave of heavy rain is adding
to a flood emergency that's

06:30.933 --> 06:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
already claimed five lives.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The swollen Meramec River neared
an all-time high in suburban
Saint Louis today, damaging

06:39.300 --> 06:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
200 homes and threatening
some 1,500 more.

06:43.300 --> 06:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Parts of two interstate highways
are also underwater, and a
section of the Mississippi

06:48.133 --> 06:50.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
River is closed.

06:50.200 --> 06:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. Justice Department
confirmed today it will not
charge two white policemen in

06:56.366 --> 06:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the killing of a black man
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

06:59.533 --> 07:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cell phone video from last
July showed Alton Sterling
pinned, but struggling.

07:06.500 --> 07:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One officer yelled that
he was reaching for a
gun, and then he shot him.

07:09.200 --> 07:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Baton Rouge today, U.S.
attorney Corey Amundson said
there are no solid grounds for

07:15.066 --> 07:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a civil rights violation.

07:17.100 --> 07:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COREY AMUNDSON, Acting U.S.
Attorney: After an exhaustive,
almost year-long investigation,

07:22.566 --> 07:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of the prosecutors and
agents involved in this case
have come to the conclusion that

07:29.600 --> 07:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insufficient evidence exists
to charge either officer with
a federal crime in connection

07:35.233 --> 07:37.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with this incident.

07:37.266 --> 07:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The attorney

State TV said that Kim Sang
Dok, an instructor at Pyongyang
University, was picked up on

07:55.966 --> 07:57.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last month.

07:57.466 --> 07:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is accused of acts aimed at
overthrowing the government.

07:59.900 --> 08:04.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Kim is now one of
three Americans being
held by the North.

President Trump's America-first
policy means that human
rights will not determine U.S.

08:10.233 --> 08:12.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
relations with
foreign governments.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson took that message
to his employees today.

08:16.633 --> 08:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said that, in some cases
-- quote -- "If you condition
our national security efforts

08:21.466 --> 08:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on someone adopting
our values, it really
does create obstacles."

08:28.400 --> 08:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Trump hosted
Palestinian leader
Mahmoud Abbas today,
and vowed to try to make

08:31.533 --> 08:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
peace in the Middle East.

08:33.600 --> 08:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House meeting was
their first, and over lunch
in the Cabinet Room, Mr. Trump

08:38.000 --> 08:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said there's a very good
chance of getting a peace deal.

08:40.666 --> 08:45.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP, President
of the United States:
It's a -- something that
I think is, frankly,

08:47.066 --> 08:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
maybe not as difficult as people
have thought over the years.

08:48.966 --> 08:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we need two willing parties.

08:51.333 --> 08:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We believe Israel is willing.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We believe you're willing.

08:54.966 --> 08:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if you both are willing,
we're going to make a deal.

08:57.200 --> 09:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
met with the Israeli prime
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,

09:01.333 --> 09:03.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in February.

09:03.433 --> 09:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Former President Obama's
foundation has unveiled
the plans for his
presidential library and

09:08.600 --> 09:10.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
civic center.

09:10.533 --> 09:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The site would cover 225,000
square feet along Lake Michigan,
on Chicago's South Side.

09:16.333 --> 09:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It includes a tower-like museum,
and other buildings, and it's
expected to cost at least

09:21.933 --> 09:24.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
$500 million.

09:24.233 --> 09:26.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Wall Street made
little headway today.

09:26.233 --> 09:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial
average gained eight
points to close near 20958.

09:30.600 --> 09:35.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq fell almost
23 points, and the
S&amp;P 500 gave up three.

09:37.566 --> 09:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Boston baseball fans are
trying to make amends to an
opposing player who faced racist

09:43.433 --> 09:45.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
taunts.

09:45.366 --> 09:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Adam Jones of the Baltimore
Orioles spoke out after
Monday's game with the Red Sox.

09:51.466 --> 09:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last night, Jones got an
extended standing ovation when
he came to the plate at Fenway

09:55.200 --> 09:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Park for his first at-bat.

09:56.566 --> 10:00.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The two teams play
again tonight.

10:00.533 --> 10:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the latest push by Republicans
to win support for a replacement

10:05.400 --> 10:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Obamacare; in South Sudan,
rape used as a weapon of war;
a free press under threat

10:13.300 --> 10:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
worldwide; and much more.

10:26.400 --> 10:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After fits, starts and failure,
Republicans in Congress are
aiming for a new amendment

10:33.033 --> 10:36.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to win over enough votes
to repeal and replace
the Affordable Care Act.

10:36.133 --> 10:41.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We get two takes now on
this latest legislative
back-and-forth from
both sides of the aisle.

10:43.033 --> 10:45.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We start with Representative
Mark Sanford, Republican
from South Carolina.

10:45.466 --> 10:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congressman Sanford, thank
you very much for joining us.

10:48.600 --> 10:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you opposed the first
version of Obamacare
replacement back in March.

10:55.700 --> 10:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe your argument was
that it left too much of the
original Obamacare in place.

11:00.466 --> 11:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You apparently have come
around now to this new version.

11:02.066 --> 11:03.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

11:03.066 --> 11:04.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

11:04.733 --> 11:09.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SANFORD (R),
South Carolina: It, in
essence, split things.

11:11.033 --> 11:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It left open the possibility
of federalism, which is to
say, we have historically had

11:14.500 --> 11:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a patchwork of different
states and different remedies.

11:17.800 --> 11:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our founding fathers were so
intent on this idea of letting
states try different things

11:22.500 --> 11:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they built it in, though we
had a population of about four
million people when our country

11:26.233 --> 11:28.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
started.

11:28.300 --> 11:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think what it does is,
it allows Vermont to go to a
single-payer system if Vermont

11:31.733 --> 11:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wants to do so, and South
Carolina can go to a more
market-based system, if it chose

11:35.733 --> 11:37.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do so.

11:37.766 --> 11:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you know,
I'm sure, that today Congressman
Fred Upton and others worked

11:40.800 --> 11:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on an amendment, a proposal to
further change this new version
that would add more money

11:47.733 --> 11:52.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to cover those
people with so-called
preexisting conditions.

11:52.633 --> 11:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are you confident, from what
you know, though, that this is
going to guarantee everybody

11:57.300 --> 11:59.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with preexisting
conditions coverage?

11:59.500 --> 12:01.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

12:01.666 --> 12:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SANFORD: Built into the
base bill is this issue of
guarantee issue, so that you

12:03.166 --> 12:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cannot be denied based on
a preexisting condition.

12:07.466 --> 12:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question all along
has been, if a state opted
out and they chose to,
again, make alterations

12:14.100 --> 12:17.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on that front, which
this bill does allow,
what happens to them?

12:17.566 --> 12:22.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that's why it's
been important that this
issue of a risk pool,
as Maine has done, was

12:23.300 --> 12:25.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
built into the bill.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is about $130
billion built into the
bill to that very effect.

12:27.966 --> 12:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what has been talked about
here in the 11th hour is an
additional $8 billion based

12:34.966 --> 12:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Fred Upton and a couple of
other folks' insistence, that
a little bit more money be

12:37.333 --> 12:39.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
built in as a cushion
on this front.

12:39.466 --> 12:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you're talking over $100
billion being built into the
high-risk pool to cover somebody

12:46.466 --> 12:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the event that a state
opted out of this issue of not
preexisting condition, but the

12:52.533 --> 12:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
idea of somebody being able
to be charged more based
on a preexisting condition.

12:56.333 --> 12:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I know this
can get really complicated,
and I'm going to try to keep

12:59.433 --> 13:02.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
my question as
basic as possible.

13:02.166 --> 13:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressman, I'm sure you know
the American Medical Association
has come out today saying

13:06.433 --> 13:08.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they are still opposed.

13:08.500 --> 13:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are worried that millions
of people are going to be left
out with preexisting conditions.

13:12.166 --> 13:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The AARP, retired
persons association, says
they're still opposed.

13:19.100 --> 13:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the American Cancer Society
says they have taken a look
at this, and they say every

13:22.033 --> 13:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bit of history for anything
that looks anything like this
high-risk pool arrangement that

13:29.033 --> 13:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressman Upton has included
is going to be unaffordable,
is still going to leave too

13:34.333 --> 13:35.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
many people out.

13:35.533 --> 13:37.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, they can't
support it either.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SANFORD: Well, one,
I would expect them to
say that as advocates.

13:40.833 --> 13:43.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that is what
they're supposed to do.

13:43.333 --> 13:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that what we're
trying to include is that vast
unspoken group out there that

13:48.166 --> 13:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe hadn't gotten the
degree of media coverage,
small business people
across the state of

13:52.733 --> 13:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Carolina or other states
in this country that have been
really struggling with the

13:56.733 --> 13:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
limitation of coverage and
the increase in premiums.

13:59.733 --> 14:02.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In South Carolina last
year, premiums went up
by about 30 percent.

14:02.600 --> 14:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what we're trying to do
is to let insurance be insurance
for the preponderance of folks

14:09.500 --> 14:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are in the individual
marketplace that have seen their
premiums rise dramatically,

14:12.533 --> 14:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
while, at the same time,
covering folks that indeed have
a preexisting condition or have

14:19.366 --> 14:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been -- seen the consequence
of a horrendous accident.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think that that's
what this bill does.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It tries to cover both.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It does so imperfectly, as any
bill would, but I think it's
the best that we are going

14:29.700 --> 14:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be able to see out
of this House at this
particular moment in time.

14:32.566 --> 14:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You are saying
it does so imperfectly.

14:35.066 --> 14:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The doubters out there
are saying it still leaves
too many people with
preexisting conditions

14:41.800 --> 14:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who can't afford coverage
uncovered and people
- - people who would
then be in a vulnerable

14:47.533 --> 14:49.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
position not able to
access health care.

14:49.933 --> 14:51.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

14:51.966 --> 14:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SANFORD: What I would
say to that is, that was not
the experience of what we saw

14:53.333 --> 14:55.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Maine.

14:55.400 --> 14:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would ask people to look
at the risk pool that took
place in Maine and the degree

14:58.466 --> 15:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of coverage that it afforded
people indeed with preexisting
conditions, while simultaneously

15:05.433 --> 15:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bringing down the rate of
premium for, again, those small
business folks that don't have,

15:08.833 --> 15:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again, the kind of health
challenges that we see there
in the risk pool in Maine, or,

15:14.700 --> 15:17.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
frankly, other states.

15:17.066 --> 15:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman,
is it the government's
responsibility to make
sure everybody has

15:20.066 --> 15:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health care coverage?

15:21.066 --> 15:22.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

15:22.766 --> 15:24.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SANFORD: I think
that that's a debate
that will be ongoing.

15:24.833 --> 15:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that -- you know, I
guess part and parcel to any
open and free society is this

15:31.066 --> 15:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debate between freedom on one
side and security on the other.

15:34.833 --> 15:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that there is a
vital tension between those two.

15:37.433 --> 15:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So even if this bill makes
its way to the Senate and
passes there, even if it comes

15:41.433 --> 15:45.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
back and is signed by
the president, based on
the conference report
that got signed off

15:45.800 --> 15:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on in this House, even that
happens, this is a debate that
is going to be ongoing, because

15:52.733 --> 15:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that that tension
between security and freedom is
one that fits in this debate,

15:55.933 --> 15:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as it does in so many
others here on Capitol Hill.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman Mark
Sanford, we thank you very much.

16:00.766 --> 16:01.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:01.733 --> 16:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SANFORD: My pleasure.

16:02.733 --> 16:05.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

16:05.100 --> 16:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
now, for a Democrat's
perspective, we are joined by
Representative Kathy Castor

16:07.733 --> 16:09.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Florida.

16:09.800 --> 16:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congresswoman Castor, I think
you were able to hear what
Congressman Sanford is saying.

16:13.200 --> 16:18.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Do you believe that what
the Republicans appear
to be coming together
on does now cover enough

16:19.133 --> 16:20.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Americans?

16:20.133 --> 16:21.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:21.133 --> 16:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KATHY CASTOR (D), Florida: No.

16:23.133 --> 16:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the next 24 hours are
going to be very important for
families all across the country

16:26.300 --> 16:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are concerned about their
health coverage, because what
we know about the Republican

16:31.100 --> 16:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bill is that it will rip
coverage away from millions of
Americans, raise costs, impose

16:37.933 --> 16:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a huge age tax on our neighbors
who are 50, 55, and older,
and not yet in Medicare.

16:44.666 --> 16:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then it weakens the life of
the Medicare trust fund, just
at a time we have more baby

16:48.333 --> 16:51.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
boomers retiring and
going into Medicare.

16:51.666 --> 16:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But here's the kicker for the
vote that could come up in
the next 24 hours, is the bill

16:57.400 --> 16:59.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has gotten even worse.

16:59.500 --> 17:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To round up the votes of the
Tea Party Caucus, Speaker Ryan
and the White House agreed to

17:06.800 --> 17:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go to the heart of the
Affordable Care Act, which was a
guarantee that no American could

17:13.833 --> 17:18.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
be discriminated against
because they have a
preexisting condition,
like cancer or diabetes.

17:19.000 --> 17:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

17:21.633 --> 17:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHY CASTOR: So, apparently,
this is going to be a
close vote tomorrow.

17:23.666 --> 17:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The phones are ringing off the
hook all across the Capitol,
because families understand what

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is at risk, higher costs and
a fundamental return to the
bad old days where insurance

17:34.700 --> 17:36.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
companies could
charge you anything.

17:36.700 --> 17:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you had a preexisting
condition, it was very
difficult to get coverage.

17:40.033 --> 17:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let
me ask you about what
Congressman Sanford just said.

17:43.166 --> 17:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said there are examples --
he kept citing the state of
Maine -- where they have created

17:47.133 --> 17:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these so-called high-risk
pools that allow money to be
put into one pool that people

17:54.166 --> 17:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who can't afford coverage, who
have preexisting conditions
would be able to access that and

17:58.933 --> 17:59.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get coverage.

17:59.933 --> 18:01.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATHY CASTOR: Well, it's very
inefficient and very costly.

18:04.066 --> 18:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this so-called Upton
amendment that has been floated
today to provide $8 billion to

18:10.500 --> 18:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
states that go that direction is
-- would be wholly inadequate.

18:13.733 --> 18:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, in my home state
of Florida, we have tried
high-risk pools in the past,

18:20.533 --> 18:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the state never
stepped up to their
responsibility to fund them.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The feds here, I would
be very skeptical that,
under a Republican
Congress and this White

18:30.966 --> 18:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House, they would say, yes,
it's important to provide
billions of dollars for that.

18:34.566 --> 18:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, remember,
under this bill, they
decimate Medicaid services.

18:42.066 --> 18:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are the services for
our neighbors suffering
from Alzheimer's that
need nursing care, and

18:47.166 --> 18:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
children, and the disabled.

18:49.033 --> 18:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it's very difficult to see
how this is going anywhere.

18:52.933 --> 18:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In fact, you mentioned
the opposition from
the AMA and the AARP.

18:56.833 --> 19:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you have America's
doctors, America's nurses, AARP,
the American Cancer Society

19:03.266 --> 19:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opposed to it, I'm surprised
it's even close right now.

19:06.700 --> 19:08.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time,
Congresswoman, you know
elections have consequences.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Republicans control the House.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They control the Senate.

19:13.233 --> 19:16.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They obviously control
the White House now.

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the Republicans are
looking at putting before
the House for a vote now
has made accommodations

19:22.800 --> 19:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
toward the Democrats.

19:24.733 --> 19:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It does preserve some of
Obamacare, unlike what the most
conservative members of the

19:29.533 --> 19:30.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
House want.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Doesn't there have to be
some sort of compromise?

19:33.633 --> 19:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And are Democrats not willing
to move at all on your own, as
Republicans have been willing

19:39.600 --> 19:40.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do?

19:40.600 --> 19:42.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHY CASTOR: No, the Republican
bill goes to the heart of the
Affordable Care Act repeal

19:45.600 --> 19:47.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

19:47.633 --> 19:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They could make that argument
before, before they were talking
about gutting the protection

19:51.566 --> 19:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for preexisting conditions
and essential health benefits.

19:54.433 --> 19:58.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, what good is an
insurance policy if you
buy it and you can't
go to the emergency

19:58.666 --> 20:00.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
room and be covered?

20:00.700 --> 20:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, yes, Democrats, we're
willing to work on the high
cost of pharmaceuticals.

20:05.333 --> 20:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would really like to get to
the heart of the matter of how
we encourage greater competition

20:10.000 --> 20:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in areas of the country that
do not have competition.

20:13.133 --> 20:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a lot of great ideas,
and, hopefully, this will --
this new repeal effort will fail

20:20.133 --> 20:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tomorrow, and we can get down to
brass tacks, to improving what
works and fixing what doesn't.

20:24.166 --> 20:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're
prepared with the idea that it
may pass, that the Republicans

20:28.466 --> 20:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may now have enough votes
among themselves to get
this through the House?

20:31.766 --> 20:33.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATHY CASTOR: Boy, they're
really trying to ram it through.

20:35.100 --> 20:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The White House and Speaker Ryan
have really been twisting arms.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what I'm hearing from my
colleagues here in the Capitol.

20:43.600 --> 20:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have the American people
on our side, in addition to
America's doctors, nurses,

20:48.366 --> 20:49.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so many advocates.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But this next 24 hours
will be critical.

20:52.500 --> 20:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's no other issue that
touches every American family,
every small business owner.

20:59.533 --> 21:01.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, this is critical.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And time is of the essence.

21:02.933 --> 21:05.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're
absolutely right about
it touching everybody.

21:05.133 --> 21:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congresswoman Kathy Castor,
thank you very much.

21:08.766 --> 21:10.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

21:10.300 --> 21:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KATHY CASTOR: Thank you.

21:17.333 --> 21:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This week, we
have reported on the civil war
in South Sudan and the famine

21:23.333 --> 21:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it has partly caused.

21:25.433 --> 21:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, a brutal, often
unseen side of this
conflict: an epidemic of
rape, used as a weapon

21:31.600 --> 21:34.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of war against South
Sudan's women and girls.

21:34.766 --> 21:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With the partnership of the
Pulitzer Center on Crisis
Reporting, here again is special

21:39.033 --> 21:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
correspondent Jane Ferguson.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a warning: Parts of
this story are disturbing.

21:43.733 --> 21:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The women
gathering in this small building
all have one thing in common:

21:49.900 --> 21:52.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a brutal experience that
binds them together.

21:52.466 --> 21:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDA, Rape Victim (through
translator): When I got off the
bus, they grabbed me and took

21:56.433 --> 21:58.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
me to a small house by
the side of the road.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then, 10 of them raped me.

22:00.733 --> 22:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Linda, not
her real name, was kidnapped,
beaten, and raped last year by

22:06.966 --> 22:10.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
government soldiers on
the streets of South
Sudan's capital, Juba.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At this International Rescue
Committee support center, she
meets with others like her.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Were they wearing uniforms?

22:16.033 --> 22:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LINDA (through translator): Yes.

22:17.966 --> 22:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: All of them?

22:19.833 --> 22:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LINDA (through translator): Yes.

22:21.633 --> 22:23.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JANE FERGUSON: Were
they carrying weapons?

22:23.766 --> 22:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LINDA (through translator): Yes.

22:26.133 --> 22:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At first, they told us they
were going to shoot us and
kill us, so we were afraid.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then they beat us and raped us.

22:32.633 --> 22:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: She was
taken with six other women.

22:35.166 --> 22:38.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Two of them were
never seen again.

22:38.300 --> 22:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She lives with around 30,000
others in this cramped camp for
people fleeing ethnic violence.

22:45.266 --> 22:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a huge, fortified slum in
Juba where U.N. peacekeeping
soldiers provide a little

22:50.100 --> 22:52.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
security.

22:52.933 --> 22:57.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When South Sudan's civil
war broke out in 2013,
it quickly became fueled
by tribal divisions.

23:00.333 --> 23:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Salva Kiir
of the Dinka tribe,
pitted against his vice
president, Riek Machar, from

23:05.166 --> 23:07.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Nuer tribe.

23:07.233 --> 23:11.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dinka government soldiers
have been fighting rebels, led
mostly by the Nuer tribe, all

23:11.900 --> 23:14.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
across the country.

23:14.033 --> 23:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both sides are accused of
taking part in war crimes,
one of those crimes, rape.

23:20.800 --> 23:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has become a tool
of war here, used with
barbaric consistency, a
ruthless form of collective

23:27.333 --> 23:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
punishment against rival tribes.

23:30.366 --> 23:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gang-raped by soldiers,
this young mother of four is
now eight months pregnant.

23:36.766 --> 23:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
This is the result of tribalism.

23:39.200 --> 23:42.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If it wasn't, then the
fight would be between
soldier and soldier.

23:42.933 --> 23:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But now they do this to women.

23:44.833 --> 23:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are raping women because
our husbands are not here.

23:47.366 --> 23:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are rebels away fighting.

23:49.433 --> 23:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
When they were raping
me, they kept calling
me a Nuer and a rebel.

23:53.033 --> 23:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Soon, she will
have yet another child to care
for, in this desperate poverty.

24:00.400 --> 24:05.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The International Rescue
Committee helps these
women, assigning social
workers to keep them

24:05.166 --> 24:08.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going long after the
physical scars fade.

24:08.600 --> 24:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yet, even here, there is
no guarantee of safety.

24:12.333 --> 24:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a war where sexual violence
is so prevalent, camps like
this are essential to providing

24:18.400 --> 24:20.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some sort of
protection for women.

24:20.733 --> 24:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it's not really enough.

24:22.733 --> 24:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The women here know that,
the moment they leave this
camp, they're at risk of being

24:26.633 --> 24:28.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
raped.

24:28.633 --> 24:32.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Last July, fighting
broke out in the capital
between government
troops and rebels, and

24:32.500 --> 24:35.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very little food was
making it into the camp.

24:35.366 --> 24:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In desperation, mothers were
forced to venture out, searching
for something to feed their

24:40.966 --> 24:42.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
families.

24:42.900 --> 24:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just a few yards from the
camp gates, this woman was
grabbed, tied up, and violently

24:47.433 --> 24:49.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
assaulted.

24:49.433 --> 24:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
The children didn't have
anything to eat for four days.

24:53.266 --> 24:56.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I decided to go
outside and look for food.

24:56.166 --> 25:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I at least had a small
amount of money to go
outside and buy something.

25:00.633 --> 25:04.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I went to the market,
but when I was coming
back, they grabbed me.

25:04.933 --> 25:06.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They tied my hands
with a piece of cloth.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Then, they raped me.

25:08.966 --> 25:13.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JANE FERGUSON: According
to women like her, rape
here is often committed
by gangs of government

25:13.833 --> 25:15.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
soldiers.

25:15.900 --> 25:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
Six of them raped me, and
then I lost consciousness.

25:21.633 --> 25:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They left me by the road, and
some people came and found
me and carried me back to the

25:26.633 --> 25:29.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
camp.

25:29.166 --> 25:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: It is
an astounding fact that
most of the women in this
camp have been raped,

25:34.600 --> 25:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.N. says 70 percent,
the majority by government
soldiers and police.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
None of the women we spoke to
for this story has dared leave
the camp since their assault.

25:43.966 --> 25:48.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WINNIE BYANYIMA, Oxfam
International: Women
who step out to look for
food for their children

25:48.266 --> 25:51.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get assaulted and raped.

25:51.933 --> 25:53.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, they can't step out.

25:53.533 --> 25:57.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They told me that:
We long for peace.

25:57.066 --> 26:01.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We want to be able to
walk freely and farm
and feed our families.

26:01.566 --> 26:04.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the solution lies in
resolving the conflict.

26:04.766 --> 26:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The rape crisis
in South Sudan is one that
often gets lost in the other,

26:11.666 --> 26:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more visible disasters
of famine and civil war
tearing this country apart.

26:16.833 --> 26:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Countrywide, it is not known
how many have been raped.

26:20.366 --> 26:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Women here often bury the
burden of their enormous
collective suffering silently.

26:26.800 --> 26:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Ferguson in Juba, South Sudan.

26:32.700 --> 26:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tomorrow, our
focus on South Sudan continues
with a look at what life is

26:38.333 --> 26:42.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
like for refugees
fleeing the violence
into neighboring Uganda.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

26:52.833 --> 26:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": is
mountaintop mining sacrificing
coal country's environment?;

26:58.466 --> 27:03.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and problems in the path
of Facebook as its grows
its users and influence.

27:04.466 --> 27:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But first: Sometimes, searching
for the truth is dangerous work.

27:08.666 --> 27:13.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Journalists around the
world at times risk
death or imprisonment
to inform the public.

27:13.600 --> 27:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twenty-four years ago, the U.N.
General Assembly proclaimed
May 3 Press Freedom Day.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we mark this moment by
assessing where things stand.

27:22.633 --> 27:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

27:24.600 --> 27:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's often
where you report that determines
the level of threat that a

27:28.133 --> 27:30.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
journalist faces.

27:30.200 --> 27:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Mexico, dozens have been
killed by cartels while
reporting on the drug trade.

27:34.166 --> 27:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Turkey, it's the government
that's been cracking down,
closing newspapers and locking

27:38.500 --> 27:40.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up reporters.

27:40.533 --> 27:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And here in the U.S., it's more
of a rhetorical attack, with
accusations of fake news, and

27:46.366 --> 27:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president questioning
the motives and
honesty of the press.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We look at this global
landscape now with Joel Simon.

27:50.800 --> 27:54.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's executive director
of the Committee to
Protect Journalists.

27:54.433 --> 27:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour," Joel.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEL SIMON, Executive
Director, Committee to Protect
Journalists: Great to be on.

27:58.433 --> 28:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's go
through some of these global hot
spots that we have been talking

28:00.133 --> 28:02.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

28:02.233 --> 28:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your organization just put out
a report about Mexico and some
of the violence directed at

28:05.300 --> 28:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
journalists there.

28:06.866 --> 28:08.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's going on?

28:08.933 --> 28:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEL SIMON: What's going on
is, you have a country where
the government is effectively

28:14.266 --> 28:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unable to assert control because
violent forces are dominant.

28:20.533 --> 28:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they are determining,
through violence, what the
people can and can't know.

28:23.833 --> 28:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're killing journalists.

28:26.033 --> 28:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're suppressing information,
and they often operate with
the complicity of the police

28:30.533 --> 28:32.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and local authorities.

28:32.633 --> 28:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In a
circumstance like that,
where you're talking
about basically criminal

28:36.533 --> 28:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
organizations killing
journalists, what can
we, as the journalistic
community, do to protect

28:42.400 --> 28:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people in that environment?

28:44.400 --> 28:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEL SIMON: Well, I think,
first of all, we have to call
on the Mexican government.

28:47.133 --> 28:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have a constitutional
obligation to ensure
that Mexicans are able to
exercise free expression,

28:54.233 --> 28:56.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that the press can
operate freely.

28:56.233 --> 29:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, we have confirmed
a meeting tomorrow with the
president of Mexico, Enrique

29:01.433 --> 29:02.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pena Nieto.

29:02.366 --> 29:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We released a report this week.

29:04.466 --> 29:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We met today with journalists
in Veracruz, one of the more
violent states in the country.

29:10.166 --> 29:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we are going to call on
the president to do all within
his power to ensure that

29:16.200 --> 29:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those responsible for
these crimes are brought
to justice and not
protected and are not able

29:21.600 --> 29:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to operate with impunity.

29:24.166 --> 29:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean,
murdering journalists
is obviously one end of
a very awful spectrum.

29:29.500 --> 29:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the other end of the
spectrum, we have other nations,
nations like Turkey, that are

29:32.233 --> 29:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to suppress journalism
in a very different way.

29:34.866 --> 29:36.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOEL SIMON: Yes.

29:36.900 --> 29:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, if, in Mexico, the
problem is that you have a
very weak state that is unable

29:41.133 --> 29:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to assert authority and protect
the rights of its citizens,
in Turkey, you have sort

29:46.033 --> 29:48.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the opposite problem.

29:48.033 --> 29:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have a state that's becoming
increasingly autocratic, led
by a leader who has launched

29:54.666 --> 29:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a consolidated crackdown on
all of civil society, including
the media, following an aborted

30:00.833 --> 30:02.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
coup.

30:02.866 --> 30:06.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But this is a long-term
trend in Turkey, the
sort of consolidation
and strengthening of

30:06.266 --> 30:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state power and the
suppression of critical voices.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Turkey is actually
the world's leading
jailer of journalists.

30:12.500 --> 30:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were 81 journalists in
jail when we completed our
annual census at the end of

30:17.333 --> 30:19.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last year.

30:19.333 --> 30:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Again, in
that circumstance, when you have
got a very strong government

30:21.366 --> 30:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing this, is this the role of
other Western pro-journalistic
governments to put pressure

30:27.500 --> 30:29.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on Turkey to stop
this kind of behavior?

30:29.333 --> 30:31.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOEL SIMON: Absolutely.

30:31.433 --> 30:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think a very critical
voice is missing, and
that's the United States.

30:36.133 --> 30:38.200 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
That's -- that's
President Trump.

30:38.200 --> 30:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, certainly, the U.S. press
freedom record has not been
perfect, and certainly they have

30:42.533 --> 30:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not exercised this influence
as fully as they might, and
we have been critical of that.

30:48.866 --> 30:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we think they have
tremendous influence.

30:51.200 --> 30:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. has been a defender
of these values, because they
represent values that are so

30:57.700 --> 31:00.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
deeply essential to
our political system.

31:00.666 --> 31:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But President Trump has
welcomed to the White House
President El-Sisi of Egypt.

31:07.666 --> 31:11.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he was doing a fantastic
job, when, in fact, he's jailing
journalists, 25 journalists

31:13.233 --> 31:15.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in prison in Egypt.

31:15.366 --> 31:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's rolled up out the
red carpet for President
Xi of China, dozens
of journalists in jail

31:20.833 --> 31:22.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

31:22.233 --> 31:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he has failed confront
President Erdogan.

31:23.733 --> 31:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, he's been quite
complimentary of Erdogan.

31:31.100 --> 31:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this is a key voice
on behalf of journalists
and press freedom that's
missing right now.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's talk
a little bit about President
Trump in this country.

31:37.766 --> 31:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, obviously, we still
have a very strong, a very free
and vibrant press in the United

31:42.300 --> 31:44.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

31:44.433 --> 31:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the president, as you well
know, constantly is hurling
this accusation of fake news.

31:48.466 --> 31:50.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOEL SIMON: Yes.

31:50.433 --> 31:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: He's
accused journalists of
being enemies of the people.

31:52.066 --> 31:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you make of
all that rhetoric?

31:54.133 --> 31:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEL SIMON: Well, I think
-- I think there are so many
ways to -- this has been a big

32:00.900 --> 32:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
topic of discussion, and there
are so many things that I
think President Trump is trying

32:04.233 --> 32:06.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to achieve.

32:06.200 --> 32:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One is changing the subject
sometimes when there's
an uncomfortable story.

32:09.233 --> 32:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One is sort of rallying a base
that's -- that's - - that has
a very low -- low view of the

32:16.800 --> 32:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
role of the media, and
they might be responsive
to that kind of criticism.

32:23.733 --> 32:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think -- but journalists
themselves, if you talk to
journalists in Washington,

32:26.166 --> 32:27.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they really don't like
this kind of language.

32:27.966 --> 32:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're threatened by it
and are not at all sanguine.

32:31.466 --> 32:32.966 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But they're able
to do their job.

32:32.966 --> 32:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're able to resist this
kind of chilling pressure.

32:35.200 --> 32:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think where the damage is most
acute is actually in the rest
of the world, where autocratic

32:42.200 --> 32:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
leaders like Erdogan
in Turkey, or Sisi in
Egypt, feel emboldened
by this kind of framing

32:50.600 --> 32:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that journalists are
enemies, that journalists
provide fake news.

32:53.933 --> 32:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, really, that's not
the way the leader of the
democratic world talks.

32:58.033 --> 33:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the kind of rhetoric you
hear from repressive leaders.

33:01.066 --> 33:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so it's very disturbing.

33:03.166 --> 33:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, do you
think in the end that this
may be a galvanizing moment

33:09.300 --> 33:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the American press to have
-- to have this sort of very
aggressive attack from the

33:13.533 --> 33:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
highest office in the land?

33:15.500 --> 33:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEL SIMON: Well, it's
galvanizing for the moment, but
I don't think we should declare

33:18.233 --> 33:19.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
victory.

33:19.500 --> 33:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think we have to
be very cognizant.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know, it's a
war of words now.

33:22.866 --> 33:26.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the words, you
know, can be resisted.

33:26.233 --> 33:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And journalists certainly
feel, you know, they
have a critical role.

33:29.533 --> 33:32.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They feel there's
more public support.

33:32.100 --> 33:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ironically, every time the
president attacks the media, you
see subscriptions rise in the

33:36.800 --> 33:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
media outlets he's attacking.

33:38.766 --> 33:40.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's also obsessed
with the media.

33:40.766 --> 33:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, journalists, bizarrely,
ironically, feel that they have
more influence in a certain

33:45.366 --> 33:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way, because the president
is watching or reading
everything they say.

33:49.100 --> 33:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you know, journalists don't
yet feel chilled by this kind
of speech, but I think there's

33:53.866 --> 33:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a real danger that this chilling
speech leads to policies,
and that those policies have

34:00.333 --> 34:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a real impact on the ability
of journalists to do their job.

34:02.033 --> 34:04.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's why we
need to be vigilant.

34:04.466 --> 34:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All
right, Joel Simon, Committee
to Protect Journalists,
thank you very much.

34:07.033 --> 34:11.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOEL SIMON: Thank you.

34:11.900 --> 34:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
has pledged to revive the
coal industry, and has already

34:22.733 --> 34:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
begun rolling back some
government regulations.

34:25.833 --> 34:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In one case, that means boosting
so-called mountaintop mining.

34:29.833 --> 34:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But even as many in coal country
applaud those moves, there's
concern over what it means

34:34.500 --> 34:35.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the environment.

34:35.933 --> 34:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is the focus of this week's
report from Miles O'Brien.

34:38.800 --> 34:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our weekly
series on the Leading Edge
of science and technology.

34:43.100 --> 34:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Rocky
Hackworth is a coal miner who
makes a surprising claim.

34:49.533 --> 34:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROCKY HACKWORTH, Mine Manager:
I'm a true environmentalist.

34:51.933 --> 34:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I work in it and live in it.

34:54.233 --> 34:56.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: And
he reshapes it.

34:56.266 --> 35:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He manages the 1,600-acre,
Four Mile Fork surface mine
30 miles south of Charleston,

35:01.733 --> 35:03.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
West Virginia.

35:03.733 --> 35:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a state where the thick,
deep layers, or seams, of coal
are all but gone after 200

35:09.966 --> 35:12.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
years of relentless
underground mining.

35:12.033 --> 35:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROCKY HACKWORTH: Now, you got
a lot more of the smaller,
thinner seams that are on top

35:17.933 --> 35:19.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of these mountains.

35:19.066 --> 35:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Those areas have
already been mined out.

35:20.533 --> 35:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the surface mine was
just a natural progression.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: With a mother
lode of unnatural consequences.

35:25.533 --> 35:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the hills of West Virginia,
surface mining carries a huge
cost, nothing less than the

35:31.933 --> 35:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mountains themselves, the
icons of this beautiful state.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLAY MULLINS, Former Coal
Miner: They had everything here.

35:36.900 --> 35:39.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They had two or three
post offices, I think.

35:39.066 --> 35:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Clay Mullins is
a former underground miner who
lives near a mountaintop removal

35:43.933 --> 35:46.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mine in Pax.

35:46.066 --> 35:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He endures the sound of daily
explosions and the destruction
of woods where he once hunted

35:52.433 --> 35:54.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and fished.

35:54.433 --> 35:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLAY MULLINS: I think West
Virginians are sacrificing
too much of our mountains, our

36:00.133 --> 36:01.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wildlife.

36:01.100 --> 36:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Our wildlife really suffers.

36:03.133 --> 36:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just don't like looking out
and seeing the mountains get
torn out the way they are.

36:09.900 --> 36:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ten percent of
the land in Central Appalachia
is now either active or

36:13.633 --> 36:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reclaimed surface mines.

36:15.733 --> 36:19.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EMILY BERNHARDT, Duke
University: The Central
Appalachian landscape
has been fundamentally

36:19.400 --> 36:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
changed, and it's been
changed in a way that it's
not going to recover from.

36:22.966 --> 36:24.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Those mountains are
not going to grow back.

36:24.933 --> 36:29.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Emily
Bernhardt is a professor
of biogeochemistry
at Duke University.

36:29.400 --> 36:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's been researching
the decapitation of
mountains for seven years,
trying to understand

36:35.733 --> 36:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how it affects the
rivers and streams below.

36:37.833 --> 36:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMILY BERNHARDT: The problem is
that for every about a meter of
coal, you have about 99 meters

36:44.066 --> 36:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of rock that you have to put
somewhere during this process.

36:46.333 --> 36:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you're in a landscape
like Appalachia, the place that
most of that rock ends up being

36:50.633 --> 36:52.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
put is in river valleys.

36:52.933 --> 36:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: When the rock
is pulverized in the mining
process, toxic chemicals and

37:00.433 --> 37:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minerals locked inside
for millennia are released
and exposed to the
air, creating two areas

37:05.200 --> 37:07.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of concern.

37:07.233 --> 37:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMILY BERNHARDT: One, that
the water coming out of these
mines is salty, it's full of

37:09.800 --> 37:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rock-derived salts, and that
by itself is stressful to
many freshwater organisms.

37:16.666 --> 37:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the sort of subsidiary
problem is that that salt
contains lots of elevated levels

37:19.333 --> 37:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of trace metals, which have
known toxicity to organisms.

37:22.833 --> 37:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But the
mining industry believes
that concern is overstated.

37:26.933 --> 37:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROCKY HACKWORTH: This is a
good example of a ditch that
we have to build on top of a

37:31.133 --> 37:33.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
valley field.

37:33.666 --> 37:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Rocky
Hackworth showed me the
trenches and retention
ponds designed to capture

37:36.433 --> 37:39.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
run-off and protect the
surrounding environment.

37:39.466 --> 37:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROCKY HACKWORTH: That way,
you don't have anything that
is leaving the property.

37:43.233 --> 37:46.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Downstream, there's
no consequences.

37:46.766 --> 37:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had samples taken
now for eight years, and we
have never had a water issue.

37:54.166 --> 37:59.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: The coal
industry says it tests
water continuously.

38:01.233 --> 38:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chris Hamilton is the senior
vice president of the West
Virginia Coal Association.

38:03.766 --> 38:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS HAMILTON, West
Virginia Coal Association:
It's not something that's
done haphazardously.

38:06.400 --> 38:11.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a very, very high
premium placed on that, and it's
a very important aspect, just

38:11.366 --> 38:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like personal and individual
mine health and safety.

38:14.333 --> 38:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But the data
tells a different story.

38:17.766 --> 38:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We joined Emily Bernhardt's
colleague Eric Moore, as he did
some fieldwork near the largest

38:23.900 --> 38:26.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
surface mine in
Central Appalachia.

38:26.500 --> 38:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Active for more than 40 years,
the Hobet mine has transformed
about 10,000 acres of natural

38:32.600 --> 38:37.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mountain peaks
into manmade mesas.

38:37.300 --> 38:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Duke team presides over 14
different monitoring sites in
what appear to be clean mountain

38:43.300 --> 38:45.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
streams.

38:45.266 --> 38:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They measure temperature, oxygen
levels and acidity, and they
also test the conductivity

38:51.200 --> 38:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the water, a good indication
of the health of the stream.

38:54.666 --> 38:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In this case, the number
is more than 1,900
microsiemens per centimeter.

38:58.433 --> 39:00.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does that mean?

39:00.566 --> 39:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC MOORE, Duke University:
Well, compared to our natural
watersheds, they run around

39:05.933 --> 39:07.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
150.

39:07.933 --> 39:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In this mountain
stream, the conductivity is
similar to an urban waterway

39:13.133 --> 39:15.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
filled with road salt
and other pollutants.

39:15.600 --> 39:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only possible source here,
the chemicals unleashed when
the mountaintops are destroyed.

39:22.033 --> 39:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is not a healthy stream?

39:23.100 --> 39:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC MOORE: Correct, not at all.

39:24.500 --> 39:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It looks good.

39:25.700 --> 39:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC MOORE: Yes, looks fine.

39:27.133 --> 39:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But it's not.

39:28.133 --> 39:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC MOORE: No, not at all.

39:30.166 --> 39:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In the final days
of the Obama administration,
the federal Office of Surface

39:36.533 --> 39:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mining Reclamation and
Enforcement published
a new rule designed to
protect streams like

39:40.600 --> 39:42.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

39:42.633 --> 39:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would have prevented mining
companies from impacting the
hydrologic balance, forced them

39:49.100 --> 39:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to monitor the water during
mining, and mandated streams be
restored to their natural state

39:53.433 --> 39:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after the mining was over.

39:55.933 --> 40:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS HAMILTON: We saw
signs of every agency that
had any responsibility
over mining proposed

40:02.400 --> 40:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
onerous rule after onerous rule,
which really served to restrict,
if not close down, a number

40:09.366 --> 40:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of mining operations here.

40:11.333 --> 40:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But President
Trump has made some big
promises to help the coal mining

40:16.066 --> 40:18.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
industry.

40:18.133 --> 40:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: And, for those
miners, get ready, because

40:26.533 --> 40:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you are going to be working
your asses off, all right?

40:27.533 --> 40:28.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

40:28.733 --> 40:29.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Thank
you, everybody.

40:29.533 --> 40:31.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In February,
he signed legislation killing
the stream protection rule.

40:33.566 --> 40:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the president is promising
more regulatory relief to
bring back mining jobs.

40:35.933 --> 40:39.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Are people optimistic
now here in coal country
in West Virginia?

40:39.766 --> 40:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROCKY HACKWORTH: Very much
optimistic, 100 percent.

40:42.566 --> 40:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It changed the day
after the election.

40:44.633 --> 40:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But scientists
believe surface mining is taking
a big toll, not just to the

40:50.633 --> 40:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mountains and streams, but also
to the humans who live nearby.

40:53.033 --> 40:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL HENDRYX, Indiana
University: If you value public
health, this form of destruction

40:57.800 --> 41:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around people's community
should stop, and even if that
means that the mining companies

41:01.766 --> 41:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make less money or the coal
stays on the ground forever.

41:04.966 --> 41:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Michael Hendryx
is a professor of applied health
science at Indiana University.

41:11.966 --> 41:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has studied the health
effects of mountaintop removal
in West Virginia for 10 years.

41:17.900 --> 41:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He has documented high
occurrences of heart,
lung, kidney diseases
and some forms of cancer

41:22.933 --> 41:26.033 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
among people who
live near mines.

41:26.033 --> 41:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the mining
industry is skeptical.

41:28.166 --> 41:33.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS HAMILTON: There's
a segment of our culture
and society here that's
had some ill health

41:35.200 --> 41:40.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and some health effects,
and most of that has
been attributed thus
far to lifestyle,

41:41.966 --> 41:45.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
diet, smoking and
things of that nature.

41:45.633 --> 41:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, Hendryx is
launching a new study designed
to factor out those other

41:51.133 --> 41:53.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
causes.

41:53.166 --> 41:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He and his team will collect
detailed health data, along
with environmental exposures to

41:57.133 --> 41:59.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
various toxins.

41:59.666 --> 42:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Participants will receive
passive air sampling
devices inside and
outside their homes, and,

42:06.133 --> 42:09.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on their wrists,
silicone wristbands
absorb certain toxins.

42:09.666 --> 42:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL HENDRYX: We're trying
now to try to make those
connections more direct between

42:14.100 --> 42:19.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
environmental conditions
in these communities
and the exposures that
individual people are

42:19.033 --> 42:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
facing, and the health
consequences of those.

42:21.600 --> 42:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The consequences
to the landscape and the
environment are more clear-cut.

42:28.666 --> 42:32.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At Four Mile Fork and
all other mines, federal
regulations require them
to sculpt and replant

42:33.866 --> 42:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the land that is mined out.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROCKY HACKWORTH: These mountains
have natural resources that
God put there, and they were

42:38.533 --> 42:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put here for a reason, to be
used, and we're using them and
putting them back in place.

42:45.800 --> 42:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But people who
live near a surface mine, like
former miner Clay Mullins,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
say the landscape
is forever altered.

42:54.100 --> 42:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLAY MULLINS: It all comes back
to that almighty dollar, because
that's what they care about.

42:59.466 --> 43:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what they're in
business for, is to make money.

43:05.066 --> 43:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, everybody understands
that stuff, now, but you got
to draw a line between what's

43:10.166 --> 43:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
good for the health of your
workers and what's good for
the health of the Earth.

43:15.400 --> 43:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Wherever that
line in the sand was before, the
Trump administration is clearly

43:22.266 --> 43:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
determined to move mountains
for the coal industry, even
as it does the same in Central

43:27.266 --> 43:29.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Appalachia.

43:29.266 --> 43:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Kanawha County, West
Virginia, I'm Miles O'Brien
for the "PBS NewsHour."

43:33.433 --> 43:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now questions
about the ever-growing
scope of Facebook's
empire and social network,

43:50.666 --> 43:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and whether the company
is embracing enough
responsibility for its reach.

43:55.066 --> 44:00.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, Facebook CEO Mark
Zuckerberg announced
that they will add 3,000
more people to monitor

44:01.533 --> 44:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
live video, after problems
with violence and hate speech.

44:05.733 --> 44:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan
takes it from there.

44:07.766 --> 44:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The decision
comes after a series of cases
where people shared live

44:12.366 --> 44:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
video of murder and suicide,
recent examples, a murder in
Cleveland last month that was

44:17.233 --> 44:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
posted live on Facebook, and a
man in Thailand posted video of
him murdering his 11-month-old

44:23.066 --> 44:24.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
daughter.

44:24.066 --> 44:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't removed for 24 hours.

44:26.600 --> 44:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once Facebook makes these
announced hires, there
will be 7,500 employees
to monitor thousands

44:32.133 --> 44:34.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of hours of videos
uploaded constantly.

44:34.600 --> 44:38.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Farhad Manjoo is a
tech columnist for The
New York Times who has
been closely covering

44:38.266 --> 44:40.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Facebook.

44:40.233 --> 44:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He joins me now to talk
about this issue and other
questions facing the company.

44:42.733 --> 44:45.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Farhad, so let's first
-- today's news, how
significant is this?

44:45.566 --> 44:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FARHAD MANJOO, The New York
Times: I think it's significant.

44:47.500 --> 44:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it's a significant sort
of step up in their ability
to monitor these videos,

44:52.533 --> 44:54.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and it should help.

44:54.566 --> 44:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The way it works is, there's
lots of videos going on,
on Facebook all the time.

45:01.033 --> 45:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If somebody sees something
that looks bad, that looks
like it may be criminal or some

45:06.300 --> 45:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other, you know, terrible thing,
they flag it, and the flagged
videos go to these reviewers.

45:11.600 --> 45:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just having more of
these reviewers should make
the whole process faster.

45:15.066 --> 45:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, it should help.

45:16.866 --> 45:20.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, I think the
question is why it took
them a year to do this.

45:20.600 --> 45:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, put the
scale in perspective here.

45:22.633 --> 45:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they have 1.2 billion active
users a month or whatever it
is that they talk about, even

45:29.500 --> 45:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at one-half of 1 percent, if
they wanted to harm themselves
and put this on Facebook,

45:33.266 --> 45:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's six million people.

45:34.266 --> 45:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do these 7,000 stop that?

45:35.666 --> 45:38.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FARHAD MANJOO: Yes.

45:38.266 --> 45:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the way that tech
companies generally work
is, they manage scale
by, you know, leveraging

45:43.433 --> 45:45.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
commuters, basically.

45:45.366 --> 45:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a lot of kind of
algorithmic stuff that goes into
making sure -- they try to,

45:51.333 --> 45:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, cut down the
pool that the human
reviewers have to look at.

45:56.933 --> 45:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there is some experience
in this in the Valley.

45:58.666 --> 46:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, YouTube has had
to deal with this sort
of thing for years.

46:01.700 --> 46:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the way they have
really come around to doing
it is a similar process.

46:06.466 --> 46:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, they have thousands and
thousands of hours of videos
uploaded essentially every

46:10.966 --> 46:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minute, and they count on kind
of the viewers to flag anything
that's terrible, and then

46:17.966 --> 46:19.733 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
it goes to these
human reviewers.

46:19.733 --> 46:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it's a process
that can work.

46:21.933 --> 46:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The difficulty in Facebook's
case is, it's live video, so
they have to get it down much

46:25.833 --> 46:28.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more quickly.

46:28.133 --> 46:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, you know, it's possible
that they may need more people
or some other, you know,

46:35.200 --> 46:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
algorithmic solution, but I
think this is a -- you know,
it should be an improvement

46:37.766 --> 46:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over what they have now.

46:39.833 --> 46:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You
mentioned it took them so
long to get to this point.

46:42.200 --> 46:44.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

46:44.333 --> 46:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FARHAD MANJOO: I think this is
a real sort of cultural blind
spot for Facebook in general.

46:48.066 --> 46:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Oftentimes, they go into these
projects -- you know, Facebook
Live is an example, but many

46:55.666 --> 46:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the other things they
have done -- with, you
know, tremendous optimism.

46:59.633 --> 47:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a company, and Mark
Zuckerberg as a technologist,
he has tremendous
optimism in technology.

47:08.333 --> 47:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they often fail to see or
appreciate the possible kind of
downsides of their technology

47:14.800 --> 47:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the ways that
it could be misused.

47:16.833 --> 47:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I think that what we
have seen with live -- with the
live video is a small example.

47:23.800 --> 47:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The way that Facebook has sort
of affected elections, the
way that -- you know, the fake

47:27.566 --> 47:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
news problem we saw in the U.S.
election, the way it's been
used as a tool for propaganda

47:32.433 --> 47:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in various other parts of the
world, you know, those are huge
examples of, you know, what

47:37.300 --> 47:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looked like a fairly simple
solution technologically,
like we're going to
get everyone connected

47:43.166 --> 47:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and have them share the news.

47:45.200 --> 47:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, it brings some real
deep, like, social questions
that they are only lately

47:51.466 --> 47:53.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
beginning to confront
in a serious way.

47:53.866 --> 47:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, this
combination of, I guess, an
optimism in the technology and

47:58.266 --> 48:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
design and a faith in users
are ultimately good and will
make the right choice, I mean,

48:02.600 --> 48:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that the sort of core
cultural concern or problem that
keeps the company making these

48:07.566 --> 48:08.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sorts of decisions?

48:08.766 --> 48:10.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FARHAD MANJOO:
That's part of it.

48:10.766 --> 48:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the other thing to remember
is, you know, they're a
technology company, and speed is

48:15.666 --> 48:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the utmost concern for them.

48:17.733 --> 48:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the things that was
happening in the tech industry
last year is that a whole bunch

48:21.433 --> 48:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of other companies were rolling
out live video systems, and
Facebook didn't want to be left

48:26.200 --> 48:27.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
behind.

48:27.966 --> 48:30.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so they created
their live video system.

48:30.533 --> 48:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it became, you know,
the biggest, because they're
the biggest social network.

48:34.933 --> 48:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But with that sort of size
comes, you know, an increased
opportunity for misuse and more

48:40.666 --> 48:42.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
power, right.

48:42.700 --> 48:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, a video on Facebook
that can be seen by, you know,
potentially much more people

48:46.566 --> 48:49.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has a lot more potential
for being misused.

48:49.433 --> 48:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think they -- it's not
right to say that they don't
consider those things, but

48:55.600 --> 48:59.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it seems like it's on
a back burner for them.

48:59.966 --> 49:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think what's happening
at Facebook is a shift toward
thinking about these issues

49:06.933 --> 49:09.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at an earlier stage.

49:09.766 --> 49:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have really seen
this more recently in their
work with the news industry.

49:13.900 --> 49:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, after the -- after what
happened -- after what happened
in the election and the kind

49:18.333 --> 49:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of controversy about fake
news, they have started to --
they have rolled out a bunch

49:25.200 --> 49:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of initiatives to do
stuff to improve how
news is seen on Facebook.

49:28.766 --> 49:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have added fact-checkers
and other things.

49:31.400 --> 49:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think their attitude
is changing, but it may be
changing too slowly, compared to

49:37.733 --> 49:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how quick the technology
they're rolling out is changing.

49:39.800 --> 49:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Farhad Manjoo of The New
York Times, thanks so much.

49:42.866 --> 49:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FARHAD MANJOO: All right, great.

49:43.966 --> 49:47.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thanks so much.

49:47.433 --> 49:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares, something
that caught our eye that may be

49:56.733 --> 49:58.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

49:58.733 --> 50:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's springtime, and that means
it's peak tornado season in
the nation's Central Plains.

50:05.566 --> 50:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We recently spoke with one
Wisconsin researcher who thinks
modeling massive twisters with

50:10.066 --> 50:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
supercomputers could
help save lives.

50:12.533 --> 50:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEIGH ORF, University of
Wisconsin: My name is Leigh Orf,
and I am a scientist at the

50:16.466 --> 50:17.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
University of Wisconsin.

50:17.966 --> 50:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I study thunderstorms.

50:20.500 --> 50:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Specifically, I study the
supercell thunderstorms
that produce the most
powerful tornadoes,

50:25.600 --> 50:27.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
using computers
to simulate them.

50:27.800 --> 50:31.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Only a small fraction
of supercells produce
tornadoes, and only a
small fraction of that

50:31.333 --> 50:34.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
fraction produce the
kind of tornado that
we're trying to study.

50:34.300 --> 50:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the reason we are studying
it is because, if you think
of 2011 with Joplin, Missouri,

50:41.366 --> 50:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tuscaloosa, Alabama, El Reno,
Oklahoma, these are the big,
long-track EF-5 tornadoes that

50:47.533 --> 50:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just do incredible amounts of
damage and, if people can't
get out of the way of those

50:49.700 --> 50:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
storms, a lot of fatalities.

50:51.766 --> 50:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A computer model like the
one we're using essentially
emulates or simulates the real

50:58.000 --> 51:00.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
atmosphere as faithfully
as we scientists know
how to make it work.

51:00.933 --> 51:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We use the equations of physics
to essentially grow a cloud
in a specific environment.

51:08.466 --> 51:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What goes into the model
are atmospheric conditions
of winds, temperature,
pressure, and humidity.

51:13.833 --> 51:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And from there on, it's
just -- the model just
integrates forward in time.

51:17.366 --> 51:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This sequence is designed
to give you a sense of
the scale of the storm.

51:21.233 --> 51:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what's really striking
about this is, you can see how
small the tornado is, at least

51:25.833 --> 51:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with respect to the full storm.

51:28.400 --> 51:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the reason I do this
is to give people an
understanding of how --
why we need supercomputers

51:32.966 --> 51:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to study this, because the
whole storm really needs to be
at this very high resolution in

51:37.466 --> 51:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
order to capture the tornado.

51:39.933 --> 51:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This highlights the
streamwise vorticity
current, which is a feature
we have identified in these

51:44.000 --> 51:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
simulations that seems to be
important to maintaining the
strength of the storm and,

51:48.866 --> 51:49.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
therefore, the tornado.

51:49.866 --> 51:51.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
These are just massless.

51:51.766 --> 51:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We call them parcels, air
parcels in meteorology.

51:54.433 --> 51:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you are hanging out in
the streamwise vorticity
area where those yellow
parcels are, the tornado

51:58.566 --> 52:00.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is coming right at you.

52:00.633 --> 52:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They take a horizontal path,
and then they kind of go
tilted upward into the storm's

52:04.633 --> 52:06.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
updraft.

52:06.666 --> 52:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Depending upon where you put
these source regions, you
can see the air is doing very

52:10.033 --> 52:11.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
different things.

52:11.433 --> 52:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The red region is the
streamwise vorticity current.

52:14.433 --> 52:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The darker green region, this
is air that's in the cold
pool of the supercell, and it

52:20.633 --> 52:22.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seems to be directly
feeding the tornado.

52:22.633 --> 52:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The whole reason we do this
kind of research is essentially
to produce better forecasts

52:27.333 --> 52:29.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of when these things
are going to happen.

52:29.500 --> 52:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Too many people still die from
tornadoes in - - around the
world, but in the United States,

52:33.933 --> 52:36.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
too.

52:36.066 --> 52:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a false alarm problem
where we issue a warning when
the tornado is not happening.

52:39.200 --> 52:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we have the problem
where the tornado is already
happening, but we haven't issued

52:42.466 --> 52:44.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a warning.

52:44.533 --> 52:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the challenge is to do a
much better job at producing
these warnings even before the

52:49.200 --> 52:50.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
storm has formed.

52:50.700 --> 52:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the first step is to
first understand the storm.

52:53.033 --> 52:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't forecast a storm until
you understand it, and we're
just getting to the point where

52:57.166 --> 53:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're better understanding
what's going on.

53:04.366 --> 53:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right now: Medicare
doesn't help pay for home-based

53:15.700 --> 53:19.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
care, unless it's
requested by a physician
as medically necessary.

53:19.966 --> 53:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But even for people who
qualify, it can be a struggle
to get those benefits.
