JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.206 --> 00:10.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Fifty-one State
Department officials sign a
letter urging

00:11.078 --> 00:17.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Obama administration to
abandon its policy
in Syria and carry out
airstrikes against

00:17.517 --> 00:19.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Syria's president.

00:19.386 --> 00:25.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, ahead of the Olympics, we
dive in to
the story behind Brazil's deadly
waters, and

00:25.158 --> 00:28.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how local residents are risking
it all to
fight pollution.

00:28.762 --> 00:31.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDRE ANDERSON, Fisherman
(through translator):
They shot at me in front of the
fisherman's

00:31.465 --> 00:36.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
association. Shrapnel hit my
waist, but I
knew I had to keep fighting.
Other fishermen

00:37.070 --> 00:38.939 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have been killed.

00:39.039 --> 00:44.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.
Mark Shields
and David Brooks analyze a full
week of news.

00:44.745 --> 00:50.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:50.884 --> 00:53.253 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:53.353 --> 01:03.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Iraqi special
forces pushed
into the heart of Fallujah
today, for the

01:03.730 --> 01:08.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first time since Islamic State
fighters seized
it in early 2014.

01:08.735 --> 01:13.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The breakthrough came nearly a
month into
an army offensive to recapture
the city. Troops

01:14.074 --> 01:19.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paraded the Iraqi flag through
the city's
streets today after taking the
main government

01:19.613 --> 01:24.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
complex. Later, the prime
minister declared
victory.

01:24.151 --> 01:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people of Britain mourned
today for Jo
Cox, the member of parliament
who was brutally

01:29.323 --> 01:31.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
murdered yesterday.

01:31.391 --> 01:35.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rohit Kachroo of Independent
Television News
reports on the day's events.

01:35.329 --> 01:46.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROHIT KACHROO: If ever there was
a moment
for unity, perhaps this was it.
Today, leaders

01:46.406 --> 01:53.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
became just mourners, walking
through the
silent streets in the footsteps
of so many

01:54.081 --> 02:02.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
others. They came to the place
where Jo Cox
lived and is loved to share
their sadness

02:02.656 --> 02:08.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one by one with flowers and then
with moving
tributes.

02:08.862 --> 02:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON, British Prime
Minister: Today,
our nation is rightly shocked.
And I think

02:12.933 --> 02:18.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is a moment to stand back and
think about
some of the things that are so
important about

02:18.472 --> 02:20.240 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our country.

02:20.340 --> 02:24.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEREMY CORBYN, Leader, Labor
Party: She was
taken from us in an act of
hatred, in a vile

02:24.378 --> 02:30.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
act that has killed her. It's an
attack on
democracy, what happened
yesterday. It's the

02:30.751 --> 02:32.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will of hatred that killed her.

02:32.919 --> 02:38.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROHIT KACHROO: They announced
that Parliament
will be recalled on Monday.

02:38.925 --> 02:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is mourned as a campaigner,
but missed
most as a mother. Her husband
posted this

02:46.433 --> 02:54.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, messages from the prime
minister, from
friends, from strangers told of
the impact

02:54.941 --> 03:01.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of her death. It's the motive
behind it, though,
that's still a mystery.

03:01.515 --> 03:07.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The accused
killer, Thomas
Mair, remains in custody.
Investigators are

03:07.120 --> 03:11.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking into possible links to
far-right extremist
groups.

03:11.425 --> 03:17.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Grieving families held more
funerals today
in Orlando for the victims of
Sunday's nightclub

03:17.264 --> 03:23.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack. Mourners consoled each
other at a
service for two of the 49 killed
in the mass

03:23.270 --> 03:29.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shooting. Also today, Orlando's
mayor announced
that a fund to help the families
has collected

03:29.209 --> 03:31.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
$7 million.

03:31.178 --> 03:36.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was also the anniversary of
the Charleston,
South Carolina, shootings. One
year ago today,

03:36.450 --> 03:43.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a white gunman shot nine black
parishioners
to death at the Emanuel AME
Church. Today,

03:43.557 --> 03:48.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor Nikki Haley and other
leaders joined
in a memorial service, paying
tribute to the

03:48.829 --> 03:50.564 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
victims.

03:50.664 --> 03:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. NIKKI HALEY (R), South
Carolina: They
taught us amazing things. We
will forever

03:53.366 --> 04:00.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be changed, the Mother Emanuel
12 that we
will always talk about. I don't
want it to

04:00.440 --> 04:06.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
be talked about on an
anniversary. I will
always talk about it, whether
I'm in state

04:06.379 --> 04:11.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or out of state. I will always
talk about
these people who changed my
life. And I will

04:11.785 --> 04:13.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
forever be grateful.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The alleged
shooter, Dylann
Roof, is facing the death
penalty in both

04:17.057 --> 04:19.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
state and federal trials.

04:19.626 --> 04:24.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Germany, a court has
convicted a former
guard at the Auschwitz death
camp of aiding

04:24.531 --> 04:32.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 170,000 murders. Reinhold
Hanning is now
94. The judge ruled today that
he was part

04:32.606 --> 04:38.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Nazi machinery behind the
Holocaust.
Survivors welcomed the decision.

04:38.612 --> 04:46.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEDY BOHM, Auschwitz Survivor: I
feel that
my loved ones who were murdered
finally got

04:46.620 --> 04:56.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some justice, that my murdered
mother and
father now perhaps can rest in
peace.

04:56.596 --> 05:02.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hanning was
sentenced to five
years in prison. He has
apologized, but says

05:02.402 --> 05:06.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he never took part in
actual killings.

05:06.506 --> 05:10.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Investigators have found the
second black
box from the EgyptAir flight
that crashed

05:10.710 --> 05:16.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Mediterranean last month.
The recovery
of the cockpit voice recorder
boosts hopes

05:16.149 --> 05:22.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of determining the cause of the
crash. All
66 people on board died when the
plane disappeared

05:22.589 --> 05:24.357 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
May 19.

05:24.457 --> 05:30.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A world sports body today upheld
the ban on
Russia's track and field team
for the upcoming

05:30.330 --> 05:36.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Summer Olympics. The
International Association
of Athletics Federations found
that Moscow

05:36.269 --> 05:41.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has not done enough to clean up
widespread
doping. President Vladimir Putin
denied that

05:41.908 --> 05:47.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his government was involved in
the doping,
and Russian officials said that
they may appeal.

05:47.814 --> 05:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street today, stocks
finished
the week with more losses, amid
worries that

05:52.953 --> 05:58.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Britain will leave the European
Union. The
Dow Jones industrial average
shed 58 points

05:58.792 --> 06:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to close at 17675. The Nasdaq
fell 44 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 dropped six.

06:07.300 --> 06:11.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
dozens of
State Department officials break
with President

06:12.072 --> 06:19.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama on Syria; dirty water
threatening the
Summer Olympics; the case for
Britain staying

06:19.779 --> 06:31.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the E.U.; and much more.

06:31.825 --> 06:37.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you end the war in Syria?
It's a question
that has plagued world leaders
since the start

06:37.664 --> 06:40.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the devastating civil
conflict there.

06:40.200 --> 06:45.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, we learned more about the
extent of
disagreement inside the U.S.
State Department

06:45.605 --> 06:47.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about the course set by
President Obama.

06:48.074 --> 06:51.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner reports.

06:51.444 --> 06:58.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: For five years,
the savage
Syria conflict has killed some
400,000 and

06:58.551 --> 07:00.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
put millions more to flight.

07:00.720 --> 07:06.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now 51 mid-level diplomatic
officials have
gone on record advocating a
dramatic shift

07:06.926 --> 07:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in U.S. strategy. They have
signed an internal
so-called dissent letter,
calling for targeted

07:12.766 --> 07:16.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
military strikes against
President Bashar
al-Assad's government.

07:17.003 --> 07:21.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The dissenters argue it would
help bring Assad
to the negotiating table and
deal a major

07:22.075 --> 07:27.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blow to ISIS. The document
remains secret,
but Andrew Tabler, an expert on
Syria at the

07:27.547 --> 07:31.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington Institute for Near
East Policy,
is familiar with the document's
contents.

07:32.018 --> 07:35.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW TABLER, Fellow,
Washington Institute
for Near East Policy: If the
Assad regime

07:35.322 --> 07:41.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
violates the cessation of
hostilities and
uses it to further its position
on the battlefield,

07:41.728 --> 07:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in such cases, military force
could be used.
Second, if humanitarian
assistance is not

07:46.900 --> 07:50.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
provided or is impeded in some
way, military
force could be used.

07:50.770 --> 07:55.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In Copenhagen
today, Secretary
of State John Kerry said he had
not yet seen

07:55.241 --> 07:56.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the memo, but welcomed it.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: I think
it's an important statement, and
I respect

07:59.746 --> 08:03.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the process very, very much, and
I will probably
meet with people or have a
chance to talk

08:03.550 --> 08:05.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with them when we get back.

08:05.452 --> 08:08.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The memo came
through a channel
created for State Department
employees to

08:08.955 --> 08:17.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
register policy disagreements
without retaliation.
When conflict first broke out in
2011, President

08:17.530 --> 08:22.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama called for ousting Assad.
And in 2012,
he threatened military action.

08:22.802 --> 08:27.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
A red line for us is, we start
seeing a whole

08:27.273 --> 08:31.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bunch of chemical weapons moving
around or
being utilized. That would
change my calculus.

08:31.911 --> 08:37.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But after a
regime chemical
attack killed more than 1,000
Syrians in August

08:37.183 --> 08:43.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2013, the president didn't
launch military
strikes, nor step up arming the
Syrian rebels.

08:43.556 --> 08:49.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More recently, he's launched
U.S. airstrikes
in Syria, but only against ISIS.
Instead,

08:49.963 --> 08:54.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia intervened last fall on
Assad's behalf,
bolstering him. Today, Russian
air attacks

08:54.968 --> 08:59.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hit anti-Assad rebels battling
is in Southern
Syria.

08:59.472 --> 09:04.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A spokesman for Russian
President Vladimir
Putin warned today any U.S. move
targeting

09:04.811 --> 09:09.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Assad's forces would plunge the
region into
total chaos.

09:09.115 --> 09:10.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Andrew Tabler's response?

09:11.051 --> 09:13.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW TABLER: If you look at
this, over time,
whether it's the United States
and the threat

09:13.987 --> 09:20.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of use of military force in 2013
or Israel's
continued use of strikes inside
of Syria,

09:20.794 --> 09:23.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is something that the Assad
regime is
known to respond to.

09:23.430 --> 09:28.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: All of this
comes as a February
cease-fire has largely
dissolved. It did let

09:28.535 --> 09:34.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
humanitarian aid reach some
Syrian communities,
but others remain cut off by
Assad loyalists.

09:34.841 --> 09:39.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And peace talks backed by
Secretary of State
Kerry and the Russians have
shown no progress.

09:39.646 --> 09:46.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An August 1 deadline for a
political transition
won't be met. Plans now are only
to resume

09:46.286 --> 09:47.454 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
talks then.

09:47.554 --> 09:50.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Margaret
joins me now.

09:50.223 --> 09:54.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Margaret, how unusual is
this, to have
so many diplomats weigh in like
this?

09:54.494 --> 09:57.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: You put your
finger on it,
Judy. It's unprecedented in the
memory of

09:57.964 --> 09:59.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anyone in the history of the
State Department.

09:59.833 --> 10:03.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Usually, these are solo letters,
maybe three
or four. There was a little
flurry during

10:03.770 --> 10:09.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Iraq War. Never have you
seen 51. And
that just shows the depth of the
frustration.

10:09.476 --> 10:13.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I talked to Ambassador --
former Ambassador
to Syria Robert Ford who
actually, as you

10:13.179 --> 10:17.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, two years ago resigned
publicly because
he felt he couldn't support the
policy, that

10:17.717 --> 10:19.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president wasn't supporting
the opposition
sufficiently.

10:19.919 --> 10:24.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said, when you're in the
State Department,
you must follow the commander in
chief. If

10:25.024 --> 10:30.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can't, you have to resign.
And he said
the grave danger for these
mid-level people

10:30.263 --> 10:34.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, they're all people with
young families
with mortgages to pay, and it
can be risky,

10:34.968 --> 10:36.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even though the rule is no
retaliation.

10:36.803 --> 10:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Margaret, how
widely held
are these views in the State
Department?

10:40.139 --> 10:44.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: They are widely
held, Judy,
from the people I talk to not
only at State,

10:44.210 --> 10:49.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but in intelligence and defense
agencies,
which is, you have got 400,000
dead and all

10:49.215 --> 10:51.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these millions driven from their
home.

10:51.117 --> 10:54.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whether or not we could have
done anything
about it, clearly, whatever has
been tried

10:54.521 --> 11:00.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been a failure. But for some
of these
officers who are acting to try
to implement

11:00.360 --> 11:04.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the policy, as Fred Hof, who
used to be the
envoy to the Syrian opposition,
and he first

11:04.864 --> 11:09.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resigned in protest at the lack
of action,
he said -- and I thought it's
was very touching

11:09.335 --> 11:14.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- he said, this gap between
belief and duty
has weighed heavily on some very
conscientious

11:14.774 --> 11:16.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
officials, younger officials.

11:16.709 --> 11:20.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And by that, he meant duty to
the commander
in chief -- you're not the
elected one -- but

11:21.047 --> 11:28.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a belief that this whole policy
is leading
us down to more destruction.

11:29.088 --> 11:42.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to Rio de
Janeiro, where,
late today, the regional
government declared

11:42.168 --> 11:46.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a state of public calamity over
a major budget
crisis.

11:46.606 --> 11:51.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In just seven weeks, the Summer
Olympics will
open. Among the many concerns
for athletes

11:51.744 --> 11:56.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
competing in the Games has been
the waters
of the heavily polluted bay
where the sailing

11:56.883 --> 12:02.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
competition will take place. But
thousands
of Brazilians' lives and
livelihoods depend

12:02.855 --> 12:04.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on this troubled body of water.

12:05.091 --> 12:11.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour" producer Jon Gerberg
and NPR's
Lulu Garcia-Navarro bring us
this story of

12:11.764 --> 12:15.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their life-and-death fight to
save the bay.

12:16.002 --> 12:27.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Alexandre
Anderson is
a hunted man, targeted for his
work on these

12:27.714 --> 12:30.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
treacherous waters.

12:30.416 --> 12:35.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every day, as he heads out onto
Rio de Janeiro's
Guanabara Bay, he's on a mission
to defend

12:35.855 --> 12:42.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the bay he calls home. He tells
us its stark
beauty hides a dark reality.

12:42.895 --> 12:49.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDRE ANDERSON, Fisherman
(through translator):
We hope the Olympics will show
the world another

12:49.469 --> 12:54.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bay. There is the bay for the
rich, for visitors
to see, and there is the bay of
the fishermen,

12:54.273 --> 12:59.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are suffering. That is the
bay of excrement,
garbage, and oil. It is the
Guanabara Bay

12:59.445 --> 13:01.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of violence.

13:01.347 --> 13:04.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Alexandre
took us on
a tour of that bay. He knows it
well. He grew

13:05.018 --> 13:09.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up fishing here. But as the bay
got more and
more polluted, he became an
activist, who

13:09.922 --> 13:14.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leads a fishermen's
organization.

13:14.761 --> 13:20.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ecological devastation here
is hard to
miss. He shows us a mangrove
swamp used as

13:20.400 --> 13:26.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an illegal dumping ground for
trash. Raw sewage
is also pumped into the bay from
communities

13:26.272 --> 13:28.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that have no access to
sanitation.

13:28.574 --> 13:34.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for Alexandre Anderson, the
biggest polluters
are not only the residents who
lack basic

13:34.480 --> 13:42.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
infrastructure, but also the
petroleum industry.
This is one of the biggest
refineries in the

13:42.989 --> 13:46.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
area. And it's right on the
banks of the Guanabara
Bay.

13:46.159 --> 13:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can see here in the
water it's slick
with oil. Rio de Janeiro, a
world-famous beach

13:53.933 --> 14:00.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town, is also Brazil's oil and
gas heartland.
Energy accounted for 13 percent
of Brazil's

14:00.239 --> 14:05.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GDP in 2014. And almost
three-quarters of
the world's recent deep-water
oil discoveries

14:05.912 --> 14:09.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been made in Brazil. The
Guanabara Bay
is the industry's hub.

14:09.816 --> 14:15.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alexandre takes us to an oil
industry shipyard
and points out broken
eco-barriers meant to

14:15.688 --> 14:19.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stop paint and chemicals from
leaking into
the water.

14:19.592 --> 14:24.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDRE ANDERSON (through
translator): All
this material contains heavy
metals. Some

14:24.530 --> 14:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are very toxic. This is an
environmental crime.
This is a company that is using
a natural

14:29.902 --> 14:35.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resource and polluting it. The
small quantity
of fish that we have left here
are being contaminated

14:35.842 --> 14:37.577 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or being killed.

14:37.677 --> 14:40.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Alexandre
points out
guards protecting the site. He's
had run-ins

14:41.013 --> 14:46.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with them before. We speed away.
Alexandre
spends his days documenting
these infractions

14:46.786 --> 14:51.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and reporting them. He says the
authorities
do little to stop what's
happening.

14:51.557 --> 14:57.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDRE ANDERSON (through
translator): We
fishermen understand that the
Guanabara Bay

14:57.230 --> 15:03.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still has life. The Guanabara
Bay is a nursery
for many species, if only they
would stop

15:03.302 --> 15:05.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
polluting and the government
would start acting.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: In a
statement issued
to "PBS NewsHour," the state
environmental

15:09.041 --> 15:13.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secretary said the problem is
that many groups
have oversight of the bay, but
they don't

15:13.412 --> 15:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a common plan or vision for
its recovery
and preservation.

15:17.550 --> 15:22.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the absence of government,
Alexandre says
the fishermen have become the
guardians of

15:22.622 --> 15:28.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the bay instead. Many like him
have become
vocal advocates, staging
demonstrations and

15:29.061 --> 15:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking other actions to call
attention to
the state of the bay. Brazil's
national oil

15:34.000 --> 15:38.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
company, Petrobras, is
responsible for at
least two major oil spills in
the bay that

15:38.271 --> 15:40.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
severely damaged the ecosystem.

15:40.473 --> 15:45.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Alexandre, speaking out
against one of
the most powerful economic
forces in the country

15:45.678 --> 15:47.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
almost cost him his life.

15:47.680 --> 15:52.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDRE ANDERSON (through
translator): They
shot at me in front of the
fisherman's association.

15:53.052 --> 15:58.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shrapnel hit my waist, but I
knew I had to
keep fighting. Other fishermen
have been killed.

15:58.758 --> 16:03.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Brazil is
the among the
most dangerous countries in the
world to be

16:03.162 --> 16:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an environmental defender. One
of Alexandre's
colleagues was brutally
murdered, his body

16:07.900 --> 16:11.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tied to his fishing boat and
sunk after being
riddled with bullets.

16:12.038 --> 16:17.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Alexandre is in a federal
protection program
and lives in a secret location.
Up until recently,

16:17.476 --> 16:22.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he had a permanent security
detail. He blames
the shadowy forces protecting
the oil industry

16:22.982 --> 16:24.717 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the violence.

16:24.817 --> 16:28.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The state oil company,
Petrobras, also at
the center of a massive
corruption scandal

16:28.654 --> 16:33.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, released this statement to
"PBS NewsHour":
"Petrobras is unaware of these
incidents and

16:33.459 --> 16:37.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rejects any act of violence
against the fishermen,"
it read. "The company maintains
a dialogue

16:38.097 --> 16:42.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the fishing and other
communities that
surround the Guanabara Bay.
Petrobras is also

16:42.335 --> 16:46.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a company that, along with other
activities,
invests in social and
environmental projects

16:47.006 --> 16:51.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Guanabara Bay. All of our
projects
rigorously follow the various
government environmental

16:51.744 --> 16:54.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
controls and are licensed."

16:54.247 --> 16:58.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Prosecutors have been
investigating several
murders and disappearances of
fishermen on

16:58.718 --> 17:04.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the bay. A prosecutor who has
dealt with Alexandre's
case told "PBS NewsHour" he had
no proof directly

17:04.357 --> 17:06.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
implicating the oil industry in
the deaths.

17:06.692 --> 17:10.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LAURO COELHO JR., Federal
Prosecutor (through
translator): It is involved in
an environmental

17:10.396 --> 17:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and economic conflict in which
there is a
clash between development and
the environment,

17:14.600 --> 17:18.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and in the midst of this
conflict, deaths
occurred.

17:18.204 --> 17:23.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: The
polluted waters,
from the oil industry, from the
raw sewage

17:23.309 --> 17:28.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and trash dumped into the bay,
have also hurt
the fishermen and their families
in other

17:28.714 --> 17:30.616 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ways.

17:30.716 --> 17:34.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alexandre takes us to visit the
oldest fishing
community in the region in a
town called Surui.

17:35.054 --> 17:41.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Romildo Soares de Oliveira is
the president
of the fishermen association
here. He tells

17:41.894 --> 17:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us young people are leaving, the
community
is dying, because the bay can no
longer support

17:47.700 --> 17:49.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their livelihood.

17:49.535 --> 17:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brazil promised to clean up
Guanabara Bay
for the Olympics. That could
have meant a

17:53.005 --> 17:57.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new start for the artisanal
fishermen who
have been plying their trade on
the bay and

17:57.977 --> 18:00.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its tributaries for hundreds of
years.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROMILDO SOARES DE OLIVEIRA,
Fishermen Association
(through translator): We had
hope for the

18:04.083 --> 18:09.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Olympics. We end up believing in
these false
promises to clean up the bay, to
bring a better

18:09.121 --> 18:15.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bay for the fishermen. We were
excited, but
the end of this soap opera is
always the same.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Nothing happens.

18:17.797 --> 18:21.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: The water,
which they
rely on for their survival, has
been proven

18:21.834 --> 18:27.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to carry dangerous viruses and
bacteria with
devastating consequences.

18:27.340 --> 18:31.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Romildo introduced me to a group
of residents.
They have seen family members
become severely

18:31.477 --> 18:37.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sick and hospitalized for weeks.
Yuri Chagas,
a 14-year-old from Surui, went
swimming in

18:37.683 --> 18:42.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the river after he cut his foot.
It then began
to swell, and he was
hospitalized.

18:42.421 --> 18:48.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YURI CHAGAS, Surui Resident
(through translator):
I was a month there, urinating
with pus. They

18:48.194 --> 18:53.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost had to amputate the leg,
but later
they decided it wouldn't be
necessary. I have

18:53.232 --> 18:56.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had to do physical therapy,
because I was
walking with crooked leg.

18:56.802 --> 19:02.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Some have
even died.
Antonio Batista Reis lost his
11-year-old

19:02.541 --> 19:04.443 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
son 15 years ago.

19:04.543 --> 19:10.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO BATISTA REIS, Brazil
(through translator):
At high tide, the kids used to
bathe in the

19:10.349 --> 19:14.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
river. I do not know what
happened. One day,
he went to bathe and came back
with itchy

19:14.620 --> 19:19.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eyes. We took him to the clinic
and his eyes
began to swell. He then went to
the hospital

19:19.558 --> 19:21.427 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and died.

19:21.527 --> 19:29.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Reis, like
the others,
is sure that the polluted water
was the cause.

19:29.168 --> 19:33.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We took that assertion to
Alberto Chebabo,
head of infectious diseases at
Rio's Federal

19:34.006 --> 19:39.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
University Hospital. He said
there is no way
to prove a direct link, but he
said ingesting

19:39.779 --> 19:44.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or even touching the bay's water
can result
in a number of diseases. And he
said that

19:44.717 --> 19:46.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
children are at higher risk.

19:46.986 --> 19:50.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALBERTO CHEBABO, Federal
University Hospital
(through translator): If you
look at the statistics

19:50.890 --> 19:55.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of hospitalization around the
bay, there is
a clear picture of the risks to
people being

19:55.394 --> 20:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exposed to this water. When you
consider this
population, especially children,
living in

20:00.566 --> 20:05.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these degraded areas, it is very
easy to see
the link between the bay's
environmental contamination

20:05.905 --> 20:07.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and these diseases.

20:07.773 --> 20:11.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Back in
Surui, Antonio
Reis, a fisherman himself, says
he says he

20:11.644 --> 20:16.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has no choice but to continue to
work in the
waters that he believes killed
his son.

20:17.016 --> 20:20.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO BATISTA REIS (through
translator):
The most majority of the people
here, about

20:20.486 --> 20:25.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
80 percent, live from the
fishing. We have
to fish. We have to find a way.
There's no

20:25.658 --> 20:27.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
other solution. We have to risk.

20:27.760 --> 20:32.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: He says the
people have
a right to clean water. But
Romildo, the president

20:32.998 --> 20:35.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the fishing association,
believes nothing
will change.

20:35.734 --> 20:40.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROMILDO SOARES DE OLIVEIRA
(through translator):
A lot of people talk about
athletes, about

20:40.573 --> 20:46.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Olympics, but lives are being
cut short here.
People do not talk about it, but
lives are

20:46.345 --> 20:48.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being taken.

20:48.347 --> 20:57.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: As we head
home, Alexandre
Anderson tells us he believes
this place can

20:57.823 --> 21:06.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be restored. He says he has
fought for the
bay long before the Olympics,
and he will

21:06.765 --> 21:11.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continue long after the Games
have come and
gone.

21:11.370 --> 21:21.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lulu
Garcia-Navarro
of NPR in Rio de Janeiro.

21:21.547 --> 21:31.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

21:31.223 --> 21:36.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields
and David Brooks take on the
week's news;

21:36.295 --> 21:42.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poems marking one year after the
Charleston
church shooting; and a middle
school graduation

21:42.334 --> 21:46.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speech in the style of this
year's presidential
candidates.

21:46.172 --> 21:52.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: It is less than a
week until voters
in the United Kingdom decide
whether to stay

21:52.478 --> 21:54.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or leave the European Union.

21:55.080 --> 21:59.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Campaigning was suspended for a
second straight
day today because of the
shooting death of

21:59.818 --> 22:01.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a lawmaker.

22:01.720 --> 22:06.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Last night, our economics
correspondent, Paul
Solman, explored the arguments
in favor of

22:06.392 --> 22:08.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Brexit, or exiting the E.U.

22:08.627 --> 22:13.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, he hears the case for
remaining.
It's part of his series on
Making Sense of

22:13.732 --> 22:15.534 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
financial news.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL HESELTINE, Former U.K.
Deputy Prime
Minister: This is a two-tiered
debate, hearts

22:17.703 --> 22:19.505 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and minds.

22:19.605 --> 22:23.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: At the Oxford
Debate Union last
week, the audience seemed to
side with those

22:23.442 --> 22:27.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in favor of the United Kingdom
remaining in
the European Union.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX SALMOND, Scottish National
Party M.P.:
I have never heard the phrase
workers' rights

22:29.748 --> 22:34.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come out the mouth of any of the
three of
the leading protagonists.

22:34.753 --> 22:41.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL HESELTINE: The man in
the desert is
sovereign, he is free, he can do
whatever

22:41.160 --> 22:45.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he likes, but he has no power.
We're better
together.

22:45.998 --> 22:51.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And the remain
sentiment certainly
prevails at Mansfield College,
where I'm spending

22:51.370 --> 22:53.305 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the spring term.

22:53.405 --> 22:55.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LUCINDA RUMSEY, Mansfield
College: We should
definitely stay in Europe,
absolutely, unambiguously.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Lucinda Rumsey
teaches old English
literature.

22:59.078 --> 23:03.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUCINDA RUMSEY: We should be in
Europe, because
it's good for Europe to have us
in. And we

23:03.182 --> 23:07.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should be contributing. We're a
rich country,
and we should be contributing
and helping

23:07.853 --> 23:09.688 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

23:09.788 --> 23:13.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But why then has
there been so
much support for leaving? Well,
one reason,

23:13.259 --> 23:15.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Rumsey speculates:

23:15.194 --> 23:20.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUCINDA RUMSEY: Lots of English
people hate
the French, hate the Germans
since the -- kind

23:20.299 --> 23:25.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of since the wars, and so they
kind of come
back to that. They don't want to
be in that

23:25.771 --> 23:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
club with those people. They
just don't like
them; they haven't liked them
since the 13th

23:29.375 --> 23:31.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
century. They're not going to
like them now.

23:31.377 --> 23:37.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But put prejudice
aside, says
Paul Flather, who runs the
Europaeum, an association

23:37.182 --> 23:42.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of top European universities.
The costs of
leaving, he says, are simply too
great.

23:42.421 --> 23:48.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL FLATHER, The Europaeum:
Every single
financial economic report of the
last two

23:48.861 --> 23:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weeks have unanimously pointed
out that we
will have between 2 and 4
percent down on

23:55.034 --> 23:55.834 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
growth.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because of less
trade?

23:57.803 --> 24:03.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL FLATHER: Because of less
trade, because
of having to renegotiate
agreements and not

24:03.709 --> 24:10.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being able to sell things, of
tariffs, losing
markets. I think 40 percent of
our exports

24:10.115 --> 24:13.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go to Europe. Only 3 percent of
theirs come
to us.

24:13.319 --> 24:18.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Economics, the key
to conservative
Prime Minister David Cameron's
case for remain.

24:18.290 --> 24:22.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON, British Prime
Minister: The
shock to our economy after
leaving Europe

24:22.594 --> 24:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would tip the country into
recession. This
could be, for the first time in
history, a

24:27.533 --> 24:29.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
recession brought on ourselves.

24:29.268 --> 24:31.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And what about
Mansfield's students?

24:31.337 --> 24:33.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROSHAN FOROUHI, Student: I'm for
remaining.

24:33.105 --> 24:35.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELLA GRODZINSKI, Student: I
think we should
remain as well.

24:35.441 --> 24:36.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER BERGAMIN, Student: Remain.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
®MD-BO-LUKE CHARTERS-REID,
Student: Yes,
I think Britain should remain.

24:38.744 --> 24:42.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Luke Charters-Reid
came to Oxford
from a low-status state school.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.016 align:left position:37.5%,start line:80% size:62.5%
®MD-BO-
LUKE CHARTERS-REID: I think
pretty much all

24:44.116 --> 24:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the students I spoke to want to
stay in Europe.
I think it's better off for
students who are

24:47.486 --> 24:51.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thinking about the jobs for when
we leave,
and I think those jobs are more
secure if

24:52.057 --> 24:53.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we remain in Europe.

24:53.926 --> 24:56.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLA GRODZINSKI: The lack of
confidence people
would have of a Britain outside
of Europe

24:56.395 --> 24:57.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would itself cause losses in
jobs.

24:57.963 --> 25:01.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Ella Grodzinski
says no one can
predict what would happen.

25:01.667 --> 25:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLA GRODZINSKI: But it seems to
me that the
predictions of what will happen
if we stay

25:05.471 --> 25:09.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are much more solid and grounded
than the
predictions of what will happen
if we leave.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Roshan Forouhi is
more emphatic.

25:11.810 --> 25:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSHAN FOROUHI: The world is
going to carry
on globalizing without us. For
me personally,

25:16.315 --> 25:20.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I would perceive the
opportunities in the
job markets to be more
international, and

25:20.886 --> 25:24.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would probably leave Britain,
whereas, if
we remain, I have a strong case
for remaining

25:24.957 --> 25:26.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Britain myself.

25:26.792 --> 25:29.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So you think that
there is a
possibility of brain drain,
essentially.?

25:29.528 --> 25:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSHAN FOROUHI: Absolutely. The
job markets
will shift abroad, more to the
states, more

25:34.433 --> 25:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Germany, more to the emerging
markets in
Asia. And the prominence of
London as a financial

25:40.139 --> 25:43.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sector will massively decline if
we leave.

25:43.208 --> 25:47.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But wait a second.
These kids
go to Oxford. Their futures are
assured. What

25:48.080 --> 25:54.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about Britons who feel their
wages, jobs and
safety are threatened by
immigration?

25:54.253 --> 25:56.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Peter Bergamin hails from
Canada.

25:56.188 --> 26:01.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BERGAMIN: I think, when
times get tight,
people tend to look for easy
answers or easy

26:01.693 --> 26:05.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
solutions. And this is exactly
what's happening
now. This is why you can see the
moves towards

26:05.230 --> 26:11.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these kind of populist leaders.
And they approach
things from, let's say, a
primordial, nationalistic

26:11.737 --> 26:13.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
perspective, right?

26:13.739 --> 26:19.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's all about ethnicity on some
level, Britishness
on some level, which usually
means a certain

26:19.511 --> 26:21.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stereotype.

26:21.346 --> 26:26.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL FLATHER: I sense that
there's been a
failure on the part of the
governing elites.

26:27.052 --> 26:33.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think we have explained
properly what
changes are happening in the
world and the

26:33.859 --> 26:40.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
benefits of being in a big club,
in an international,
much more interdependent, much
more complicated

26:40.365 --> 26:42.201 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

26:42.301 --> 26:45.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Paul Flather has
been a journalist,
diplomat, and professor in
England, but was

26:45.604 --> 26:47.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
raised in India.

26:47.372 --> 26:51.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL FLATHER: I actually came as
a migrant
on a boat through the Suez
Canal, but I'm

26:51.777 --> 26:57.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so British that I sometimes put,
you know,
other Brits to shame, you know,
the village

26:57.382 --> 27:02.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
green, the sound of cricket
bats, and sunny
teas and lovely sandwiches. But
we can't pull

27:02.855 --> 27:04.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up the drawbridge.

27:04.656 --> 27:06.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BARONESS HELENA KENNEDY,
Mansfield College:
Listen, there is a kind of
fiction around

27:06.825 --> 27:08.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the business of sovereignty.

27:08.627 --> 27:12.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Mansfield's head of
college,
Baroness Helena Kennedy, is also
a human rights

27:12.831 --> 27:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lawyer and a Labor party member
of the House
of Lords.

27:15.868 --> 27:22.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARONESS HELENA KENNEDY: being
the sole operator,
far from giving you this
swaggering, you know,

27:22.207 --> 27:29.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
independence and freedom,
actually makes you
low on the list of people that
nations want

27:29.948 --> 27:33.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do business with. They want
to do business
with bigger blocs.

27:33.886 --> 27:39.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a tiny, wee country like the
U.K. isn't
going to figure very well in all
that.

27:39.124 --> 27:44.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But in the end,
says Kennedy,
the remain case is bigger than
just economics.

27:44.630 --> 27:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARONESS HELENA KENNEDY: Europe
is a union
of nations, making us close
enough that we

27:48.600 --> 27:53.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
would never think of ever
getting involved
in conflict again, about coming
together in

27:53.739 --> 28:00.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
order to defeat things like
fascism, to coming
together to prevent the kind of
horror that

28:00.145 --> 28:02.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I imagine could easily happen
just now.

28:02.548 --> 28:09.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL HESELTINE: So that the
self-interests
of this country, driven by
people like you,

28:09.187 --> 28:14.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is as important in the
generations to come
as it has been in the
generations of which

28:14.726 --> 28:16.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have been privileged to be a
part.

28:16.595 --> 28:22.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, finally, how
did the vote
go at the Oxford Debate Union?;
227 in favor

28:22.834 --> 28:26.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of remaining, only 79 for
Brexit.

28:26.672 --> 28:32.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Next week, we will see if the
rest of the
country mirrors those results in
any way at

28:32.511 --> 28:34.079 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
all.

28:34.179 --> 28:37.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is economics correspondent
Paul Solman,
reporting from Oxford, England.

28:37.783 --> 28:43.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the moment,
polls show more
British voters are in favor of
leaving the

28:43.255 --> 28:48.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
European Union. But the betting
markets, which
have often been more accurate,
see it differently.

28:48.594 --> 29:04.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There, the wagers are weighted
toward Britain
staying in.

29:04.977 --> 29:09.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now to the analysis of Shields
and Brooks.
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and

29:09.615 --> 29:11.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

29:11.950 --> 29:13.752 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

29:13.852 --> 29:18.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gentlemen, begin by the terrible
thing that
happened last weekend in
Orlando, this 29-year-old

29:18.857 --> 29:24.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man with -- who had displayed
erratic behavior,
Mark, through much of his life.
Are there

29:24.730 --> 29:26.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
any lessons from this?

29:26.298 --> 29:29.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I'm not sure there
are, Judy.

29:29.434 --> 29:35.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was -- I have been amazed how
polarized
our nation is. Ordinarily and
historically,

29:35.340 --> 29:40.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
events this tragic -- and there
have been
none really this tragic, I
guess, in just

29:41.013 --> 29:45.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sheer magnitude -- but there is
sort of a
uniting feeling in the country.

29:45.350 --> 29:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's been missing. We can
blame our
politics and our politicians.
And we will.

29:51.056 --> 29:55.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's -- I think it reflects
the country.
There's just -- we live in a
couple of different

29:55.661 --> 30:02.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
worlds. Republicans
overwhelmingly think it's
a matter of terrorism, and
Islamic terrorism,

30:02.100 --> 30:08.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that that's where all the
attention -- and
Democrats overwhelmingly respond
that it's

30:08.640 --> 30:17.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the availability and the
promiscuous availability
of weapons without background
checks or adequate

30:17.616 --> 30:19.351 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
controls.

30:19.451 --> 30:25.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I guess the -- tragedies
like this
have historically brought out
the best in

30:25.524 --> 30:29.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country, and I don't think
that's happened
this time. It definitely hasn't.

30:29.127 --> 30:30.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We think of 9/11.

30:31.029 --> 30:35.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Think of 9/11,
exactly. Think
of other times of tragedy, and
even Charleston.

30:35.867 --> 30:37.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I actually take of
a cheerier
view, I think.

30:39.571 --> 30:45.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought there was an amazing
amount of simple,
unadorned grief and sympathy for
the victims

30:45.444 --> 30:49.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the victims' families. And
the fact a
large percent of them were gay
wasn't as big

30:50.082 --> 30:51.850 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
an issue.

30:51.950 --> 30:56.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was my perception, that
people of all
sides said, these were human
beings, God's

30:56.354 --> 31:00.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
creatures, who were killed. And
there was
an outpouring of simple grief
for the people.

31:00.525 --> 31:05.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On the political stuff,
obviously, the gun
thing is divisive. But I thought
most people

31:05.597 --> 31:10.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, well, this is both an act
of terrorism
and a hate crime at the same
time. And it

31:10.535 --> 31:15.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can be both. And I think that's
what really
just struck me about the week
is, sometimes,

31:15.373 --> 31:19.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the divisions we have between
psychology and
politics and religion, those
divisions don't

31:19.845 --> 31:21.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really make sense in practice.

31:21.747 --> 31:25.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have seen this so many
times with so
many different shooters. They're
the same

31:25.851 --> 31:31.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
personality type. You begin with
a sense of
humiliation, personal failure,
personal disappointment,

31:31.923 --> 31:37.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
personal injury. That turns into
a sense of
grievance, that the problem is
not me, the

31:37.562 --> 31:39.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
problem is the world.

31:39.397 --> 31:42.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then that turns into sort of
moral outrage
at the evil people who are doing
this. Then

31:42.868 --> 31:48.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that gets weaponized by sort of
some radical
ideology that allows me to
justify the violence.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then you walk down the line.

31:50.375 --> 31:54.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they walk down these same
series of steps,
and it's just the social
isolation of young,

31:55.013 --> 31:56.782 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
angry men.

31:56.882 --> 31:59.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But when -- your
-- to your
point, Mark, when you look at
the reaction

31:59.518 --> 32:05.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the political leadership,
Donald Trump
focused on terrorism, on what he
likes to

32:06.057 --> 32:11.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refer to as radical Islam, very
different
from the emphasis, at least,
from President

32:12.063 --> 32:13.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Obama and Hillary Clinton.

32:13.899 --> 32:15.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, no question.

32:15.767 --> 32:19.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while I agree with David and
the points
he makes, and I think they're
strong points,

32:19.971 --> 32:25.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, I would just add that the
FBI is coming
in for some, I think, undeserved
criticism

32:25.744 --> 32:33.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that somehow -- this was a man
with bad thoughts,
outrageous thoughts.

32:33.885 --> 32:38.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't arrest people in this
country. We
don't incarcerate them. There is
no thought

32:38.123 --> 32:44.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
control. And it is acts. And
there weren't
any acts, other than reportedly
his abuse

32:44.129 --> 32:48.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his wife, which doesn't rise
to the level
of the FBI, and is local law
enforcement.

32:48.967 --> 32:53.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you're absolutely right.
First of all,
President Obama is at his best
at times like

32:53.939 --> 32:58.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this. And it's a terrible thing
to say, but
he was at Charleston, he was at
Newtown, he

32:58.476 --> 33:03.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was after Gabby Giffords. And in
a strange
way, it brings out the best in
him.

33:03.748 --> 33:10.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a cool detachment about
Barack Obama,
sort of a remoteness emotionally
most times.

33:11.089 --> 33:16.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was -- he's so accessible
in listening
to the victims' families and the
survivors

33:16.728 --> 33:21.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and how much it means to them
and how genuine
they feel he is.

33:21.299 --> 33:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought he had a choice to
go on the
LGBT -- there are three elements
to it's -- the

33:28.240 --> 33:33.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LGBT, obviously, the terrorism
and the guns.
And he thought the guns were the
most available,

33:33.545 --> 33:37.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where they may get some action.
And that's
what he chose to emphasize.

33:37.115 --> 33:44.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As far as the others, I thought
Hillary Clinton
was quite measured, very
calibrated, responsible,

33:44.389 --> 33:50.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and stood in stark contrast -- a
little more
hawkish than the president, and
stood in dark

33:50.829 --> 33:56.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contrast to Donald Trump, who
squandered what
is the one area where
Republicans have a decided

33:56.434 --> 34:01.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advantage, which is national
security and
sort of homeland security.

34:01.206 --> 34:07.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he just -- I mean, first of
all, congratulating
himself at the outset, and then
insinuating

34:07.746 --> 34:13.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in innuendo that the president
was somehow
involved was beyond the pale. It
makes him

34:13.551 --> 34:14.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unacceptable as a national
figure.

34:15.020 --> 34:16.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you size
up their reaction?

34:16.922 --> 34:18.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, well,
somewhat agreement.

34:18.790 --> 34:22.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I had to rank them, if one
ranks these
things, I thought Hillary
Clinton's reaction

34:22.694 --> 34:29.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the best. It combined both
the gun issue,
the gay issue, but also the
Islamic radicalism

34:29.467 --> 34:33.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue, if we want to use that
word. And I
give her credit for mentioning
that.

34:33.271 --> 34:37.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do think, in acts like
this, it's not
driven by religious faith, but
it's driven

34:38.043 --> 34:42.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and shaped by a bin Ladenist,
jihadist ideology.
And I think the president is
wrong not to

34:43.048 --> 34:44.816 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
say that.

34:44.916 --> 34:50.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have a quote in my column
today by Peter
Bergen, who is a friend of --
and he said,

34:50.889 --> 34:54.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying Islamic terror is not
related to Islam
is like saying the Crusades are
not related

34:54.359 --> 34:56.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Christianity and their view
of Jerusalem.

34:57.062 --> 35:03.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It is sort of a radical
politicized version
of a faith ideology. And for the
president

35:03.535 --> 35:09.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to say that, A, is not the
truth, but, B,
it reeks of a political
correctness which

35:09.174 --> 35:11.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ends up driving people to Donald
Trump.

35:11.843 --> 35:15.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think he should use the
term. Every
other world leader uses the
term. We can all

35:15.714 --> 35:21.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
distinguish between the few
terrorists who
are radical Islamists between --
and the tens

35:21.386 --> 35:25.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and hundreds of millions of
Muslims who are
peaceful, law-abiding, normal
human beings.

35:25.890 --> 35:28.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that,
Mark?

35:28.226 --> 35:30.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I disagree
with David.

35:30.362 --> 35:38.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the syllable is very
important. Radical
Islam is the defamation of a
faith, of a faith,

35:38.870 --> 35:42.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whereas radical Islamist, yes,
definitely,
or radical Islamism.

35:42.273 --> 35:50.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But that is a profound
difference. And when
you start slipping into
denigration of an

35:50.615 --> 35:58.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
entire faith, which obviously is
the position
that Donald Trump has been
comfortable with,

35:58.323 --> 36:03.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
an area where he's been
comfortable in, it
is not only not in the national
interest.

36:03.561 --> 36:06.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It is dishonest and it is
fomenting further
strife.

36:06.664 --> 36:09.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Or the president
called it
a political talking point, this
insistence

36:09.734 --> 36:11.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Trump's part that he use that
term.

36:11.569 --> 36:14.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. I am actually
not comfortable
with the phrase radical Islam in
part for

36:14.105 --> 36:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that reason. People who are
faithful to the
Muslim faith don't turn into
terrorists when

36:18.743 --> 36:19.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they become more faithful.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Exactly.

36:21.713 --> 36:25.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But there is sort
of ideology
sort of attached to Islam, as
there used to

36:25.717 --> 36:29.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be to Christianity, or as there
sometimes
still is to Christianity or
Judaism, which

36:29.220 --> 36:33.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a secular political ideology
that cloaks
itself in religious garb.

36:33.591 --> 36:38.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we could call it bin
Ladenism. You can
call it jihadism. But it is the
shaping ideology

36:38.663 --> 36:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that magnetizes people like this
and sets
them off on the killing sprees.

36:42.300 --> 36:45.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the things
that has
come out of this, very quickly,
is the move

36:45.203 --> 36:50.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Congress on the part of
Democrats, Mark,
to pass some kind of legislation
on gun control.

36:51.042 --> 36:54.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you see any possibility of a
change there?

36:54.479 --> 36:57.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think there is a
change in
mood. I don't think -- we're in
an election

36:57.715 --> 36:59.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
year. We're four months away
from an election.

36:59.584 --> 37:06.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think there is a good
development, Judy,
quite frankly, in the group
that's assembled

37:07.025 --> 37:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Stanley McChrystal and the
Veterans Coalition
For Common Sense, Mark Kelly, to
try and bring

37:15.567 --> 37:19.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
control, some sensible
background checks.
And I think there is where it's
going to have

37:19.871 --> 37:21.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to come from. I really do.

37:21.806 --> 37:26.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the Democrats have an
advantage. Make
no mistake about it. If you
don't fly, you

37:26.578 --> 37:33.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't buy, which is, I think, a
dangerous
position in a civil liberties
basis, because

37:33.284 --> 37:37.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump in charge of a
don't-fly list
is something that should sober
every American

37:37.956 --> 37:39.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
citizen in who he would put on
it.

37:40.058 --> 37:41.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you see it
going anywhere?

37:42.026 --> 37:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I don't, just
because past is
prologue. And after all the
different killings

37:46.364 --> 37:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have had, it hasn't gone
anywhere.

37:48.233 --> 37:51.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Susan Collins has an attempt at
some sort
of moderated -- the senator from
Maine -- some

37:51.970 --> 37:56.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of moderated list that she
hopes some
Republicans get, Democrats get
behind, but

37:56.574 --> 37:58.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the prospects in the House are
slim.

37:59.077 --> 38:03.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would say, you know, I
support all this
legislation, but I'm not sure it
would be

38:03.681 --> 38:10.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
super effective. This guy was
actually looked
into by the FBI. He actually had
checks. And

38:10.989 --> 38:13.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's just very tough to predict
human behavior.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Quickly.

38:14.959 --> 38:18.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, there is no
reason in
the United States for civilian
circulation

38:18.229 --> 38:24.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of assault weapons, none. It's
indefensible
as a product, shouldn't be
manufactured in

38:24.402 --> 38:26.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States, any more than
bazookas
should be or flamethrowers.

38:26.804 --> 38:30.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
both about Donald
Trump.

38:30.542 --> 38:37.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Political path ahead, David. He
was in -- having
a lot of tense words this week
with Republican

38:37.749 --> 38:43.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leadership with Congress, with
other Republicans
in his own party. His poll
ratings are slipping.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.756 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do you see?

38:44.856 --> 38:48.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I see mild to mass
panic in
the Republican Party, because he
really is

38:48.893 --> 38:51.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sliding. We have talked about it
before in
the last few weeks.

38:51.863 --> 38:57.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He was even with Hillary
Clinton, and in the
last three weeks, it's just been
zoom. He's

38:57.569 --> 39:01.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
collapsing. And he's picking
fights with the
Republicans. Any sense of buy-in
is now just

39:01.673 --> 39:04.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fraying. I don't know if they
are going to
do anything against him.

39:04.576 --> 39:09.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to me, the significance of
this week politically
was, would the country sort of
rally around

39:09.747 --> 39:16.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him on sort of xenophobic or
anti-terror mood?
And the answer so far from the
polling is,

39:16.421 --> 39:18.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no, he didn't get any help from
this week
politically.

39:19.090 --> 39:24.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, therefore, I think there is
a real hardening
against him among an awful lot
of Americans,

39:24.629 --> 39:28.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and his political prospects, at
least this
week, seem extremely dire.

39:28.233 --> 39:30.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you see?

39:30.168 --> 39:35.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, the stop
Trump movement,
which the death rattle sounded,
and then it

39:35.940 --> 39:40.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seems to come back again. The
old maxim in
politics, you don't beat
somebody with nobody.

39:40.712 --> 39:45.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is nobody. There is no
alternative.
Everybody wants an alternative
-- not everybody,

39:45.650 --> 39:49.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but probably a lot of
Republicans. Certainly,
those on the ballot in November
would like

39:49.220 --> 39:50.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have an alternative, but
there isn't.

39:51.055 --> 39:54.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You put a face on that, and
there is nobody
there. So he will be the
nominee. He's got

39:54.892 --> 39:57.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the strong argument: I have got
more votes
than anybody in the history of
Republican

39:57.895 --> 39:59.631 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
primaries.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, obviously, they are not
going to try
and take it away from him. But
I'm reminded

40:02.467 --> 40:06.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 1972, when Democrats tried to
stop George
McGovern, for the very same
reason. They thought

40:06.571 --> 40:08.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he was going to lose, and it
cost them seats.

40:08.473 --> 40:12.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last quick
points. Bernie Sanders
made a statement last night.
Let's listen

40:12.677 --> 40:15.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to it, a part of it quickly, and
then I want
to ask you about it.

40:15.313 --> 40:18.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
It is no secret that Secretary
Clinton and

40:18.850 --> 40:24.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have strong disagreements on
some very,
very important issues.

40:24.856 --> 40:31.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is also true that our views
are quite close
on others. I look forward in the
coming weeks

40:31.462 --> 40:38.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to continued discussion between
the two campaigns
to make certain that your voices
are heard

40:38.569 --> 40:45.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that the Democratic Party
passes the most
progressive platform in its
history and that

40:45.143 --> 40:49.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats actually fight for
that agenda.

40:49.514 --> 40:52.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do we make
of this, David?

40:52.717 --> 40:53.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:53.718 --> 40:54.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It's marriage
counseling.

40:54.152 --> 40:56.120 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:56.220 --> 40:59.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The Sanders and
Clinton people,
they're coming together. They
will come together.

40:59.123 --> 41:03.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has to happen in stages, so
healing can
happen. But I would be shocked
if the Democrats

41:03.961 --> 41:05.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weren't pretty united by the end
of the summer.

41:05.496 --> 41:06.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just by what he
said?

41:06.764 --> 41:07.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

41:08.099 --> 41:10.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: It's an
acknowledgment, not
a concession.

41:10.935 --> 41:15.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders is indispensable
to the Democrats
and their well-being in taking
back the Senate.

41:16.040 --> 41:20.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is the leader of a movement.
They need
him. He was a generational
candidate more

41:20.478 --> 41:25.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than an ideological candidate.
And voters
under the age of 45 are Bernie,
and Hillary

41:25.883 --> 41:31.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
needs them. And he needs her.
And it will
be -- will only be a shotgun
marriage, but

41:31.522 --> 41:34.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it might not be the -- but it
will be a marriage,
believe me.

41:34.692 --> 41:36.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we may be
watching this
at the convention.

41:36.661 --> 41:38.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Absolutely.

41:38.563 --> 41:40.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
David Brooks,
and you will both be there to
talk about it

41:40.932 --> 41:41.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
all.

41:41.833 --> 41:42.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Look forward to
it.

41:43.067 --> 41:45.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Happy Father's
Day to both
of you.

41:45.803 --> 41:49.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you.

41:49.874 --> 41:53.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Thank you.

41:53.945 --> 41:59.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even as the
country's attention
has been focused on Orlando for
much of the

41:59.617 --> 42:04.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
week, today marked the
anniversary of another
mass shooting, when nine people
were killed

42:04.822 --> 42:10.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Charleston, South Carolina,
at the Emanuel
AME Church, known as Mother
Emanuel.

42:10.795 --> 42:15.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We look back through the
thoughts and words
of two Charleston poets. They're
part of the

42:15.433 --> 42:18.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community that's been coping
with the tragedy
since then.

42:18.136 --> 42:25.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCUS AMAKER, Poet: That was a
crazy night.
My wife and I were watching the
news online,

42:25.910 --> 42:32.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we were watching everything
unfold. There
was a whole bunch of fear,
because the shooting

42:32.817 --> 42:35.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happened about five or six
blocks from our
house.

42:36.053 --> 42:38.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARJORY WENTWORTH, Poet Laureate
of South
Carolina: I felt like someone
had punched

42:38.389 --> 42:44.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me in the stomach. I physically
reacted. And
then I had to go to work. And I
work -- teach

42:44.796 --> 42:50.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a college two blocks from
Mother Emanuel.
And it was a crime scene. They
hadn't caught

42:50.668 --> 42:52.603 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the killer yet.

42:52.703 --> 42:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCUS AMAKER: My name is Marcus
Amaker. And
I'm a Web designer, graphic
designer, videographer,

42:57.208 --> 42:58.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
musician, and poet.

42:59.010 --> 43:03.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARJORY WENTWORTH: I'm Marjory
Wentworth.
I'm the poet laureate of South
Carolina.

43:03.147 --> 43:10.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Music of doves ascending. Yellow
crime tape
tied to the rod-iron fence
weaves through

43:10.221 --> 43:16.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bouquets of flowers and wreaths
made of white
ribbons like rivers of bright
pain flowing

43:16.961 --> 43:18.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through the hours.

43:18.796 --> 43:26.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARCUS AMAKER: Circadian
rhythms. At ground
zero of death, the voice of God
will sound

43:26.871 --> 43:30.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like an alarm clock waking you
up from a dream.

43:30.308 --> 43:36.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARJORY WENTWORTH: The arts
community in Charleston
has been folded into the healing
process.

43:36.180 --> 43:43.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was immediate. Poetry
is -- in a
time of crisis, it is a great
way to find

43:43.321 --> 43:47.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the language for something that
people don't
have. And they want that
language. People

43:47.158 --> 43:54.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crave some way of articulating
what they're
feeling. And that's what poetry
does, I think.

43:54.165 --> 43:59.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCUS AMAKER: I think that, for
a long time,
a lot of people my age,
especially, racism

43:59.437 --> 44:04.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not really this tangible
thing, but then,
when this happened at the
church, it really

44:04.709 --> 44:08.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
became the most real thing that
we have ever
experienced.

44:08.646 --> 44:14.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You open your eyes and see
yourself not as
a woman or a man, but as a
spirit who had

44:14.852 --> 44:17.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been breathing in an illusion.

44:17.154 --> 44:24.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARJORY WENTWORTH: I think, in
terms of the
larger issue in the city, the
state and the

44:24.729 --> 44:33.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, you know, the flag is
down as a result
of a horrific crime, but the
conditions that

44:33.170 --> 44:39.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exist around that, the sort of
social justice
issues based on race, have not
changed in

44:39.510 --> 44:41.479 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
our city.

44:41.579 --> 44:49.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One week later, the funeral
bells ring. Lines
of strangers still bring
offerings. Nine doves

44:49.120 --> 44:55.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tossed toward the sun. One week
later, the
funeral bells ring, while
churches in small

44:55.960 --> 45:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
towns are burning. Nine doves
tossed toward
the sun, because there are no
words to sing

45:03.668 --> 45:10.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while churches in small towns
are burning.
A blur of white wings ascends
like music.

45:10.841 --> 45:17.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARCUS AMAKER: I see an
awakening that's happened
in this city. I have been
awakened. It's not

45:17.715 --> 45:24.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like I didn't know that racism
was out there,
but to see it in this tangible,
real way so

45:24.221 --> 45:27.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
close to where I live was really
a big awakening.

45:27.725 --> 45:34.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, for me, it feels like the
time for small
talk is over. If we don't change
after this,

45:34.699 --> 45:36.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
then what is going to change us?

45:37.034 --> 45:43.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On June 18, the voice of God
sounded like
an alarm clock and woke us up
from a nightmare.

45:43.574 --> 45:50.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the day after a massacre,
when illusion
became reality, when darkness
was a dagger

45:50.848 --> 45:57.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in our hearts. From this day
forward, the
voice of God sounds like an
alarm clock waking

45:57.555 --> 46:04.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us up from a dream. Our eyes are
now open
to the restlessness of our souls
as we confront

46:04.795 --> 46:14.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the relentlessness of racism. I
will not rest
until we can sleep peacefully
again.

46:14.171 --> 46:33.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

46:33.791 --> 46:35.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

46:35.660 --> 46:40.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As this graduation season comes
to a close,
we took a closer look at the
advice given

46:40.531 --> 46:46.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by actors, politicians and
industry leaders
to college graduates around the
country.

46:46.337 --> 46:48.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here are some highlights:

46:48.239 --> 46:54.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J.K. SIMMONS, Actor: Take care
of yourself.
Eat your vegetables. Get some
exercise. Floss.

46:54.779 --> 46:56.547 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:56.647 --> 47:04.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J.K. SIMMONS: Use your turn
signal. I know
that has nothing to do with
taking care of

47:04.321 --> 47:05.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yourself. It's just a pet peeve
of mine.

47:05.156 --> 47:06.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:07.091 --> 47:11.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT DAMON, Actor: As the great
philosopher
Benjamin Affleck once said,
judge me by how

47:12.096 --> 47:17.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good my good ideas are, not by
how bad my
bad ideas are. You have got to
suit up in

47:17.568 --> 47:21.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your armor. You have got to get
ready to sound
like a total fool.

47:21.305 --> 47:25.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not having an answer isn't
embarrassing. It's
an opportunity. Don't be afraid
to ask questions.

47:25.943 --> 47:30.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, Facebook:
I hope that
you walk without pain and you
are grateful

47:30.114 --> 47:38.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for each step. And when the
challenges come,
I hope you remember that deep
within you is

47:38.789 --> 47:42.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ability to learn and grow.
You are not
born with a fixed amount of
resilience. It's

47:43.027 --> 47:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a muscle. You can build it up,
and then draw
on it when you need it.

47:49.166 --> 47:54.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Cynicism is so easy, and cynics
don't accomplish

47:54.138 --> 48:01.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much. As a friend of mine who
happens to be
from New Jersey, a guy named
Bruce Springsteen,

48:01.178 --> 48:03.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
once sang...

48:03.147 --> 48:05.116 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:05.216 --> 48:10.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: ... they spend
their lives waiting
for a moment that just don't
come. Don't let

48:10.955 --> 48:12.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that be you.

48:12.857 --> 48:16.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN SPIELBERG, Director: I
have imagined
many possible futures in my
films, but you

48:17.094 --> 48:23.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
will determine the actual
future. And I hope
that it's filled with justice
and peace.

48:23.334 --> 48:32.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, finally, I wish you all a
true Hollywood-style
happy ending. I hope you outrun
the T-rex,

48:32.676 --> 48:39.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
catch the criminal, and, for
your parents'
sake, maybe every now and then,
just like

48:39.650 --> 48:40.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
E.T., go home.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.453 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:42.553 --> 48:45.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA,
Lyricist/Actor: There
will be blind alleys and
one-night wonders

48:45.222 --> 48:51.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and soul-crushing jobs and
wakeup calls and
crises of confidence and moments
of transcendence

48:51.195 --> 48:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when you are walking down the
street and someone
will thank you for telling your
story because

48:55.566 --> 48:57.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it resonated with their own.

48:57.568 --> 49:03.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I feel so honored to be a
detail, a minor
character in the story of your
graduation

49:03.474 --> 49:10.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day. I feel so honored to bear
witness to
the beginning of your next
chapter. I'm painfully

49:10.347 --> 49:14.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aware of what's at stake. I
can't wait to
see how it turns out.

49:14.351 --> 49:16.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thank you, and congratulations
to the class
of 2016.

49:16.821 --> 49:18.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

49:18.656 --> 49:21.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All good advice.

49:21.225 --> 49:26.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we wanted to share just one
more. Chicago
area eighth grader Jack Aiello
mixed a large

49:26.997 --> 49:32.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
dose of humor into his
graduation address
last week. He delivered his
entire speech

49:32.369 --> 49:38.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
using impersonations of the
leading presidential
candidates and the current
commander in chief.

49:38.142 --> 49:39.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Take a look.

49:40.044 --> 49:44.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK AIELLO, Student: Hello. And
congratulations.
You are now getting to hear a
speech from

49:44.615 --> 49:45.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the magnificent Donald Trump.

49:45.850 --> 49:47.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:47.718 --> 49:51.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK AIELLO: And let me just
tell you that
Thomas has been such a great
school. Quite

49:51.922 --> 49:53.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
frankly, it's been fantastic.

49:53.357 --> 49:55.192 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:55.292 --> 49:58.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK AIELLO: Now, we did all the
regular sports
you would expect, like
basketball and soccer.

49:58.963 --> 50:05.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we also did some unique ones
too. So,
like, on rainy days, we would go
into the

50:05.769 --> 50:07.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
small gym and do yoga.

50:07.338 --> 50:09.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:09.173 --> 50:14.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK AIELLO: And I am proud to
say that I
have completely mastered the
downward dog.

50:14.445 --> 50:17.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

50:17.381 --> 50:23.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JACK AIELLO: Thank you,
President Obama.

50:23.254 --> 50:28.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would like to start off by
thanking the
great hardworking teachers of
Thomas Middle

50:28.325 --> 50:30.094 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
School.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

50:30.194 --> 50:32.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK AIELLO: They have been our
champions.
They have given us the skills we
need to get

50:32.763 --> 50:45.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through sixth grade and through
seventh grade
and through eighth grade. And
now we're going

50:45.743 --> 50:51.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take those skills and apply
them to high
school.

50:51.815 --> 50:53.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, finally, to conclude this
entire graduation
speech, I would just like to say
that the

50:53.684 --> 51:04.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bottom line is this. As far as
schools go,
TMS is in the top one-half of
one-half of

51:04.528 --> 51:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
1 percent of schools in the
entire country.

51:09.934 --> 51:13.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thank you all so much, and
congratulations
to the class of 2016!

51:13.504 --> 51:15.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
JUDY WOODRUFF: Young Jack
Aiello, I think
he's got a future.

51:16.073 --> 51:21.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: Did Lou
Gehrig actually have Lou
Gehrig's disease?

51:21.712 --> 51:28.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A team of scientists say it's
not clear. Repetitive
head injury can result in a
syndrome that

51:28.118 --> 51:29.954 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mimics ALS.

51:30.054 --> 51:34.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:34.725 --> 51:38.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And a reminder about some
upcoming programs
from our PBS colleagues.

51:38.162 --> 51:41.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week,"
which airs later this evening.

51:41.966 --> 51:42.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here's a preview.

51:42.666 --> 51:43.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Gwen?

51:43.334 --> 51:45.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Thanks, Judy.

51:45.369 --> 51:50.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last weekend's horrific shooting
in Orlando,
Florida, revived all sorts of
debates in Washington

51:50.908 --> 51:56.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and on the campaign trail. We
will wade into
the week's arguments about
terrorism, guns,

51:57.047 --> 52:02.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hate crimes, immigration and
what politicians
are willing to do about any of
it on the one-year

52:02.853 --> 52:08.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anniversary of the Charleston
church shooting.
That's tonight on "Washington
Week" -- Judy.

52:08.459 --> 52:11.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we look
forward to seeing
it.

52:11.195 --> 52:17.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On tomorrow's edition of "PBS
NewsHour Weekend":
a report from Jordan, inside the
growing economy

52:17.167 --> 52:20.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the world's largest Syrian
refugee camp.

52:21.005 --> 52:23.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

52:23.640 --> 52:38.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Have a great weekend. Thank you,
and good
night.
