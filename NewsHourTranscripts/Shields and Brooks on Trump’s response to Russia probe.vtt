00:01.400 --> 00:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to the
analysis of Shields and Brooks.

00:03.433 --> 00:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

00:05.500 --> 00:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, gentlemen, it's been
another tumultuous week,
on top of several others.

00:11.633 --> 00:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had the attorney general
of the United States testifying
before the Senate Intelligence

00:14.000 --> 00:16.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee.

00:16.066 --> 00:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we learned, I guess
in the last 48 hours, Mark,
that the investigation by the

00:19.933 --> 00:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
special counsel into the
Russia meddling in the election
has been expanded to include

00:26.433 --> 00:29.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
whether or not the
president committed
obstruction of justice.

00:29.133 --> 00:31.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is this a one-alarm
crisis, two-alarm?

00:31.500 --> 00:35.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are we making too
big a deal of this?

00:35.066 --> 00:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, based
on what the president
- - how the president's
reacting, Judy, I don't

00:39.033 --> 00:41.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think we're making
too big a deal of it.

00:41.100 --> 00:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the president, having
acted briefly presidential after
the tragedy of the shooting

00:47.833 --> 00:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Steve Scalise and the others
at the baseball field, has
reverted to form and gone back

00:55.300 --> 01:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to, as you reported at the
outset, now the man who told
me to fire the FBI director is

01:03.233 --> 01:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after me because -- is
investigating me because
of firing of the FBI
director, which is totally

01:10.166 --> 01:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contradictory to what the
president said to Lester Holt
on NBC, that the recommendation

01:16.266 --> 01:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Rod Rosenstein had nothing
to do with his decision to fire
James Comey as FBI director,

01:22.566 --> 01:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it was based solely on
Donald Trump's desire, as he
expressed to the Russians the

01:25.433 --> 01:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
next day in the Oval
Office, to get the Russian
investigation behind him.

01:32.466 --> 01:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I just think that he is
behaving like a man who really
wants to fire Robert Mueller

01:37.566 --> 01:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, you know, who didn't live
through October 20, 1973, when
President Nixon ordered Elliot

01:44.566 --> 01:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Richardson to fire Archibald
Cox and the independent counsel,
and he refused and resigned.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And William Rucklehaus,
his deputy, resigned.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we had a
constitutional crisis.

01:55.100 --> 01:56.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it led to
impeachment hearings.

01:56.966 --> 01:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president is
calling it a witch-hunt, David.

01:59.066 --> 02:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House is saying
he didn't -- isn't going to
fire the special counsel.

02:03.233 --> 02:04.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it isn't clear.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There have been
reports out about that.

02:06.433 --> 02:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, it
may be a witch-hunt, but
he's acting like a witch.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:10.766 --> 02:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: To me, we have
had this -- the idea that there
has been collusion between

02:13.733 --> 02:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Russians and the
Trump campaign has been
investigated for a long time.

02:18.733 --> 02:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so far, we have had no
really serious evidence that
they did collude, and everything

02:23.300 --> 02:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
else seems to be leaking out.

02:25.366 --> 02:28.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I begin to be a
little suspicious -- and
maybe I'm wrong -- we
will see over the long

02:28.366 --> 02:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
term -- whether there was
any actual act of collusion.

02:30.966 --> 02:34.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There were certainly
conversations maybe
about some building and
some investment, but so

02:34.966 --> 02:37.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
far, no evidence of
an underlying crime.

02:37.333 --> 02:38.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But this, to me, is
not a criminal story.

02:38.866 --> 02:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is a psychological story.

02:40.933 --> 02:45.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's a story about
a president who seems to
be under more pressure,
under more threat,

02:45.300 --> 02:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lashing out in ways that are
painfully self-destructive,
but also extremely
disturbing to anybody around

02:51.600 --> 02:53.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

02:53.700 --> 02:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so whether it's the North
Korean Cabinet hearing that
he held recently, where they

02:56.100 --> 03:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all had to praise him, or the
tweets as late as this morning,
this is not a president who

03:01.966 --> 03:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is projecting mental stability.

03:04.500 --> 03:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the idea that he will
fire somebody, whether
it's Mueller or anybody
else, seems very plausible.

03:10.733 --> 03:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, to me, if there is
something really damaging here,
it's something that has not

03:12.833 --> 03:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yet happened caused by
the psychological pressure
that he apparently feels.

03:16.866 --> 03:18.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is.

03:18.933 --> 03:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People are referring, are
reflecting back, Mark, to the
Whitewater investigation, the

03:22.766 --> 03:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Watergate investigation, that
what happened after the original
alleged crime made whatever

03:30.400 --> 03:32.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happened in the first
place much worse.

03:32.633 --> 03:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, the two
iron rules of Washington
scandals, Judy, is, it's never

03:37.566 --> 03:39.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the act itself.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Rule one, it's
always the cover-up.

03:41.266 --> 03:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And rule two is, everybody
always forgets rule one.

03:44.066 --> 03:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's -- but I think we
have got -- I'm not ready for
the clean bill of health yet.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got the transition to
go through and The New York
Times' Matt Apuzzo and Michael

03:54.866 --> 03:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Schmidt's story this week that
suggested that Robert Mueller
was looking at money laundering,

04:01.933 --> 04:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that this would have been the
way, through the Russians, that
had been -- the beneficiaries

04:05.400 --> 04:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had received their payments
through offshore banks.

04:09.533 --> 04:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This kind of opened up a
new avenue that's reported
in The New York Times.

04:16.500 --> 04:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I just think that,
Judy, the abject lack, absence
of curiosity on the part of

04:23.333 --> 04:28.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the president in his
nine conversations with
the FBI correct or any
other -- anybody else,

04:30.866 --> 04:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and with the attorney
general before the Senate
Intelligence Committee,
abject lack of curiosity

04:35.266 --> 04:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in how the Russians did it.

04:37.733 --> 04:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you would come in
and you say 17 intelligence
agencies have concluded
the Russians tried

04:42.866 --> 04:46.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to sabotage the American
electoral process, and
there's not a single
question about, what

04:48.400 --> 04:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did they do, how did they
do it, how can we avoid it,
what can we do in the future?

04:51.900 --> 04:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Geez, no, let's go, let's
find the three million
people who were illegally
voting in California

04:57.366 --> 04:58.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
instead.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We will appoint a
commission for that.

05:00.766 --> 05:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean, Mark
does have a point, David, that
when the attorney general was

05:02.900 --> 05:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asked about the -- a number
of things, one of the things
he said was that he had not

05:06.633 --> 05:09.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been briefed at all on
the Russia meddling.

05:09.066 --> 05:10.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's in part why
it's a psychological issue.

05:12.666 --> 05:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every contact we know where
Donald Trump had conversations
about the Russia thing, he saw

05:17.033 --> 05:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through the prism of his
own victory and would he
get credit for the victory.

05:21.766 --> 05:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's perfectly plausible for
a normal human being to think,
well, I won the presidency,

05:25.533 --> 05:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but the Russians also did
seriously endanger interests,
the American political system,

05:30.166 --> 05:32.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and, therefore, I'm
going to go after that.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so he -- but he's incapable
of seeing that second part.

05:35.200 --> 05:38.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's just, am I getting
full credit for what
I think I achieved?

05:38.200 --> 05:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's the intellectual
insecurity that I think
is overshadowing all else.

05:42.466 --> 05:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that, by definition, can
spill -- this is why it's a
little different than Whitewater

05:46.633 --> 05:48.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Watergate.

05:48.633 --> 05:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nixon has his own psychological
complexities, but he was
someone who acted at least maybe

05:52.166 --> 05:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Machiavellian ways, but in
straightforward, linear ways.

05:54.933 --> 05:57.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, certainly, that
was true of Clinton.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
With this team, no.

05:59.500 --> 06:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the second thing to
be said is, Clinton had very
competent people around him, and

06:04.933 --> 06:05.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so did Richard Nixon.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not the case here.

06:08.033 --> 06:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you talked to the people
in the Clinton White House, it
was hell to be in that White

06:11.333 --> 06:13.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
House.

06:13.466 --> 06:15.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They tried to build
these Chinese walls, so
they could do their jobs
while the investigation

06:15.000 --> 06:17.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was going on, and it was
super tough for them.

06:17.100 --> 06:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I imagine, especially when you
have got tweetstorms coming out,
it's near impossible to do your

06:23.500 --> 06:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
job right now in any corner
of the Trump administration.

06:24.933 --> 06:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tweetstorms
from the president.

06:26.166 --> 06:27.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Just two
quick points, Judy.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is, Richard
Nixon was no Donald Trump.

06:30.233 --> 06:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, Richard Nixon had
served four years in the United
States Navy as an officer, 14

06:34.566 --> 06:38.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
years in the House and
the Senate, eight years
as vice president, and
was a constant reader

06:38.766 --> 06:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of history and biography, may
have been the best-prepared
president in terms of experience

06:43.733 --> 06:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the history of the
nation, and has a record
of achievement that --
amply documented character

06:51.533 --> 06:56.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
defects and criminal
activity, but a historic
record of achievement,
whether it's OSHA or

06:57.266 --> 06:59.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EPA or whatever else.

06:59.333 --> 07:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The two things that David's
mentioned, of that Cabinet
meeting, it was the most awkward

07:03.466 --> 07:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
event I have seen in 50 years.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is when
he went around the table and
asked each Cabinet member...

07:07.733 --> 07:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: To tell how
wonderful you were, not what I
did -- not only what I did on my

07:11.466 --> 07:14.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vacation, but how
wonderful you are.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there wasn't a single
member of that Cabinet,
with the exception of
Jim Mattis, the secretary

07:17.666 --> 07:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of defense, who escaped with
his or her self-respect intact.

07:21.300 --> 07:24.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, it was:
You're wonderful.

07:24.466 --> 07:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They love you in Mississippi.

07:25.633 --> 07:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're doing a great job.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everybody's better.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The economy is better.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everything is terrific.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, this was just
-- this was scary.

07:32.500 --> 07:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the final thing was,
yesterday, he goes after Hillary
Clinton again, crooked Hillary.

07:37.466 --> 07:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, he's trying to
rerun that 2016 election.

07:40.633 --> 07:45.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, all
this takes place, David,
in a week when, as you
both have mentioned,

07:45.300 --> 07:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the shooting happened.

07:47.800 --> 07:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans are practicing
for their annual
baseball game against the
Democrats in Congress,

07:53.500 --> 07:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and this man comes into
town from Illinois.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He ends up being killed,
grievously wounds
Congressman Steve Scalise,
still in the hospital

08:01.700 --> 08:03.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in critical condition.

08:03.166 --> 08:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
After this, we see a coming
together of the parties.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I wanted to show a picture.

08:08.533 --> 08:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is from the baseball game
last night, where you had --
or two nights ago -- where

08:11.900 --> 08:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you had the four leaders of
Congress there for once -- I
don't think we have ever seen

08:16.500 --> 08:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a picture like this -- coming
together looking like they at
least can tolerate each other.

08:23.266 --> 08:25.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

08:25.233 --> 08:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the thing that's symptomatic
of me -- for me is, I used
to think polarization was a

08:27.866 --> 08:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington phenomenon, that
the people on Capitol Hill
were polarized, but the country

08:31.600 --> 08:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was sort of still
a moderate nation.

08:33.833 --> 08:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think there is little
evidence to support that now.

08:36.066 --> 08:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a polarized country.

08:38.600 --> 08:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And most of the politicians
I know, members of Congress,
hate the system they're in.

08:42.333 --> 08:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're stuck in a much
more polarized world than
they wish they were in.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's out of the country.

08:47.133 --> 08:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that doesn't say the
shooter is any way symptomatic.

08:49.100 --> 08:51.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If anything, he's
an atypical nutcase.

08:51.966 --> 08:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it is a sign on the fringes.

08:54.266 --> 08:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have seen a ratcheting
up of violence.

08:55.766 --> 08:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We saw it, I thought, at the
conventions on both sides.

08:58.133 --> 09:01.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We saw it at the Trump
rallies on both sides.

09:01.066 --> 09:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the people on the fringes
of society, we have just
seen a ratcheting up in their

09:04.833 --> 09:08.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
feeling of justification
that they can resort
to violent means.

09:08.100 --> 09:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this guy apparently
had a list of people,
according to what's being
reported this afternoon,

09:12.966 --> 09:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of people he wanted to shoot.

09:15.533 --> 09:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's weaponizing
mentally disordered people
through the process of
political extremism.

09:22.900 --> 09:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is this
coming together at all, Mark?

09:26.833 --> 09:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you see any enduring --
any endurance of that, or is
that just -- is it just going

09:31.366 --> 09:33.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be a blip?

09:33.900 --> 09:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: You hope,
Judy, but to David's
point, both parties --
according to Pew Research,

09:39.333 --> 09:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in both parties, what drives
the most activist wing is not
support and energy and advocacy

09:44.633 --> 09:45.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of their own side.

09:45.833 --> 09:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's loathing of the other side.

09:47.933 --> 09:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the gauge as to whether
you're going to be politically
involved, you're going to

09:50.433 --> 09:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote, and whether you're going
to contribute, how much do you
loathe the other party, how

09:54.566 --> 09:56.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
much do you hate them.

09:56.666 --> 10:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there was a time, I will
be very blunt, when I came to
Washington, when the legitimacy

10:01.400 --> 10:02.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of your opponent was
never questioned.

10:02.966 --> 10:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You questioned their judgment.

10:04.966 --> 10:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You questioned their opinions
or their arguments, but
you never their legitimacy.

10:06.633 --> 10:10.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that changed.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it changed.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And one of the reasons
it changed is that a
man was elected from
the state of Georgia

10:17.733 --> 10:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who ran on the book, and the
book was, you use these words.

10:21.366 --> 10:23.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You use sick.

10:23.366 --> 10:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You refer pathetic, traitor,
liar, corrupt, shame,
enemy of normal Americans.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was Newt Gingrich's bible.

10:31.833 --> 10:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't an idea of a policy.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It wasn't a program.

10:35.066 --> 10:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He used it and he
became successful.

10:37.033 --> 10:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He became speaker of the House.

10:38.633 --> 10:41.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Donald Trump is a
clone of Newt Gingrich.

10:41.700 --> 10:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump used, Donald Trump,
lying Ted, and lightweight
Bobby Jindal, and Mitt Romney

10:49.233 --> 10:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
choked like a dog, and
used that language.

10:52.900 --> 10:54.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And you're right.

10:54.933 --> 10:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The left has used similar
language and there has been a
response and almost a premium on

10:59.100 --> 11:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going after Trump in the
same sort of language.

11:01.733 --> 11:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But there's been no punishment.

11:04.133 --> 11:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no political
downside for this tactic.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 45 seconds.

11:08.666 --> 11:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is one side more
responsible than another?

11:10.666 --> 11:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And are we going to
see any of this coming
together last, or is it...

11:15.200 --> 11:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, to me,
in 1970, people were asked,
would you mind it if your son

11:19.533 --> 11:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or daughter married someone
of the opposing party?

11:21.833 --> 11:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And 5 percent would mind.

11:23.900 --> 11:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now 40 percent mind, because
people think your political
affiliation is a sign of your

11:27.733 --> 11:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
worth, your values,
your philosophy, your
culture, your lifestyle.

11:30.133 --> 11:32.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's everything.

11:32.233 --> 11:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of a sudden, we have been
reduced to politics and we have
made politics into the ultimate

11:35.700 --> 11:37.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
source of our souls.

11:37.233 --> 11:38.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's -- it's
just -- that's not
what it should bearing.

11:38.966 --> 11:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just about arguments
about tax rates.

11:41.366 --> 11:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not everything.

11:42.866 --> 11:44.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS:
That's a good point.

11:44.833 --> 11:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks,
Mark Shields, thank you both.

11:46.966 --> 11:47.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you.
