WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It
was North Korea's own
version of fireworks
for the Fourth of July.

00:04.300 --> 00:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The communist state today fired
off a new missile that may
someday put the United States

00:09.266 --> 00:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
within range of its weapons.

00:11.233 --> 00:13.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nick Schifrin
begins our coverage.

00:13.166 --> 00:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: On this July
4, North Korea declared
independence from what it called

00:18.966 --> 00:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
American nuclear threats.

00:21.033 --> 00:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
The scientists and technicians
have successfully test-fired

00:25.266 --> 00:28.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the newly developed
intercontinental
ballistic missile.

00:28.100 --> 00:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In Pyongyang,
North Koreans celebrated what
appears to be its most advanced

00:32.133 --> 00:35.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
test in its long pursuit
of a nuclear weapon.

00:35.533 --> 00:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The missile flew for about 40
minutes, almost straight up,
reaching an altitude of more

00:39.400 --> 00:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than 1,500 miles, and came
straight down 580 miles
away in the Sea of Japan.

00:46.466 --> 00:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On a flatter trajectory, it's
estimated the missile could
have traveled as far as 4,000

00:48.700 --> 00:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
miles, past Anchorage, Alaska,
says scientist David Wright.

00:51.700 --> 00:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WRIGHT, Co-Director
of Global Security,
Union Of Concerned
Scientists: If they shoot

00:53.800 --> 00:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it essentially straight up in
the air, it goes very, very
high and comes down not very

00:56.533 --> 00:58.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
far away.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they then flatten it out a
little bit, it uses all that
speed to go a much longer

01:01.666 --> 01:03.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
distance.

01:03.766 --> 01:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But the test
doesn't mean North Korea can
deliver a nuclear weapon.

01:06.433 --> 01:10.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's not known whether
it's mastered required
miniaturization or
guidance and separation

01:10.500 --> 01:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
systems that can take
years to develop.

01:12.500 --> 01:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WRIGHT: As you go to
longer and longer ranges, there
are just much higher stresses,

01:17.066 --> 01:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vibrations, the acceleration,
so there are a lot of forces
on this nuclear warhead.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't know if they have
actually done the final steps to
have a warhead that they could

01:28.666 --> 01:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually put into one of these
long-range missiles and have
it work the way it's supposed

01:32.433 --> 01:34.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: As
president-elect, Donald
Trump vowed not to
let today's event ever

01:37.033 --> 01:39.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happen.

01:39.166 --> 01:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As president, he tried to push
China to pressure North Korea,
but he recently admitted that

01:42.333 --> 01:44.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
failed.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, he addressed North Korean
leader Kim Jong-un, tweeting:
"Does this guy have anything

01:47.533 --> 01:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
better to do with his life?

01:49.600 --> 01:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Perhaps China will put a heavy
move on North Korea and end
this nonsense once and for all."

01:55.833 --> 01:58.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, today, China didn't
show willingness to
apply more pressure.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GENG SHUANG, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesperson
(through translator):
We hope all sides can

02:00.566 --> 02:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
remain calm and exercise
restraint, ease the tense
situation on the peninsula.

02:04.700 --> 02:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And, in Moscow,
Chinese and Russian Presidents
Xi Jinping and Vladimir

02:08.700 --> 02:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin jointly called for the
U.S. and North Korea to abandon
long-held positions in order

02:14.433 --> 02:16.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to calm the peninsula.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
We agreed to actively promote

02:18.900 --> 02:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parallel freezing of
nuclear missile activities
of North Korea and
large-scale joint military

02:24.000 --> 02:26.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
drills of the U.S.
and South Korea.

02:26.033 --> 02:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: North Korea has
exploited the July 4 holiday
before, in 2006 and 2009.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But this is their most
dramatic test, and their
momentum is increasing.

02:35.633 --> 02:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have now launched more
missiles in the last three years
than in the last three decades.

02:39.800 --> 02:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WRIGHT: I don't see a
roadblock to them being able
to continue this process until

02:46.833 --> 02:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they got a missile that
really had the ability to
reach the lower 48 states.

02:52.266 --> 02:54.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think it's just a
matter of time until
they reach that point.

02:54.933 --> 02:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Nick Schifrin.

02:57.633 --> 03:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We will look
at the implications of the North
Korean test right after the news

03:01.500 --> 03:01.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.
