00:10.377 --> 00:11.245
>> Sreenivasan: ON THIS EDITION

00:11.245 --> 00:13.380
FOR SATURDAY, OCTOBER 18:

00:13.380 --> 00:15.148
THE PRESIDENT APPEALS FOR CALM

00:15.148 --> 00:17.551
IN THE FACE OF THE EBOLA SCARE.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.419
GAS PRICES PLUNGE-- WE'LL TALK

00:19.419 --> 00:20.687
TO AN EXPERT ABOUT HOW LOW THEY

00:20.687 --> 00:21.788
COULD GO.

00:21.788 --> 00:23.457
AND IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT,

00:23.457 --> 00:25.292
TRYING TO BRING NEW JOBS TO COAL

00:25.292 --> 00:27.127
MINING COMMUNITIES 50 YEARS

00:27.127 --> 00:28.996
AFTER L.B.J. LAUNCHED THE WAR ON

00:28.996 --> 00:29.897
POVERTY.

00:29.897 --> 00:32.466
NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.735
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS IN

00:34.735 --> 00:36.270
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:36.270 --> 00:37.971
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:37.971 --> 00:38.705
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING.

00:38.705 --> 00:39.506
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:39.506 --> 00:41.074
DURING HIS WEEKLY RADIO ADDRESS,

00:41.074 --> 00:42.142
PRESIDENT OBAMA OFFERED

00:42.142 --> 00:44.544
REASSURANCES THAT EBOLA DOES NOT

00:44.544 --> 00:46.179
POSE A MAJOR THREAT TO THE

00:46.179 --> 00:48.015
UNITED STATES.

00:48.015 --> 00:49.283
>> WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS NOT

00:49.283 --> 00:51.652
AN OUTBREAK OR AN EPIDEMIC OF

00:51.652 --> 00:53.754
EBOLA IN AMERICA.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.555
WE'RE A NATION OF MORE THAN 300

00:55.555 --> 00:57.257
MILLION PEOPLE.

00:57.257 --> 00:59.159
TO DATE, WE'VE SEEN THREE CASES

00:59.159 --> 01:01.228
OF EBOLA DIAGNOSED HERE.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.129
WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS IN

01:02.129 --> 01:03.397
PERSPECTIVE.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.598
AS OUR PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS

01:04.598 --> 01:06.566
POINT OUT, EVERY YEAR, THOUSANDS

01:06.566 --> 01:08.535
OF AMERICANS DIE FROM THE FLU.

01:08.535 --> 01:09.803
>> Sreenivasan: THE PRESIDENT

01:09.803 --> 01:11.204
ALSO ANSWERED CRITICS WHO HAVE

01:11.204 --> 01:13.040
DEMANDED THAT HE CUT OFF ALL

01:13.040 --> 01:14.741
TRAVEL BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES

01:14.741 --> 01:16.543
AND THE WEST AFRICAN NATIONS,

01:16.543 --> 01:17.778
WHERE THE DISEASE HAS ALREADY

01:17.778 --> 01:20.948
CLAIMED AT LEAST 4,000 LIVES.

01:20.948 --> 01:21.982
>> TRYING TO SEAL OFF AN ENTIRE

01:21.982 --> 01:23.450
REGION OF THE WORLD, IF THAT

01:23.450 --> 01:24.985
WERE EVEN POSSIBLE, COULD

01:24.985 --> 01:26.153
ACTUALLY MAKE THE SITUATION

01:26.153 --> 01:27.154
WORSE.

01:27.154 --> 01:28.422
IT WOULD MAKE IT HARDER TO MOVE

01:28.422 --> 01:29.923
HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND SUPPLIES

01:29.923 --> 01:31.258
BACK AND FORTH.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.993
EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT IT COULD

01:32.993 --> 01:33.894
ALSO CAUSE PEOPLE IN THE

01:33.894 --> 01:35.862
AFFECTED REGION TO CHANGE THEIR

01:35.862 --> 01:38.432
TRAVEL, TO EVADE SCREENING AND

01:38.432 --> 01:40.233
MAKE THE DISEASE EVEN HARDER TO

01:40.233 --> 01:41.001
TRACK.

01:41.001 --> 01:41.802
>> Sreenivasan: THE U.S.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.136
GOVERNMENT WILL TEMPORARILY STOP

01:43.136 --> 01:44.571
FUNDING RESEARCH THAT COULD MAKE

01:44.571 --> 01:45.739
THREE HIGHLY-INFECTIOUS

01:45.739 --> 01:47.307
DISEASES-- MERS, SARS AND

01:47.307 --> 01:48.642
INFLUENZA-- EVEN MORE

01:48.642 --> 01:49.509
CONTAGIOUS.

01:49.509 --> 01:50.844
SOME SCIENTISTS ARGUE THE

01:50.844 --> 01:52.179
RESEARCH IS VALUABLE BECAUSE IT

01:52.179 --> 01:53.280
COULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:53.280 --> 01:55.248
VACCINES IF THE DISEASES

01:55.248 --> 01:56.717
MUTATE NATURALLY.

01:56.717 --> 01:57.951
BUT CRITICS WARN THAT THE

01:57.951 --> 01:59.252
RESEARCH COULD BE USED BY

01:59.252 --> 02:01.054
TERRORISTS OR OTHERS DETERMINED

02:01.054 --> 02:02.589
TO START A PANDEMIC.

02:02.589 --> 02:04.191
NONE OF THIS INVOLVES WORK ON

02:04.191 --> 02:05.859
EBOLA RESEARCH.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.227
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

02:07.227 --> 02:09.062
HAS UPHELD A LAW REQUIRING TEXAS

02:09.062 --> 02:10.764
VOTERS TO PRESENT PHOTO I.D.

02:10.764 --> 02:11.999
WHEN THEY GO TO THE POLLS NEXT

02:11.999 --> 02:12.966
MONTH.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.167
THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND

02:14.167 --> 02:15.469
CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS HAD SOUGHT

02:15.469 --> 02:17.604
TO HAVE THE LAW OVERTURNED.

02:17.604 --> 02:19.373
THE SIX JUSTICES WHO UPHELD THE

02:19.373 --> 02:21.441
TEXAS LAW OFFERED NO RATIONALE

02:21.441 --> 02:22.275
FOR THEIR DECISION.

02:22.275 --> 02:24.378
BUT A SIX-PAGE DISSENT, WRITTEN

02:24.378 --> 02:26.213
BY JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG

02:26.213 --> 02:28.148
AND SUPPORTED BY JUSTICES KAGAN

02:28.148 --> 02:29.883
AND SOTOMAYOR, SAID THE RULING

02:29.883 --> 02:32.552
COULD KEEP AS MANY AS 600,000

02:32.552 --> 02:34.521
TEXANS FROM VOTING, MOST OF THEM

02:34.521 --> 02:36.590
AFRICAN-AMERICAN OR HISPANIC.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.758
A LAWYER FOR THE STATE OF TEXAS

02:37.758 --> 02:38.925
HAS CALLED THOSE ESTIMATES

02:38.925 --> 02:40.060
"PREPOSTEROUS."

02:40.060 --> 02:41.628
EARLY VOTING IN TEXAS BEGINS

02:41.628 --> 02:43.230
MONDAY.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.531
THE WHITE POLICE OFFICER WHO

02:44.531 --> 02:46.033
KILLED AN UNARMED BLACK TEEN IN

02:46.033 --> 02:47.834
FERGUSON, MISSOURI, LAST AUGUST

02:47.834 --> 02:49.669
HAS TOLD INVESTIGATORS HE WAS

02:49.669 --> 02:51.638
PINNED IN HIS VEHICLE BY MICHAEL

02:51.638 --> 02:53.707
BROWN AND FEARED FOR HIS LIFE.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.475
OFFICER DARREN WILSON ALSO SAID

02:55.475 --> 02:57.244
BROWN REACHED FOR HIS GUN DURING

02:57.244 --> 02:58.845
THE SCUFFLE AND THAT THE GUN WAS

02:58.845 --> 03:01.348
FIRED TWICE INSIDE THE CAR.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.150
FORENSIC TESTS SHOWED BROWN'S

03:03.150 --> 03:04.885
BLOOD ON THE GUN, ON THE

03:04.885 --> 03:06.686
INTERIOR DOOR PANEL OF THE

03:06.686 --> 03:08.755
POLICE CAR AND ON WILSON'S

03:08.755 --> 03:09.756
UNIFORM.

03:09.756 --> 03:10.924
ALL THIS ACCORDING TO AN

03:10.924 --> 03:12.259
ARTICLE IN TODAY'S "NEW YORK

03:12.259 --> 03:13.126
TIMES."

03:13.126 --> 03:14.027
A MISSOURI GRAND JURY IS

03:14.027 --> 03:15.195
CONSIDERING BRINGING CRIMINAL

03:15.195 --> 03:16.630
CHARGES AGAINST WILSON.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.698
HE SHOT BROWN SEVERAL TIMES

03:18.698 --> 03:20.500
OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.601
THERE'S BEEN A SIGHTING OF THE

03:21.601 --> 03:23.303
SURVIVALIST ACCUSED OF KILLING

03:23.303 --> 03:25.038
ONE STATE TROOPER AND WOUNDING

03:25.038 --> 03:26.807
ANOTHER IN PENNSYLVANIA.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.175
31-YEAR-OLD ERIC FREIN

03:28.175 --> 03:29.409
REPORTEDLY WAS SPOTTED CARRYING

03:29.409 --> 03:31.645
A RIFLE NEAR A HIGH SCHOOL LAST

03:31.645 --> 03:32.212
NIGHT.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.747
FREIN HAS ELUDED POLICE FOR A

03:33.747 --> 03:35.682
MONTH, DESPITE AN EXTENSIVE

03:35.682 --> 03:36.550
MANHUNT.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.984
INVESTIGATORS ALSO ARE EXAMINING

03:37.984 --> 03:39.953
BLOOD FOUND ON THE BACK PORCHES

03:39.953 --> 03:42.556
OF SEVERAL HOMES IN THE AREA.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.657
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN BERMUDA

03:43.657 --> 03:45.292
ARE WITHOUT POWER TODAY AFTER

03:45.292 --> 03:46.893
HURRICANE GONZALO SWEPT ACROSS

03:46.893 --> 03:48.628
THE ISLAND LAST NIGHT, DOWNING

03:48.628 --> 03:50.664
TREES AND BLOCKING ROADWAYS.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.132
IT'S THE SECOND POWERFUL STORM

03:52.132 --> 03:53.767
TO STRIKE BERMUDA IN LESS THAN A

03:53.767 --> 03:54.534
WEEK.

03:54.534 --> 03:55.869
POLICE HAVE REPORTED NO DEATHS

03:55.869 --> 03:58.171
OR SERIOUS INJURIES.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.706
OVERSEAS TODAY, CATHOLIC BISHOPS

03:59.706 --> 04:00.774
MEETING IN VATICAN CITY

04:00.774 --> 04:02.142
CONCLUDED THEIR TWO-WEEK SYNOD

04:02.142 --> 04:03.410
WITHOUT APPROVING A MEASURE

04:03.410 --> 04:04.911
SOUGHT BY THE POPE THAT WOULD

04:04.911 --> 04:06.413
HAVE WELCOMED GAYS INTO THE

04:06.413 --> 04:07.280
CHURCH.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.982
ANOTHER LIBERALIZATION MEASURE,

04:08.982 --> 04:10.717
ALLOWING DIVORCED AND CIVILLY

04:10.717 --> 04:12.619
REMARRIED CATHOLICS TO RECEIVE

04:12.619 --> 04:15.055
COMMUNION, ALSO WAS DEFEATED.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.289
A DRAFT AGREEMENT SHOWING

04:16.289 --> 04:18.291
UNPRECEDENTED OPENNESS TOWARD

04:18.291 --> 04:20.427
GAYS AND CO-HABITATING UNMARRIED

04:20.427 --> 04:22.429
CATHOLICS RECEIVED WIDESPREAD

04:22.429 --> 04:24.197
COVERAGE, BUT IT WAS WATERED

04:24.197 --> 04:25.532
DOWN THROUGHOUT THE WEEK.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.167
AND THE WATERED-DOWN VERSION WAS

04:27.167 --> 04:29.202
ULTIMATELY REJECTED.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.704
AND FACEBOOK IS DEMANDING THAT

04:30.704 --> 04:31.705
THE U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT

04:31.705 --> 04:33.140
ADMINISTRATION STOP USING FAKE

04:33.140 --> 04:34.574
PROFILE PAGES TO TRY TO HUNT

04:34.574 --> 04:35.609
DOWN SUSPECTS.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.643
IN A LETTER MADE PUBLIC

04:36.643 --> 04:37.911
YESTERDAY, FACEBOOK'S CHIEF

04:37.911 --> 04:39.579
SECURITY OFFICER SAID LAW

04:39.579 --> 04:40.947
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS HAVE TO

04:40.947 --> 04:42.349
FOLLOW THE SAME RULES AS

04:42.349 --> 04:44.184
EVERYONE ELSE AND NOT LIE ABOUT

04:44.184 --> 04:45.352
THEIR IDENTITY.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.520
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS SAY

04:46.520 --> 04:48.688
THEY ARE REVIEWING THE PRACTICE.

04:58.565 --> 04:59.466
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW, MORE OF

04:59.466 --> 05:01.301
OUR CONTINUING SERIES, "THE WAR

05:01.301 --> 05:03.003
ON ISIS," DETAILED ANALYSIS OF

05:03.003 --> 05:04.237
THE ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS TO

05:04.237 --> 05:05.705
HALT THE ADVANCE BY ISLAMIC

05:05.705 --> 05:07.040
EXTREMISTS WHO HAVE CAPTURED

05:07.040 --> 05:08.875
LARGE PORTIONS OF SYRIA AND

05:08.875 --> 05:09.609
IRAQ.

05:09.609 --> 05:10.410
FOR THE LATEST, WE ARE JOINED

05:10.410 --> 05:11.645
ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT FROM

05:11.645 --> 05:13.079
WASHINGTON BY DOUGLAS OLLIVANT.

05:13.079 --> 05:14.114
HE SERVED WITH THE NATIONAL

05:14.114 --> 05:15.382
SECURITY COUNCIL UNDER PRESIDENT

05:15.382 --> 05:17.083
BUSH AND PRESIDENT OBAMA AND IS

05:17.083 --> 05:18.051
NOW A PARTNER WITH MANTID

05:18.051 --> 05:19.119
INTERNATIONAL.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.487
SO, THE IRAQI PARLIAMENT TODAY

05:20.487 --> 05:21.655
APPROVED NOMINEES FOR THE

05:21.655 --> 05:23.690
INTERIOR AND DEFENSE MINISTRY

05:23.690 --> 05:24.357
POSITIONS.

05:24.357 --> 05:25.992
SO, WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF

05:25.992 --> 05:27.494
THAT AND WHAT CAN BE DONE NOW

05:27.494 --> 05:29.930
THAT THEY ARE IN PLACE?

05:29.930 --> 05:30.931
>> WELL, IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.032
WE'VE NOT HAD A

05:32.032 --> 05:33.533
PARLIAMENTARY-APPROVED MINISTER

05:33.533 --> 05:34.634
OF DEFENSE OR MINISTER OF

05:34.634 --> 05:37.103
INTERIOR SINCE 2010.

05:37.103 --> 05:38.405
SO, TO HAVE THE SUNNI MINISTER

05:38.405 --> 05:40.273
OF DEFENSE AND SHI'A MINISTER OF

05:40.273 --> 05:42.142
INTERIOR IS VERY IMPORTANT

05:42.142 --> 05:43.743
MOVING FORWARD.

05:43.743 --> 05:45.145
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TALKED ABOUT

05:45.145 --> 05:46.746
GETTING AN INCLUSIVE GOVERNMENT,

05:46.746 --> 05:48.315
AND THE HARDEST PART OF THAT WAS

05:48.315 --> 05:49.649
THE SECURITY MINISTRY.

05:49.649 --> 05:51.718
SO, NOW THAT WE HAVE A

05:51.718 --> 05:53.353
PARLIAMENTARY-APPROVED MINISTER

05:53.353 --> 05:54.287
OF DEFENSE AND MINISTER OF

05:54.287 --> 05:56.122
INTERIOR, WE HAVE YET ANOTHER

05:56.122 --> 05:58.024
STEP TO GO FORWARD ON REALLY

05:58.024 --> 05:59.693
COORDINATING THE RESPONSE TO THE

05:59.693 --> 06:01.861
ISLAMIC STATE IN IRAQ.

06:01.861 --> 06:02.696
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY, WE'VE BEEN

06:02.696 --> 06:04.397
TALKING A LOT ABOUT ISIS IN THE

06:04.397 --> 06:05.932
CONTEXT OF SYRIA AND IRAQ.

06:05.932 --> 06:07.467
IT SEEMS LEBANON IS STARTING TO

06:07.467 --> 06:08.368
GET DRAGGED INTO THIS FIGHT AS

06:08.368 --> 06:09.703
WELL.

06:09.703 --> 06:10.670
>> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.272
THE ISLAMIC STATE HAS MADE NO

06:12.272 --> 06:13.607
BONES ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT HAS

06:13.607 --> 06:15.909
DESIGNS ON LEBANON, AND LEBANON

06:15.909 --> 06:18.211
HAS A VERY FRAGILE STABILITY

06:18.211 --> 06:20.280
FROM ITS OWN CIVIL WAR 20 YEARS

06:20.280 --> 06:20.847
AGO.

06:20.847 --> 06:23.183
IT'S TAKEN IN A LOT OF SYRIAN

06:23.183 --> 06:25.352
REFUGEES WHICH HAS PUT GREAT

06:25.352 --> 06:27.187
STRAIN ON ITS STATE, ITS

06:27.187 --> 06:28.588
SERVICE AND ITS BALANCES.

06:28.588 --> 06:29.456
AND AGAIN NOW YOU HAVE THE

06:29.456 --> 06:31.458
ISLAMIC STATE PROBING THE

06:31.458 --> 06:33.093
LEBANON BORDER, CLEARLY TRYING

06:33.093 --> 06:33.760
TO BRING THEM INTO THIS

06:33.760 --> 06:34.794
CONFLICT.

06:34.794 --> 06:35.795
>> Sreenivasan: WE'RE GOING TO

06:35.795 --> 06:36.997
PUT A MAP UP ON THE SCREEN THAT

06:36.997 --> 06:38.732
ILLUSTRATES THAT ISIS ADVANCE

06:38.732 --> 06:40.367
THROUGH THE ANBAR PROVINCE WEST

06:40.367 --> 06:41.701
OF BAGHDAD DURING THE PAST SEVEN

06:41.701 --> 06:42.769
WEEKS.

06:42.769 --> 06:45.238
WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE

06:45.238 --> 06:45.972
ANBAR PROVINCE?

06:45.972 --> 06:47.574
AND WHAT'S THE IRAQI MILITARY

06:47.574 --> 06:50.243
DOING TO STOP ISIS THERE?

06:50.243 --> 06:51.611
>> WELL, ANBAR'S ALWAYS BEEN

06:51.611 --> 06:52.312
IMPORTANT.

06:52.312 --> 06:54.047
IT'S A VERY LARGE PROVINCE IN

06:54.047 --> 06:56.683
THE WEST OF IRAQ AND IT BORDERS

06:56.683 --> 06:58.618
A NUMBER OF OTHER PROVINCES.

06:58.618 --> 06:59.853
IT BORDERS BAGHDAD, MOST

06:59.853 --> 07:02.522
NOTABLY, BUT ALSO BABEL,

07:02.522 --> 07:04.357
KERBALA, NAJAF.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.159
IT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT, VERY

07:06.159 --> 07:09.129
LARGE PROVINCE, AND ISIS FIRST

07:09.129 --> 07:11.598
MOVED HERE IN JANUARY, LONG

07:11.598 --> 07:13.500
BEFORE ITS SWEEP INTO MOSUL THAT

07:13.500 --> 07:15.035
GARNERED EVERYONE'S ATTENTION.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.469
SO, ISIS HAS BEEN HERE A LONG

07:16.469 --> 07:17.504
TIME.

07:17.504 --> 07:18.905
AND IN FACT, SOME WOULD SAY ISIS

07:18.905 --> 07:20.607
REALLY NEVER LEFT, THAT EVEN

07:20.607 --> 07:23.510
WHEN THE FORMER A.Q.I., NOW

07:23.510 --> 07:24.711
ISIS, THE FORMER AL QAEDA IN

07:24.711 --> 07:26.780
IRAQ, WENT TO GROUND, IT NEVER

07:26.780 --> 07:28.882
REALLY LEFT ANBAR AND ALWAYS HAD

07:28.882 --> 07:30.016
A FOOTHOLD THERE.

07:30.016 --> 07:30.950
>> Sreenivasan: THEY ALSO

07:32.452 --> 07:34.287
MILES WEST OF THE BAGHDAD

07:34.287 --> 07:35.722
AIRPORT, AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE

07:35.722 --> 07:37.457

07:37.457 --> 07:38.758
ZONE ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF

07:38.758 --> 07:39.626

07:39.626 --> 07:40.593
IS.

07:40.593 --> 07:42.562
HOW SAFE IS BAGHDAD NOW FROM

07:42.562 --> 07:44.531

07:44.531 --> 07:46.333
>> WELL, IN THE MEGA-PICTURE,

07:46.333 --> 07:47.834
BAGHDAD IS NOT GOING TO FALL TO

07:47.834 --> 07:49.202
THE ISLAMIC STATE LIKE MOSUL

07:49.202 --> 07:50.170
DID.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.671
THAT'S SIMPLY NOT GOING TO

07:51.671 --> 07:52.305
HAPPEN.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.941
BAGHDAD IS A MAJORITY SHI'A CITY

07:54.941 --> 07:57.544
THAT IS JUST-- WHOSE CITIZENS

07:57.544 --> 07:59.412
FIND ISIS TO BE ABSOLUTELY

07:59.412 --> 08:00.680
ANATHEMA AND IT WILL NOT BE

08:00.680 --> 08:02.382
WELCOMED IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR

08:02.382 --> 08:03.083
FORM.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.418
NOW, THAT SAID, ISIS DOES HAVE

08:05.418 --> 08:08.188
SANCTUARY IN AND AROUND BAGHDAD

08:08.188 --> 08:10.023
AND CAN DO HARRASING ATTACKS.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.725
WHAT EVERYONE IS MOST CONCERNED

08:11.725 --> 08:13.393
ABOUT, OF COURSE, IS THE BAGHDAD

08:13.393 --> 08:14.327
AIRPORT.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.629
THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE BAGHDAD

08:16.629 --> 08:18.465
AIRPORT IS JUST A FEW KILOMETERS

08:18.465 --> 08:20.800
FROM ANBAR PROVINCE, AND IT IS

08:20.800 --> 08:23.002
NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT ISIS IS

08:23.002 --> 08:25.772
TRYING TO NOT CAPTURE BUT

08:25.772 --> 08:28.641
INTERDICT THE BAGHDAD AIRPORT.

08:28.641 --> 08:29.609

BREAKS TO SPUR JOB GROWTH.

14:11.584 --> 14:12.952
PRESIDENT OBAMA PROPOSED TAX

14:12.952 --> 14:14.620
CUTS FOR THE PROMISE ZONES, BUT

14:14.620 --> 14:16.189
THEY HAVE TO BE PASSED BY

14:16.189 --> 14:18.224
CONGRESS, A PROSPECT CONSIDERED

14:18.224 --> 14:20.059
UNLIKELY FOR NOW.

14:20.059 --> 14:21.794
AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEED

14:21.794 --> 14:23.629
FEDERAL AID, JUST A PROMISE OF

14:23.629 --> 14:25.965
PRIORITY FOR FEDERAL GRANTS.

14:25.965 --> 14:27.533
THE PROMISE ZONE IN KENTUCKY

14:27.533 --> 14:29.268
INCLUDES PARTS OF EIGHT COUNTIES

14:29.268 --> 14:30.436
IN THE SOUTHEAST PART OF THE

14:30.436 --> 14:32.872
STATE WHERE TOBEY MILLER LIVES.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.407
JERRY RICKETT LED THE EFFORT TO

14:34.407 --> 14:35.575
APPLY FOR THE PROMISE ZONE

14:35.575 --> 14:36.909
DESIGNATION.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.778
IT'S NO SECRET THAT THIS PART OF

14:38.778 --> 14:41.848
THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN STRUGGLING

14:41.848 --> 14:42.715
WITH A LOT OF THESE ISSUES FOR

14:42.715 --> 14:44.117
MANY YEARS.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.419
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS PROMISE

14:46.419 --> 14:48.387
ZONE THAT YOU THINK IS GOING TO

14:48.387 --> 14:49.889
ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE?

14:49.889 --> 14:50.923
>> I THINK IT GETS BACK TO THE

14:50.923 --> 14:53.226
PARTNERS ALL PULLING TOGETHER.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.227
YOU KNOW, ONE INDIVIDUAL GROUP

14:54.227 --> 14:56.896
CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH, BUT IF YOU

14:56.896 --> 14:58.765
WEAVE US TOGETHER INTO A ROPE,

14:58.765 --> 15:00.333
WE CAN BE REALLY, REALLY STRONG.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.434
>> THE PEOPLE OF THE REGION HAVE

15:01.434 --> 15:02.335
SAID, THIS IS IT.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.971
WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING NOW OR

15:04.971 --> 15:07.607
ELSE WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO

15:07.607 --> 15:08.608
PULL BACK.

15:08.608 --> 15:09.308
>> Reporter: IN FACT, THE

15:09.308 --> 15:10.343
PROMISE ZONE HAS BROUGHT

15:10.343 --> 15:11.778
TOGETHER A NEW COALITION OF

15:11.778 --> 15:13.880
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, SCHOOLS AND

15:13.880 --> 15:15.348
COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT

15:15.348 --> 15:16.749
WILL IMPLEMENT THE PROMISE ZONE

15:16.749 --> 15:19.418
GOALS: DIVERSIFYING THE ECONOMY,

15:19.418 --> 15:21.420
CREATING JOBS, GROWING SMALL

15:21.420 --> 15:22.989
BUSINESS, AND IMPROVING

15:22.989 --> 15:25.091
EDUCATION AND RETRAINING.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.159
THE WORK IS JUST GETTING UNDER

15:26.159 --> 15:27.760
WAY, BUT RICKETT POINTS TO A

15:27.760 --> 15:29.028
COUPLE SUCCESSFUL LOCAL

15:29.028 --> 15:30.630
INITIATIVES THAT SHOW HOW THE

15:30.630 --> 15:32.165
PROMISE ZONE COULD WORK.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.766
>> WE'VE GOT TO GET A BETTER-

15:33.766 --> 15:36.235
EDUCATED WORKFORCE, GOT TO HELP

15:36.235 --> 15:38.137
THE ADULTS THAT, YOU KNOW, NEED

15:38.137 --> 15:39.572
ADDITIONAL TRAINING OR

15:39.572 --> 15:41.674
RETRAINING.

15:41.674 --> 15:42.608
>> Reporter: ESPECIALLY

15:42.608 --> 15:44.177
UNEMPLOYED COAL MINERS.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.444
MANY ARE LEAVING IN DROVES TO

15:45.444 --> 15:46.579
FIND WORK.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.681
SO, IN HAZARD, KENTUCKY, TWO

15:48.681 --> 15:49.949
PROMISE ZONE PARTNERS-- THE

15:49.949 --> 15:51.584
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND A JOB-

15:51.584 --> 15:53.419
TRAINING GROUP-- LAUNCHED A NEW

15:53.419 --> 15:55.154

15:55.154 --> 15:56.856
TO REPAIR ELECTRICITY AND PHONE

15:56.856 --> 15:57.723

15:57.723 --> 16:00.560
SO FAR, 39 HAVE GRADUATED AND

16:00.560 --> 16:02.061
ALMOST EVERY ONE HAS FOUND A

16:02.061 --> 16:03.296
JOB.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.631
TOBEY MILLER IS ALSO RETRAINING.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.533
AT HIS NEARBY COMMUNITY COLLEGE,

16:07.533 --> 16:08.968
HE'S EARNING AN ASSOCIATE'S

16:12.004 --> 16:14.574

16:14.574 --> 16:16.509

16:16.509 --> 16:19.078
RIGHT HERE AND TRY TO GET

16:19.078 --> 16:20.346
THROUGH THIS SCHOOL THAT I'M

16:20.346 --> 16:22.548
DOING, BECAUSE IT'S HERE.

16:22.548 --> 16:25.117
H.V.A.C. WORK IS HERE.

16:25.117 --> 16:26.118
>> Reporter: MILLER SAYS HE

16:26.118 --> 16:27.653
WANTS TO START HIS OWN BUSINESS

16:27.653 --> 16:28.554
ONE DAY.

16:28.554 --> 16:29.856
PROMISE ZONE SUPPORTERS SAY

16:29.856 --> 16:31.724
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT,

16:31.724 --> 16:32.525
TOO.

16:32.525 --> 16:33.793
>> WE REALLY BELIEVE IN

16:33.793 --> 16:35.261
ENTREPRENEURSHIP, TRYING TO GET

16:35.261 --> 16:37.330
BUSINESSES TO START, TRYING TO

FIND WAYS TO HELP THE ONES THAT

16:38.531 --> 16:40.833
ARE HERE, YOU KNOW, THRIVE.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.935
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT

16:42.935 --> 16:43.903
INDUSTRIES INTO EASTERN

16:43.903 --> 16:45.004
KENTUCKY.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.072
>> Reporter: BECAUSE IT'S SO

16:46.072 --> 16:47.373
DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT OUTSIDE

16:47.373 --> 16:49.342
EMPLOYERS, RICKETT SAYS THEY

16:49.342 --> 16:50.676
NEED TO GROW THEIR OWN.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.311
LAST YEAR, RICKETT'S GROUP GOT

16:52.311 --> 16:54.680
AN $800,000 FEDERAL GRANT, WHICH

16:54.680 --> 16:56.082
IT THEN LOANED TO LOCAL

16:56.082 --> 16:58.551
MANUFACTURER CLYDE PHILLIPS.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.186
HE HIRED 19 PEOPLE WITH THAT

17:00.186 --> 17:02.421
MONEY AND PLANS TO HIRE DOZENS

17:02.421 --> 17:03.589
MORE.

17:03.589 --> 17:04.357
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

17:04.357 --> 17:05.558
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LOSING THEIR

17:05.558 --> 17:06.792
JOBS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

17:06.792 --> 17:08.995
ALREADY UN... UNEMPLOYED, WILL

17:08.995 --> 17:11.097
ONE OR TWO JOBS HERE OR A DOZEN

17:11.097 --> 17:13.566
JOBS THERE MAKE THAT DIFFERENCE?

17:13.566 --> 17:15.167
>> WELL, IT'S THE ONLY OP...

17:15.167 --> 17:18.337
OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE.

17:18.337 --> 17:19.338
YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC AND

17:19.338 --> 17:21.240
WORK WITHIN THE AREAS THAT YOU

17:21.240 --> 17:24.543
CAN AND HAVE PROGRESS AND

17:24.543 --> 17:25.711
SUCCESS IN.

17:25.711 --> 17:26.545
>> I DO GET THE SENSE THAT

17:26.545 --> 17:30.016
THERE'S GREATER ENERGY AND

17:30.016 --> 17:33.052
ENTHUSIASM TO... TO... TO TACKLE

17:33.052 --> 17:33.986
THE PROBLEM.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.288
BUT TIME WILL TELL WHETHER OR

17:35.288 --> 17:37.323
NOT IT WILL ULTIMATELY PAY OFF.

17:37.323 --> 17:38.658
CLEARLY, WE'RE HOPING THAT IT

17:38.658 --> 17:39.392
DOES.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.493

17:42.428 --> 17:44.163
HERE, TOBEY MILLER BLAMES THE

17:44.163 --> 17:45.932
GOVERNMENT FOR THE COAL LAYOFFS

17:45.932 --> 17:47.099
BUT ADMITS HE'S BEEN HELPED BY

17:47.099 --> 17:48.701
FEDERAL PROGRAMS, TOO.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.336
A LOCAL PROMISE ZONE PARTNER

PROVIDE A STIPEND FOR A FEW

17:55.875 --> 17:57.243
MONTHS.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.011

17:59.011 --> 18:00.046
FOR ME.

18:00.046 --> 18:04.850
I MEAN, IT SAVED MY BACON.

18:04.850 --> 18:05.818
BUT THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH IT

18:05.818 --> 18:08.821
IS, IF THEY'D LEFT THINGS ALONE,

18:08.821 --> 18:09.855
EVERYTHING WOULD'VE STILL BEEN

18:09.855 --> 18:12.725
GOING ALONG JUST FINE.

18:12.725 --> 18:13.659
>> Reporter: MILLER SAYS HIS

18:13.659 --> 18:15.094

18:15.094 --> 18:16.462
SEND HIS YOUNGEST DAUGHTER TO A

18:16.462 --> 18:18.064
FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE.

18:18.064 --> 18:19.565

18:27.573 --> 18:29.976
VISIT www.newshour.pbs.org.

18:32.378 --> 18:33.346
>> Sreenivasan: AS YOU NO DOUBT

18:33.346 --> 18:35.014
KNOW, GAS PRICES HAVE FALLEN

18:35.014 --> 18:36.949
SHARPLY IN RECENT WEEKS.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.484
ACCORDING TO A.A.A., THE AVERAGE

18:38.484 --> 18:40.086
PRICE OF A GALLON OF REGULAR WAS

18:40.086 --> 18:42.088
$3.52 IN LATE JULY.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.556
NOW, LESS THAN THREE MONTHS

18:43.556 --> 18:45.291
LATER, IT'S $3.12.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.492
FOR MORE, WE ARE JOINED NOW BY

18:48.861 --> 18:50.062
REPORTER WITH BLOOMBERG NEWS.

18:50.062 --> 18:51.764
SO WE'VE SEEN IT DECLINE A LOT

18:51.764 --> 18:53.099
AND SOMETIMES THERE'S A LAG

18:53.099 --> 18:54.266
BETWEEN THE PRICE OF OIL AND THE

18:54.266 --> 18:55.101
PRICE OF GAS.

18:55.101 --> 18:57.003
ARE WE LIKELY TO SEE THE PRICE

18:57.003 --> 18:58.738
OF GAS GO LOWER?

18:58.738 --> 19:00.006
>> IT COULD CONTINUE TO TICK

19:00.006 --> 19:00.873
DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.808
WE ARE SEEING OIL PRICES START

19:02.808 --> 19:04.243
TO STABILIZE SIGNIFICANTLY

19:04.243 --> 19:05.011
LOWER THAN THEY WERE THIS

19:05.011 --> 19:07.613
SUMMER, BUT IT DEPENDS SORT OF

19:07.613 --> 19:08.748
WHERE OIL GOES FROM NOW.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.317
IF OIL CONTINUES ITS FREEFALL,

19:11.317 --> 19:13.719
REALLY, OR FINDS A FLOOR AROUND

19:13.719 --> 19:14.754
$80 A BARREL.

19:14.754 --> 19:15.521
>> Sreenivasan: IS IT LIKELY

19:15.521 --> 19:16.322
TO LAST?

19:16.322 --> 19:17.456
THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT

19:17.456 --> 19:19.025
FACTORS THAT ARE PUSHING IT

19:19.025 --> 19:19.692
DOWN.

19:19.692 --> 19:20.393
>> ABSOLUTELY.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.561
WE'VE GOT VERY SOFT DEMAND

19:22.561 --> 19:24.230
GLOBALLY, AND EXPANDING SUPPLY

19:24.230 --> 19:28.300
FROM THE U.S., AND REALLY ALL

19:28.300 --> 19:29.935
EYES ARE ON OPEC NOW TO SEE IF

19:29.935 --> 19:33.606
THEY CUT BACK SUPPLY OR CONTINUE

19:33.606 --> 19:36.742
TO ADD SUPPLY AND LET PRICES

19:36.742 --> 19:37.510
CONTINUE TO FALL.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.244
>> Sreenivasan: AND THERE WERE

19:38.244 --> 19:39.645
SOME COMMENTS MADE BY THE I.M.F.

19:39.645 --> 19:40.713
IN SAUDI ARABIA EARLIER THIS

19:40.713 --> 19:42.548
WEEK ABOUT WHAT'S GOOD AND

19:42.548 --> 19:43.482
WHAT'S BAD FOR SAUDI ARABIA,

19:43.482 --> 19:44.417
"WHAT'S THAT PRICE POINT."

19:44.417 --> 19:46.018
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

19:46.018 --> 19:47.553
>> THE I.M.F. ESTIMATES SAUDI

19:47.553 --> 19:49.989
ARABIA NEEDS ABOUT $83 A BARREL

19:49.989 --> 19:52.491
TO BREAK EVEN ON ITS BUDGET.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.660
BUT SAUDI ARABIA HAS A LOT OF

19:54.660 --> 19:56.028
CURRENCY RESERVES AND VERY GOOD

19:56.028 --> 19:56.762
CREDIT.

19:56.762 --> 19:58.464
THEY'VE RUN DEFICITS BEFORE AND

19:58.464 --> 20:00.299
THEY COULD WITHSTAND IT FOR SOME

20:00.299 --> 20:00.933
TIME.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.069
SO, LOWER PRICES, WHILE IT WOULD

20:03.069 --> 20:04.670
REDUCE SAUDI ARABIA'S INCOME, IT

20:04.670 --> 20:05.838
WOULD ACTUALLY PROBABLY HURT

20:05.838 --> 20:07.206
SOME OF THEIR BIG RIVALS MORE

20:07.206 --> 20:08.808
LIKE IRAN OR RUSSIA.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.077
SO, YOU KNOW, THERE'S-- ANALYSTS

20:11.077 --> 20:12.044
ARE SORT OF SPLIT.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.145
IS OPEC JUST NOT HANGING

20:13.145 --> 20:14.747
TOGETHER OR IS THERE A CAMP THAT

20:14.747 --> 20:16.115
THINKS MAYBE SAUDI ARABIA IS ALL

20:16.115 --> 20:16.982
RIGHT WITH THE PRICES BEING

20:16.982 --> 20:17.817
LOWER?

20:17.817 --> 20:18.684
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT'S THE

20:18.684 --> 20:19.652
UPSIDE HERE?

20:19.652 --> 20:22.521
WHEN PRICES FALL AT THE PUMP,

20:22.521 --> 20:24.123
CONSUMERS IN THE THE UNITED

20:24.123 --> 20:25.424
STATES ACTUALLY FEEL BETTER

20:25.424 --> 20:26.358
ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY'RE PAYING

20:26.358 --> 20:27.359
LESS AT THE GAS STATION, BUT

20:27.359 --> 20:28.661
WHAT ARE KIND OF THE ECONOMIC

20:28.661 --> 20:30.262
RIPPLE EFFECTS WHEN THERE ARE

20:30.262 --> 20:31.030
LOW GAS PRICES?

20:31.030 --> 20:31.730
>> ABSOLUELY.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.165
THIS IS ABOUT THE EQUIVALENT OF

20:33.165 --> 20:35.634
A $500 OR $600 TAX CUT FOR EVERY

20:35.634 --> 20:37.603
HOUSEHOLD, AND THAT'S MONEY THAT

20:37.603 --> 20:38.871
IS PROBABLY GOING TO GET SPENT

20:38.871 --> 20:40.739
BASICALLY RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE SO

20:40.739 --> 20:42.174
MANY AMERICANS LIVE PAYCHECK TO

20:42.174 --> 20:43.642
PAYCHECK AND SPEND EVERYTHING IN

20:43.642 --> 20:44.743
THEIR POCKET, SO ANYTHING THAT

20:44.743 --> 20:46.145
THEY'RE SAVING ON FUEL, THAT'S

20:46.145 --> 20:47.113
MONEY THAT'S GOING TO GO RIGHT

20:47.113 --> 20:48.214
INTO THE ECONOMY AND INTO

20:48.214 --> 20:49.515
CONSUMER SPENDING.

20:49.515 --> 20:51.350
AND THAT WILL HAPPEN PRETTY

20:51.350 --> 20:54.320
QUICKLY, AND THE ECONOMIC

20:54.320 --> 20:55.988
EFFECT OF THAT COULD BE ABOUT

20:55.988 --> 20:57.623
.4% OF G.D.P. GROWTH.

20:57.623 --> 20:58.524
>> Sreenivasan: WOW.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.793
HOW DOES THAT RIPPLE INTO, FOR

21:00.793 --> 21:01.961
EXAMPLE, THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING

21:01.961 --> 21:03.329
SEASON OR IS THAT MORE MONEY IN

21:03.329 --> 21:05.998
THE POCKET WE CAN START SPENDING

21:05.998 --> 21:07.366
ON TOYS AND GIFTS, ET CETERA, ET

21:07.366 --> 21:08.033
CETERA?

21:08.033 --> 21:08.968
>> THE OTHER INTERESTING THING

21:08.968 --> 21:10.536
ABOUT GAS PRICES IS, IT'S OFTEN

21:10.536 --> 21:11.837
BEEN NOTED THAT IT'S REALLY

21:11.837 --> 21:13.072
PECULIAR, THE WAY WE BUY IT.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.507
WE SIT THERE AND WATCH THE

21:14.507 --> 21:16.075
DOLLARS ROLL BY.

21:16.075 --> 21:19.278
EVEN MORE THAN THE THE ACTUAL

21:19.278 --> 21:21.780
EFFECT ON INCOME IS THIS

21:21.780 --> 21:24.450
PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT ON CONSUMER

21:24.450 --> 21:26.218
CONFIDENCE BECAUSE WE REALLY

21:26.218 --> 21:27.453
NOTICE WHEN THOSE PRICES MOVE

21:27.453 --> 21:29.622
AROUND AS WE WATCH THEM GO BY.

21:29.622 --> 21:30.956
>> Sreenivasan: TO RECAP, THE

21:30.956 --> 21:33.726
BIG REASONS ARE THAT CHINA IS

21:33.726 --> 21:35.060
PERHAPS DEMANDING LESS OIL.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.061
>> ABSOLUTELY.

21:36.061 --> 21:36.862
>> Sreenivasan: AND AT THE

21:36.862 --> 21:37.997
SAME TIME THE U.S. IS CREATING

21:37.997 --> 21:38.964
MORE NATURAL GAS AND OIL

21:38.964 --> 21:39.665
RESERVES?

21:39.665 --> 21:41.133
>> YEAH, SO THE U.S. IS

21:41.133 --> 21:42.701
PRODUCING A LOT MORE OIL

21:42.701 --> 21:44.003
DOMESTICALLY, IMPORTING A LOT

21:44.003 --> 21:45.371
LESS, WHICH MAKES A LOT MORE OIL

21:45.371 --> 21:46.672
AVAILABLE ON THE WORLD MARKET TO

21:46.672 --> 21:47.973
GO TO ASIA.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.476
BUT CHINA IS NOT-- THE GROWTH IS

21:50.476 --> 21:51.577
SLOWING DOWN THERE.

21:51.577 --> 21:53.045
ALSO, IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,

21:53.045 --> 21:54.280
CARS ARE GETTING MORE EFFICIENT

21:54.280 --> 21:55.848
AND PEOPLE ARE DRIVING LESS.

21:55.848 --> 21:58.150
SO DEMAND GLOBALLY IS GROWING AT

21:58.150 --> 22:00.186
THE SLOWEST PACE SINCE 2009, AND

22:00.186 --> 22:02.021
2009 WAS, OBVIOUSLY, A VERY WEAK

22:02.021 --> 22:02.788
YEAR.

22:02.788 --> 22:05.157
AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS

22:05.157 --> 22:06.525
ALL THIS SUPPLY COMING ON FROM

22:06.525 --> 22:07.826
THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE, SO

22:07.826 --> 22:09.094
THAT'S WHY WE'VE SEEN PRICES

22:09.094 --> 22:09.828
TAKE SUCH A NOSEDIVE.

22:09.828 --> 22:10.696
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY, ISAAC

22:10.696 --> 22:11.630
ARNSDORF FROM BLOOMBERG NEWS.

22:11.630 --> 22:12.531
THANKS SO MUCH.

22:12.531 --> 22:14.133
>> THANK YOU.

22:16.302 --> 22:18.270
>>THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND,

22:18.270 --> 22:19.305
SATURDAY.

22:24.877 --> 22:25.644
>> Sreenivasan: MUSIC FANS HAVE

22:25.644 --> 22:26.645
LONG DEBATED THE MEANING OF THIS

22:26.645 --> 22:28.380
PHOTOGRAPH, THE COVER OF THE

22:28.380 --> 22:31.116
1969 ICONIC BEATLES ALBUM,

22:31.116 --> 22:32.284
"ABBEY ROAD."

22:32.284 --> 22:33.319
THAT IMAGE WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF

22:33.319 --> 22:34.553
SEVERAL TAKEN DURING A PHOTO

22:34.553 --> 22:35.788
SHOOT WITH THE FAB FOUR.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.556
NOW, 45 YEARS LATER, ALL THE

22:37.556 --> 22:38.691
PHOTOS SNAPPED THAT DAY ARE

22:38.691 --> 22:40.292
GOING UP FOR AUCTION.

22:40.292 --> 22:41.360
>> Reporter: THE PHOTOGRAPHER

22:41.360 --> 22:43.229
ONLY HAD TEN MINUTES, SO HE GOT

22:43.229 --> 22:44.863
THE BAND TO CROSS THE ROAD A FEW

22:44.863 --> 22:47.233
TIMES, TOOK SIX SNAPS, AND THEN

22:47.233 --> 22:48.634
PAUL McCARTNEY CHOSE THE ONE

22:48.634 --> 22:50.369
THAT ENDED UP ON THE ALBUM

22:50.369 --> 22:51.403
COVER.

22:51.403 --> 22:55.207
♪

22:55.207 --> 22:56.475
NOW, FOR WHAT'S THOUGHT TO BE

22:56.475 --> 22:58.744
THE FIRST TIME, ALL SIX IMAGES

22:58.744 --> 23:00.779
TAKEN BY IAIN MACMILLAN AND ONE

USED ON THE BACK OF THE "ABBEY

23:02.181 --> 23:03.849
ROAD" ALBUM ARE BEING SOLD

23:03.849 --> 23:04.883
TOGETHER.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.885

23:06.885 --> 23:09.021
COLLECTING MUSIC PHOTOGRAPHY FOR

23:09.021 --> 23:11.790
OVER 15 YEARS, AND IT TOOK HIM

23:11.790 --> 23:12.625
TEN YEARS TO FIND IT.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.394
SO, IT'S REALLY SPECIAL.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.262
>> Reporter: WHAT FEW KNEW AT

23:16.262 --> 23:17.930
THE TIME WAS THAT "ABBEY ROAD,"

23:17.930 --> 23:20.132
RELEASED IN 1969, WOULD BE THE

23:20.132 --> 23:21.767
LAST TIME THE BEATLES RECORDED

23:21.767 --> 23:23.035
TOGETHER.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.436
IT LEAD LATER TO CONSPIRACY

23:24.436 --> 23:25.871
THEORIES, THAT THE SCENE ON THE

23:25.871 --> 23:27.673
COVER SYMBOLIZED A FUNERAL

23:27.673 --> 23:29.508
PROCESSION, EVEN THAT PAUL

23:29.508 --> 23:30.943
McCARTNEY HAD DIED AND AN

23:30.943 --> 23:32.311
IMPOSTER WAS USED.

23:32.311 --> 23:33.812
THE COVER BECAME AN ICON IN ITS

23:33.812 --> 23:34.914
OWN RIGHT.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.915
JOHN LENNON'S SUIT WAS AUCTIONED

23:36.915 --> 23:38.651
OFF FOR A SMALL FORTUNE.

23:38.651 --> 23:40.653
SO, TOO, WAS THE WHITE CAR-- THE

23:40.653 --> 23:42.121
FIFTH "BEATLE" IN THE IMAGE--

23:42.121 --> 23:43.622
WHICH IS NOW ON DISPLAY IN

23:49.428 --> 23:50.929
EVERY YEAR AND, OF COURSE, ALL

23:50.929 --> 23:52.331
OF THE LONDON TRAFFIC, FINDING A

23:52.331 --> 23:54.166
QUIET TEN MINUTES TO TAKE THOSE

23:54.166 --> 23:55.934
PICTURES THESE DAYS WOULD BE A

23:55.934 --> 23:58.570
VIRTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.306
IT DOESN'T STOP FANS TRYING TO

24:00.306 --> 24:03.208
CAPTURE THE MOMENT.

24:03.208 --> 24:04.643
SOME WITH THEIR OWN UNIQUE

24:04.643 --> 24:05.678
TWIST.

24:05.678 --> 24:06.879
EVEN THE OUTTAKES ARE PRODUCING

24:06.879 --> 24:09.515
HUGE INTEREST, ESPECIALLY AS

24:09.515 --> 24:10.716
JUST MONTHS AFTER THESE IMAGES

24:10.716 --> 24:12.651
WERE TAKEN, THE BEATLES WOULD BE

24:12.651 --> 24:14.620
WALKING AWAY FOR GOOD WHEN THEY

24:14.620 --> 24:15.821
SPLIT UP.
