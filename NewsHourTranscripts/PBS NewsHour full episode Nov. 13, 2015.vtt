reports range even higher

02:52.406 --> 02:58.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there was no immediate claim of
responsibility the wave of
chilling

02:58.545 --> 03:03.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shattered Friday night in paris
as police and military race to
stop an

03:03.984 --> 03:09.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all-out assault on the city of
at least six sites were hit from

03:16.029 --> 03:21.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the worst carnage where at least
100 people died after gunmen
seized hostages

03:21.835 --> 03:27.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the police assault there killed
at least two of the attackers
bomb blast near the

03:27.107 --> 03:32.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
soccer stadium reverberate
inside where thousands of things

03:32.245 --> 03:38.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gathered France Germany I heard
one bed and then ten to fifteen
minutes later

03:38.752 --> 03:42.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
another bang bang two in one go

03:42.222 --> 03:48.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then I heard another one outside
inside French president Francois
Hollande was

03:48.161 --> 03:53.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the stadium as well but was
quickly evacuated moments later
he addressed the

03:53.667 --> 03:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nation declaring a state of
emergency and shutting the
nation's borders the

03:58.738 --> 04:03.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dole was a sudden applying must
ensure that no one can return to
carry out such

04:03.643 --> 04:07.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as and at the same time that
those who have carried out these
crimes are also

04:07.547 --> 04:11.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
apprehended before trying to
leave the country in Washington
President Obama

04:11.918 --> 04:16.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
came to the White House briefing
room as the attacks were still
ongoing

04:16.456 --> 04:21.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
once again we've seen an
outrageous attempt to terrorize
innocent civilians

04:21.661 --> 04:30.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is an attack not just on
Paris it's time I just on the
people of France but

04:30.103 --> 04:37.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is an attack on all of
humanity of the universal values
that we share we

04:37.244 --> 04:42.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stand prepared and ready to
provide whatever assistance that
the government

04:42.215 --> 04:47.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the people of France need to
respond back in Paris
investigators began trying

04:47.821 --> 04:53.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to figure out who was behind the
worst attack on the city since
world war two

04:53.193 --> 04:59.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and how they carried it out here
in the USA officials said there
is no credible

04:59.032 --> 05:04.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threat of an attack but security
has been stepped up at locations
in New York

05:04.371 --> 05:09.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Boston and Washington Dec for
more on the attacks we turn to
reporter Kate

05:09.409 --> 05:15.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moody of France 24 television
she is in Paris Kate moody tell
us the latest you

05:15.782 --> 05:23.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have at this hour is still on
the battle plans theater where
this dramatic

05:23.456 --> 05:28.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hostage situation has just come
to an end about two hours ago we
understand

05:28.962 --> 05:33.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that police and forensic
investigators are going in there
and uncovering a

05:33.266 --> 05:37.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really bloody bloody scene we've
been seeing covered bodies
coming out of that

05:37.370 --> 05:42.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
theater injured people being
taken to hospital for treatment

05:42.442 --> 05:49.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Kate we know that there were
is it five or six other sites
where there were

05:49.716 --> 05:57.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacks of a different nature
yeah there wasn't justice
hostage situation going

05:57.090 --> 06:01.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on although that seems to emerge
as the most high-profile
incident the evening

06:01.795 --> 06:06.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the bloody evening began as she
will add around 9 p.m. local
time with a series

06:06.499 --> 06:11.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of explosions were heard outside
the study hard stadium where
their soccer

06:11.838 --> 06:16.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
match between France and Germany
was taking place we understand
that five

06:16.176 --> 06:21.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people were killed outside of
that stadium including the
potentially choose

06:21.715 --> 06:24.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suicide attacker that that's
what's being reported that has
not been

06:24.117 --> 06:26.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
confirmed by the police

06:26.886 --> 06:30.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these explosions were heard
inside the stadium but no one
really realize what

06:30.991 --> 06:37.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was in the game went ahead as
normal and separately a few
minutes later there

06:37.097 --> 06:41.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was there was a series of
gunshots and people who were
killed outside a

06:41.468 --> 06:46.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cambodian restaurant in the 11th
arrondissement of Paris really
buzzing

06:46.273 --> 06:50.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of hit neighborhood where a
lot of people were out on the
terraces then

06:50.877 --> 06:55.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this incident took place at the
theater where an American ben
was actually

06:55.015 --> 06:59.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting a rock show hundreds and
hundreds of people inside that
sold out

06:59.419 --> 07:04.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
show an optimization and then
developed there there were also
reports at least

07:04.357 --> 07:09.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
four other reports of gunfire in
the city throughout the evening
it's not

07:09.229 --> 07:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clear whether those were in fact
related to the series of attacks
although the I

07:13.433 --> 07:18.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think we can say fairly safely
the series at the at the
restaurant the

07:18.672 --> 07:22.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
theater and then the stadium do
seem to have been related in
some way that the

07:22.375 --> 07:27.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
impression that authorities
didn't understand that in total
five attackers

07:27.013 --> 07:30.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were involved and have been
neutralized that's worth of the
french prosecutors

07:30.617 --> 07:35.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
using the other opened up
investigations try and find out
you know who these

07:35.322 --> 07:38.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people are who they may have
been connected with the years
we've not been

07:38.825 --> 07:42.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given to the all clear signs of
Paris the because they have the
knees other

07:42.629 --> 07:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
potentially related incidents
with don't know the people who
were involved in

07:46.966 --> 07:49.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those out there have been taken
into custody have been
neutralized use their

07:49.302 --> 07:51.438 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
word

07:51.438 --> 07:57.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the city still very much on
edge evening kate is there any
clue at all as

07:57.243 --> 08:02.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the identity of any of these
attackers there's not we've
heard from

08:02.882 --> 08:07.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some people who were inside the
Buckland theater who said that
they heard the

08:07.387 --> 08:13.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attackers mentioning Syria
someone said they heard her
cries of Allahu Akbar

08:13.760 --> 08:18.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but that does just individuals
that we've heard from there's no
sense for

08:18.331 --> 08:22.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officials yet that that could be
any kind of any kind of a
motivation

08:22.469 --> 08:27.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prosecutors have been very very
careful not to make any and not
pointing fingers

08:27.941 --> 08:32.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if you will yet because we're
really still in the very early
stages of this

08:32.612 --> 08:36.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigation as I said we're
not even sure that would that
that everything has

08:36.383 --> 08:39.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been company has been been calm
down for the evening is still
very very much on

08:39.853 --> 08:43.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actual a lot of questions bill
just beginning to be raised a
lot of

08:43.857 --> 08:49.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
questions for sure and and given
what happened in Paris just
months ago with

08:49.763 --> 08:56.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Charlie Hebdo attack the
French newspaper where a number
of people were

08:56.369 --> 09:01.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killed we know security was
stepped up in Paris but clearly
not enough to stop

09:01.508 --> 09:08.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something as horrific as this
you know exactly was feeling
fairly fairly

09:08.915 --> 09:14.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
impressive presence of military
personnel and police just much
more

09:14.254 --> 09:17.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visible on the streets of Paris
in the months since that Charlie
at their

09:17.924 --> 09:23.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shooting and and you know posted
outside outside news officers
outside churches

09:23.596 --> 09:28.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and synagogues and temples we
feel we've seen all that for
months

09:28.568 --> 09:33.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of people perish sort of
thought after while maybe
they're trying a

09:33.006 --> 09:36.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
little too far with that maybe
we could dial it down obviously
those questions

09:36.810 --> 09:41.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
resurfacing this evening the
other question of course is
going to be the

09:41.147 --> 09:45.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issue of counterintelligence
counterterrorism really how how

09:45.752 --> 09:48.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigators go about stopping
these kinds of things before
they happen

09:48.588 --> 09:51.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
without the threat of

09:51.324 --> 09:55.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the threat of policemen on the
streets how how how can the
intelligence

09:55.862 --> 10:00.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community find people who might
become perpetrators in the
future

10:00.667 --> 10:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
French government has tried to
go some way to expanding its own
powers trying

10:05.371 --> 10:11.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to track down those people I
think that it will certainly be
much much more

10:11.344 --> 10:14.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moody we thank you and we are
going to continue to follow this

Adam Goldman has covered that
story extensively for the

13:11.591 --> 13:16.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
technically I don't think jockey
John meant much to the
organization itself he

13:16.663 --> 13:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wasn't a battlefield general but
he helped great symbolism for
that group

13:20.967 --> 13:27.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I think his demise is a blow
to the organization he was a
great recruitment

13:27.073 --> 13:32.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
tool and he also seemed
untouchable but the you s just

hour more on the attacks that
have rocked Paris

how everyday acts of racism can
bill to a tipping point and more

17:50.136 --> 17:55.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now a look at what questions
authorities are asking in paris
tonight we turn to

17:55.441 --> 18:00.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lorenzo buddy know he is the
director of the program on
extremism at george

18:00.279 --> 18:04.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
washington university
here in washington D C

18:04.083 --> 18:09.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
welcome to the program lorenzo's
so somebody who studies
terrorism what do

18:09.155 --> 18:13.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you make of what we're hearing
out of Paris we're seeing it
seemed quite well

18:13.292 --> 18:17.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coordinated that over the last
couple of years we've seen a lot
of attacks which

18:17.196 --> 18:21.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were carried out by lone actors
will be small groups of people
that quite

18:21.367 --> 18:26.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unsophisticated he seems very
different with multiple
locations automatic

18:26.405 --> 18:33.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weapons probably suicide belts
and suicide actions all at the
same time

18:33.245 --> 18:38.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very high number of casualties
and he seems quite sophisticated
likely of

18:38.317 --> 18:42.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
course we don't know a lot of
things at this point but like
the the action of a

18:42.221 --> 18:46.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group of a pretty sophisticated
network what do you make we
heard Kate moody the

18:46.525 --> 18:52.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reporter a minute ago say that
one witness heard one of the
attackers use

18:52.999 --> 18:58.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the word say syria and there may
have been someone who heard an
attacker say

18:58.504 --> 19:04.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all who are are what we are
these just little bits of
information we have to be

19:04.877 --> 19:08.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very cautious of course what
what people here in situations
like that in the

19:08.347 --> 19:12.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
middle of the pack they could it
be because I misheard the
obviously bizarre

19:12.551 --> 19:19.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
potential indications of what is
the most likely suspicious group
so that the

19:19.158 --> 19:24.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
al-qaida rice has inspired form
of terrorism they talking about
Syria if

19:24.296 --> 19:28.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they say that god is great the
lower part in Arabic they will
be indication

19:28.334 --> 19:33.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that individuals inspired by
technology in a way to be linked
or not

19:33.005 --> 19:38.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
groups again premature to say
that is obviously the most
likely scenario but

19:38.577 --> 19:42.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's one of these two groups are
anyways what ideology but let's
remember but a

19:42.281 --> 19:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
few years ago when both attacks
in Norway took place we all
thought he was

19:47.386 --> 19:52.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
islamic inspire terrorism and it
was not again the most likely
scenario is bad

19:52.491 --> 19:56.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but I think it would be silly
for everybody to to assume
that's what it is

19:56.195 --> 19:59.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and i think what the French
investigators said in its notice
telling

19:59.598 --> 20:03.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me to make about the suction
from the beginning is there
anything we can make

20:03.169 --> 20:08.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the methodology the fact that
they did simultaneous attacks at
one time

20:08.808 --> 20:13.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they went into a concert
hall and apparently just picked
people off one by

20:13.045 --> 20:17.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one by one very soft targets

20:17.583 --> 20:20.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it says the mayor of Paris I
think we're seeing these are the
places where people

20:20.719 --> 20:25.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go on a Friday night to have
fun restaurant to soccer game

20:25.191 --> 20:29.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the concert that had been
brutally extremely brutally
killed people one by

20:29.462 --> 20:36.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one so obviously this is two to
make a statement pieces not to
kill brutally

20:36.102 --> 20:42.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again it's the methodology
reducing with vice related
groups and we just reading

20:42.041 --> 20:45.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the news wires that the
Department of Homeland Security
is saying once again

20:45.611 --> 20:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they still have no reason no
credible threat that the that
there there's an

20:50.683 --> 20:55.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attack being directed it at the
you s so my question is why
France why Paris what

20:55.354 --> 20:58.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
makes that the target tonight

20:58.691 --> 21:02.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
difficult to see again because
we don't know all the facts and
who's behind this

21:02.094 --> 21:07.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if it is indeed a nice is
inspired al-qaida-inspired
attack and friends has

21:07.099 --> 21:11.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a very very large number of
individuals who have gone to
Syria we're talking

21:11.737 --> 21:15.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about more than 1,000 people
they went from friends to fight
with Isis in Syria

21:15.674 --> 21:21.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a few hundred of both have come
back we ever even larger number
of sympathizers

21:21.413 --> 21:25.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in France over there are a lot
of networks lot of a jihadist
activities

21:25.417 --> 21:29.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beer and I thought these are
overwhelmed now this is a
problem it is common to

21:29.321 --> 21:34.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most Western countries including
the United States but the size
the magnitude

21:34.226 --> 21:38.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the problem in trends is so
much bigger than in the USA and
most other

21:38.297 --> 21:45.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
European countries and again
it's early but does this
represent possibly some

21:45.070 --> 21:49.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of turning point in that it
was believed before there were
gonna be

21:49.041 --> 21:51.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these kind of attacks but they
were going to step up security
and they

21:51.544 --> 21:55.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really stepped up security but
there was security and yet they
were able to pull

21:55.481 --> 21:59.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this off it's almost impossible
to stop this kind of this kind
of a tax and and

21:59.785 --> 22:03.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
keep in mind a bit on a monthly
basis authorities in most
Western countries

22:03.756 --> 22:09.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including the United States for
it to Texas so for everyone but
does take

22:09.195 --> 22:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
place we have seen dozens of
attacks over the last couple of
months have been

22:14.166 --> 22:18.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thwarted but you can't stop
everything in in in a free
society you cannot

22:18.070 --> 22:23.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
secure every restaurant
every concert venue

22:23.576 --> 22:28.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every you every football game
and if we have thousands of
people but are

22:28.147 --> 22:31.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
inspired by a sort of radiology
and ready to commit an act of
violence one

22:31.850 --> 22:36.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
cannot just a little
capabilities and resources one
cannot monitor all these

22:36.689 --> 22:40.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people 24 7 so it's impossible
to secure a country in every
single soft target in

22:40.793 --> 22:42.695 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it

22:42.695 --> 22:46.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well many many questions raised
by what's happened by what's led
to this

you thank you

23:06.719 --> 23:12.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
we bring you another
conversation and R Series race
matters solutions during a

23:12.224 --> 23:16.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week when racial tensions on
campus have led to protests and
high-profile

23:16.762 --> 23:21.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
resignations special
correspondent charlene hunter
goal sat down with

23:21.400 --> 23:26.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Columbia University Teachers
College professor darold sooo to
learn more

23:26.405 --> 23:31.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the small slight that some
say are more insidious than the
overt racial

23:31.810 --> 23:37.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tensions that could be seen and
observed by all here's that
conversation with

23:37.316 --> 23:42.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is sooo thank you for
joining us so tell me just what
exactly is Mike

23:42.021 --> 23:44.523 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
regression

23:44.523 --> 23:53.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
micro aggressions are varying
from being conscious deliberate
on a continuum to

23:53.032 --> 23:58.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being outside once the level of
awareness and unintentional
micro

23:58.537 --> 24:03.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
aggressions really are
reflections of worldviews of
inclusion exclusion

24:03.642 --> 24:11.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
superiority or inferiority and
they come out ways that are
outside the level of

24:11.383 --> 24:17.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conscious awareness of an
individual when I'm asked where
were you born and I

24:17.556 --> 24:22.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say I was born in Portland Ore
ego and they persist by $10 know
where you are

24:22.895 --> 24:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I'll SE Portland Oregon and
those who know what country were
you born out

24:27.900 --> 24:33.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I'll see the United States
get very embarrassed now this is
an example that

24:33.972 --> 24:40.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are intending to make a
personal connection but the
human communication

24:40.179 --> 24:46.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the true world view is that I am
a perpetual alien or foreigner
in my

24:46.518 --> 24:53.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country I am NOT a true American
because true Americans only
looked the following

24:53.659 --> 25:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way and that's what generates
these micro aggressions but you
describe it is

25:01.900 --> 25:06.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unintentional and yet we've seen
at the University of Missouri
very blatant

25:06.872 --> 25:09.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
examples of racism

25:09.842 --> 25:16.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
right about that micro
aggressions very being conscious
deliberate intention of

25:16.615 --> 25:24.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from old-fashioned racism and
bias tape but to the
unintentional consequences in

25:24.256 --> 25:30.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our studies to indicate that
it's the unintentional forms of
buyers that are

25:30.629 --> 25:36.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most damaging to people of color
and that like at the University
of Missouri

25:36.468 --> 25:42.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would you have people being
caused racial epithets or
behaviors that are

25:42.908 --> 25:50.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going on actually is only the
tip of the iceberg reason why I
believe students of

25:50.582 --> 26:00.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
color faculty of color are
reacting and such a way that
they are experiencing a

26:00.659 --> 26:09.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
climate that is hostile that is
full of micro aggressions on
campus are

26:09.201 --> 26:15.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
triggering off this discontent
pain and feeling of being
silenced their critics

26:15.774 --> 26:21.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of your studies and the notion
even of Michael aggression which
they stay have

26:21.180 --> 26:28.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more from 1917 with it was
unintentional to now everything
that happens and that

26:28.120 --> 26:32.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people are just being overly
sensitive they think if you got
all these students

26:32.658 --> 26:36.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on campus how does that prepare
them to live in the real world
you know the

26:36.762 --> 26:43.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
problem is that people believe
micro aggressions are very
similar to the

26:43.735 --> 26:50.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everyday and root us that
individuals white americans
experience in their

26:50.242 --> 26:56.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day-to-day lives they are quite
different micro aggressions for
people

26:56.048 --> 27:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of color are constant continual
and cumulative they occurred to
people of

27:02.488 --> 27:08.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
color from the moment of birth
to when they die and as a result
any one

27:08.594 --> 27:14.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
microgram isolation may
represent the feather that
breaks the camel's back and

27:14.766 --> 27:17.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people who don't see

27:17.836 --> 27:22.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see the lived experience of
people of color and the daily
onslaught that they

27:22.808 --> 27:28.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
experienced tend not to believe
that has some major you know
there's another

27:28.447 --> 27:34.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
criticism because this is Ben
called some of the things that
people call now

27:34.820 --> 27:40.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they say that inward and things
like that is hate speech and
that it's

27:40.125 --> 27:44.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
protected by the First
Amendment so in that ok

27:44.630 --> 27:50.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given that kind of reasoning
that people who say that we are
preventing

27:50.936 --> 27:57.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
individuals from free speech
don't realize how ironically the
people of

27:57.075 --> 28:03.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
color that historically have not
been able to express themselves
openly and

28:03.982 --> 28:10.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
freely without punitive actions
being directed at and so there
has to be this

28:10.055 --> 28:15.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
balanced but at the same time
and understanding that there are
limits to

28:15.460 --> 28:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
free speech when it harms hurts
people why do you think that
students commit

28:21.033 --> 28:25.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
micro aggressions or
adults for that matter

28:25.571 --> 28:30.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
general that's a good question
and I think it goes to the heart
of the matter

28:30.342 --> 28:35.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that none of us are immune from
inheriting the racial bias ease
of our

28:35.847 --> 28:42.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forbearers we have attitudes and
policies that are delivered
through

28:42.921 --> 28:48.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
micro aggressions but when some
of these micro aggressions come
out in the form

28:48.760 --> 28:56.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of real hatred is that solvable
we can deal with that
deliberately but the

28:56.101 --> 29:02.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
subtle forms of micro
aggressions are hard to prove
hard to quantify in some

29:02.107 --> 29:07.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way and very difficult for us to
take actions against because
people

29:07.279 --> 29:14.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oftentimes don't proceed as
harmful significant you know
people oftentimes

29:14.853 --> 29:20.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tell me that white americans are
the enemy not white americans
are the enemy

29:20.025 --> 29:25.197 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
white supremacy
social conditioning

29:25.197 --> 29:30.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the superiority of one group
over another and many white
Americans are

29:30.969 --> 29:37.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
equally victimized because they
have been socialized into a
society that

29:37.175 --> 29:43.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tends to view them with these
jurors that they believe it but
it's no fault

29:43.115 --> 29:50.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of their own if you really rich
white americans they can become
valuable

29:50.856 --> 29:56.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allies one of the reasons why
are some research concentrates
on the

29:56.628 --> 30:03.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unintentional forums microbe
russians is very much what Maya
Angelou said it's

30:03.735 --> 30:10.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the unintentional by our staff
does the greatest harm to people
of color and I

30:10.275 --> 30:15.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
often times you see example that
you know when you look at the
disparities

30:15.480 --> 30:21.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then we have in education
employment and health care is
not due to the over

30:21.953 --> 30:28.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
racist white supremacist due to
the well intentioned teachers
who educate our

30:28.427 --> 30:30.796 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
children

30:30.796 --> 30:38.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
employers who decide who to hire
who to retain and who to promote
that those

30:38.603 --> 30:44.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
individuals who are unaware of
their hidden bias sees that are
having a major

30:44.776 --> 30:53.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
impact on our standard of living
and you can find more about

this week we have seen

31:32.057 --> 31:36.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shift in the 2016 race for

31:46.738 --> 31:50.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for both parties so far

24,000 people and Boston 27,000

for him to

31:56.047 --> 32:01.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
standard campaign

32:01.553 --> 32:06.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but his headline now center on a
different set of numbers the
polling

32:06.057 --> 32:09.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let's take a look at Iowa in
September Sanders was on the
rise but he had ups

32:09.961 --> 32:12.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and downs since then

32:12.264 --> 32:17.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meantime Hillary Clinton is
pulling ahead now by more than
20 points

32:17.536 --> 32:21.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
according to poll averages there
and in New Hampshire right next
door to

32:21.473 --> 32:26.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
standard home state of Vermont
he had a ten point lead in
September now he and

32:26.878 --> 32:32.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clinton are virtually tied as
Sanders numbers shift no
accident so does his

32:32.184 --> 32:35.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strategy it's true we've entered
a different phase of the
campaign that's

32:35.921 --> 32:40.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tad devine the strategist behind
Bernie Sanders campaign he says
the campaign

32:40.458 --> 32:45.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now needs to get beyond the big
crowd energy got to balance it
with the need

32:45.330 --> 32:49.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
particularly states to be
accessible to talk directly to
voters in to deliver

32:49.467 --> 32:53.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his message to people who we can
persuade one way to do that

32:53.338 --> 32:59.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
traditional and money on TV this
month Sanders launched his first
TV ad

32:59.544 --> 33:04.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign two million dollars on
this sixty second spot including
a

33:04.182 --> 33:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
biographical touch that is not
in his stump speech the son of a
Polish

33:07.085 --> 33:08.353 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immigrant

33:08.353 --> 33:11.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a brooklyn tenement

33:11.223 --> 33:16.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he went the added area and Iowa
and New Hampshire and it came
three months after

33:16.027 --> 33:21.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clinton launched her first TV
spots there and speaking of
clinton sanders is

33:21.099 --> 33:26.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing more of that two months he
was the No attacks candidate
this campaign that

33:26.404 --> 33:31.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am running let me reiterate is
not against Hillary Clinton or
anybody else

33:31.243 --> 33:45.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even avoided taking a shot in
their October debate and that is
now he's

33:45.023 --> 33:48.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting more aggressive and more
critical differences between
Hillary

33:48.627 --> 33:51.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton and myself

33:51.463 --> 33:57.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charms disagree with Hillary
Clinton on many many issues as
his campaign tries

33:57.836 --> 34:00.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to find the right formula some
political observers point out
Sanders has two

34:00.705 --> 34:02.841 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
goals

34:02.841 --> 34:07.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the white house and his agenda
Brown is a professor at George
Washington

34:07.812 --> 34:13.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
University the real win for
Sanders isn't that he personally
win it said his

34:13.385 --> 34:21.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ideas become more accepted and
more kind of diffused across the
Democratic Party

34:21.293 --> 34:26.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he really wants voters to
appreciate who he is what he
believes and why it is

34:26.965 --> 34:30.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
important for them

34:30.135 --> 34:35.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanders has two and a half
months before the Iowa caucuses
when voters go away

Republican donald Trump made
news last night for a ninety
five minute long

34:46.651 --> 34:52.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speech in Fort Dodge Iowa that
was full of attacks including
apparently on

34:52.223 --> 34:56.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

starting with Trump's words
about rival ben

people of Iowa

35:54.719 --> 36:02.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how stupid are the people of the
country to believe this from
that we turn now to

36:02.160 --> 36:06.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shields in gerson whom I spoke
with earlier tonight syndicated
columnist

36:06.464 --> 36:10.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark shields and Washington Post
columnist Michael Gerson David
Brooks is

36:10.869 --> 36:18.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away so gentlemen this is a fast
moving stories still very much
we know

36:18.309 --> 36:21.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president alone has closed the
borders of france has called it
an emergency and

36:21.746 --> 36:24.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
markets a reminder
that even though

36:24.949 --> 36:27.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foreign policy defense policy
has not been front and center I
think of the

36:27.919 --> 36:32.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
minds of most Americans
something can change in an
instant

36:32.424 --> 36:36.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
question judy and that ministers
since a shock but increasing
awareness of

36:36.261 --> 36:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vulnerability and I think that's
what the reaction and
understandable reaction

36:42.500 --> 36:47.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a most people beyond
the obvious sympathy

36:47.172 --> 36:51.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and said so outrageous that
people have done it and sympathy
for those who are

36:51.609 --> 36:57.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suffering but does the suburban
mobility and it's clear at this
point it would be

36:57.048 --> 37:01.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the President Obama
administration officials have
said Michael there's no

37:01.019 --> 37:04.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
indication of an immediate
threat to the United States but
of course that's

37:04.956 --> 37:09.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's where you're thinking
goes well this is one of the
strategies of

37:09.160 --> 37:14.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
al-qaida like organization
spectacular attacks designed to
demoralise countries

37:14.632 --> 37:20.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this was true with us' to
Britain in 2005 with the
underground attack and

37:20.738 --> 37:25.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's true in France now but it
doesn't work you know we've
actually hardens

37:25.176 --> 37:30.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
resolve and France is playing an
important role in the Middle
East I i

37:30.081 --> 37:37.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think that they're not gonna be
deterred from that we will
continue to monitor it

37:37.322 --> 37:43.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it is it's disturbing at the
very least horrific as the scale
of it unfold

37:43.294 --> 37:46.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so let's turn back to the
campaign mark we just heard a
little bit of what

37:46.998 --> 37:52.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump had to say and that
really surprising speech that he
made last

37:52.370 --> 37:56.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
night in iowa what are we to
make of this he went after Ben
Carson he went

37:56.674 --> 38:02.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
after many of the other
candidate you some very very
tough language I don't

38:02.347 --> 38:04.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
know what to make of it

38:04.549 --> 38:09.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
48 hours he went from the
Milwaukee debate where he was
subdued repetitive

38:09.454 --> 38:17.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
uninteresting donald Trump that
all the manhood generated such
great numbers for

38:17.462 --> 38:24.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these debates to ask reid in
Fort Dodge Iowa which he rated
salvaged if you

38:24.903 --> 38:26.804 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
would

38:26.804 --> 38:34.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr Carr said yes but candidate
george pataki Lindsey Graham
Marco Rubio Jeb

38:34.746 --> 38:42.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bush john Kasich everybody
basically accepted crews who was
spared but for

38:42.053 --> 38:46.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first time in a sense that
he wasn't talking about just
perceived

38:46.090 --> 38:50.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shortcomings whether it was low
energy sweat glands of a
candidate and people

38:50.562 --> 38:54.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
could kinda giggle

38:54.399 --> 39:00.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mischievous giggle I think he
made his people and comfortable
in that room

39:00.605 --> 39:06.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
especially going after Ben
Carson him is the best liked and
the most part based

39:06.244 --> 39:09.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the reactions of people
people there and the reports
that I have made it talk

39:09.814 --> 39:14.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking to people who were there
I do think that there was an
uncomfortable

39:14.686 --> 39:20.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about it and I don't know which
donald Trump is going to be
whether it's the

39:20.358 --> 39:26.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Milwaukee donald Trump which US
presidential quotes that he
didn't go

39:26.864 --> 39:30.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after anybody ever more elegant
the question is well the good
thing to this

39:30.668 --> 39:34.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
person who really sad

39:34.339 --> 39:41.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
basically accused ben Carson it
being a psychopath excuse me
what do you make of

39:41.012 --> 39:42.780 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it

39:42.780 --> 39:47.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well there are a lot of problems
with our presidential nomination
process but

39:47.585 --> 39:56.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it does overtime candidates
reveals them under pressure and
this was I think that

39:56.728 --> 40:01.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people have a democratic duty to
watch what what what took place
in those nine

40:01.199 --> 40:10.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
five minutes as much as you can
stomach was vile and vulgar and
vicious and

40:10.041 --> 40:18.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deformed this was a unbelievable
performance and I think
conservatives

40:18.182 --> 40:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are just have to have a tough
time defending this if this
isn't the line

40:21.252 --> 40:24.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
there's no lie

40:24.122 --> 40:28.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this was really the worst type
of politics and you will see
what the

40:28.559 --> 40:35.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
effect is he jumped the shark so
many times and avoid the
consequences but

40:35.199 --> 40:40.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
this really struck me as
something different is it is it
is it worth even

40:40.571 --> 40:46.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speculating about why is it just
just no way to know why he would
do that

40:46.744 --> 40:55.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attended in Carson the fact that
ben carson had inserted into our
leading in

40:55.586 --> 40:57.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the polls

40:57.989 --> 41:05.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think ben Carson is ahead in
iowa and register poll which is
sort of the goals

41:05.730 --> 41:09.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is is the gold standard and I i
think that is that's part of
Donald Trump's

41:09.967 --> 41:15.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
introduction of himself every
time I'm leaving all the polls
and I don't know

41:15.373 --> 41:20.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if he's bothered by that just
what it is that trumps biggest
strategic failure in

41:20.712 --> 41:25.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this speech he actually attacked
carson's religious conversion
said this

41:25.983 --> 41:32.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
isn't the way things happen that
is a central tenet of
evangelical beliefs the

41:32.056 --> 41:38.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possibility of redemption and
conversion I want was blind but
now IC by attacking

41:38.296 --> 41:44.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that in a very religious state
iowa I can't imagine what reason
there could be

41:44.068 --> 41:49.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this was this was a really just
illiteracy it also really showed
a

41:49.407 --> 41:53.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
hostility towards the
evangelical tradition that that
I can't explain that

41:53.311 --> 41:55.880 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at all

41:55.880 --> 42:00.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well let's turn to we just heard
that that really good report
from lisa days

42:00.051 --> 42:03.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're down and political
director about Bernie Sanders
and there seems to be

42:03.488 --> 42:11.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mark is trying a different tack
year he wants he is it that he
doesn't feel his

42:11.129 --> 42:16.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
message is getting across what
what is what do you think is
behind his problem

42:16.567 --> 42:21.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has always been the same Hillary
Clinton while she said
polarizing figure

42:21.305 --> 42:26.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nationally and has a ceiling as
pollsters say how high should go
is

42:26.411 --> 42:31.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enormously popular Democratic
primary voters and she has a big
national lead

42:31.048 --> 42:37.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
birdies and his best bet I i
think is always been a two-state
strategy it's

42:37.989 --> 42:42.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's necessity be the mother of
invention here they need to
compete we

42:42.860 --> 42:47.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can compete with the resources
would be up some parity and Iowa
and New

42:47.298 --> 42:50.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hampshire where he can happen
have a chance and to make the
case judy

42:50.067 --> 42:53.271 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
basically

42:53.271 --> 42:59.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not against her but a case of
who believe the trust who do you
think the

42:59.944 --> 43:06.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1% most most against who stood
up on the war in Iraq who stood
up against wall

43:06.884 --> 43:14.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
street when they were reminding
us really against the trade
pacts that have

43:14.425 --> 43:20.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cost americans jobs I think that
that is probably his best
strategy and to make

43:20.832 --> 43:23.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it a case of you know he's not
been a candidate of convenience
these indicate

43:23.734 --> 43:25.770 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a conviction

43:25.770 --> 43:30.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's also a reflection that a
couple in the last couple of
weeks

43:30.741 --> 43:34.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hillary Clinton has essentially
sewn up the Democratic
nomination when Joe Biden

43:34.846 --> 43:38.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't get in what she did very
well in her in the hearings guy
like she did

43:38.749 --> 43:43.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very well in the debates where
poll numbers stabilized and
began to go up i

43:43.654 --> 43:48.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mean she's in a commanding
position right now this is a
reaction to that I

43:48.626 --> 43:54.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't think that they are
accountants campaign is afraid
of Sanders I think

43:54.465 --> 44:00.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's afraid of James Comey FBI
director because that's where
the real threat

44:00.137 --> 44:05.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comes from that looks like the
expanding investigation over the
possibility of of

44:05.743 --> 44:10.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you know him during an
investigation and that I think
it's the real source of

44:10.882 --> 44:15.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concern I just had one thing to
do and that is if in fact bernie
sanders for

44:15.653 --> 44:19.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the win iowa and new hampshire
that changes the dynamic of the
race the

44:19.790 --> 44:25.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
inevitability Hillary Clinton or
anybody who just has taken a
beating are looking

44:25.897 --> 44:30.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the first two contests the
dynamic changes in that sense of
inevitability

44:30.535 --> 44:35.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's frayed it's not a rodent
and that's where he's really
focus right now

44:35.940 --> 44:42.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well i want to i want to ask you
both about the really what I
think it one of

44:42.980 --> 44:47.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the things that emerged from
that debate that you talked
about Michael Republican

44:47.385 --> 44:50.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate this weekend that is on
immigration you saw a clear
split

44:50.588 --> 44:54.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between those Republicans who
were arguing like Donald Trump
do everything

44:54.125 --> 44:57.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you can to keep to get

44:57.662 --> 45:00.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those who were here undocumented
immigrants out of the country
and those

45:00.731 --> 45:05.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the party who were saying
wait a minute that's doesn't
make sense yeah I

45:05.570 --> 45:08.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think clearly for republicans in
order to have a chance going
forward not just

45:08.873 --> 45:13.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
this election but future
elections because the nature
demographics you know

45:13.911 --> 45:18.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the candidate comes out of this
is going to have to repudiate
the idea of mass

45:18.683 --> 45:23.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deportations like it they're
gonna have to positively
distance themselves from

45:23.321 --> 45:26.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this and win so it's someone
like jab or someone like Ruby
our someone like john

45:26.857 --> 45:30.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kasich that can play that role

45:30.227 --> 45:35.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the question is whether the the
forces of really nativism within
the party can

45:35.499 --> 45:40.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
defeat them can make it
impossible for a viable
Republican to get the nomination

45:40.771 --> 45:47.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that's the main issue we're
going to see his marker you are
we now seeing the

45:47.912 --> 45:54.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
situation where if you're a
moderate Republican and you say
just enough to to

45:54.118 --> 45:58.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appeal to Hispanic voters that
maybe republicans have a shot
but have a

45:58.589 --> 46:04.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chance on the immigration issue
that we didn't see this to me is
suicidal on the

46:04.395 --> 46:10.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of republicans and we have
an increasingly minority America
the

46:10.968 --> 46:16.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican primary electorate
judy is six percent minority at
92% the general

46:16.974 --> 46:22.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election of the country in 2012
is 72% might be down 71 maybe
seventy and 26

46:22.146 --> 46:25.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
percent minority that's
what do you know

46:25.216 --> 46:29.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
African American Asian and
others and i just i just think
that they're playing

46:29.453 --> 46:35.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to an older whiter more
conservative electorate

46:35.726 --> 46:38.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican candidates are and I
will say this if immigration
that is opposition

46:38.629 --> 46:45.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to immigration categorical
just outspoken

46:45.169 --> 46:50.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
traveled opposition to
immigration of of sorts becomes
the litmus test of who

46:50.041 --> 46:56.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wins the republicans will lose
and I i would just disappear
Michaelis I think

Marco Rubio really faces a test
he's trying to have a keep
traveling east and

47:03.587 --> 47:10.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he was burned in that
process I had the best night
when he made the

47:10.628 --> 47:14.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economic populist targeting
those with lawyers and bankers
and journalists

47:14.865 --> 47:18.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coming across the Rio Grande
they'd be a concern that got to
have a job taken

finally tonight one of the
year's most acclaimed movies and
journalism behind

47:38.322 --> 47:40.124 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it

47:40.124 --> 47:44.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reporters frequently don't come
off well in the movies these
days but the new

47:44.195 --> 47:48.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
film opening in many cities this
weekend is built around the
investigative

47:48.199 --> 47:52.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
journalism that uncovered a
major scandal in the archdiocese
Catholic

47:52.770 --> 47:58.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Archdiocese of Boston the
fallout of that report in turn
triggered numerous

47:58.075 --> 48:01.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
other investigations and
revelations and other
archdioceses jeffrey Brown has
the

48:01.512 --> 48:03.848 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story

48:03.848 --> 48:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the numbers clearly indicate
that their senior involved it
was one major

48:07.752 --> 48:12.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
institution the hometown
newspaper taking on another the
Catholic Church we

48:12.556 --> 48:16.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need to focus on the institution
the individual priests practice
and policy

48:16.861 --> 48:22.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
show me this was systemic
it came from the top

48:22.967 --> 48:28.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Boston Globe's investigation
revealed that the church knew
about

48:28.773 --> 48:32.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sexual abuse of children by
priests and covered it up even
allowing guilty

48:32.710 --> 48:35.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
priests to keep their jobs

48:35.112 --> 48:38.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a recording this in any way
shape or form of nothing that's
the story of the

48:38.749 --> 48:40.785 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story

48:40.785 --> 48:45.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
director Tom McCarthy we became
fascinated with my new show with
the

48:45.256 --> 48:50.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
procedure with the craft of
journalism and I think early on
we committed to not

48:50.094 --> 48:54.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only writing but betraying that
is accurately as possible and I
think we

48:54.031 --> 48:57.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
felt and the rest of my creative
team felt that if we found it
exciting

48:57.401 --> 49:02.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hopefully our audience what the
NewsHour was there in Boston in
the spring of

49:02.339 --> 49:10.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2002 covering the case as it
unfolded efforts were led by
then editor Martin

49:10.014 --> 49:15.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Baron is new to the city and the
paper he had a column by a glow
brighter about

49:15.219 --> 49:20.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one case of abuse that was under
court seal an extraordinary
story here was a

49:20.191 --> 49:27.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
priest who had been accused by a
hundred and thirty people of
having abused them

49:27.031 --> 49:32.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as minors that was just an
extraordinary number in and of
itself and i was just

49:32.369 --> 49:36.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
struck by the fact that I hadn't
heard of this case I said we'll
be considered

49:36.407 --> 49:42.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
challenging that confidentiality
order I'd like to challenge the
protective

49:42.780 --> 49:48.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
order and they gave in case you
want to see the Catholic Church
which is filing

49:48.385 --> 49:56.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a motion but yes in the film
played by actor Liev Schreiber
do today Martin

49:56.327 --> 50:00.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Baron is editor of the
washington post he talked at
length to the filmmakers

50:00.898 --> 50:05.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about his experience in Boston
and told us have seen the
results I think this

50:05.436 --> 50:09.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
movie is quite authentic think
they they got the basics right
they really

50:09.773 --> 50:13.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
understood the subject matter
they understood how newsrooms
work and I

50:13.310 --> 50:16.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think that's one thing that
impressed a lot of journalists
is that they get the

50:16.013 --> 50:19.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
life of journalists
so right gets

50:19.550 --> 50:23.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's incredible we're not used
to seeing that in movies their
cover of stories on

50:23.354 --> 50:30.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saturday priests rabbis and
confirmation from either side

50:44.241 --> 50:49.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including the actions of a
priest named gahagan implicated
in many abuse cases

50:49.346 --> 50:54.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and his ultimate superior
cardinal bernard law then the
very prominent

50:54.418 --> 50:59.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leader of the Catholic Church in
Boston the spotlight reporters
called 18 years

of church directories to track
over 900 active and retired
priests the key man

51:04.995 --> 51:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
created a database which allowed
to match at Target least a
hundred priests

51:09.333 --> 51:14.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with allegations of abuse they
honed in on priests who had been
moved from a

unit for documents to
me were breathtaking

51:30.821 --> 51:36.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the extent to which they knew
the cordiality the
correspondence between

the Cardinals and other gahagan
and the other bishops and father

connect your thoughts McCarthy
says he and his team took great
care in how they

51:59.083 --> 52:07.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
would tell us not to
sensationalize the story with
the town to approach the

52:07.624 --> 52:10.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
report we had the great good
fortune of sitting down with
several survivors

52:10.794 --> 52:17.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
abuse namely to depicted in the
film Joe Crowley and Phil
Saviano

52:17.468 --> 52:23.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these men in the courage they
exemplify talking with us in
dealing with this

52:23.140 --> 52:27.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every day of our lives of their
lives and becoming advocates for
survivors

52:27.444 --> 52:33.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's it's hard not to be
greatly impressed by it

52:33.584 --> 52:38.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the scandal began to snowball
even as the church vehemently
pushed back the

52:38.288 --> 52:43.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
globe published its first story
on January 6 2002 with the
headline church

52:43.394 --> 52:48.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allowed abuse by priests for
years it also printed the phone
number of a

52:48.065 --> 52:53.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
confidential Colin line bringing
in many new allegations from
victims take us so

52:53.504 --> 53:01.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
long to see something that in
hindsight seems so obvious there
was a lot of talk

53:01.045 --> 53:04.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about this a lot of murmurs and
whisper something is going on
something as bad

53:04.581 --> 53:11.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the process of the film is
drawn comparison to all the
President's Men

53:11.021 --> 53:16.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
documented the Washington Post
pursuit of the Watergate scandal
forty years ago

53:16.026 --> 53:21.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that means also capturing the
changing world of newspapers at
a time of

53:21.598 --> 53:28.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cutbacks layoffs and closures
today bearing says this where a
profession

53:28.305 --> 53:33.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's under tremendous pressure
a lot of financial pressure so
clearly it's

53:33.477 --> 53:37.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to be more difficult given
that there are fewer resources
to do it this

53:37.347 --> 53:42.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is very expensive work to do and
yet we have to commit ourselves
to doing it

53:42.252 --> 53:45.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
somebody needs to hold powerful
institutions and individuals
accountable

53:45.722 --> 53:51.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and we're the ones who have that
particular role in our society
