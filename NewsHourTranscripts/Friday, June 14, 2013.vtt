IN THE DIRECTION THAT IT'S
GOING.

24:22.893 --> 24:24.683
IN THE DIRECTION THAT IT'S
GOING.
AND SECONDLY, WE --

24:24.684 --> 24:25.712
GOING.
AND SECONDLY, WE --

24:25.714 --> 24:26.806
AND SECONDLY, WE --
>> Brown: DOES THAT INCLUDE
WITH WEAPONS AND EVEN MORE

24:26.809 --> 24:28.532
>> Brown: DOES THAT INCLUDE
WITH WEAPONS AND EVEN MORE
WEAPONS THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR?

24:28.534 --> 24:29.892
WITH WEAPONS AND EVEN MORE
WEAPONS THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR?
>> WELL, IT WOULD REQUIRE MORE

24:29.894 --> 24:31.684
WEAPONS THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR?
>> WELL, IT WOULD REQUIRE MORE
WEAPONS THAN WE HAVE ANNOUNCED.

24:31.686 --> 24:33.973
>> WELL, IT WOULD REQUIRE MORE
WEAPONS THAN WE HAVE ANNOUNCED.
IT ALSO WOULD REQUIRE PROBABLY A

24:33.975 --> 24:36.263
WEAPONS THAN WE HAVE ANNOUNCED.
IT ALSO WOULD REQUIRE PROBABLY A
STRATEGY ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING

24:36.265 --> 24:38.087
IT ALSO WOULD REQUIRE PROBABLY A
STRATEGY ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING
TO -- WHO WE'RE GOING TO GIVE

24:38.089 --> 24:39.813
STRATEGY ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING
TO -- WHO WE'RE GOING TO GIVE
THE WEAPONS TO, HOW WE'RE GOING

THE WEAPONS TO, HOW WE'RE GOING
TO GIVE IT.

24:40.776 --> 24:42.468
THE WEAPONS TO, HOW WE'RE GOING
TO GIVE IT.
AND I THINK LARGER ISSUE IS OUR

24:42.469 --> 24:43.595
TO GIVE IT.
AND I THINK LARGER ISSUE IS OUR
CREDIBILITY, THE CREDIBILITY OF

24:43.596 --> 24:45.685
AND I THINK LARGER ISSUE IS OUR
CREDIBILITY, THE CREDIBILITY OF
AMERICAN FOREIGN PCY

24:45.687 --> 24:47.909
CREDIBILITY, THE CREDIBILITY OF
AMERICAN FOREIGN PCY
AT STAKE AND THEN WE HAVE TO

24:47.911 --> 24:49.435
AMERICAN FOREIGN PCY
AT STAKE AND THEN WE HAVE TO
ESSENTIALLY USE ANY KIND OF

24:49.437 --> 24:50.862
AT STAKE AND THEN WE HAVE TO
ESSENTIALLY USE ANY KIND OF
INTERVENTION TO REVERSE THAT.

24:50.863 --> 24:51.891
ESSENTIALLY USE ANY KIND OF
INTERVENTION TO REVERSE THAT.
>> Brown: WHAT DO YOU THINK

24:51.893 --> 24:53.583
INTERVENTION TO REVERSE THAT.
>> Brown: WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT A STRONG -- MORE WEAPONS,

24:53.585 --> 24:55.308
>> Brown: WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT A STRONG -- MORE WEAPONS,
A STRONGER INVOLVEMENT AND THIS

24:55.309 --> 24:56.801
ABOUT A STRONG -- MORE WEAPONS,
A STRONGER INVOLVEMENT AND THIS
QUESTION OF OUR CREDIBILITY AT

A STRONGER INVOLVEMENT AND THIS
QUESTION OF OUR CREDIBILITY AT
THIS POINT?

24:57.732 --> 24:58.825
QUESTION OF OUR CREDIBILITY AT
THIS POINT?
YOU RAISED THE RED LINE

24:58.827 --> 24:59.190
THIS POINT?
YOU RAISED THE RED LINE
QUESTION.

24:59.191 --> 25:01.214
YOU RAISED THE RED LINE
QUESTION.

OF ALL.
AS WE KNOW, THERE ARE A GREAT

OF ALL.
AS WE KNOW, THERE ARE A GREAT
MANY FACTIONS COMPETING FOR

AS WE KNOW, THERE ARE A GREAT
MANY FACTIONS COMPETING FOR
POWER ON THE GROUND IN SYRIA AND

MANY FACTIONS COMPETING FOR
POWER ON THE GROUND IN SYRIA AND
MOST OF THEM ARE NOT VERY

POWER ON THE GROUND IN SYRIA AND
MOST OF THEM ARE NOT VERY
FRIENDLY TO US.

25:08.980 --> 25:10.205
MOST OF THEM ARE NOT VERY
FRIENDLY TO US.
SO WEAPONS FOR WHOM?

25:10.206 --> 25:12.296
FRIENDLY TO US.
SO WEAPONS FOR WHOM?
IT SO HAPPENS, UNFORTUNATELY,

25:12.298 --> 25:14.320
SO WEAPONS FOR WHOM?
IT SO HAPPENS, UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT THOSE FACTIONS WHICH WE

DEMOCRATIC ARE THE WEAKEST.

25:17.607 --> 25:18.964
CONSIDER TO BE ALLEGEDLY
DEMOCRATIC ARE THE WEAKEST.
SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO

25:18.967 --> 25:20.425
DEMOCRATIC ARE THE WEAKEST.
SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO
ACCOMPLISH BY INFUSING A FEW

25:20.427 --> 25:21.653
SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO
ACCOMPLISH BY INFUSING A FEW
MORE ARMS FOR GROUPS THAT ARE

ACCOMPLISH BY INFUSING A FEW
MORE ARMS FOR GROUPS THAT ARE
THE WEAKEST?

25:23.281 --> 25:25.801
MORE ARMS FOR GROUPS THAT ARE
THE WEAKEST?
IF WE'RE GOING TO ENGAGE IN

25:25.802 --> 25:27.426
THE WEAKEST?
IF WE'RE GOING TO ENGAGE IN
POLITICAL WARFARE WITH A

MIGHT WE CONCEIVABLY COLLIDE

SYRIA.
MIGHT WE CONCEIVABLY COLLIDE
WITH THE IRANIAN FORCES?

25:53.508 --> 25:55.363
MIGHT WE CONCEIVABLY COLLIDE
WITH THE IRANIAN FORCES?
DO WE REALLY WANT THAT AT THIS

WITH THE IRANIAN FORCES?
DO WE REALLY WANT THAT AT THIS
STAGE OF HISTORY IN THE MIDDLE

25:57.224 --> 26:00.274
DO WE REALLY WANT THAT AT THIS
STAGE OF HISTORY IN THE MIDDLE
EAST AS WE ARE GETTING READY TO

26:00.276 --> 26:02.132
STAGE OF HISTORY IN THE MIDDLE
EAST AS WE ARE GETTING READY TO
DISENGAGE FROM AFGHANISTAN?

26:02.134 --> 26:02.928

>> Brown: WHAT'S THE RESPONSE

26:02.930 --> 26:03.526
DISENGAGE FROM AFGHANISTAN?
>> Brown: WHAT'S THE RESPONSE
TO THAT?

26:03.528 --> 26:05.118
>> Brown: WHAT'S THE RESPONSE
TO THAT?
>> THOSE ARE ALL DANGERS ARE

26:05.120 --> 26:06.446
TO THAT?
>> THOSE ARE ALL DANGERS ARE
THAT ARE ON THE TABLE THAT WE

>> THOSE ARE ALL DANGERS ARE
THAT ARE ON THE TABLE THAT WE
HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION.

26:10.296 --> 26:12.351
THAT ARE ON THE TABLE THAT WE
HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION.
THE SYRIA CRISIS HAS NOW BECOME

26:12.353 --> 26:14.641
HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION.
THE SYRIA CRISIS HAS NOW BECOME
VERY COMPLEX WITH MANY ISSUES

26:14.642 --> 26:16.864
THE SYRIA CRISIS HAS NOW BECOME
VERY COMPLEX WITH MANY ISSUES
THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SORT

26:16.866 --> 26:18.058
VERY COMPLEX WITH MANY ISSUES
THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SORT
OUT AND ADDRESS.

26:18.060 --> 26:20.547
THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SORT
OUT AND ADDRESS.
BUT GOING FORWARD, YOU KNOW,

26:20.549 --> 26:21.808
OUT AND ADDRESS.
BUT GOING FORWARD, YOU KNOW,
ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE DEALING WITH

26:21.810 --> 26:23.168
BUT GOING FORWARD, YOU KNOW,
ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE DEALING WITH
DYNAMICS OF TWO SEPARATE WARS

26:23.170 --> 26:24.495
ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE DEALING WITH
DYNAMICS OF TWO SEPARATE WARS
AND TWO SEPARATE ISSUES HERE.

26:24.497 --> 26:26.619
DYNAMICS OF TWO SEPARATE WARS
AND TWO SEPARATE ISSUES HERE.
ONE IS THE WAR BETWEEN THE

26:26.621 --> 26:28.145
AND TWO SEPARATE ISSUES HERE.
ONE IS THE WAR BETWEEN THE
REBELS AND OPPOSITION AND THE

26:28.147 --> 26:29.074
ONE IS THE WAR BETWEEN THE
REBELS AND OPPOSITION AND THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IN WHICH WE

26:29.076 --> 26:30.700
REBELS AND OPPOSITION AND THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IN WHICH WE
HAVE SAID THAT WE WOULD LIKE THE

26:30.702 --> 26:31.596
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IN WHICH WE
HAVE SAID THAT WE WOULD LIKE THE
REBELS TO WIN.

26:31.598 --> 26:33.985
HAVE SAID THAT WE WOULD LIKE THE
REBELS TO WIN.
THE SECOND ONE IS REALLY THE WAR

26:33.987 --> 26:35.543
REBELS TO WIN.
THE SECOND ONE IS REALLY THE WAR
BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT FACTIONS

26:35.546 --> 26:37.235
THE SECOND ONE IS REALLY THE WAR
BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT FACTIONS
WITHIN THE OPPOSITION.

26:37.238 --> 26:39.857
BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT FACTIONS
WITHIN THE OPPOSITION.
THE JIHADIS AND THE EXTREMISTS

26:39.859 --> 26:41.184
WITHIN THE OPPOSITION.
THE JIHADIS AND THE EXTREMISTS
VIS-A-VIS THE OTHER ONES.

26:41.187 --> 26:43.240
THE JIHADIS AND THE EXTREMISTS
VIS-A-VIS THE OTHER ONES.
SO THE KEY QUESTION IS WHICH ONE

26:43.243 --> 26:44.569
VIS-A-VIS THE OTHER ONES.
SO THE KEY QUESTION IS WHICH ONE
ARE WE TRYING TO INFLUENCE?

26:44.571 --> 26:46.063
SO THE KEY QUESTION IS WHICH ONE
ARE WE TRYING TO INFLUENCE?
ARE WE TRYING TO INFLUENCE

26:46.065 --> 26:48.153
ARE WE TRYING TO INFLUENCE?
ARE WE TRYING TO INFLUENCE
GENERALLY THE REBELS AS IT

26:48.155 --> 26:49.645
ARE WE TRYING TO INFLUENCE
GENERALLY THE REBELS AS IT
STANDS AGAINST ASSAD, WHICH HAS

26:49.646 --> 26:55.386
GENERALLY THE REBELS AS IT
STANDS AGAINST ASSAD, WHICH HAS
ALL THE DANGERS AND PROBLEMSZINU

26:55.388 --> 26:55.651
STANDS AGAINST ASSAD, WHICH HAS
ALL THE DANGERS AND PROBLEMSZINU
ARM?

26:55.654 --> 26:57.111
ALL THE DANGERS AND PROBLEMSZINU
ARM?
HOW DO YOU ARM THEM WHAT IS THE

26:57.113 --> 26:58.571
ARM?
HOW DO YOU ARM THEM WHAT IS THE
DANGERS OF HAVING TO CONFRONT

26:58.573 --> 27:00.097
HOW DO YOU ARM THEM WHAT IS THE
DANGERS OF HAVING TO CONFRONT
THE IRANIANS AND THE RUSSIANS.

27:00.099 --> 27:01.823
DANGERS OF HAVING TO CONFRONT
THE IRANIANS AND THE RUSSIANS.
AND THE OTHER ARGUMENT IS

27:01.825 --> 27:03.315
THE IRANIANS AND THE RUSSIANS.
AND THE OTHER ARGUMENT IS
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ASSAD

27:03.317 --> 27:04.444
AND THE OTHER ARGUMENT IS
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ASSAD
SURVIVES AND LEAVES, THERE'S

27:04.446 --> 27:05.572
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ASSAD
SURVIVES AND LEAVES, THERE'S
GOING TO BE A BATTLE BETWEEN

27:05.574 --> 27:06.700
SURVIVES AND LEAVES, THERE'S
GOING TO BE A BATTLE BETWEEN
DIFFERENT FACTIONS OF THE

27:06.702 --> 27:07.728
GOING TO BE A BATTLE BETWEEN
DIFFERENT FACTIONS OF THE
SYRIANS AND THE QUESTION IS DO

27:07.731 --> 27:09.421
DIFFERENT FACTIONS OF THE
SYRIANS AND THE QUESTION IS DO
WE WANT TO ARM A FACTION OF THE

27:09.423 --> 27:10.682
SYRIANS AND THE QUESTION IS DO
WE WANT TO ARM A FACTION OF THE
SYRIANS THAT WOULD BE THE

27:10.684 --> 27:12.407
WE WANT TO ARM A FACTION OF THE
SYRIANS THAT WOULD BE THE
COUNTERPOINT TO THE JIHADIS?

27:12.409 --> 27:13.999
SYRIANS THAT WOULD BE THE
COUNTERPOINT TO THE JIHADIS?
IF SO, IS THIS THE RIGHT TIME TO

27:14.001 --> 27:16.322
COUNTERPOINT TO THE JIHADIS?
IF SO, IS THIS THE RIGHT TIME TO
START BUILDING THOSE RELATIONS?

27:16.323 --> 27:17.881
IF SO, IS THIS THE RIGHT TIME TO
START BUILDING THOSE RELATIONS?
>> Brown: IS THERE AN

27:17.883 --> 27:18.312
START BUILDING THOSE RELATIONS?
>> Brown: IS THERE AN
ALTERNATIVE?

27:18.315 --> 27:20.403
>> Brown: IS THERE AN
ALTERNATIVE?
BECAUSE IF THE U.S. DOES LITTLE

27:20.405 --> 27:22.825
ALTERNATIVE?
BECAUSE IF THE U.S. DOES LITTLE
OR NOTHING AND THE SYRIAN

27:22.827 --> 27:24.617
BECAUSE IF THE U.S. DOES LITTLE
OR NOTHING AND THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT WINS-- AS NOW THE

27:24.619 --> 27:25.778
OR NOTHING AND THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT WINS-- AS NOW THE
BATTLEFIELD PERHAPS LOOKS LIKE

27:25.779 --> 27:27.835
GOVERNMENT WINS-- AS NOW THE
BATTLEFIELD PERHAPS LOOKS LIKE
IT'S BEEN TURNED-- DOESN'T THAT

27:27.837 --> 27:28.997
BATTLEFIELD PERHAPS LOOKS LIKE
IT'S BEEN TURNED-- DOESN'T THAT
AFFECT OUR INTEREST IN THE

27:28.999 --> 27:30.092
IT'S BEEN TURNED-- DOESN'T THAT
AFFECT OUR INTEREST IN THE
REGION AND THE WORLD AS WELL.

27:30.094 --> 27:31.618
AFFECT OUR INTEREST IN THE
REGION AND THE WORLD AS WELL.
>> WELL, OF COURSE IT DOESN'T

27:31.620 --> 27:32.712
REGION AND THE WORLD AS WELL.
>> WELL, OF COURSE IT DOESN'T
AFFECT THEM POSITIVELY.

27:32.715 --> 27:34.438
>> WELL, OF COURSE IT DOESN'T
AFFECT THEM POSITIVELY.
BUT WE HAVE TO THINK OF THE

27:34.440 --> 27:35.632
AFFECT THEM POSITIVELY.
BUT WE HAVE TO THINK OF THE
ALTERNATIVE CONSEQUENCES.

27:35.634 --> 27:38.818
BUT WE HAVE TO THINK OF THE
ALTERNATIVE CONSEQUENCES.
IF WE GET INVOLVED IN A

27:38.820 --> 27:39.879
ALTERNATIVE CONSEQUENCES.
IF WE GET INVOLVED IN A
PROTRACTED WAR, WE ARE AGAIN IN

27:39.881 --> 27:41.008
IF WE GET INVOLVED IN A
PROTRACTED WAR, WE ARE AGAIN IN
A WAR IN THE REGION.

27:41.010 --> 27:43.695
PROTRACTED WAR, WE ARE AGAIN IN
A WAR IN THE REGION.
THIS HURTS US ALSO IN

27:43.697 --> 27:44.127
A WAR IN THE REGION.
THIS HURTS US ALSO IN
AFGHANISTAN.

27:44.128 --> 27:45.387
THIS HURTS US ALSO IN
AFGHANISTAN.
SECONDLY, THAT WAR PRODUCES A

27:45.389 --> 27:47.147
AFGHANISTAN.
SECONDLY, THAT WAR PRODUCES A
COLLISION BETWEEN AMERICA AND

27:47.149 --> 27:48.672
SECONDLY, THAT WAR PRODUCES A
COLLISION BETWEEN AMERICA AND
IRANIANS SUPPORTING ASSAD.

27:48.674 --> 27:51.260
COLLISION BETWEEN AMERICA AND
IRANIANS SUPPORTING ASSAD.
IS THAT BETTER THAN AN OUTCOME

27:51.262 --> 27:53.583
IRANIANS SUPPORTING ASSAD.
IS THAT BETTER THAN AN OUTCOME
IN WHICH PERHAPS ASSAD STAYS IN

27:53.584 --> 27:53.881
IS THAT BETTER THAN AN OUTCOME
IN WHICH PERHAPS ASSAD STAYS IN
POWER?

27:53.884 --> 27:55.506
IN WHICH PERHAPS ASSAD STAYS IN
POWER?
BETTER STILL, OF COURSE, AN

27:55.509 --> 27:58.461
POWER?
BETTER STILL, OF COURSE, AN
INTERNATIONAL GENEVA CONFERENCE.

27:58.463 --> 27:59.556
BETTER STILL, OF COURSE, AN
INTERNATIONAL GENEVA CONFERENCE.
BUT LET'S JUST THINK OF WHO

27:59.558 --> 28:00.352
INTERNATIONAL GENEVA CONFERENCE.
BUT LET'S JUST THINK OF WHO
OUGHT TO BE THERE.

28:00.353 --> 28:01.612
BUT LET'S JUST THINK OF WHO
OUGHT TO BE THERE.
SHOULD WE BE THERE WITH THE

28:01.614 --> 28:02.607
OUGHT TO BE THERE.
SHOULD WE BE THERE WITH THE
FRENCH AND THE BRITISH?

28:02.609 --> 28:04.598
SHOULD WE BE THERE WITH THE
FRENCH AND THE BRITISH?
THE TWO COUNTRIES WHICH ARE MOST

28:04.599 --> 28:07.718
FRENCH AND THE BRITISH?
THE TWO COUNTRIES WHICH ARE MOST
HATED IN THE REGION THIS FORMER

28:07.720 --> 28:08.249
THE TWO COUNTRIES WHICH ARE MOST
HATED IN THE REGION THIS FORMER
COLONIAL POWERS?

28:08.251 --> 28:09.510
HATED IN THE REGION THIS FORMER
COLONIAL POWERS?
ARE THESE THE RIGHT COUNTRIES

28:09.512 --> 28:10.969
COLONIAL POWERS?
ARE THESE THE RIGHT COUNTRIES
WITH WHOM WE OUGHT TO BE

28:10.971 --> 28:11.301
ARE THESE THE RIGHT COUNTRIES
WITH WHOM WE OUGHT TO BE
DEALING?

28:11.303 --> 28:13.956
WITH WHOM WE OUGHT TO BE
DEALING?
OF COURSE TURKEY OUGHT TO BE

28:13.958 --> 28:14.288
DEALING?
OF COURSE TURKEY OUGHT TO BE
THERE.

28:14.290 --> 28:15.847
OF COURSE TURKEY OUGHT TO BE
THERE.
WHAT ABOUT CHINA?

28:15.849 --> 28:17.704
THERE.
WHAT ABOUT CHINA?
WHAT ABOUT JAPAN?

ALL OF WHICH ARE DEPENDENT ON A

THEY HAVE STAKES IN THAT REGION.
THEY MIGHT PREFER SOME ORTH OF A

28:28.722 --> 28:29.882
THEY HAVE STAKES IN THAT REGION.
THEY MIGHT PREFER SOME ORTH OF A
COMPROMISE SOLUTION AND MIGHT BE

28:29.884 --> 28:31.109
THEY MIGHT PREFER SOME ORTH OF A
COMPROMISE SOLUTION AND MIGHT BE
PREPARED TO GIVE THE POLITICAL

COMPROMISE SOLUTION AND MIGHT BE
PREPARED TO GIVE THE POLITICAL
SUPPORT FOR IT.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.764
PREPARED TO GIVE THE POLITICAL
SUPPORT FOR IT.
THEY MIGHT ALSO BE ABLE TO

SUPPORT FOR IT.
THEY MIGHT ALSO BE ABLE TO
INFLUENCE THE RUSSIANS.

28:34.861 --> 28:37.347
THEY MIGHT ALSO BE ABLE TO
INFLUENCE THE RUSSIANS.
BUT TO SIMPLY GO IN ON THE HOPE
