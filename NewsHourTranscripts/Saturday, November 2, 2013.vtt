05:20.600 --> 05:22.300
I THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA,

ACTUALLY

05:22.567 --> 05:24.467
WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND WE'R

05:24.467 --> 05:27.867
LOOKING AT ABOUT OVER 50,000

05:27.867 --> 05:29.000
SCREENERS THAT WERE NOT SELECTED

05:29.000 --> 05:29.933
ON THE BASIS OF THEIR ABILITY TO

05:29.933 --> 05:32.733
CARRY A WEAPON, AND IF A WEAPO

05:32.733 --> 05:34.900
WOULD HAVE TO BE USED, IT WOUL

05:34.900 --> 05:37.800
HAVE TO BE USED UNDER VERY

05:37.800 --> 05:39.567
EXTREME CONDITIONS, IN A

05:39.567 --> 05:41.433
EXTREMELY CROWDED AREA, WHER

05:41.433 --> 05:44.433
THE CARRYING THE WEAPON -- THE

05:44.433 --> 05:46.400
WEAPON USER COULD CAUSE MORE

05:46.400 --> 05:46.600
DAMAGE SOMETIMES THAN HELP, AN

05:46.600 --> 05:52.700
THAT REQUIRES BASI

05:52.700 --> 05:54.067
PREREQUISITES AND GOOD TRAININ

05:54.067 --> 05:55.500
AND A DEDICATED PERSON TO BE

05:55.500 --> 05:56.767
ABLE TO DO THAT.

05:56.767 --> 05:58.800
SO THE IDEA OF NOW TRYING TO

05:58.800 --> 06:01.433
CHANGE THE NATURE OF TSA

06:01.433 --> 06:03.067
SCREENERS FROM PEOPLE THAT WATCH

06:03.067 --> 06:05.333
FOR BEHAVIOR AND WATCH SCREENS

06:05.333 --> 06:08.300

06:08.300 --> 06:11.767

06:11.767 --> 06:14.233
THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE USIN

06:14.233 --> 06:15.800
THE WEAPON, IS NOT A GOOD IDEA

06:15.800 --> 06:16.600
>> ALL RIGHT

06:16.600 --> 06:19.167
SO SHOULD WE POSSIBLY MOVE THE

06:19.167 --> 06:20.600
SCREENING PROCESS OUTSIDE TH

06:20.600 --> 06:20.700
AIRPORT?

06:23.067 --> 06:23.767

06:23.767 --> 06:26.533
BUT IS THAT A SOLUTION

06:26.533 --> 06:28.700
>> WELL, OF COURSE, IT I

06:28.700 --> 06:30.267
INCONVENIENT, AND I DON'T THIN

06:30.267 --> 06:39.533
THAT THE ISRAELI MODE IS RIGHT

06:39.533 --> 06:40.367
FOR THE AMERICAN

06:40.367 --> 06:41.200
I DON'T THINK THE THREAT I

06:41.200 --> 06:41.433
SIMILAR TO THE ONE IN ISRAEL AND

06:41.433 --> 06:45.833
REQUIRES THE SAME, THE I WOULD

06:45.833 --> 06:48.233
SAY FAR-REACHING SOLUTIONS

17:15.667 --> 17:16.767
OVERALL VALUE FOR CUSTOMERS.

17:16.767 --> 17:18.467
SO IF THE FACE OF ALL THIS, HO

19:26.800 --> 19:29.733
IT'S CALLED, FIGURED OUT THERE

19:29.733 --> 19:31.600
ARE TWO IMPORTANT INGREDIENTS TO

19:31.600 --> 19:33.133
CREATING GENDER EQUALITY

19:33.133 --> 19:35.233
WHICH, BY THE WAY, ACTUALL

19:35.233 --> 19:37.433
PRODUCES GREATER ECONOMI

STABILITY AND GREATER OVERAL

19:39.433 --> 19:40.800
SOCIAL HEALTH.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.367
AND THOSE TWO INGREDIENTS ARE ON

19:43.367 --> 19:45.467
THE ONE HAND NOTIONS OF EQUA

19:45.467 --> 19:45.967
OPPORTUNITY AND THE ECONOMY, AND

19:45.967 --> 19:50.767
AT WORK, AND WHICH AMERICANS

19:50.767 --> 19:52.367
WOULD FIND VERY LITTLE FAULT

19:52.367 --> 19:52.633
WITH

19:52.633 --> 19:53.400
BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT

19:53.400 --> 19:56.967
EQUATION IS, THEY'VE ALS

19:56.967 --> 20:00.000
SUPPORTED NOTIONS OF FAMIL

20:00.000 --> 20:00.800
SUPPORT POLICIES

20:00.800 --> 20:01.867
THAT THEY WANT ALL THEIR

20:01.867 --> 20:03.633
FAMILIES TO BE HEALTHY, TO B

20:03.633 --> 20:06.233
ECONOMICALLY SECURE, AND TO HAVE

20:06.233 --> 20:08.067
AS MANY EARNERS AS POSSIBLE AN

20:08.067 --> 20:09.533
AS MANY CARETAKERS AS POSSIBLE

20:09.533 --> 20:12.500
SO THAT MEANS, NOT ONLY THAT

20:12.500 --> 20:14.167
THEY HAVE INCORPORATED WOMEN

20:14.167 --> 20:15.567
INTO THE WORKFORCE, THEY'V

20:15.567 --> 20:17.133
INCORPORATED MEN INTO THE HOME

20:17.133 --> 20:20.133
THEY HAVE VERY STRONG POLICIES

20:20.133 --> 20:21.200
THAT BRING MEN IN AS FATHERS

20:21.200 --> 20:24.667
AND FINALLY, THEY'VE ACCEPTE

20:24.667 --> 20:27.100
AND IN FACT, EMBRACED THE NOTION

20:27.100 --> 20:29.333
THAT FAMILIES ARE PART OF LARGER

20:29.333 --> 20:30.833
COMMUNITIES, AND GOOD CHILD CARE

20:30.833 --> 20:33.700
MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR WOMEN AN

20:33.700 --> 20:35.300
MEN TO GAIN MORE EQUALITY IN

HIGH LIFE EXPECTANCY

20:59.167 --> 21:00.167
ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN

21:00.167 --> 21:01.733
THE LESSON, WE ARE QUITE

THAT WELL COMPARED TO OTHE

21:28.433 --> 21:30.133
PARTICIPATION AND OPPORTUNITY.

21:36.900 --> 21:38.567
IT CAME TO FWHACH EQUALITY

21:38.567 --> 21:39.167

21:46.000 --> 21:47.167
WOMEN INTO THE WORKPLACE, BUT WE

21:47.167 --> 21:48.767
DIDN'T FOCUS AS MUCH ON WHAT

21:48.767 --> 21:50.467
HAPPENED TO THEM ONCE THEY GOT

21:50.467 --> 21:51.167
THERE.

21:51.167 --> 21:52.000
SO, YES.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.367
