JUDY WOODRUFF: We want to
introduce you to Alonzo King, a
noted choreographer who believes

00:09.833 --> 00:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dance improves our spirits,
and that in turn has a
direct effect on our health.

00:15.433 --> 00:16.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Take a look.

ALONZO KING, Choreographer:
My name is Alonzo King.

00:20.866 --> 00:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm the artistic director
of Alonzo King LINES Ballet.

00:24.533 --> 00:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a San Francisco-based
international touring
ballet company.

00:27.700 --> 00:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were invited to the Health
Festival here at Aspen, and
I brought four dancers from

00:34.766 --> 00:39.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the company to do a
demonstration and talk
about how health and
art are intertwined.

00:40.633 --> 00:44.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My mother took
dancing at university.

00:44.566 --> 00:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when I was a kid, she would
show me things, and I had a
blast with intimacy with my mom.

00:50.766 --> 00:55.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Plus, I loved moving,
so I never stopped.

00:55.200 --> 01:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a triumvirate of
body/mind/soul that is in
a balancing act for health.

01:05.333 --> 01:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If something is imbalanced, then
it's with - - it's dis-eased.

01:12.266 --> 01:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The performance that we do here
on Friday is largely a lecture
demonstration, displaying

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how dance is really ideas,
that it's thought made visible,
in the same way that music is

01:22.766 --> 01:26.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thought made audible.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Our hope is that the
mind will be stirred and
the heart will be moved.

01:31.733 --> 01:34.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And may argue with it.

01:34.566 --> 01:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You want them to hear it and
to have some response to it.

01:39.466 --> 01:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I first began
dancing, I had no idea
that it was a profession.

01:45.666 --> 01:49.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I just knew that it
was an experience

01:59.266 --> 02:04.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that mad
