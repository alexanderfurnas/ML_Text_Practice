00:13.380 --> 00:15.115
TURKEY BEGINS AIRSTRIKES AGAINST

00:15.115 --> 00:16.783
ISIS: WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE

00:16.783 --> 00:18.051
UNITED STATES.

00:18.051 --> 00:20.153
IS THE SO-CALLED SHARING ECONOMY

00:20.153 --> 00:22.222
REALLY WORKING FOR ITS WORKERS?

00:22.222 --> 00:23.490
>> I'M TRYING TO BE FLEXIBLE

00:23.490 --> 00:24.892
AROUND A PART-TIME JOB AND

00:24.892 --> 00:26.059
ANOTHER GIG AND ANOTHER GIG,

00:26.059 --> 00:27.227
BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FULL-

00:27.227 --> 00:28.395
TIME JOBS OUT THERE.

00:28.395 --> 00:29.630
>> Sreenivasan: AND, THE 50th

00:29.630 --> 00:31.298
ANNIVERSARY OF DYLAN GOING

00:31.298 --> 00:34.801
ELECTRIC.

00:34.801 --> 00:37.070
NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:37.070 --> 00:39.206
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS IN

00:39.206 --> 00:40.941
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:40.941 --> 00:42.676
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:42.676 --> 00:43.610
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING AND

00:43.610 --> 00:44.678
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.246
FOR THE FIRST TIME, TURKEY IS

00:46.246 --> 00:48.248
JOINING U.S.-LED AIRSTRIKES IN

00:48.248 --> 00:50.117
SYRIA, TARGETING ISLAMIC STATE

00:50.117 --> 00:51.952
EXTREMISTS, OR ISIS.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.487
THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT SAYS OVER

00:53.487 --> 00:55.088
THE LAST TWO DAYS ITS F-16

00:55.088 --> 00:56.657
AIRCRAFT HAVE ATTACKED MULTIPLE

00:56.657 --> 00:58.825
ISIS LOCATIONS, LESS THAN EIGHT

00:58.825 --> 01:00.494
MILES FROM TURKEY'S SOUTHERN

01:00.494 --> 01:02.195
BORDER WITH SYRIA.

01:02.195 --> 01:03.764
TURKEY'S STEPPED-UP ROLE FOLLOWS

01:03.764 --> 01:05.666
THIS WEEK'S SUICIDE BOMBING BY

01:05.666 --> 01:08.168
ISIS THAT KILLED 32 PEOPLE IN

01:08.168 --> 01:10.270
THE TURKISH TOWN OF SURUC.

01:10.270 --> 01:11.538
TURKISH FORCES HAVE ALSO

01:11.538 --> 01:13.006
ATTACKED KURDISH MILITANTS

01:13.006 --> 01:14.975
ACROSS THE BORDER WITH IRAQ.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.476
AT THE SAME TIME, THEY HAVE

01:16.476 --> 01:18.278
ARRESTED NEARLY 600 PEOPLE

01:18.278 --> 01:19.680
SUSPECTED OF BEING ISIS OR

01:19.680 --> 01:21.114
KURDISH MILITANTS.

01:21.114 --> 01:22.649
TURKEY'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS

01:22.649 --> 01:24.351
BOTH MILITARY OPERATIONS, IN

01:24.351 --> 01:27.187
SYRIA AND IRAQ, WILL CONTINUE.

01:27.187 --> 01:28.288
>> (translated): TURKEY'S

01:28.288 --> 01:29.356
OPERATIONS WILL, IF NEEDED,

01:29.356 --> 01:30.524
CONTINUE UNTIL THE TERROR

01:30.524 --> 01:32.259
ORGANIZATION'S COMMAND CENTERS,

01:32.259 --> 01:33.927
ALL LOCATIONS WHERE THEY PLAN

01:33.927 --> 01:35.896
ATTACKS AGAINST TURKEY, AND ALL

01:35.896 --> 01:37.931
DEPOTS USED TO STORE ARMS TO BE

01:37.931 --> 01:39.333
USED AGAINST TURKEY ARE

01:39.333 --> 01:40.534
DESTROYED.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.035
>> Sreenivasan: THE U.S. AND

01:42.035 --> 01:43.637
NATO HAVE PRESSURED TURKEY FOR

01:43.637 --> 01:44.972
MONTHS TO JOIN THE MILITARY

01:44.972 --> 01:47.040
COALITION AGAINST ISIS.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.408
SO WHAT DOES TURKEY'S NEW

01:48.408 --> 01:50.043
MILITARY ACTION MEAN?

01:50.043 --> 01:51.311
REUTERS REPORTER AYLA JEAN

01:51.311 --> 01:52.946
YACKLEY JOINS ME FROM ISTANBUL

01:52.946 --> 01:53.981
TO DISCUSS THAT.

01:53.981 --> 01:56.116
SO WHAT WAS IT THAT PUSHED

01:56.116 --> 01:57.985
TURKEY INTO THIS FIGHT?

01:57.985 --> 01:59.019
>> WELL, AS YOU MENTIONED,

01:59.019 --> 02:00.921
EARLIER THIS WEEK, THERE WAS A

02:00.921 --> 02:03.357
SUICIDE BOMB ATTACK IN A TOWN

02:03.357 --> 02:04.958
CALLED SURUC ACROSS THE BORDER

02:04.958 --> 02:08.729
FROM SYRIA, AND THAT SENT SHOCK

02:08.729 --> 02:10.430
WAVES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.466
THAT WAS NOT THE FIRST ATTACK BY

02:12.466 --> 02:13.633
ISLAMIC STATE ON TURKISH

02:13.633 --> 02:15.235
TERRITORY BUT IT WAS BY FAR THE

02:15.235 --> 02:17.471
MOST SIGNIFICANT AND DEADLIEST

02:17.471 --> 02:18.905
AND IT HAD TO BE A FACTOR IN

02:18.905 --> 02:21.408
TURKEY'S DECISION TO MOVE CLOSER

02:21.408 --> 02:24.378
IN ALLIANCE WITH THE ALLY, THE

02:24.378 --> 02:25.479
UNITED STATES.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.346
>> Sreenivasan: WE TALKED

02:26.346 --> 02:27.447
ABOUT TWO SET OF TARGETS HERE

02:27.447 --> 02:28.749
THAT TURKEY IS FOCUSING ON --

02:28.749 --> 02:31.485
ISIS AND KURDISH SEPARATISTS.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.452
THEY CALL THEM A TERRORIST

02:32.452 --> 02:33.387
ORGANIZATION.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.421
ONE PERSON'S TERRORIST

02:34.421 --> 02:35.489
ORGANIZATION IS ANOTHER PERSON'S

02:35.489 --> 02:36.356
FREEDOM FIGHTER, RIGHT.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.158
WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THAT

02:38.158 --> 02:39.493
FRONT?

02:39.493 --> 02:42.329
THE P.K.K. IS ALSO DEEMED A

02:42.329 --> 02:44.297
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION BY THE

02:44.297 --> 02:45.532
UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS THE

02:45.532 --> 02:48.368
EUROPEAN UNION.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.103
BUT THE P.K.K., OR AT LEAST

02:50.103 --> 02:52.072
FORCES ALLIED WITH THE P.K.K.,

02:52.072 --> 02:53.740
IN NORTHERN SYRIA HAVE BEEN

02:53.740 --> 02:54.875
COORDINATING WITH THE UNITED

02:54.875 --> 02:57.177
STATES IN ITS CAMPAIGN AGAINST

02:57.177 --> 02:59.146
ISLAMIC STATE, BUT TURKEY'S

02:59.146 --> 03:00.981
NEVER CHANGED ITS STANCE TOWARDS

03:00.981 --> 03:01.915
THE P.K.K.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.550
IT HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN A PEACE

03:03.550 --> 03:05.986
PROCESS WITH THE P.K.K., IN

03:05.986 --> 03:07.821
WHICH THERE'S BEEN VERY

03:07.821 --> 03:09.923
SLOW-MOVING TALKS BETWEEN THE

03:09.923 --> 03:12.959
TWO SIDES SINCE LATE 2012.

03:12.959 --> 03:14.795
HOWEVER, IT VERY MUCH CONSIDERS

03:14.795 --> 03:16.430
THEM A THREAT TO NATIONAL

03:16.430 --> 03:17.597
SECURITY.

03:17.597 --> 03:18.765
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT HAPPENS

03:18.765 --> 03:20.367
ON THE GROUND IN TURKEY

03:20.367 --> 03:21.802
ROUND-UP OF 600 DIFFERENT

03:21.802 --> 03:22.869
ARRESTS?

03:22.869 --> 03:24.304
WHAT DOES THAT DO TO THE KURDISH

03:24.304 --> 03:26.440
POPULATION IN THERE IN ISTANBUL

03:26.440 --> 03:27.808
OR OTHER PLACES?

03:27.808 --> 03:30.544
>> IT VERY MUCH ESCALATES

03:30.544 --> 03:33.180
TENSIONS AND CONCERNS?

03:33.180 --> 03:35.749
THE P.K.K. SAID THE STRIKES

03:35.749 --> 03:37.350
EFFECTIVELY END THE PEACE

03:37.350 --> 03:40.520
PROCESS, SO THERE'S A REAL FEAR

03:40.520 --> 03:41.888
THAT THINGS COULD TURN VIOLENT

03:41.888 --> 03:42.956
AGAIN.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.091
>> Sreenivasan: SO THIS IS

03:44.091 --> 03:46.426
ALSO ON THE HEELS OF THE U.S.

03:46.426 --> 03:48.095
KIND OF GETTING UPGRADED ACCESS

03:48.095 --> 03:49.796
TO TURKISH AIR BASSES ALONG THE

03:49.796 --> 03:51.098
BORDER WITH SYRIA.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.332
THERE WERE DRONES FLYING OUT OF

03:52.332 --> 03:54.201
IT BUT NOW U.S. FIGHTER JETS CAN

03:54.201 --> 03:55.135
FLY.

03:55.135 --> 03:56.436
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THAT?

03:56.436 --> 03:57.437
>> AS PENTAGON OFFICIALS HAVE

03:57.437 --> 03:59.106
DESCRIBED IT, IT'S A BIG DEAL.

03:59.106 --> 04:02.876
IT REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO

04:02.876 --> 04:06.279
REACH ITS TARGETS IN SYRIA AND

04:06.279 --> 04:09.049
IRAQ.

04:09.049 --> 04:11.918
IT'S HUGE.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.220
IT'S ALSO SYMBOLICALLY VERY

04:13.220 --> 04:15.755
IMPORTANT, TOO, TO HAVE YOUR

04:15.755 --> 04:17.858
STALWART NATO ALLY TURKEY

04:17.858 --> 04:20.527
FINALLY FULLY ON BOARD IN THE

04:20.527 --> 04:21.828
FIGHT AGAINST THE ISLAMIC STATE

04:21.828 --> 04:23.130
WHICH THE U.S. HAS BEEN SEEKING

04:23.130 --> 04:24.631
FOR WELL OVER A

04:24.631 --> 04:25.632
YEAR NOW.

04:25.632 --> 04:26.633
>> Sreenivasan: AYLA JEAN

04:26.633 --> 04:27.634
YACKLEY FROM REUTERS JOINING US

04:27.634 --> 04:28.768
BY SKYPE FROM ISTANBUL.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.203
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

04:30.203 --> 04:31.738
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

04:31.738 --> 04:32.539
>> Sreenivasan: SYRIAN PRESIDENT

04:32.539 --> 04:34.141
BASHAR AL-ASSAD IS TRYING TO ADD

04:34.141 --> 04:36.243
REINFORCEMENTS TO HIS DEPLETED

04:36.243 --> 04:38.111
GOVERNMENT FORCES BY OFFERING

04:38.111 --> 04:40.514
AMNESTY TO MILITARY DESERTERS.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.149
SYRIA REQUIRES ITS MALE CITIZENS

04:42.149 --> 04:43.583
TO JOIN THE ARMY, BUT TENS OF

04:43.583 --> 04:45.218
THOUSANDS HAVE DODGED THAT RULE

04:45.218 --> 04:46.686
SINCE THE COUNTRY'S CIVIL WAR

04:46.686 --> 04:48.355
BEGAN FOUR YEARS AGO.

04:48.355 --> 04:49.923
MANY FLED THE COUNTRY OR JOINED

04:49.923 --> 04:51.625
ANTI-GOVERNMENT REBELS.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.660
ASSAD SAYS DESERTERS HAVE TWO

04:53.660 --> 04:55.095
MONTHS TO TURN THEMSELVES IN AND

04:55.095 --> 04:56.096
AVOID IMPRISONMENT.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.297
GOVERNMENT TROOPS ARE FIGHTING

04:57.297 --> 04:58.698
REBELS IN THE NORTHWEST PART OF

04:58.698 --> 05:00.200
THE COUNTRY AND TRYING TO RETAKE

05:00.200 --> 05:02.102
THE ANCIENT CITY OF PALMYRA IN

05:02.102 --> 05:04.571
CENTRAL SYRIA FROM ISIS.

05:04.571 --> 05:05.872
IN KENYA, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA

05:05.872 --> 05:07.908
IS VOWING TO WEAKEN ISLAMIC

05:07.908 --> 05:08.942
MILITANTS BASED IN NEIGHBORING

05:08.942 --> 05:09.776
SOMALIA.

05:09.776 --> 05:10.744
ON HIS VISIT TODAY, THE

05:10.744 --> 05:12.078
PRESIDENT ALSO VOICED SUPPORT

05:12.078 --> 05:14.014
FOR GAY RIGHTS IN A NATION WHERE

05:14.014 --> 05:16.183
GAY SEX IS OUTLAWED.

05:16.183 --> 05:17.684
HIS FOCUS WAS MEETING KENYAN

05:17.684 --> 05:19.286
PRESIDENT UHURU KENYATTA ABOUT

05:19.286 --> 05:21.054
IMPROVING TRADE, AND ATTENDING A

05:21.054 --> 05:22.422
GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP SUMMIT

05:22.422 --> 05:23.890
IN NAIROBI WITH OFFICIALS AND

05:23.890 --> 05:25.625
BUSINESS LEADERS FROM 120

05:25.625 --> 05:27.027
COUNTRIES.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.161
>> AND THAT CREATES INCREDIBLE

05:28.161 --> 05:29.596
OPPORTUNITIES FOR AFRICANS AND

05:29.596 --> 05:31.798
FOR THE WORLD.

05:31.798 --> 05:34.167
IT MEANS MORE GROWTH AND TRADE

05:34.167 --> 05:35.368
THAT CREATES JOBS IN ALL OUR

05:35.368 --> 05:36.403
COUNTRIES.

05:36.403 --> 05:39.206
IT'S GOOD FOR ALL OF US.

05:39.206 --> 05:41.374
THIS CONTINENT NEEDS TO BE A

05:41.374 --> 05:44.110
FUTURE HUB OF GLOBAL GROWTH NOT

05:44.110 --> 05:45.445
JUST AFRICAN GROWTH.

05:45.445 --> 05:46.613
>> Sreenivasan: THE PRESIDENT

05:46.613 --> 05:47.581
HAD A PRIVATE DINNER WITH HIS

05:47.581 --> 05:48.982
EXTENDED FAMILY LAST NIGHT.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.017
HIS FATHER WAS FROM KENYA.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.018
THE NEXT STOP ON HIS FOURTH

05:52.018 --> 05:53.353
AFRICAN TRIP AS PRESIDENT IS

05:53.353 --> 05:54.554
ETHIOPIA.

05:54.554 --> 05:55.855
HILLARY CLINTON SAYS SHE WILL

05:55.855 --> 05:57.357
TESTIFY AGAIN BEFORE CONGRESS

05:57.357 --> 05:58.592
ABOUT THE BENGHAZI, LIBYA

05:58.592 --> 05:59.793
TERRORIST ATTACK THAT KILLED

05:59.793 --> 06:01.828
FOUR AMERICANS IN 2012, WHEN SHE

06:01.828 --> 06:03.763
WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.

06:03.763 --> 06:05.165
MRS. CLINTON WILL BE QUESTIONED

06:05.165 --> 06:06.933
AT A PUBLIC HEARING, IN OCTOBER,

BEFORE A SPECIAL HOUSE OF

06:08.335 --> 06:09.369
REPRESENTATIVES PANEL PROBING

06:09.369 --> 06:10.403

06:10.403 --> 06:11.605
CLINTON PREVIOUSLY TESTIFIED

06:11.605 --> 06:13.340
ABOUT BENGHAZI BEFORE A SENATE

06:13.340 --> 06:15.075
COMMITTEE BACK IN 2013.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.043
CLINTON SAYS SHE HAD NO ROLE IN

06:17.043 --> 06:18.578
SECURITY DECISIONS SURROUNDING

06:18.578 --> 06:20.046
THE U.S. CONSULATE IN LIBYA,

06:20.046 --> 06:21.548
WHERE THE ATTACK OCCURRED.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.515
THE HOUSE COMMITTEE IS ALSO

06:22.515 --> 06:23.984
DEMANDING HILLARY CLINTON TURN

06:23.984 --> 06:25.919
OVER THE PERSONAL EMAIL SERVER

06:25.919 --> 06:27.721
SHE USED WHILE SHE RAN THE STATE

06:27.721 --> 06:28.788
DEPARTMENT.

06:28.788 --> 06:30.624
SHE HAS RELEASED 30,000 EMAILS,

06:30.624 --> 06:31.891
BUT SHE EXCLUDED PRIVATE

06:31.891 --> 06:32.759
MESSAGES.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.461
TWO INSPECTORS GENERAL HAVE

06:51.344 --> 06:52.979
WAYS IN WHICH TECHNOLOGY, AND

06:52.979 --> 06:55.448
OUR INCREASINGLY MOBILE LIFE IS

06:55.448 --> 06:57.784
CHANGING HOW WE DO BUSINESS.

06:57.784 --> 06:59.219
ESTIMATES ARE THAT INDEPENDENT

06:59.219 --> 07:00.954
CONTRACTORS, OR FREELANCERS,

07:00.954 --> 07:04.090
RANGE FROM 13% TO 34% OF THE

07:06.559 --> 07:08.194
THEIR OWN SCHEDULES AND WORKING

07:08.194 --> 07:10.096
PROJECT BY PROJECT.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.498
FROM THE TAP OF A SMARTPHONE

07:11.498 --> 07:12.899
APP, A GROWING NUMBER OF

07:12.899 --> 07:14.301

07:19.406 --> 07:21.174

09:23.463 --> 09:25.598

09:28.168 --> 09:29.736
IMPROVE THEIR JOBS.

09:30.603 --> 09:31.638
COULD ONLY PROVIDE THIS LAYER OF

09:31.638 --> 09:34.374
MANAGEMENT ONLY WITH EMPLOYEES.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.208
SO THIS HAS TO BE MORE

10:19.319 --> 10:21.020
AS SHOPPING.

10:21.020 --> 10:22.055

10:22.055 --> 10:23.223
THAT WE'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH,

10:41.808 --> 10:43.009
I FELT ANGRY.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.477
I DIDN'T THINK-- I DIDN'T THINK

IT WAS THAT BAD.

I DID NOT THINK IT WOULD, YOU

BEING A CONTRACTOR.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.164

IT'S LIKE, THAT'S GOOD, BUT WHY
