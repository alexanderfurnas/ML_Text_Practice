WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But first:
It is growing season for
farmers across the Midwest, and

00:04.366 --> 00:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many are faced with yet another
tough financial forecast, as
corn and soybean prices remain

00:10.766 --> 00:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
low, which means less
money in farmers' pockets.

00:12.833 --> 00:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Nebraska, some producers are
now coming to grips with what
some say is this new reality.

00:17.633 --> 00:20.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
From NET in Nebraska,
Jack Williams reports.

00:20.566 --> 00:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARL SOUCEK, Farmer: This
is our little office that we
use as kind of a break room.

00:27.600 --> 00:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the center where we
can on the computer or order
parts or things like that.

00:33.300 --> 00:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK WILLIAMS: On a family
farm in Prague, Nebraska, about
40 miles north of Lincoln,

00:37.833 --> 00:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Carl Soucek is right at home.

00:39.500 --> 00:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His family has been farming
this land since the late 1940s.

00:43.400 --> 00:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They grow mostly corn and
soybeans, but the last couple
of years haven't been easy.

00:48.033 --> 00:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
High prices for crops translated
to more income for farmers a
few years ago, but now those

00:54.500 --> 00:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prices have tumbled, leaving
farmers in a financial ditch.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARL SOUCEK: The best thing
that ever happened to the corn
industry was $7 corn, and the

01:04.000 --> 01:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worst thing to happen to it
was $7 corn, because it kind of
threw everything out of balance.

01:09.233 --> 01:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think we will see
the cycle come back.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't know when it's
going to come back.

01:13.666 --> 01:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK WILLIAMS: While he waits,
Soucek is doing what he can
to cut costs on the farm.

01:18.633 --> 01:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead of taking his equipment
to the local implement dealer
for repairs, he has parts

01:23.233 --> 01:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
delivered to the farm and
does those repairs himself.

01:27.033 --> 01:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much money does that save
you, doing your own repairs?

01:29.500 --> 01:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you had to take your tractor
in yourself, how much would
that cost you, compared to

01:32.033 --> 01:34.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you actually doing
this yourself?

01:34.666 --> 01:39.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CARL SOUCEK: Shop rates
can run anywhere from
$75 to $150 an hour.

01:41.633 --> 01:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And service calls, if they
come out from the dealership to
work on a piece of equipment,

01:46.933 --> 01:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
service calls could be
another $250 on top of that.

01:49.866 --> 01:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if it's something we can
take care of ourselves, every
time we do that, we're saving

01:52.366 --> 01:54.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a little bit of money.

01:54.433 --> 01:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK WILLIAMS: Soucek doesn't
apologize for enjoying the
good times a few years ago.

02:01.766 --> 02:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says farming isn't always
easy, and when prices of crops
such as corn and soybeans

02:06.400 --> 02:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shot up, many farmers' earnings
increased, and they enjoyed
a higher standard of living.

02:13.366 --> 02:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a lot different than
the days when they had to
watch every penny they spent.

02:15.300 --> 02:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARL SOUCEK: If we need to
go back to that, we will.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think we have already.

02:20.600 --> 02:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're careful about our family
living, and been there, done
that, and we will do it again

02:26.266 --> 02:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if we need to tighten
our belt that much.

02:28.266 --> 02:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK WILLIAMS: At a recent
economic workshop in Lincoln,
farmers and ranchers got a dose

02:32.000 --> 02:36.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of economic reality.

02:36.133 --> 02:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With falling prices of corn,
soybeans and wheat bringing
farmers less income, many are

02:42.500 --> 02:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
facing more debt, tighter
margins and an uncertain future.

02:45.366 --> 02:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're looking for guidance
as they try to navigate through
the down times without too

02:49.266 --> 02:51.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much damage.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY PARSONS, University of
Nebraska-Lincoln: They have seen
the good times, they have seen

02:52.300 --> 02:53.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the bad times.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They know nothing lasts forever.

02:55.333 --> 02:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they keep track of things
and they monitor things and
they're aware of things.

02:58.333 --> 03:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's probably a decent
number of people out there that
haven't had that perspective

03:03.166 --> 03:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and are still trying to
adjust to the new situation.

03:05.933 --> 03:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK WILLIAMS: Economic factors,
such as high land costs and
skyrocketing property taxes,

03:12.366 --> 03:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are testing the resolve
of some Midwest producers.

03:15.300 --> 03:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that might actually
be a good thing for their
long-term financial health.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA BARRETT, Director, Nebraska
Farm Business, Inc.: Tough
times make better managers.

03:21.933 --> 03:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if I think about the
producers I work with, those
who had tough times in the '80s

03:26.933 --> 03:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are great managers today,
because they had to learn how
to make those tough choices,

03:30.833 --> 03:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they had to learn how to manage
their business like a business,
and they continued to do

03:37.666 --> 03:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that through the profitable
times and made a lot
of money through that.

03:40.133 --> 03:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK WILLIAMS: Dave Nielsen
is a third-generation
farmer in Lancaster County
in Eastern Nebraska,

03:46.266 --> 03:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where he grows corn and
soybeans on about 2,000 acres.

03:49.833 --> 03:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His father and grandfather
worked this ground before him,
so he's seen the good and bad

03:54.500 --> 03:56.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
times.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says the younger farmers
who got into the business a
few years ago when prices were

03:59.300 --> 04:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high are the ones who feel
the downturn the most.

04:02.533 --> 04:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVE NIELSEN, Farmer:
It was really tough on
young guys starting then.

04:08.933 --> 04:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Young guys starting in those
glory years, wow, this is easy.

04:10.966 --> 04:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a lot of youth that
came back to the farm, maybe
left jobs in town and came

04:15.000 --> 04:16.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
back to the family
farm, to the farm.

04:16.900 --> 04:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, you know, now it's a
whole different ball game.

04:20.900 --> 04:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now it's, you really
have to watch what you're
spending on inputs and
family living and that.

04:28.766 --> 04:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK WILLIAMS: Nielsen probably
won't lime his soil this
year and, like Carl Soucek in

04:35.200 --> 04:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Prague, he's doing a lot of
his own repairs to save money.

04:37.433 --> 04:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's taking a hard look
at the rest of his expenses.

04:40.033 --> 04:43.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVE NIELSEN: Every
good operation should,
even in the good times.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Really, you should.

04:45.566 --> 04:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You probably -- just a little
sharper pen or a little
sharper pencil when you're in

04:50.100 --> 04:52.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the downturn.

04:52.133 --> 04:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

NewsHour," I'm Jack Williams
