02:26.767 --> 02:28.433
THE JAPANESE CONSTITUTION ALLOWS

02:28.433 --> 02:30.333
TROOPS ONLY TO ENGAGE IN SELF-

02:30.333 --> 02:31.100
DEFENSE, IF JAPAN ITSELF WERE

POPULATION FROM SYRIA.

06:26.867 --> 06:30.633
THAT PARALYZES THE GOVERNMENT,

SURVIVORS SHOWS CATASTROPHIC

08:04.467 --> 08:05.700
EVENTS CAN ALTER OUR BODY

08:05.700 --> 08:06.867
CHEMISTRY AND THOSE CHANGES CAN

08:06.867 --> 08:08.067
BE TRANSMITTED TO CHILDREN.

08:08.067 --> 08:09.267
THE RESULT: CHILDREN MAY SUFFER

08:09.267 --> 08:10.433
THE EFFECTS OF A TRAUMATIC EVENT

08:10.433 --> 08:11.667
THEY NEVER WITNESSED OR

08:11.667 --> 08:12.467
EXPERIENCED.

SHORE OF LONG ISLAND, JUST AN

08:19.933 --> 08:21.533
HOUR'S DRIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY.

08:21.533 --> 08:23.133
HER PARENTS SURVIVED THE

08:23.133 --> 08:24.167
HOLOCAUST BUT RARELY MENTIONED

08:24.167 --> 08:25.167
IT.

08:25.167 --> 08:27.200
>> ALL I KNEW WAS THAT WE WERE

08:27.200 --> 08:28.967
DIFFERENT, THAT I WAS DIFFERENT.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.800
I DIDN'T EXACTLY KNOW WHY.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.467

08:32.467 --> 08:34.067
JEWISH, BORN IN GERMANY, BUT

08:34.067 --> 08:35.433
AFTER HITLER CAME TO POWER,

08:35.433 --> 08:37.067
THEIR FAMILIES FLED.

08:37.067 --> 08:38.833
SONNEBERG'S PARENTS WERE JUST

08:38.833 --> 08:40.467
CHILDREN BUT CARRIED THE TRAUMAS

08:40.467 --> 08:41.367
OF NAZI OPPRESSION THROUGHOUT

08:41.367 --> 08:43.500
THEIR LIVES.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.867
>> MY MOTHER FROM THE TIME SHE

08:44.867 --> 08:46.133
WAS THREE ON, FOR MY FATHER,

08:46.133 --> 08:48.000
FROM THE TIME HE WAS FIVE OR

08:48.000 --> 08:49.900
SIX-YEARS-OLD, HE WAS SUBJECTED

08:49.900 --> 08:55.567
TO THE PAINFUL EXISTENCE IN

08:55.567 --> 08:57.067
GERMANY.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.167
STRUGGLED FOR YEARS WITH ANXIETY

09:03.167 --> 09:04.933
AND STRESS.

09:04.933 --> 09:06.633
WHILE SHE COULDN'T PROVE IT, SHE

09:06.633 --> 09:08.100
BELIEVED IT WAS SOMEHOW LINKED

09:08.100 --> 09:09.167
TO HER PARENTS' TRAUMATIC

09:09.167 --> 09:10.700
CHILDHOODS.

09:10.700 --> 09:12.900
>> HAVING DISCUSSED THIS WITH

09:12.900 --> 09:15.267
MANY OF MY FRIENDS WHO COME FROM

09:15.267 --> 09:19.467
SIMILAR BACKGROUNDS, IT SEEMS TO

09:19.467 --> 09:23.333
BE CONSISTENT IN MOST OF US, OR

09:23.333 --> 09:24.367
THERE WERE DEFINITELY CHALLENGES

09:24.367 --> 09:25.667
THAT "AMERICAN" KIDS DIDN'T SEEM

09:25.667 --> 09:27.700
TO HAVE EXPERIENCED.

09:27.700 --> 09:28.867
>> Reporter: EVEN THOUGH YOU

09:28.867 --> 09:29.967
WEREN'T THERE.

09:29.967 --> 09:30.967
>> EXACTLY.

09:30.967 --> 09:33.200
THAT'S THE AMAZING PART OF IT.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.633

09:34.633 --> 09:35.967
PUBLISHED THIS MONTH IN THE

09:39.133 --> 09:40.900
SONNEBERG'S BELIEF THAT SHE

09:40.900 --> 09:42.100
EXPERIENCED THE AFTER EFFECTS OF

09:42.100 --> 09:44.700
HER PARENTS' TRAUMA.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.767
DR. RACHEL YEHUDA, DIRECTOR OF

09:51.000 --> 09:53.033
HER TEAM INTERVIEWED AND DREW

09:53.033 --> 09:55.233
BLOOD FROM 32 SETS OF SURVIVORS

09:55.233 --> 09:58.467
AND THEIR CHILDREN, FOCUSING ON

09:58.467 --> 10:01.067
A GENE CALLED FKBP5

10:01.067 --> 10:03.433
>> WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THIS IS

10:03.433 --> 10:05.500
A GENE THAT CONTRIBUTES TO RISK

10:05.500 --> 10:06.667
FOR DEPRESSION AND POST-

10:06.667 --> 10:08.433
TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.000
>> Reporter: YEHUDA NOTICED A

10:10.000 --> 10:11.833
PATTERN AMONG THE HOLOCAUST

10:11.833 --> 10:13.633
SURVIVORS CALLED AN EPIGENETIC

10:13.633 --> 10:15.400
CHANGE-- NOT A CHANGE IN THE

10:15.400 --> 10:17.167
GENE ITSELF, BUT RATHER A CHANGE

10:17.167 --> 10:18.033
IN A CHEMICAL MARKER ATTACHED TO

10:18.033 --> 10:19.667
IT.

10:19.667 --> 10:21.833
>> WHEN WE LOOKED AT THEIR OWN

10:21.833 --> 10:23.867
CHILDREN, THEIR CHILDREN ALSO

10:23.867 --> 10:26.100
HAD AN EPIGENETIC CHANGE IN THE

10:26.100 --> 10:26.933
SAME SPOT ON A STRESS-RELATED

10:26.933 --> 10:27.967
GENE.

10:27.967 --> 10:28.667
>> Reporter: WHAT DOES THAT

10:28.667 --> 10:30.267
SUGGEST?

10:30.267 --> 10:31.967
>> WELL, IN THE FIRST

10:31.967 --> 10:34.400
GENERATION, IN THE HOLOCAUST

10:34.400 --> 10:36.433
SURVIVOR, IT SUGGESTS THAT THERE

10:36.433 --> 10:38.867
HAS BEEN AN ADAPTATION OR A

10:38.867 --> 10:41.467
RESPONSE TO A HORRENDOUS

10:41.467 --> 10:43.633
ENVIRONMENTAL EVENT, AND IN THE

10:43.633 --> 10:45.567
SECOND GENERATION IT SUGGESTS

10:45.567 --> 10:48.067
THAT THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A

10:48.067 --> 10:49.767
RESPONSE OF THE OFFSPRING TO

10:49.767 --> 10:51.867
THIS PARENTAL TRAUMA.

10:51.867 --> 10:53.300
>> Reporter: WHICH MEANS

10:53.300 --> 10:55.133
CHILDREN OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS

10:55.133 --> 10:56.733
LIKE SONNEBERG COULD BE MORE

10:56.733 --> 10:58.167
LIKELY TO DEVELOP STRESS OR

10:58.167 --> 10:59.867
ANXIETY DISORDERS.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.633
THOUGH THEIR STUDY WAS SMALL,

11:01.633 --> 11:03.300
YEHUDA AND HER TEAM CONTROLLED

11:03.300 --> 11:05.367
FOR ANY EARLY TRAUMA THE

11:05.367 --> 11:06.300
SURVIVORS' CHILDREN MAY HAVE

11:06.300 --> 11:09.000
EXPERIENCED THEMSELVES.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.967
HOW IS IT THAT A PARENT WHO WAS

11:10.967 --> 11:13.167
SUBJECTED TO THE TRAUMA OF THE

11:13.167 --> 11:14.700
HOLOCAUST IS ABLE TO SOMEHOW

11:14.700 --> 11:15.767
TRANSMIT THAT TO A CHILD WHO

11:15.767 --> 11:18.133
WASN'T THERE?

11:18.133 --> 11:19.700
>> THAT'S A REALLY GOOD

11:19.700 --> 11:21.400
QUESTION, AND THIS STUDY THAT WE

11:21.400 --> 11:23.500
DID DOESN'T ADDRESS THE HOW.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.433
THE STUDY THAT WE DID JUST

11:25.433 --> 11:28.733
PROVIDES A PROOF OF CONCEPT THAT

11:28.733 --> 11:30.033
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE

11:30.033 --> 11:32.167
HOW IF WE DO MORE RESEARCH.

11:32.167 --> 11:34.067
>> Reporter: D.N.A. IS PASSED

11:34.067 --> 11:35.700
FROM PARENTS TO CHILDREN.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.500
BUT RESEARCH LIKE YEHUDA'S

11:37.500 --> 11:39.533
SUGGESTS PARENTAL LIFE

11:39.533 --> 11:40.900
EXPERIENCES CAN MODIFY THEIR

11:40.900 --> 11:42.733
BODY CHEMISTRY, AND THOSE

11:42.733 --> 11:43.933
MODIFICATIONS CAN BE TRANSMITTED

11:43.933 --> 11:45.533
TO CHILDREN AS WELL.

11:45.533 --> 11:46.300
SCIENTISTS HAVE EXAMINED THIS

11:46.300 --> 11:48.300
IDEA BEFORE.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.567
AFTER A FAMINE IN HOLLAND DURING

11:50.567 --> 11:52.700
1944 AND 1945, CHILDREN WERE

11:52.700 --> 11:54.467
BORN WITH THE EFFECTS OF

11:54.467 --> 11:56.067
MALNUTRITION TWO GENERATIONS

11:56.067 --> 11:58.367
AFTER THE FOOD SHORTAGE ENDED.

11:58.367 --> 12:00.400
PREVIOUSLY, YEHUDA HERSELF

12:00.400 --> 12:02.267
STUDIED STRESS HORMONE LEVELS IN

12:02.267 --> 12:03.933
CHILDREN BORN TO WOMEN WHO

12:03.933 --> 12:05.067
SURVIVED THE SEPTEMBER 11

12:05.067 --> 12:06.667
TERRORIST ATTACKS.

12:06.667 --> 12:08.100
SHE'S BEEN EXAMINING THE LINK

12:08.100 --> 12:09.800
BETWEEN TRAUMA EXPERIENCED BY

12:09.800 --> 12:11.067
HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS AND THEIR

12:11.067 --> 12:13.767
CHILDREN FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS.

12:13.767 --> 12:14.633
>> A TRAUMA IS AN EVENT THAT

12:14.633 --> 12:17.000
CHANGES YOU.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.200
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO CHANGE YOU

12:18.200 --> 12:19.733
FOR THE NEGATIVE.

12:19.733 --> 12:21.633
TRAUMA CHANGES YOU IN LOTS OF

12:21.633 --> 12:23.967
DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT MOST PEOPLE

12:23.967 --> 12:26.067
WHO EXPERIENCE EXTREME TRAUMA

12:26.067 --> 12:28.533
LEARN A GREAT DEAL FROM THAT

12:28.533 --> 12:30.500
EXPERIENCE, AND SOME OF THOSE

12:30.500 --> 12:32.267
LESSONS MAY BE LESSONS THAT ARE

12:32.267 --> 12:33.433
TRANSMITTED TO THE CHILD, AND

12:33.433 --> 12:35.167
THAT'S NOT A BAD THING.

12:35.167 --> 12:36.667
>> Reporter: YEHUDA SAYS THE

12:36.667 --> 12:37.767
IMPLICATIONS AREN'T LIMITED TO

12:37.767 --> 12:39.233
HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS.

12:39.233 --> 12:41.100
BUT THIS DWINDLING POPULATION

12:41.100 --> 12:42.933
PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO HOW

12:42.933 --> 12:44.233
CLINICIANS UNDERSTAND AND TREAT

12:44.233 --> 12:46.267
STRESS DISORDERS.

12:51.567 --> 12:52.567
THIS IS YOUR WEIGHT, THAT'S NOT

12:52.567 --> 12:53.967
GOOD, THIS IS YOUR DIET, THESE

12:53.967 --> 12:55.200
ARE YOU GENETIC RISKS, AND

12:55.200 --> 12:56.567
THINGS LIKE THAT.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.067
AND IT WOULD BE VERY NICE IF WE

12:58.067 --> 12:59.833
COULD DEVELOP A SIMILAR RISK

13:13.533 --> 13:15.333
THERE ARE CHILDREN BORN IN THE

13:29.833 --> 13:31.433
OF TRAUMATIZED PARENTS HAVE

13:31.433 --> 13:33.333
STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION AND

BASING THEIR APPEAL ON OR THE

21:52.600 --> 21:53.700
ARGUMENT THEY'RE BASING THEIR

APPEAL ON IS THEY'RE SAYING THIS
