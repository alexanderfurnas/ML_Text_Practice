JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, a look
at a photographer's
more-than-decade-long project
documenting

00:05.372 --> 00:08.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hope and despair in her
hometown.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has that story.

00:10.377 --> 00:15.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Braddock,
Pennsylvania, about
nine miles outside of
Pittsburgh, a once thriving

00:15.182 --> 00:21.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
steel town of some 20,000, now
down to one-tenth
of that, and captured through
the very personal

00:21.555 --> 00:27.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lens of LaToya Ruby Frazier, the
32-year-old
winner of one of this year's
MacArthur fellowships.

00:27.094 --> 00:31.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER,
Photographer: I see myself
as an artist and a citizen
that's documenting

00:31.665 --> 00:37.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and telling the story and
building the archive
of working-class families facing
all this

00:37.604 --> 00:41.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change that's happening, because
it has to
be documented.

00:41.608 --> 00:46.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: These days,
Frazier teaches
and lives in Chicago, where we
talked to her,

00:46.179 --> 00:50.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but her true home, her childhood
home, is
the one found in her work.

00:50.751 --> 00:56.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a project titled "The
Notion of Family"
that she began more than a
decade ago, documenting

00:56.290 --> 01:00.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
three generations of
African-American women
in a particular time and place.

01:00.894 --> 01:05.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: My
grandmother, who grew
up there in the '30s, when
Braddock was prosperous

01:05.299 --> 01:11.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a city itself that everyone
came to, to
my mother growing up there in
the '60s during

01:11.939 --> 01:17.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
segregation and white flight and
the beginning
of the collapse of the steel
industry, to

01:17.611 --> 01:23.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
myself growing up there in the
'80s and '90s,
when the factories were already
dismantled

01:23.283 --> 01:25.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the war on drugs kind of hit
its peak.

01:25.953 --> 01:32.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Educator and
photographer Lewis
Hine used his camera for social
reform. Photographers

01:32.693 --> 01:38.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from the Farm Security
Administration documented
the poverty of the Depression,
the pioneering

01:38.198 --> 01:42.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
work of Gordon Parks in the
1940s and '50s.

01:42.069 --> 01:46.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Frazier sees herself working in
this tradition,
first and foremost, though, as a
visual artist.

01:46.907 --> 01:51.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: The art
comes in with
how it's crafted, how it's made,
the material,

01:52.012 --> 01:57.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me understanding the history,
because the
images, they're not purely
documents.

01:57.150 --> 02:02.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at them, first and
foremost, the
fact that I appear on the other
side of the

02:02.856 --> 02:08.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
camera lets you know that this
is contemporary
art, because now I'm performing
and doing

02:08.328 --> 02:11.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gestures in front of the camera
to create...

02:11.331 --> 02:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're part of
the scene.

02:12.599 --> 02:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: ... the
narrative and
the scene, yes.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But are they
posed photographs?

02:15.635 --> 02:21.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: They sit in
between staged
and documentation.

02:21.208 --> 02:26.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we think about the image
"Grandma Ruby
and Me, 2005," I know her
routine. I know

02:26.546 --> 02:30.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she will get up, she will have
her Folgers
cup of coffee, she will smoke
her Pall Mall

02:30.550 --> 02:33.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cigarettes, she will clean her
dolls.

02:33.053 --> 02:38.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, looking at my grandmother
one day, I said,
well, grandma, could you redo my
hair the

02:38.358 --> 02:40.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way you used to when I was a
child?

02:40.260 --> 02:47.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm in my 20s in this image.
So, I come
and I sit next to her while
she's rearranging

02:47.367 --> 02:53.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her dolls. And then we both
quietly happen
to look over our shoulders, and
the cable

02:53.707 --> 02:58.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
release is running behind to the
camera, and
I press the cable release.

02:58.845 --> 03:05.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that's how it sits
between documentation
and actual staged portraiture.

03:05.552 --> 03:11.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In 2013, Frazier
flew in a
helicopter above Braddock to
expand her view

03:11.391 --> 03:13.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the town.

03:13.093 --> 03:16.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: I just knew
I had to
shoot this, so the family could
see what was

03:16.863 --> 03:18.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
happening to their property.

03:18.698 --> 03:22.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And to capture
the plight of
one particular home owned by the
Bunn family

03:22.969 --> 03:27.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the neighborhood known as The
Bottom, right
near the old plant. It's now
surrounded by

03:27.874 --> 03:30.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bundles of crushed rubber tires.

03:30.043 --> 03:35.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: And what's
interesting
is, at one point, anyone who
immigrated or

03:35.048 --> 03:39.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
migrated to work in this factory
lived exactly
these two blocks.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?

03:41.388 --> 03:45.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: And this is
really important
to me because it's not about
being black or

03:45.058 --> 03:51.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
white. This was our rites of
passage, so it
didn't matter if you came from
Germany, Croatia,

03:51.064 --> 03:57.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Italy, Africa, North Carolina,
or South Carolina.
We all lived here together.

03:57.771 --> 04:02.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And over the years, these were
all, through
eminent domain, taken because
people died

04:03.009 --> 04:11.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from terminal illnesses,
couldn't upstand
or keep their homes. And then
this family,

04:11.885 --> 04:16.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Bunn family, decided that
they didn't
want to move.

04:16.223 --> 04:23.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In more recent
years, a new
story of Braddock has been told,
one of grit

04:24.030 --> 04:35.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and revival. Levi's even used
the city in
a 2010 ad campaign called "Ready
for Work."

04:35.275 --> 04:38.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILD: Maybe the world breaks on
purpose,
so we can have work to do.

04:38.512 --> 04:42.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Frazier isn't
buying it.

04:42.782 --> 04:50.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: Out of
concern for this
narrative and what I saw as
propaganda, I

04:50.056 --> 04:58.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
started to make the portraits to
counterbalance
this narrative. Right. It's not
an empty land.

04:58.331 --> 05:04.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not a frontier. Like,
people actually
live here and have been dealing
with the environmental

05:04.304 --> 05:06.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
crisis for decades.

05:06.173 --> 05:10.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: She points to
government policies
and corporate decisions like the
closing of

05:11.011 --> 05:15.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the main hospital, which had
served many in
the town, including Frazier's
own family,

05:15.615 --> 05:19.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who say they suffer from
environment-related
illnesses.

05:19.653 --> 05:24.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fight over the hospital was
captured in
a 2012 documentary by Tony Buba,
who's been

05:24.925 --> 05:30.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
filming life in Braddock since
the 1970s.
The protests became another
point of Frazier's

05:30.463 --> 05:32.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
own mix of art and activism.

05:32.265 --> 05:35.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: So, here,
I'm talking
about the history of protests.

05:35.402 --> 05:41.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Taken altogether,
it's a complicated
picture. Frazier wants us not to
forget those

05:41.074 --> 05:43.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who continue to struggle amid
the changes.

05:43.176 --> 05:47.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: I'm not
saying that it's
a dying town. I'm saying that we
survived.

05:47.214 --> 05:54.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, look at all of the damage,
all the abuse
we have endured, and we're still
steadfast

05:54.988 --> 06:01.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and existing. So, for me, it's a
triumphant
story. It's really a testimony.
It's not -- we're

06:01.394 --> 06:03.330 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not dying.

06:03.363 --> 06:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Even though it
looks -- I mean,
much of it looks so depressed
and depressing-type

06:07.067 --> 06:08.535 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
scenes.

06:08.568 --> 06:10.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: But look at
me in the
flesh right now in front of you.

06:10.237 --> 06:11.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: I'm not
that girl.

06:13.006 --> 06:18.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And she plans to
use the money
from the MacArthur grant,
$625,000 over five

06:18.478 --> 06:24.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, to continue to document
and complicate
our picture of Braddock,
Pennsylvania.

06:24.317 --> 06:26.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."
