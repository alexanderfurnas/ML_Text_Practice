THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY SAY TOO

01:38.133 --> 01:39.267
MUCH BECAUSE IF YOU REMEMBER

02:01.767 --> 02:03.533
HOW IS IT FUNCTIONING, 10 BEIN

02:03.533 --> 02:03.933
THE BEST

02:03.933 --> 02:06.667
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE ARE

02:06.667 --> 02:07.733
HEARING ABOUT MOST FROM PEOPLE

02:07.733 --> 02:09.267
THE SITE IMPROVED TO THE POINT

02:09.267 --> 02:10.700
WHERE YOU CAN GET TO THE LAS

02:10.700 --> 02:10.933
STEP

02:10.933 --> 02:13.267
YOU CAN CREATE AN ACCOUNT, YOU

02:13.267 --> 02:16.100
CAN SHOP AROUND FOR PLANS, FIN

02:16.100 --> 02:17.700
IF YOU GET A TAX SUBSIDY

02:17.700 --> 02:19.400
WHEN YOU GET TO THAT POINT WHERE

02:19.400 --> 02:20.833
OKAY, I'M READY TO BUY INSURANCE

02:20.833 --> 02:22.233
WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS

02:22.233 --> 02:23.367
WEBSITE, THAT'S WHERE IT LOCKS

02:23.367 --> 02:23.700
UP

02:23.700 --> 02:25.033
THAT'S WHERE IT BREAKS DOWN.

02:25.033 --> 02:27.100
ONLY A TRICKLE OF PEOPLE ARE

02:27.100 --> 02:29.133
ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO BUY A

02:29.133 --> 02:29.767
INSURANCE PLAN

02:29.767 --> 02:30.800
THEN THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE ON

02:30.800 --> 02:33.000
THE BACK END THAT WE ARE HEARING

02:33.000 --> 02:35.567
FROM INSURERS TELLING US THA

02:35.567 --> 02:37.333
THE DATA FROM THIS WEBSITE I

02:37.333 --> 02:39.400
NOT BEING TRANSMITTED TO THE

WELL

02:39.767 --> 02:41.167
THEY'RE NOT GETTING ACCURATE

02:41.167 --> 02:42.467
INFORMATION ABOUT WHO IS SIGNING

02:42.467 --> 02:42.600
UP

02:42.600 --> 02:43.933
PEOPLE ARE SIGNING UP FO

02:43.933 --> 02:48.400
INSURANCE AND NOT SURE IF TH

02:48.400 --> 02:49.467
INSURERS ARE GETTING THA

02:49.467 --> 02:49.600
INFORMATION.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.267
THERE ARE A LOT OF FUNDAMENTAL

02:51.267 --> 02:52.667
ISSUES GOING ON WITH THIS SITE

02:52.667 --> 02:53.600
THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS OVER THE

02:53.600 --> 02:55.433
WEEKEND THEY ARE STILL WORKING

02:55.433 --> 02:56.633
TRYING TO WORK THESE OUT

02:56.633 --> 02:58.567
THOSE ON THE FRONT LINES O

02:58.567 --> 03:00.167
SIGNING PEOPLE UP, THEY AR

03:00.167 --> 03:01.833
STILL QUITE SKEPTICAL AT THI

03:01.833 --> 03:01.967
POINT.

03:01.967 --> 03:03.933
>> ONE REASON IS THIS IS ALMOS

03:03.933 --> 03:06.100
A PROXY FOR THE EFFICACY OF TH

03:06.100 --> 03:07.400
LAW THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT

03:07.400 --> 03:08.667
THIS SO CLOSELY.

03:08.667 --> 03:09.900
BEST-CASE SCENARIO

03:09.900 --> 03:12.167
TOMORROW AT THE DEADLINE I

03:12.167 --> 03:14.600
LAUNCHES, EVERYTHING IS -- DOE

03:14.600 --> 03:15.900
THE MATH ADD UP?

03:15.900 --> 03:18.433
CAN THEY GET TO 7 MILLION BY

03:18.433 --> 03:18.567
MARCH?

03:18.567 --> 03:20.600
>> AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING

03:20.600 --> 03:22.767
TO ALL FLOOD ON AT ONE TIME?

03:22.767 --> 03:24.067
SO, YES, THEORETICALLY BY TH

03:31.833 --> 03:33.133
ABLE TO GET ENOUGH PEOPLE TO

03:33.133 --> 03:35.667
SIGN UP.

03:35.667 --> 03:36.967
THE CONCERN IS THAT YOUR SHO

03:36.967 --> 03:38.533
AND OTHER SHOWS ARE GOING TO B

03:38.533 --> 03:39.533
TALKING ABOUT HOW TH

03:46.067 --> 03:47.167
TO CRASH THE SITE AGAIN.

03:47.167 --> 03:48.833
SO RIGHT NOW THEY'VE GOTTEN IT

03:48.833 --> 03:50.300
TO A POINT WHERE ABOUT 50,00

03:50.300 --> 03:51.800
PEOPLE CAN COME ON AT ONE TIME

03:51.800 --> 03:53.600
IT CAN HANDLE ABOUT 80,000

03:53.600 --> 03:54.800
PEOPLE A DAY

03:54.800 --> 03:56.333
NOW, IF A MILLION PEOPLE OR

03:56.333 --> 03:57.600
MILLION PEOPLE SHOW UP ON ON

03:57.600 --> 03:59.333
DAY OR SHOW UP CLOSE TO TH

03:59.333 --> 04:00.467
DEADLINE, IT COULD BRING THE

04:00.467 --> 04:01.433
WHOLE SITE DOWN AGAIN.

04:01.433 --> 04:02.433
THAT'S A CONCERN

04:02.433 --> 04:04.667
>> WE SHOULD REMIND PEOPLE THI

04:04.667 --> 04:06.067
