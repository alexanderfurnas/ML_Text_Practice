JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:07.641 --> 00:12.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
It's Tuesday, primary night in
New York state.

00:12.145 --> 00:17.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Voters hit the polls today after
heavy campaigning
by the Republican and Democratic
presidential

00:18.085 --> 00:19.820 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidates.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Tuesday:
the longest war. What's behind
the recent

00:22.089 --> 00:24.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
uptick in violence in
Afghanistan?

00:24.124 --> 00:29.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, a
conversation with Special
Presidential Envoy Brett McGurk
on the decision

00:29.663 --> 00:31.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to send more U.S. troops to
Iraq.

00:31.899 --> 00:37.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And many
American schools
have a growing problem with lead
contamination.

00:37.337 --> 00:41.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why are districts across the
country struggling
to provide clean drinking water?

00:41.575 --> 00:45.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANNA LAMBRINIDOU, Virginia
Tech: The nature
of the beast is that lead levels
in water

00:45.979 --> 00:50.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are unpredictable, and exposure
is really
like a Russian roulette.

00:50.817 --> 00:53.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:53.854 --> 00:57.090 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:57.190 --> 01:10.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A few hours
from now, they
will be counting the votes in
New York's presidential

01:10.971 --> 01:14.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
primary, and for the first time
in many years,
the results could be critical.

01:14.908 --> 01:19.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both front-runners lost momentum
after a series
of defeats in recent weeks, but
convincing

01:19.680 --> 01:24.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
victories in New York could
change all that.
For Republican Donald Trump,
winning big tonight

01:24.685 --> 01:30.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
might help avoid a contested GOP
Convention
this summer. For Hillary
Clinton, a good night

01:30.257 --> 01:34.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would boost her already big lead
in delegates
for the Democratic nomination.

01:34.728 --> 01:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, there's no sign their
rivals plan to
drop out, regardless of what
happens tonight.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the candidates kept at it
today, even as
New Yorkers headed into voting
booths to make

01:44.738 --> 01:45.739 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their choice.

01:45.839 --> 01:50.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Who are you voting for?

01:50.410 --> 01:52.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Easy decision.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Donald Trump
casting his
New York primary ballot this
morning in Midtown

01:54.381 --> 01:56.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Manhattan, a few blocks from his
namesake
tower.

01:57.084 --> 01:58.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: New York is a
special place.

01:59.019 --> 02:02.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But the
Republican front-runner
also had to address the churning
within his

02:02.189 --> 02:07.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political team, including new
roles for veteran
political operatives brought in
as advisers

02:07.627 --> 02:12.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the resignation of a top
aide in reaction.
He acknowledged the shakeup
during a phone

02:12.733 --> 02:14.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interview this morning with FOX
News.

02:14.601 --> 02:16.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: So, when you bring
other people
in, I could see some people,
their feelings

02:16.436 --> 02:21.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get a little bit hurt. Frankly,
you know,
we're in a position where we
would like to

02:21.975 --> 02:23.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
see if we can close it out.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
Trump's closest
rival, Texas Senator Ted Cruz,
turned his

02:26.346 --> 02:31.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
attention to next week's
contests, with a
stop in Philadelphia this
evening. So too

02:31.918 --> 02:37.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with John Kasich. He's in
Maryland tonight,
after an earlier stop in
Pittsburgh.

02:37.224 --> 02:41.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two Democratic contenders
started their
days in New York state. Hillary
Clinton voted

02:41.895 --> 02:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the town she now calls home,
Chappaqua.
Later, she made a quick trip to
Washington

02:46.833 --> 02:48.802 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to court labor.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
And here's my promise to you. If
I'm fortunate

02:51.471 --> 02:58.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough to become your president,
organized
labor will always have a
champion in the White

02:58.145 --> 02:58.712 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
House.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:00.614 --> 03:03.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Her rival,
Bernie Sanders,
began with a morning stroll near
New York

03:03.650 --> 03:09.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
City's Times Square. This
afternoon, he made
his pivot to Pennsylvania,
stopping in Erie.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Let us see Pennsylvania have the
largest voter

03:11.591 --> 03:21.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turnout of the history of their
primaries.
And let's see the great state of
Pennsylvania

03:21.868 --> 03:23.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lead this country into the
political revolution.

03:24.071 --> 03:25.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:25.939 --> 03:27.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Pennsylvania
figures to
be the keystone of next
Tuesday's contests,

03:27.474 --> 03:32.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with 71 Republican delegates and
210 on the
Democratic side.

03:32.612 --> 03:36.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will take a detailed look at
today's New
York primary and what lies ahead
later in

03:36.817 --> 03:38.752 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the program.

03:38.852 --> 03:42.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news, a
two-man Taliban raid shook the
heart of Afghanistan's

03:42.789 --> 03:48.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
capital city, killing 28 people
and wounding
hundreds more. The combined
bombing and gun

03:48.929 --> 03:53.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
battle raised new questions
about the government's
ability to secure the country.
We will have

03:53.567 --> 03:57.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a look at the Taliban's strength
in Afghanistan
right after the news summary.

03:57.904 --> 04:01.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Hundreds of
international
rescue workers fanned out in
Ecuador today,

04:01.441 --> 04:07.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking for earthquake victims.
The weekend
disaster killed at least 433
people. Soldiers

04:07.180 --> 04:11.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and volunteers joined those
digging through
the rubble on the country's
Pacific coast.

04:11.651 --> 04:15.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The military also dispensed
food, water and
other supplies to survivors.

04:15.655 --> 04:22.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another strong
aftershock rattled
Southern Japan, and the death
toll rose to

04:22.329 --> 04:28.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
45 in last week's twin quakes.
Meanwhile,
a key airport reopened, allowing
the first

04:28.435 --> 04:33.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passengers and relief goods to
land. Most
outbound passenger flights are
still canceled.

04:33.907 --> 04:38.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Cuba, Raul
Castro and
the country's old guard will
keep top positions

04:38.512 --> 04:42.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the ruling Communist Party,
despite calls
for reform. The government
announced today

04:43.049 --> 04:49.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Castro at 84 will stay on
as party first
secretary and Cuba's president;
89-year-old

04:49.256 --> 04:52.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fidel Castro also made a rare
appearance at
the party congress.

04:52.559 --> 04:57.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
left for a
trip to Saudi Arabia today, at a
time of tension

04:57.764 --> 05:03.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between the two nations. The
Saudis have criticized
the nuclear deal with Iran. And
in a recent

05:03.970 --> 05:08.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interview, Mr. Obama said the
Sunni kingdom
needs to -- quote -- "share the
Middle East"

05:08.608 --> 05:10.343 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Shiite Iran.

05:10.443 --> 05:14.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He departed today after trying
to clarify
his meaning in an interview with
PBS' Charlie

05:14.514 --> 05:18.885 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Rose:
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states
generally

05:18.985 --> 05:23.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to be guarded against Iran
and they have
to be in a position where they
can defend

05:23.690 --> 05:31.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
themselves against Iranian
mischief in the
region, but that, in the end,
Iran is a large

05:31.898 --> 05:38.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country in the region, and that
a proxy war
between Saudi Arabia and Iran is
in nobody's

05:38.705 --> 05:40.507 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interests.

05:40.607 --> 05:44.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The trip also
comes as Congress
considers letting families of
September 11

05:44.611 --> 05:50.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
victims sue the Saudi government
over any
role it played in the attack.
The White House

05:50.150 --> 05:55.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opposes the Senate bill, but
senior members
of both parties voiced support
for it today.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Texas Republican John Cornyn is
the main sponsor:

05:58.725 --> 06:02.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R), Texas: I
think now the
president seems to want to use
the leverage

06:02.162 --> 06:10.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the 9/11 families in order to
somehow mollify
or cure that rift that the
president has created

06:10.303 --> 06:15.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
himself as result of the Iranian
nuclear deal.
I think that's entirely
inappropriate. And

06:15.475 --> 06:21.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as I tried to point out, we
actually need
to deter people from
facilitating and financing

06:21.815 --> 06:23.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terrorist attacks on our own
soil.

06:23.683 --> 06:27.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Both Senate
Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell and House
Speaker Paul Ryan

06:28.054 --> 06:32.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said today that they still need
to review
the bill. The Saudis have
threatened to pull

06:32.792 --> 06:37.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
billions of dollars from the
U.S. economy
if it becomes it law.

06:37.163 --> 06:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Major parts of
Houston were
still under water today, after
widespread

06:40.600 --> 06:45.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flooding that's killed six
people so far.
School was canceled again in the
nation's

06:45.105 --> 06:49.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fourth largest city, and
hundreds of people
were in shelters. Emergency
teams worked around

06:49.743 --> 06:54.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the clock to evacuate homes
flooded by the
deluge. More than a foot of rain
fell Monday,

06:54.514 --> 06:57.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and a flash flood watch remained
in effect.

06:57.517 --> 07:03.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The nation's
largest health
insurer will pull out of
insurance exchanges

07:03.223 --> 07:05.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in most states by next year.

07:05.425 --> 07:10.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UnitedHealth said today that
it's losing too
much money on the system
established under

07:10.463 --> 07:16.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president's Affordable Care
Act. The company
covers just under 800,000 people
in exchanges

07:16.936 --> 07:20.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across 34 states. That's about 6
percent of
the total.

07:20.840 --> 07:25.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Intel has
announced it's
cutting 12,000 jobs worldwide,
about 11 percent

07:25.945 --> 07:31.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of its work force. The computer
chip maker
says it needs to cut costs, as
sales of P.C.s

07:31.217 --> 07:33.019 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decline.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial
average gained 49 points to
close at 18053.

07:37.023 --> 07:41.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 19 points and
the S&amp;P 50 rose
six.

07:41.561 --> 07:45.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
Special Envoy Brett McGurk on
the decision

07:45.865 --> 07:51.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to send more troops to Iraq; how
New York's
primary could shift the momentum
in the presidential

07:52.005 --> 08:10.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race; schools across the U.S.
grappling with
lead-tainted water, and much
more.

08:10.156 --> 08:16.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We return to our top story, the
upsurge in
Taliban-driven violence in
Afghanistan, nearly

08:16.629 --> 08:21.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
15 years into the American
involvement there.

08:21.434 --> 08:25.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Smoke over the Kabul skyline
signaled the
capital was under attack.

08:25.405 --> 08:30.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMAD NAVID, Witness (through
translator):
It was a big blast. Dust covered
all the area.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wasn't able to see what was
happening. Later,
I saw lot of damage.

08:33.146 --> 08:38.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One insurgent
blew up a truck
bomb outside a security agency
that protects

08:38.618 --> 08:43.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
top officials. A second attacker
ran into
the compound and started
shooting.

08:43.623 --> 08:47.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEN. ABDUL RAHMAN RAHIMI, Kabul
Police Chief
(through translator): After the
car bomb exploded,

08:47.260 --> 08:51.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a suicide bomber was trying to
enter the building.
He came under fire from inside
the building,

08:51.231 --> 08:55.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well as from police forces
who were outside,
who didn't give him the chance
to enter. He

08:55.635 --> 08:57.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was killed.

08:57.637 --> 09:02.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The attack caused
extensive
damage just a few hundred yards
from the presidential

09:02.242 --> 09:06.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
palace. Meanwhile, fighting
continued in the
northern part of the country,
where government

09:07.046 --> 09:12.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
forces around Kunduz have
battled this week
to repel a Taliban assault.

09:12.452 --> 09:19.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Last year, the militants
captured the city
and held it for three days
before Afghan forces

09:19.192 --> 09:25.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
backed by U.S. airstrikes drove
them out.
But Afghanistan's chief
executive, Abdullah

09:25.265 --> 09:31.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Abdullah, said Kunduz and Kabul
show the Taliban's
latest spring offensive has
failed.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDULLAH ABDULLAH, Afghan Chief
Executive
(through translator): They were
defeated all

09:34.474 --> 09:38.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the country after they
carried out their
attacks and have suffered lots
of causalities.

09:38.478 --> 09:41.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, by carrying this suicide
attack, they
wanted to take revenge.

09:41.948 --> 09:47.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still, by most
reckoning, the
Taliban is at its strongest in
years, likely

09:47.854 --> 09:54.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a concern for President Obama,
when he reversed
course last fall, and announced
the U.S. will

09:54.427 --> 10:03.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
keep 10,000 troops in
Afghanistan through
this year, drawing down to 5,500
in 2017.

10:03.203 --> 10:07.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on today's attack in
Kabul, and what
it says about the overall
security situation

10:07.740 --> 10:12.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Afghanistan, we turn to Seth
Jones. He's
director of the International
Security and

10:12.679 --> 10:18.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Defense Policy center at the
RAND Corporation.
He's written extensively about
Afghanistan,

10:18.518 --> 10:24.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and in 2011 was a special
adviser to U.S.
special operation forces there.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Seth Jones, welcome back to the
program.

10:26.092 --> 10:31.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what does this attack today
in Kabul say
about the Taliban? Is it
stronger than it's

10:31.631 --> 10:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been, or, as Abdullah Abdullah
says, is what
it's doing failing?

10:36.569 --> 10:40.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH JONES, RAND Corporation:
Well, Judy,
I think what it shows is the
Taliban does

10:40.974 --> 10:45.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have the ability to conduct
attacks in most
any parts of the country.

10:45.278 --> 10:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they actually said this in
their Twitter
feeds today and in their
Internet announcements

10:50.783 --> 10:54.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after the attack of the purpose
of doing this.
At the same time, it's probably
also worth

10:54.854 --> 11:01.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knowing that the Taliban doesn't
control urban
terrain, like ISIS does in Iraq,
for example.

11:01.160 --> 11:04.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't control Kabul. They
don't control
any major provincial capitals.

11:04.697 --> 11:09.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So these kind of urban attacks
are done more
for psychological operations,
rather than

11:09.168 --> 11:11.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
control of territory.

11:11.137 --> 11:13.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what's the
distinction,
though? You say they don't
control urban areas,

11:13.806 --> 11:18.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they're able to pull off
something like
this, almost 30 people killed,
hundreds badly

11:18.511 --> 11:20.346 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hurt.

11:20.446 --> 11:24.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH JONES: Yes. What it shows,
they do control
a fair amount of rural terrain.
They also

11:24.617 --> 11:29.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have cell structures that
operate in cities.
So while the government controls
most of the

11:29.822 --> 11:35.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
urban terrain in cities like
Kabul, the Taliban
does have an ability to push in
resources

11:35.295 --> 11:37.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and conduct attacks.

11:37.163 --> 11:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it certainly has an effect
on the population
there, which believes the
government can't

11:40.433 --> 11:42.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
secure it at all times.

11:42.402 --> 11:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so that
psychological effect,
why isn't that the same or
almost the same

11:48.374 --> 11:50.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as having actual control?

11:50.243 --> 11:56.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH JONES: Well, it's different
because the
Taliban does a lot. It
administers justice

11:56.516 --> 12:00.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in areas that it controls. It
taxes the local
population.

12:00.486 --> 12:06.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has a political structure,
almost a political
state apparatus, in areas that
it controls.

12:06.292 --> 12:11.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't have that in cities
like Kabul.
What it has is really a military
and intelligence

12:11.497 --> 12:16.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
infrastructure, but it wants the
political
architecture to go with that. So
this -- it

12:16.903 --> 12:18.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is part of a longer-term
campaign.

12:19.005 --> 12:25.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What does this
say, Seth Jones,
about the standing of Afghan
security forces,

12:25.712 --> 12:30.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which we know the U.S. has been
trying to
build up for years now?

12:30.149 --> 12:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH JONES: Look, there are
plenty of challenges
with the Afghan national
security forces.

12:36.022 --> 12:41.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The higher-end forces that
responded to this
today, the intelligence forces,
the Afghan

12:41.694 --> 12:48.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
commandos, the Qataha (ph), some
of the higher-end
army forces, are pretty good.

12:48.134 --> 12:53.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the general state of the
police and a
lot of the army kandaks are of
mixed quality.

12:54.040 --> 12:59.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the problem that we're
seeing is,
they're not very proactive in
pushing out

12:59.278 --> 13:03.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against the Taliban in rural
areas. And so
the fight is now coming to them
in the cities.

13:03.916 --> 13:07.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you assess
what the
U.S. is doing? We know the
president decided

13:08.087 --> 13:14.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to keep American troops in
Afghanistan longer,
but what is the -- what role is
the posture

13:14.394 --> 13:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- is U.S. posture playing right
now in this
battle between Afghans -- the
Afghan government

13:20.933 --> 13:22.869 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and the Taliban?

13:22.969 --> 13:25.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH JONES: Well, first of all,
the U.S. president
has said that the number of
troops, it will

13:25.672 --> 13:31.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continue to come down through
January of 2017.
So now we're roughly 10,000. He
said they're

13:31.911 --> 13:35.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to go down to about 10,000
-- about
5,500.

13:35.348 --> 13:41.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also restricted the ability
to conduct
strikes against the Taliban a
few other groups

13:41.954 --> 13:47.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like the Haqqani Network without
-- unless
there's a good example of those
forces conducting

13:48.027 --> 13:52.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks against Americans. So,
there are also
limits on what the U.S. can do
training out

13:52.832 --> 13:54.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the field.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the U.S. has sort of limited
its ability
to impact this, except in
response to these

13:59.005 --> 14:00.239 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
kinds of attacks.

14:00.339 --> 14:03.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we are
continuing to
watch the story.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Seth Jones, we thank you for
joining us.

14:05.144 --> 14:06.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SETH JONES: Thanks, Judy.

14:06.746 --> 14:12.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: to another
major American
military campaign, against ISIS.

14:12.485 --> 14:18.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, Secretary of Defense
Ash Carter
announced that some 217 more
American troops

14:18.157 --> 14:24.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would soon go to Iraq, pushing
the American
strength there to over 4,000.
The U.S. will

14:24.464 --> 14:30.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also send Apache fast-attack
helicopters,
which will help protect the
Iraqi army as

14:30.303 --> 14:34.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it begins its advance on the
ISIS-held city
of Mosul.

14:34.140 --> 14:40.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. also announced more
than $400 million
in aid to the Kurdish Peshmerga
forces in

14:40.780 --> 14:42.648 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Northern Iraq.

14:42.749 --> 14:46.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on all this and the
wider war against
ISIS, I'm joined by President
Obama's special

14:47.086 --> 14:51.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
envoy to the coalition fighting
ISIS, Brett
McGurk.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome back to the program.

14:53.659 --> 14:53.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRETT MCGURK, Special
Presidential Envoy for
the Global Coalition to Counter
ISIL: Thank

14:54.093 --> 14:55.828 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you, Judy.

14:55.928 --> 14:59.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why is -- and why
is the president
sending these additional U.S.
advisers?

14:59.665 --> 15:05.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRETT MCGURK: Well, the
president really instructed
our team about four or five
months ago to

15:05.171 --> 15:08.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do all we can to accelerate the
campaign.

15:08.541 --> 15:13.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it took a while, Judy, to
get particularly
the Iraqi forces in place to be
able to stand

15:13.713 --> 15:18.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up, maneuver, conduct offensive
operations.
And we're now seeing some
success. They liberated

15:18.684 --> 15:24.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ramadi just last week. They
liberated a really
critical strategic town called
Al-Hit just

15:24.924 --> 15:27.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the west of Ramadi in the
center of the
Euphrates Valley.

15:27.560 --> 15:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been a stronghold of ISIL.
And they liberated
that last week. And what we're
now in position

15:33.199 --> 15:38.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do with the Iraqi security
forces is conduct
pressure against ISIL on
multiple simultaneous

15:38.337 --> 15:42.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fronts. That's the Euphrates
Valley and Anbar
Province, where operations will
continue,

15:42.475 --> 15:44.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and now beginning up toward
Mosul.

15:44.811 --> 15:48.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is really a package
that's been in
development for some time, and
we think it

15:48.881 --> 15:53.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will give the Iraqis some unique
capabilities
as it moves on Mosul. Mosul is a
little different

15:54.053 --> 15:59.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than Ramadi. Logistically, the
Iraqis have
the travel a little further than
they're usually

15:59.425 --> 16:01.260 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
used to.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we will be helping with
logistics, we will
be helping with sustainment.
And, of course,

16:03.663 --> 16:08.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when they come into combat, we
will be ready
to support them with Apache
helicopters and

16:08.234 --> 16:10.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some other enablers.

16:10.102 --> 16:15.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But sending U.S.
forces or
U.S. advisers closer to the
front lines, is

16:15.107 --> 16:19.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this an acknowledgment the Iraqi
military
is really not able to do the job
alone??

16:19.879 --> 16:25.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRETT MCGURK: No, it's really --
you have
to look at the topography of the
battlefield.

16:25.351 --> 16:32.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Ramadi, for example, when
Ramadi fell,
the president ordered a
detachment of U.S.

16:32.992 --> 16:37.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
special forces to Taqaddum Air
Base, which
is sandwiched right in between
Ramadi and

16:37.363 --> 16:42.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fallujah. It's only about 25
kilometers or
so from the front lines.

16:42.368 --> 16:48.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mosul is -- we have to be with
the Iraqis
in their headquarters, and their
headquarters

16:48.140 --> 16:52.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as they move toward Mosul will
change. They
will be kind of mobile. So we
will be with

16:52.545 --> 16:56.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Iraqi commanders, advising
and assisting
what they're doing, which is
very similar

16:56.782 --> 16:59.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to what we did in Anbar
province.

16:59.852 --> 17:04.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in Anbar, where we have two
facilities,
it's a little more stationary.
So, we're on

17:04.290 --> 17:07.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
base. We're advising and
assisting. In Mosul,
there will be a lot of -- it
will be a little

17:07.860 --> 17:12.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more dynamic. So, we want to
make sure that
our best advisers are with the
headquarters,

17:12.798 --> 17:16.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Iraqi commanders as
they're planning
and conducting their operations.

17:16.335 --> 17:18.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it fair the
call this mission
creep?

17:18.638 --> 17:23.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRETT MCGURK: No, it's the exact
same mission
in Mosul that we have been doing
in Anbar

17:23.743 --> 17:27.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
province. It's just we're moving
into that
phase in Mosul now. It's the
same mission.

17:28.080 --> 17:32.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only difference is Apache
helicopters.
But we were prepared to use
Apache helicopters.

17:33.019 --> 17:36.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president authorized it for
Ramadi, but
given the situation, given the
fact that the

17:36.856 --> 17:40.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqis were having an awful lot
of success,
and given the urban environment,
we determined

17:40.293 --> 17:42.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that it really wasn't needed.

17:42.228 --> 17:46.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in Mosul, it's a complex
terrain. It's
the citadel of Da'esh. They're
well-defended

17:46.732 --> 17:51.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there. So, we think Apaches can
make a difference.
We discussed this with the Iraqi
government.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everything we do in Iraq is with
the consent
of the Iraqi government. This is
something

17:55.074 --> 17:59.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prime Minister Abadi wanted. And
we found
a formula that we think will be
effective.

17:59.245 --> 18:02.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you about
some criticism we're hearing
from the other

18:02.715 --> 18:08.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side. The "NewsHour" spoke today
with retired
Army Colonel Derek Harvey, who,
as you know,

18:08.487 --> 18:11.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advised General David Petraeus
in Iraq for
a number of years.

18:11.857 --> 18:17.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told us he thinks these steps
represent
insufficient resources in the
first place

18:17.129 --> 18:23.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the administration and poor
execution by
the administration working with
the Iraqis.

18:23.402 --> 18:27.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRETT MCGURK: Well, I worked in
Iraq with
David Petraeus back in those
days, too, and

18:27.974 --> 18:31.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ambassador Crocker. It's a
different time
now. We're not fighting a war.

18:31.644 --> 18:36.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Iraqis are fighting the war.
We're in
the middle of liberating all of
Anbar province.

18:36.582 --> 18:40.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, we liberated Ramadi. That
was done
with Iraqis. We're now moving
west up the

18:41.053 --> 18:46.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Euphrates Valley. This is being
done with
Iraqis. The strategic town of
Al-Hit is critical

18:46.392 --> 18:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because it opens up a free
expressway from
Ramadi to Haditha.

18:50.830 --> 18:55.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a town of Haditha, which
has been
under siege by Da'esh for almost
two years.

18:55.401 --> 18:59.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're now in a position to break
that siege.
So, we're having an awful lot of
success.

18:59.672 --> 19:06.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a different campaign than
it was in 2007-2008.
You know, Americans are not
doing the fighting.

19:06.846 --> 19:13.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We are advising. We're
assisting. We're providing
devastating air support and
special operations.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, there are things we of
course don't
talk about much. We have special
operations

19:16.856 --> 19:21.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and special forces in Northern
Iraq. They're
very effective against the
leadership of Da'esh.

19:21.460 --> 19:26.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, you know, they're doing
a great job.
And everything we do, again,
Judy, is with

19:26.232 --> 19:30.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the consent of the Iraqi
government. This
is not a situation in which
we're an occupying

19:30.970 --> 19:35.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force. We're just -- it's a
very, very different,
much more complex, much more
challenging situation

19:35.808 --> 19:37.710 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than 2007.

19:37.810 --> 19:42.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we believe that the most
sustainable way
to do this is to get the Iraqis
fighting,

19:42.748 --> 19:44.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to empower locals.

19:44.650 --> 19:46.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you can
understand why
people look at this, and they
see more troops

19:47.019 --> 19:50.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
going, they see Apache
helicopters going,
and they want to know what's
going on.

19:50.656 --> 19:54.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But just in the time we have
left, I want
to ask you about Syria, the
fight against

19:54.994 --> 20:01.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS there. First of all, do you
see real
evidence that the Russians have
begun to go

20:01.567 --> 20:07.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after ISIS, rather than going
after the rebels
who are fighting the Assad
regime?

20:08.007 --> 20:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRETT MCGURK: Well, we have seen
a bit of
a shift.

20:11.410 --> 20:16.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if you look at the
statistics that we
talk about, when Russia came in,
they claimed

20:16.248 --> 20:19.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be going after ISIL. And that
just simply
wasn't true. About 80 percent of
their strikes

20:19.952 --> 20:23.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were against opposition, the
moderate opposition
forces.

20:23.522 --> 20:27.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Since the cessation of
hostilities came in
place, their airstrikes have
shifted quite

20:27.526 --> 20:33.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a bit. And at one point, it was
about 70 percent
against ISIL. And they helped
the Syrian forces

20:33.699 --> 20:35.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
retake Palmyra.

20:35.601 --> 20:40.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, look, we have a very long
way to go in
Syria. There is no question.
President Obama

20:40.372 --> 20:45.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spoke with President Putin
yesterday. We will
be traveling with the president
and secretary

20:45.277 --> 20:50.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tonight to Saudi Arabia to meet
with the GCC
and discuss the situation in
Syria.

20:50.616 --> 20:54.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the war against ISIL in
Syria, we're
very focused, again, east of the
Euphrates

20:54.920 --> 20:58.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
River, on moving down and
constricting Al-Raqqa,
its center of operations. And
that's something

20:59.091 --> 21:02.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we're also looking at
accelerating some
of our efforts there.

21:02.428 --> 21:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're also working to again
close off
that last about 98-kilometer
strip of border

21:07.166 --> 21:10.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that ISIL still controls with
Turkey. And
there's very active fighting
ongoing there

21:11.036 --> 21:16.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now, which we're supporting.
It's a very complex,
very dynamic situation. There
are no shortcuts.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are no easy answers.

21:18.077 --> 21:21.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we're doing is that,
when we see
something that works -- and what
we have seen

21:21.780 --> 21:25.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Euphrates Valley and
Anbar province,
the advising, the assisting,
that's worked.

21:25.584 --> 21:30.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we're going to replicate
that as we
move onto the campaign against
-- to liberate

21:30.656 --> 21:32.358 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mosul.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, a lot of
fronts to keep
track of there, as well as in
Iraq.

21:35.995 --> 21:40.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Brett McGurk, special
presidential envoy,
you're off to Saudi Arabia later
today, where

21:40.533 --> 21:43.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama will be. Thank
you very much
for joining for us.

21:43.836 --> 21:47.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRETT MCGURK: Judy, thank you so
much. Great
to be here.

21:47.873 --> 21:58.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, for more
on today's
Empire State primary, we're
joined by Tamara

21:59.051 --> 22:04.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Keith of NPR, who is in New York
City tonight,
and in Albany is Karen DeWitt,
Capitol bureau

22:04.256 --> 22:06.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chief for New York State Public
Radio.

22:06.592 --> 22:07.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, Tamara, let me start with
you.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What are you looking for
tonight?

22:09.428 --> 22:13.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: I'm looking
for a margins of victory.

22:13.499 --> 22:18.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is in search of a
clean sweep
of delegates. And the only way
he can get

22:18.704 --> 22:23.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is if he can get more than
50 percent
of the vote. And on the
Democratic side, Hillary

22:23.909 --> 22:30.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton is widely expected to
win here. Bernie
Sanders' campaign is sending
around an e-mail

22:30.382 --> 22:37.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking about how, in 2008, she
beat President
Obama by 17 percent, which seems
to be setting

22:37.223 --> 22:40.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up a question of what the margin
would be
this time.

22:40.993 --> 22:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders is expected to do better
than that.
He's expected to keep it
relatively close.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The question is just how close.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Karen, how
about you? What
are you looking for as you look
at the returns

22:51.537 --> 22:52.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
later this evening?

22:53.038 --> 22:54.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN DEWITT, New York State
Public Radio:
Well, yes, I would agree.

22:54.907 --> 22:59.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Hillary Clinton doesn't do a
10 percent
win better than Bernie Sanders,
it's going

22:59.745 --> 23:04.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to look bad for her, because she
has the party
establishment support here, the
support of

23:04.683 --> 23:08.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor Cuomo, New York City
Mayor Bill de
Blasio. She was our senator for
eight years,

23:08.821 --> 23:10.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a very popular senator.

23:10.656 --> 23:15.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, if she doesn't do a
double-digit win,
I think it's going to look quite
bad for her.

23:15.327 --> 23:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm also looking at turnout.
I mean, big
turnout does help Bernie
Sanders. It helps

23:20.366 --> 23:26.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump. And, you know,
anecdotally,
we have heard a lot about
turnout being quite

23:26.438 --> 23:32.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high almost everywhere, and
particularly in
a number of Upstate places, like
Syracuse

23:32.411 --> 23:35.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
University, where there's a lot
of students,
who presumably support Bernie
Sanders.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that's another thing to be
looking at as
well.

23:38.284 --> 23:41.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, Karen,
staying with
you for a second, what about the
demographics

23:41.453 --> 23:45.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Republican side? Are
Upstate voters
in New York, Upstate
Republicans, different

23:45.524 --> 23:49.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than city slicker Republicans in
Manhattan
or the boroughs?

23:49.261 --> 23:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN DEWITT: Well, there are
not very many
New York City Republicans.
There's very few

23:54.733 --> 23:58.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of them. Their base is Long
Island and Westchester
and then Upstate.

23:59.004 --> 24:04.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, they're not as conservative
as national
Republicans. I think that's why
we have seen

24:04.143 --> 24:08.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz hasn't done as well.
They're kind
of independent-minded people. I
think that's

24:08.580 --> 24:12.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why Donald Trump has really
resonated with
them as well.

24:12.117 --> 24:17.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, Tamara,
these are candidates
now that are focused on already
next week's

24:17.856 --> 24:23.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stuff. As we kind of looked at,
Ted Cruz has
turned the corner and left. John
Kasich is

24:23.295 --> 24:26.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in different places, Bernie
Sanders, Hillary
Clinton. They're already looking
to next Tuesday.

24:26.665 --> 24:33.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Absolutely,
because the primary
moves on from here, though the
Clinton campaign

24:34.006 --> 24:39.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is also beginning to have this
conversation
where they say, we aren't asking
Bernie Sanders

24:39.178 --> 24:44.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to drop out of the race, but we
are saying,
it looks like Clinton is going
to be the nominee,

24:44.817 --> 24:46.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
maybe Sanders should change the
tone.

24:46.785 --> 24:51.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the Clinton campaign really
feels like
New York turns a corner. The
Sanders campaign

24:51.724 --> 24:58.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't agree, and they are
planning to compete
all the way through California
on June 7.

24:58.430 --> 25:03.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they believe that he does
have momentum
and that he will continue to.

25:03.836 --> 25:09.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the delegate math is a real
challenge
for Sanders at this point going
forward into

25:09.141 --> 25:10.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the states ahead.

25:10.976 --> 25:13.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, Tamara,
staying with
you, this is not a
winner-take-all state,

25:14.046 --> 25:18.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like we have had in several
other contests.
What happens as we get on both
the Republican

25:18.884 --> 25:22.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
side of demographics, the
Democratic side,
without too much math?

25:22.488 --> 25:24.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

25:24.189 --> 25:30.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, on the Democratic side, like
in every
state, it's proportional, and so
you can't

25:30.262 --> 25:36.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really win huge in any state,
but there are
a lot of delegates at stake here
in New York.

25:36.135 --> 25:40.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Republican side, it's --
if Donald
Trump gets more than 50 percent,
then there

25:40.806 --> 25:42.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are some statewide delegates
that he would
get.

25:42.875 --> 25:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then each congressional
district, if you
get more than 50 percent, it's
winner-take-all.

25:47.846 --> 25:50.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Otherwise, it's divided up.

25:50.215 --> 25:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Karen, as you
talk to voters
over the past week, have the
recent challenges

25:56.555 --> 26:01.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that both Donald Trump and
Hillary Clinton
have faced, the idea that
momentum might be

26:01.393 --> 26:04.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shifting to other candidates,
has that resonated
with voters Upstate?

26:04.930 --> 26:11.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN DEWITT: Yes, one thing I
would add is
that it is -- New York is --
really has a

26:11.136 --> 26:15.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
closed primary, more closed than
other states.

26:15.274 --> 26:19.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you wanted to switch parties
or join a
party, you had to do it last
October. If you're

26:19.611 --> 26:23.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new voter, you had to register
by March.
So I think what we're really
seeing is a lot

26:23.949 --> 26:28.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of people are disappointed
because, if they
were newly interested in the
last two weeks,

26:28.620 --> 26:31.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're being left out of being
able to vote
in the primary today.

26:31.990 --> 26:35.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And then what
about that
idea of momentum shifting in the
past few

26:35.461 --> 26:38.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weeks? Has that crossed the
minds of the voters
you have spoken with?

26:38.964 --> 26:44.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN DEWITT: I don't think so,
really. I
think, like, New York voters are
focused on

26:44.670 --> 26:49.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York. We have seen the
campaign be all
about New York, specific to
regions Upstate,

26:49.908 --> 26:51.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to New York City.

26:51.877 --> 26:54.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the candidates are here. And
I don't think
that certainly voters here are
really thinking

26:55.047 --> 26:56.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
much beyond that at all.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Are there any
specific -- Karen,
are there any specific issues
Upstate that

26:59.885 --> 27:02.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are different from the ones that
voters are
facing in the cities?

27:02.855 --> 27:07.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN DEWITT: Well, you know,
Upstate, it's
a different world up here. It's
more rural.

27:07.893 --> 27:11.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have all these are Rust Belt
cities, where
manufacturing has left.

27:12.064 --> 27:17.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people are really discontent
over the
economy. And I think that both
Sanders and

27:17.536 --> 27:23.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump have resonated with these
voters here
who aren't feeling really good
about their

27:23.208 --> 27:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
future. They see their children
having to
leave after college to get jobs.
The jobs

27:28.280 --> 27:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aren't here. So it really is
kind of a different
world.

27:31.517 --> 27:37.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's had to be at least
two different
campaigns, if not, as Tamara
said, 27 different

27:37.856 --> 27:41.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaigns because of the 27
congressional
districts, where they're having
to compete

27:41.560 --> 27:43.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in every single one of them.

27:43.462 --> 27:46.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Karen DeWitt,
Capitol bureau chief for New
York State Public

National Public
Radio, thanks so much for
joining us tonight.

27:50.936 --> 27:56.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

27:56.241 --> 28:01.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAREN DEWITT: Sure thing.

28:01.547 --> 28:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

28:05.150 --> 28:09.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

28:18.897 --> 28:23.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: worries over lead in
the water
in school districts around the
country.

28:23.769 --> 28:29.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The outcry over Flint, Michigan
has brought
a new spotlight to problems
elsewhere. Communities

28:29.107 --> 28:33.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are becoming more sensitive to
the issue,
but many schools are having a
hard time dealing

28:33.812 --> 28:36.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with something so complex and
expensive.

28:36.448 --> 28:41.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s April Brown
reports for our
weekly education series, Making
the Grade.

28:42.020 --> 28:46.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Across the nation,
there has
been a lot of news coverage on a
growing problem

28:46.158 --> 28:48.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in many schools.

28:48.126 --> 28:52.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: This afternoon, a Central
Indiana school
district is on high alert after
unsafe levels

28:52.230 --> 28:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of lead are discovered in its
water.

28:54.266 --> 28:58.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Test results within
Ithaca School District
that show high amounts of lead
in water sources.

28:58.937 --> 29:03.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: But none of this is
new to second-grader
Cyrus Schillenback, who knows a
lot more about

29:03.775 --> 29:05.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lead than most kids his age.

29:05.711 --> 29:11.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYRUS SCHILLENBACK, Student:
It's very dangerous.
And if you eat it, you will get
poisonous

29:11.483 --> 29:13.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- poisoned quite quick.

29:13.185 --> 29:14.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: And if you drink
it?

29:14.720 --> 29:17.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CYRUS SCHILLENBACK: And if you
drink it, it's
the same.

29:17.122 --> 29:20.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Cyrus and his
brother Cazimer
(ph) attends Caroline
Elementary, just outside

29:20.926 --> 29:25.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ithaca, New York. Their school
was one of
two in the area where high
levels of lead

29:25.330 --> 29:27.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were found in the water last
August.

29:27.366 --> 29:32.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But parents, including Cyrus'
mom Rebecca,
say it wasn't until January they
were told

29:32.971 --> 29:37.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their kids might have been
exposed for months
to a neurotoxin that is
especially harmful

29:38.043 --> 29:39.778 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to children.

29:39.878 --> 29:44.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA SCHILLENBACK, Mother: We
got a letter
home. It was kind of cryptic. It
said there

29:45.083 --> 29:52.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been elevated lead found,
and we're sure
you want to talk about this,
basically, so

29:52.224 --> 29:55.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come to this parent meeting,
this informational
parent meeting.

29:55.193 --> 29:58.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: That February
meeting got heated
at times.

29:58.130 --> 30:04.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: My daughter's classroom
had elevated
lead levels. I got papers home,
papers, not

30:04.236 --> 30:07.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even the courtesy of a phone
call.

30:07.806 --> 30:11.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
APRIL BROWN: The district
wouldn't make anyone
available to speak with us, but
administrator

30:11.977 --> 30:14.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
David Brown spoke at the
community meeting.

30:14.179 --> 30:18.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROWN, Ithaca City School
District:
We should have reported. We
should have retested.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We didn't. We waited for the
county health
department. That was in
September. I can't

30:20.552 --> 30:25.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go back to September. That is
where we are
right now.

30:25.123 --> 30:26.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Neither can we.

30:27.025 --> 30:28.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Caroline parent
Melissa Hoffman
felt the district should have
taken action

30:29.061 --> 30:30.762 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much sooner.

30:30.862 --> 30:36.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELISSA HOFFMAN, Parent: I was
very alarmed.
My heart was just exploding with
fear for

30:36.268 --> 30:42.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my child, for all the children,
for the teacher,
and I felt helpless.

30:42.874 --> 30:48.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Over the past few
decades, districts
in Los Angeles, New York City,
Seattle, Washington,

30:48.213 --> 30:54.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
D.C., and elsewhere have found
higher-than-acceptable
lead levels in school drinking
water.

30:54.319 --> 30:58.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's cause for concern,
according to Lynn
Goldman, a former regulator with
the Environmental

30:58.557 --> 31:03.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Protection Agency and now dean
of the George
Washington University's School
of Public Health.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. LYNN GOLDMAN, Dean, George
Washington
University School of Public
Health: Lead is

31:05.464 --> 31:09.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quite toxic to children, and
especially when
it comes to the development of
their nervous

31:09.935 --> 31:14.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
system, the brain, but also the
cardiovascular
system.

31:14.439 --> 31:20.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: In fact, the EPA
warns that exposure
to even low levels of lead can
cause low I.Q.,

31:20.512 --> 31:24.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hearing impairment, reduced
attention span,
and poor classroom performance.

31:24.850 --> 31:29.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, how does lead get into
school drinking
water? Many school buildings in
the U.S. are

31:29.921 --> 31:34.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
old and were built when lead
pipes, solder
or fixtures were allowed to be
used. When

31:34.860 --> 31:39.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water is in contact with these
materials for
extended periods of time, over
weekends and

31:39.598 --> 31:44.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
holidays, for example, the toxin
can leach
into it. Water can also become
contaminated

31:44.603 --> 31:47.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if small particles containing
lead break off.

31:47.139 --> 31:53.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANNA LAMBRINIDOU, Virginia
Tech: This amount
of water is expected to diagnose
whether there

31:53.612 --> 31:57.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a lead and water problem
associated with
a specific tap.

31:57.516 --> 32:01.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Yanna Lambrinidou,
who teaches
at Virginia Tech and has studied
lead in water

32:02.053 --> 32:05.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nationally, says finding lead
contamination
can be tricky.

32:05.157 --> 32:10.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANNA LAMBRINIDOU: The nature of
the beast
is that lead levels in water are
unpredictable,

32:10.729 --> 32:16.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and exposure is really like a
Russian roulette.
You might hit a very, very high
lead in water

32:16.501 --> 32:21.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sample, and then you might hit
no lead in
water for the rest of the
samples you take.

32:21.706 --> 32:27.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: The EPA's Safe
Drinking Water
Act originally created in 1974
doesn't require

32:27.312 --> 32:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all schools to perform regular
water testing.
Only schools and child care
centers with their

32:32.651 --> 32:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own water supplies, such as
Wells, are required
to do so.

32:36.888 --> 32:41.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Lynn Goldman says that and
the fact no
one agency is responsible for
removing lead

32:41.927 --> 32:46.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from school drinking water are
big gaps in
the regulatory system. And she
says this is

32:47.065 --> 32:50.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a national problem that we
really don't yet
know the scope of.

32:50.302 --> 32:55.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. LYNN GOLDMAN: Until fairly
recently, lead
was allowed in so many materials
that wound

32:55.340 --> 32:57.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up in the plumbing.

32:57.209 --> 33:00.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: And, according to
the EPA, for
schools that must test, the
amount of lead

33:00.445 --> 33:04.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allowed in their drinking water
is higher
than what's allowed in homes.

33:04.516 --> 33:09.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Yanna Lambrinidou says those
levels were
not chosen based on public
health protection.

33:09.221 --> 33:15.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANNA LAMBRINIDOU: The only
level of lead
in drinking water that is safe
is zero. And,

33:15.660 --> 33:23.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in fact, EPA's lead and cooper
rule states
very clearly that, when it comes
to health

33:23.602 --> 33:26.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and a health-based standard,
zero is our number.

33:26.838 --> 33:30.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
APRIL BROWN: Last month,
officials in Newark,
New Jersey, began offering to
test thousands

33:30.609 --> 33:35.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of children and shut off water
in more than
half its 67 schools after
finding lead levels

33:35.947 --> 33:38.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exceeding the EPA's safety
threshold.

33:38.783 --> 33:42.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Newark teachers union
believes some
in the district may have known
about the problem

33:42.354 --> 33:48.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earlier, and shared an advisory
from 2014
with instructions on how to
reduce the risk

33:48.159 --> 33:53.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of possible lead contamination.
The districts
told member station NJTV
remedial actions

33:54.032 --> 33:57.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are taken when elevated samples
are detected.

33:57.802 --> 34:02.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Newark Mayor Ras Baraka recently
asked for
the community's help to deal
with the situation.

34:02.140 --> 34:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAS BARAKA, Mayor of Newark, New
Jersey: We
need at least 2,000 to 3,000
people to bring

34:07.679 --> 34:12.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us two cases of water apiece and
drop them
off at all of our community
centers.

34:12.784 --> 34:16.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Using bottled water
has been
the solution for Baltimore City
Public Schools

34:17.055 --> 34:18.023 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for years.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you guys know why you can't
drink the water?

34:20.792 --> 34:22.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: Because it's like --
something wrong
with it.

34:22.928 --> 34:28.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: That something
wrong is lead
contamination. In 2007, after
years of lead

34:28.767 --> 34:33.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
testing and remediation, the
district decided
to shut off all drinking
fountains and food

34:34.005 --> 34:38.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
preparation sinks in cafeterias
and move to
bottled water.

34:38.276 --> 34:42.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It reportedly costs about
$450,000 a year.

Charter School, which is housed
in a Baltimore

34:47.252 --> 34:52.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
public school building. She
says, in a district
dealing with tough choices, she
can understand

34:52.490 --> 34:56.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not wanting to potentially spend
millions
of dollars on repairing and
replacing lead

34:56.962 --> 34:58.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pipes and fixtures in schools.

ERIKA BROCKMAN, Southwest
Baltimore Charter
School: Would the money that the
district

35:01.766 --> 35:08.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gets be better spent giving me a
great teacher
in my classroom or fixing the
pipes in my

35:08.239 --> 35:12.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
building? In a short-term basis,
I'm going
to say, give me the teacher, any
day, hands

35:12.544 --> 35:14.245 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
down.

35:14.346 --> 35:19.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: And for Rebecca
Schillenback
in Ithaca, lead is now one more
thing she

35:19.384 --> 35:21.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
must add to her parental worry
list.

35:21.286 --> 35:24.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA SCHILLENBACK: It was
just something
we were taking for granted.
Wherever we got,

35:24.856 --> 35:28.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're going to have clean, safe
water. And,
of course, when we send our kids
to school,

35:28.193 --> 35:32.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it will be clean, safe water.
You wouldn't
even think about it. I wasn't
thinking about

35:32.764 --> 35:36.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it. So, this is a wakeup call.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Tourism
businesses on the
Greek island of Lesbos are
asking for protection

36:00.692 --> 36:06.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from bankruptcy as they face a
potential economic
catastrophe. Tens of thousands
of vacationers

36:06.431 --> 36:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
normally expected on one of
Greece's more
idyllic spots are staying away
because of

36:11.436 --> 36:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the island's central role as a
landing zone
for refugees.

36:15.507 --> 36:20.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now the islanders are appealing
for what they
call solidarity tourism.

36:20.412 --> 36:23.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports
from Lesbos.

HELEN STEDMAN, Tourist: I have
seen a cormorant.
I have seen a Ruppell's warbler.
I have seen

36:27.952 --> 36:29.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a subalpine warbler.

36:29.854 --> 36:34.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Every year,
spring in Lesbos
lures millions of migrating
birds and British

36:34.225 --> 36:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pensioner Helen Stedman. Unlike
other tourists,
troubled by images of suffering
and misery,

36:41.266 --> 36:45.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she and her keen bird-watching
partner, Jeff
Bailey, have remained faithful
to an island

36:45.570 --> 36:48.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they believe typifies
unadulterated Greece.

36:48.206 --> 36:52.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HELEN STEDMAN: I feel sad for
the islanders.
The economy is suffering. And we
have noticed

36:52.510 --> 36:57.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that restaurants that we have
favored before
have closed. They're not there
anymore. They

36:57.582 --> 36:59.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have gone bankrupt.

36:59.451 --> 37:05.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people can't -- the locals
can't afford
to pay wages. And they're just
not opening.

37:05.990 --> 37:12.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tourism is their biggest income
in this island.
And if we don't come and support
them, then

37:13.098 --> 37:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they're not going to survive,

37:15.066 --> 37:20.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Seasonal worker
Nikos Paspalatelis
is helping his former boss
prepare the hotel

37:20.238 --> 37:26.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the summer. Married with two
small children,
Paspalatelis has worked here for
almost 20

37:26.344 --> 37:31.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, but he's been laid off
this summer,
which means his state insurance
won't be paid,

37:31.449 --> 37:36.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which means he won't be entitled
to unemployment
benefit in the winter, when
there's no seasonal

37:36.221 --> 37:37.956 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

37:38.056 --> 37:39.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NIKOS PASPALATELIS, Newly
Unemployed: I'm
not going to say that we're
angry, because

37:39.924 --> 37:46.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
angry is something you do if
somebody make
you very big damage to you. But
this is -- I

37:46.965 --> 37:51.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hope this will be only for one
year, this
damage. Maybe if you ask me
maybe in two or

37:51.669 --> 37:55.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three years, if this situation
continue, I
would say, yes, I'm going to be
hungry -- angry

37:56.040 --> 37:57.809 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
-- sorry.

37:57.909 --> 38:00.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This hotel was
on the front
line. The owners estimate more
than 1,000

38:00.678 --> 38:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
boats landed on the beach next
to their taverna,
most during the peak season.

has come
to say farewell and remove his
gear.

38:11.890 --> 38:16.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOLFGANG PUNKE, Water Sports
Instructor: Oh,
I have to pack up because, in
Europe, on the

38:16.761 --> 38:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
television, you get almost every
two, third
or fourth day information about
Lesbos, about

38:22.500 --> 38:30.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the refugees. And you think
Lesbos is full
of refugees. And so the booking
numbers are

38:30.575 --> 38:32.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going down, up to zero.

38:32.477 --> 38:37.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Hotelier
Dimitrios Vatis,
whom we met at the start of the
refugee crisis,

38:37.415 --> 38:42.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shows us the difference between
bookings for
last year, which started so
promisingly, and

38:42.387 --> 38:48.560 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.
DIMITRIOS VATIS, Hotelier: This
year, the
difference between the two of
them is minus-88.28

38:48.660 --> 38:50.428 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
percent.

38:50.528 --> 38:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This business,
along with
hundreds of others on Lesbos,
could be in

38:55.333 --> 39:01.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
serious trouble. They face
double the pressure,
extra tax demands to help with
Greece's other

39:01.206 --> 39:02.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
crisis, its debt burden.

39:03.041 --> 39:08.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hotelier is appealing to the
government
to protect vulnerable
enterprises from bank

39:08.213 --> 39:13.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreclosures as they try to
survive. But his
prime concern is for loyal
employees that

39:13.985 --> 39:15.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he's been forced to let go.

39:15.853 --> 39:19.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIMITRIOS VATIS: In a little
while, these
people, they may end up asking
jobs somewhere

39:19.857 --> 39:25.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else, so they will be refugees.
I feel badly,
terribly when I'm talking about
the rest of

39:25.863 --> 39:34.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the people that they work in the
hotel, and
they're not going to be able to
have a job

39:34.872 --> 39:36.608 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this summer.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Day trippers
from Turkey
who've taken the legal ferry to
cross the

39:38.309 --> 39:41.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aegean climb one of Lesbos' main
attractions,
the chapel in Petra, the rock.

39:41.879 --> 39:47.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But their custom in no way
replaces of the
90,000 foreign visitors the
island anticipated

39:47.852 --> 39:53.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before the crisis. The islanders
were being
talked about as potential Nobel
Peace Prize

39:53.591 --> 39:55.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nominees for their generosity
and hospitality.

39:55.760 --> 40:05.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sense of rejection pains
cafe owner Stelios
Chiotellis, who is a stone's
throw from the

40:05.303 --> 40:11.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chapel. Not only is his business
being jeopardized
by the tourists staying away,
but also by

40:11.476 --> 40:15.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
foreign package holiday
companies, which are
trying to force the islanders to
cut their

40:15.380 --> 40:17.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
prices still further.

40:17.315 --> 40:19.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STELIOS CHIOTELLIS, Cafe Owner:
All the locals
here, they did the best they
could to help

40:19.651 --> 40:25.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the refugees last year. When
they first came
out, there wasn't NGOs here.
There was nothing.

40:25.556 --> 40:32.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we gave them food, drinks.
Many people
helped a lot, a lot. I wouldn't
say, me, I

40:32.897 --> 40:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helped a lot, but we do our
best.

40:36.701 --> 40:42.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, instead of people
appreciate that
and say like, oh, these people
help, they

40:42.674 --> 40:46.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turned their back to us now.
Like, they canceled
all the flights.

40:46.944 --> 40:53.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This is
Eressos, home to
Sappho, the ancient Greek poet
who wrote of

40:53.251 --> 40:59.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
romantic love between women.
This village
is one of the world's leading
lesbian destinations.

40:59.590 --> 41:05.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its location on the west of the
island shielded
it from the armada of rafts.
Despite its prominence

41:05.263 --> 41:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a niche market, Eressos is
also facing
a bleak future.

Gallinou.

41:11.536 --> 41:15.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FANI GALLINOU, Tourist Chief: We
don't how
long we will be this season. We
have guests

41:15.606 --> 41:21.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they want to come, but they
don't know
how, or it is very expensive for
them, because

41:21.713 --> 41:28.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are no anymore charter
flights. We had
25 charter flights per week, and
now we have

41:28.453 --> 41:30.221 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
only 10.

41:30.321 --> 41:35.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: For a place
that has had
such a turbulent year and whose
geographical

41:36.027 --> 41:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
position has guaranteed it
prominence in 21st
century history, Lesbos can be
disarmingly

41:41.933 --> 41:43.735 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tranquil.

41:43.835 --> 41:50.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Bird-watcher
Jeff Bailey
has great sympathy with the
people escaping

41:50.875 --> 41:54.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
war, oppression and poverty, and
has this
message for holiday-makers
worried about the

41:55.046 --> 41:56.914 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
migrant crisis.

41:57.015 --> 42:01.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF BAILEY, Tourist: Well, I
think the island
is looking as wonderful as
always. And I would

42:01.886 --> 42:07.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
urge anybody who has wanted to
come to the
island to please come to the
island. There's

42:07.358 --> 42:14.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no issues with the migrants. The
vast majority
of the island, you won't
experience that,

42:14.165 --> 42:16.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and so there's no reason for you
not to come.

42:16.667 --> 42:21.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Last summer,
Lesbos was inundated,
as the authorities failed to
cope with the

42:21.472 --> 42:26.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugee crisis. But now the
system is much
more organized, as the European
Union tries

42:26.611 --> 42:32.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get control of its external
borders. Irrespective
of the rights and wrongs, the
reality is that

42:32.116 --> 42:38.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the refugees and migrants are
now being kept
away from the main tourist
areas.

42:38.256 --> 42:42.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The village of Molyvos, with its
medieval
citadel, has endured a torrid 12
months and

42:43.094 --> 42:50.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
witnessed significant tragedy.
But the apocalyptic
scenes in its cobbled streets
have evaporated.

42:50.168 --> 42:55.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Although she has to work two
jobs, 15 hours
a day, seven days a week,
restauranteur Ioanna

42:55.473 --> 42:59.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Stipsanou takes a long
historical view and
is optimistic.

42:59.110 --> 43:04.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IOANNA STIPSANOU, Restauranteur:
It's famous.
Everybody knows Lesbos. And it
know exactly

43:04.782 --> 43:12.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also the good things we have.
It's the people,
the hospitality, and how
beautiful is the

43:12.790 --> 43:17.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place and how beautiful the
people are, and
how secure and safe you are when
you're here

43:17.495 --> 43:19.363 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with us.

43:19.464 --> 43:23.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: While the
islanders' short-term
plea is for tourists to return,
their more

43:23.734 --> 43:28.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
substantive desire is for the
world powers
to bring peace to conflict
zones, so that

43:28.539 --> 43:32.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people no longer need to use
these shores
as a stepping stone.

HARI SREENIVASAN: And now some
news about
our own reporting.

43:40.084 --> 43:45.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the "PBS NewsHour" won a
2015 Peabody
Award for Desperate Journey, our
extensive

43:46.023 --> 43:49.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
reporting on the European
migrant crisis.
Malcolm Brabant, who just
reported our story

43:49.660 --> 43:54.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Lesbos, has led much of
coverage on the
ground from across the region.
You can find

43:54.832 --> 43:58.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all our reports online, on our
home page at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

43:59.036 --> 44:04.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And speaking of
awards, let's
look at some investigative
reporting honored

44:04.942 --> 44:07.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by this year's Pulitzer Prizes.

44:07.111 --> 44:12.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post won two
Pulitzers yesterday,
including one for national
reporting for a

44:12.450 --> 44:17.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
series on police shootings of
civilians. There
had been little national data
about those

44:17.955 --> 44:19.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kind of shootings.

44:19.891 --> 44:25.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Post created its own
database that included
these findings: 990 people were
fatally shot

44:25.596 --> 44:32.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by police last year. One in six
officers had
been involved in a prior
shooting. In three-quarters

44:32.470 --> 44:37.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the cases, police were under
attack or
defending someone who was.

44:37.875 --> 44:42.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wesley Lowery was one of The
Washington Post's
lead reporters on this. He's
part of a team

44:42.346 --> 44:45.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of more than 60. And he joins me
now.

44:45.750 --> 44:46.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Congratulations, Wesley Lowery.

44:47.051 --> 44:48.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WESLEY LOWERY, The Washington
Post: Thank
you so much.

44:48.553 --> 44:50.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's see. How
many years have
you been reporting?

44:50.488 --> 44:54.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WESLEY LOWERY: A few, but -- a
few, a handful.
So, I'm 25. I have been at The
Post for two

44:54.692 --> 44:55.560 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

44:55.660 --> 44:56.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what was your
reaction?

44:56.561 --> 44:58.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WESLEY LOWERY: I was really
excited.

44:58.629 --> 45:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was a project that really
was a newsroom-wide
effort that involved a lot of
different staffs,

45:02.567 --> 45:07.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our investigative staff, our
national desk,
which I work for, our graphics
and data development

45:07.672 --> 45:10.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
staffs as well. It was just a
really great
team win.

45:10.608 --> 45:13.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How did the idea
for this come
about?

45:13.611 --> 45:17.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WESLEY LOWERY: So, this idea,
this project
was born in a lot of ways out of
Ferguson,

45:17.348 --> 45:19.150 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Missouri.

45:19.250 --> 45:21.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I was one of our lead
reporters on the
ground in Missouri, as well as
then in Baltimore,

45:21.319 --> 45:26.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when there was unrest there. And
in Ferguson,
they were having this
conversation where you

45:26.524 --> 45:31.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had the police unions and the
police chiefs
saying at the time, this is a
one-off anecdote.

45:31.128 --> 45:34.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We almost never shoot anybody.
Most officers
never fire their guns.

45:34.966 --> 45:38.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you had the civil rights
groups and many
of the activists and protesters
saying, young

45:38.536 --> 45:41.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black men are being executed in
the streets
every day. This is an outrage.
We're being

45:41.772 --> 45:43.641 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
killed.

45:43.741 --> 45:46.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so smart editors asked an
obvious question,
which is true. We should know,
right? We should

45:46.777 --> 45:51.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be able to provide some clarity
to this debate.
And it turned out that we
couldn't because

45:51.415 --> 45:55.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no one was keeping track at the
national level
and also even at state levels.
No one knew

45:55.853 --> 45:57.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exactly how many people were
being killed
by the police.

45:57.822 --> 46:03.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So what did The
Post do? As
you said, 60 or 70 people
involved. What had

46:03.661 --> 46:05.463 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be done?

46:05.563 --> 46:08.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WESLEY LOWERY: And so what we
ended up doing
-- and this part of this effort
was led by

46:08.399 --> 46:12.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Julie Tate and Jen Jenkins, two
of my close
colleagues, two of our
researchers.

46:12.236 --> 46:17.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, systematically, day by day,
we would
search for local news reporting
of police

46:17.708 --> 46:21.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shootings, right, because that's
the place
where you are most consistently
seeing some

46:21.212 --> 46:24.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
type of public acknowledgment of
a police
shooting, a local television
station, a local

46:24.949 --> 46:26.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
newspaper.

46:26.784 --> 46:29.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then what we would do is, we
would build the
database out. For every shooting
we found,

46:29.420 --> 46:35.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was one line, one name. And
then we would
go in and we report out 20 or 30
different,

46:35.126 --> 46:41.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, pieces of data points
about it,
race, age, gender, mental
illness, for example.

46:41.198 --> 46:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Whether they were
armed or
not.

46:43.034 --> 46:44.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WESLEY LOWERY: Whether they were
armed or
not, and what they were armed
with. Was there

46:44.635 --> 46:48.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a toy weapon? Was it a knife?
Was it a sledgehammer?
That kind of stuff.

46:48.205 --> 46:50.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But this is --
this took how
long to do?

46:50.875 --> 46:55.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WESLEY LOWERY: So, a full year.
So, we launched
in January, and we're still --
to date still

46:55.346 --> 46:56.247 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
working.

46:56.347 --> 46:58.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this was a year's worth of
reporting.

46:58.215 --> 47:03.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It really made a
huge splash
when this story came out. It
continues to

47:03.754 --> 47:05.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be looked at, Wesley Lowery.

47:05.623 --> 47:10.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What struck you as most -- what
surprised
you most? I know we said that
three-quarters

47:10.594 --> 47:14.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of those who were killed by
police were armed
or were attacking officers.

47:14.899 --> 47:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WESLEY LOWERY: In some way
attacking the officer.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did that surprise
you?

47:17.134 --> 47:18.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WESLEY LOWERY: No, that wasn't
completely
surprising to me.

47:19.036 --> 47:22.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, granted, a lot of the
conversation we
have is about those cases where
perhaps that

47:22.373 --> 47:25.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
isn't what happened or where
there is some
type of question. But, in some
ways, we expect

47:26.010 --> 47:30.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that. We hope and we know that
most of our
police officers out there are
not being placed

47:30.247 --> 47:33.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in some of these situations, and
also that
in many of the cases, when
someone is shot

47:33.684 --> 47:37.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and killed, that there is either
some type
of legal justification or some
type of extenuating

47:37.988 --> 47:39.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
circumstance.

47:39.857 --> 47:44.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the sheer number did
surprise us, right,
the fact that it was almost
1,000 over the

47:44.228 --> 47:48.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
course of the year, and that
very many of
them, even in cases where people
were armed

47:48.999 --> 47:53.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or unarmed, you had issues of
mental illness.
You had people who had knives,
instead of

47:53.504 --> 47:57.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guns perhaps, cases that seemed
that perhaps
there was something that could
have been done

47:57.975 --> 47:59.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to prevent this person from
being killed.

47:59.844 --> 48:02.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes, I was struck
that, what
is it, a quarter of the cases,
the individual

48:02.713 --> 48:05.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was having a mental episode or
they were mentally
ill.

48:05.983 --> 48:09.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WESLEY LOWERY: Yes, so, one out
of every four
shootings, that person is either
explicitly

48:09.854 --> 48:13.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suicidal or in the midst of some
type of mental
crisis. Right.

48:13.290 --> 48:17.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, that's compounded by
drugs or alcohol.
But very often, you are seeing
people with

48:17.461 --> 48:22.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
depression, people who are manic
depressive,
people who are bipolar, and who
are suffering

48:22.299 --> 48:26.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from some type of ailment, some
physical,
mental ailment. And that's
leading them into

48:26.837 --> 48:28.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these confrontations with police
officers.

48:28.372 --> 48:31.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you believe
this has had
an impact, this reporting?

48:31.976 --> 48:33.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WESLEY LOWERY: I do.

48:33.978 --> 48:37.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the most obvious way
is that we
embarrassed the federal
government into announcing

48:37.882 --> 48:41.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they're going to try to
keep some of
this data. Previously, again,
there was -- this

48:41.852 --> 48:44.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wasn't out there. We had to
count them case
by case.

48:44.421 --> 48:48.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, as we wrote these
stories, people
got a little outraged by that,
and they said,

48:48.259 --> 48:52.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's ridiculous. We should
know. In a country
where we count everything,
barrels of corn

48:52.396 --> 48:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and number of shark attacks, and
we know the
statistics from the movie that
premiered last

48:56.801 --> 48:59.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night, we know exactly how many
people saw
it and how much popcorn they
ate, but we didn't

49:00.070 --> 49:01.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know how many people were being
killed by
police.

49:01.972 --> 49:05.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, like I said, the FBI has
announced they
are going to start doing a
project similar

49:05.676 --> 49:10.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to ours that should launch next
year to track
these, so that we can keep
having this conversation.

49:10.681 --> 49:15.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can have this conversation
with information
and data and facts, instead of
us sort of

49:15.920 --> 49:17.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
having a conversation with
emotion and anecdotes.

49:17.488 --> 49:19.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last question.

49:19.390 --> 49:23.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a time when we seem to be
seeing so much
focus on social media, which is
how people

49:23.761 --> 49:31.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
communicate, less resources put
into raw reporting,
what do you think a project like
this says?

49:31.135 --> 49:34.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WESLEY LOWERY: This speaks to
the power that
we still have as journalists and
that newsrooms

49:34.705 --> 49:38.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still have, when we decide to
pivot on an
issue and focus our resources
into it.

49:39.009 --> 49:42.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As a political reporter
previously, but then
also a lot of breaking news, I
was someone

49:42.346 --> 49:48.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who did a lot of real-time
social media reporting,
doing things, you know, as they
break. And

49:48.285 --> 49:51.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this was, you know, for me, a
great experience
getting to work on many
longer-term kind of

49:51.989 --> 49:53.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
enterprise pieces.

49:53.924 --> 49:56.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it speaks to -- it's very
inspiring to
work at a place like The Post
that can devote

49:56.861 --> 49:59.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this type of man and woman power
to this.

49:59.530 --> 50:04.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we want to
extend congratulations
to you, to your entire team at
The Washington

50:04.735 --> 50:05.569 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Post.

50:05.669 --> 50:06.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wesley Lowery, thank you very
much.

50:06.637 --> 50:08.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WESLEY LOWERY: Thank you for
having me.

50:08.539 --> 50:12.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we have more
coverage of
the Pulitzer winners online,
including our

50:12.343 --> 50:18.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
owns interviews with Lin-Manuel
Miranda, winner
in drama for his Broadway
musical "Hamilton,"

50:18.449 --> 50:23.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and author Joby Warrick, who
explored the
rise of the Islamic State. Plus,
see our special

50:23.787 --> 50:28.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
series from Jack Ohman, who won
for his editorial
cartoons.

50:28.225 --> 50:32.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also on the
"NewsHour" online:
The weather's getting warmer,
and people want

50:32.229 --> 50:36.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to get out of the office,
including potential
employers. In our Ask the
Headhunter column

50:36.767 --> 50:40.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today: the do's and don'ts of
interviewing
in a bar.

50:40.471 --> 50:45.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And how a music program is
helping underserved
youth in Austin, Texas, by
teaching kids to

50:45.342 --> 50:50.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
play the steel drums. We have a
video from
member station KLRU.

All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

50:54.952 --> 50:59.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Time to vote in New York ticked
down as voters
headed to the polls in the
presidential primaries.

50:59.623 --> 51:04.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Democratic and Republican
candidates campaigned
furiously ahead of the vote. A
two-man Taliban

51:05.062 --> 51:10.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raid shook the Afghan capital of
Kabul, killing
28 people and wounding hundreds
more. The

51:10.734 --> 51:16.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
target was a government security
agency near
the presidential palace.

51:16.106 --> 51:22.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the death toll in last
weekend's earthquake
in Ecuador rose to 433.
International rescue

51:22.212 --> 51:26.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
teams fanned out to look for the
dozens of
people still missing.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And tonight on
"Charlie Rose":
more of Charlie's interview with
President

51:31.322 --> 51:33.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama, which focused on foreign
policy.

51:33.891 --> 51:38.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this preview, the president
explains his
decision to keep U.S. troops out
of Syria.

51:38.729 --> 51:40.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Probably the area where I have
gotten the

51:40.664 --> 51:46.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most criticism from some in the
foreign policy
establishment here in Washington
is around

51:46.136 --> 51:47.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Syria situation.

51:47.604 --> 51:49.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLIE ROSE, Host, "The Charlie
Rose Show":
Yes, and the red line.

51:49.440 --> 51:55.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: And there, what
you have is
people who I think instinctively
feel that,

51:55.646 --> 52:01.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where something is going wrong,
where we have
a problem, the solution is for
the United

52:01.285 --> 52:04.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States to send its military in
and impose
order.

52:04.421 --> 52:10.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, surely, what we have
learned not just
from Iraq, but even the great
challenges that

52:10.127 --> 52:14.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have had in places like
Afghanistan, where
we have now been there for 13
years, devoted

52:14.264 --> 52:21.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enormous resources, lives lost,
and I can
tell you, from visiting
Afghanistan, talking

52:21.972 --> 52:25.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to our troops, they are the best
of the best.
I mean, these folks know what
they're doing.

52:25.576 --> 52:27.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are outstanding at what
they do.

52:27.444 --> 52:33.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And yet it's still a very
challenging environment.
So the notion that, while we are
still busy

52:33.117 --> 52:42.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Afghanistan, still trying to
keep Iraq
together, that we would now then
potentially

52:42.226 --> 52:51.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
involve ourselves in another
military excursion
in Syria, that's the kind of
unwise decision-making

52:51.669 --> 52:58.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I think leads us to make
big mistakes
and ultimately also miss out on
opportunities

52:58.475 --> 52:59.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
elsewhere in the world.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court
hears arguments
about whether police officers
can give blood

drunk drivers
without a search warrant.
