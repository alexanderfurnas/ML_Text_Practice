JUDY WOODRUFF: The battle
to retake Mosul from
ISIS is nearing its end.

00:04.533 --> 00:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet a new deadly campaign is
under way by some Iraqi forces
of revenge and retribution

00:10.933 --> 00:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against those suspected to
have fought for or aided ISIS.

00:15.066 --> 00:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Northern Iraq, special
correspondent Marcia Biggs and
videographer Alessandro Pavone

00:20.533 --> 00:22.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

00:22.600 --> 00:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a warning: Images and
accounts in this story
may disturb some viewers.

00:25.800 --> 00:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: It starts at dawn
here in West Mosul, members
of Iraqi special forces going

00:32.200 --> 00:37.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
door to door in search
of ISIS sleeper cells.

00:39.166 --> 00:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clashes continue in a small
pocket of the Old City, but for
most of Mosul, this is where

00:41.900 --> 00:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the fight against ISIS stands.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In some houses, we find the
remnants of life under ISIS.

00:48.466 --> 00:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This was a Da'esh
prison, he says.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So this was once the home
of a local politician.

00:56.466 --> 00:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When ISIS took the area, they
turned his house into a jail.

00:59.366 --> 01:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS imprisoned anyone
who didn't pledge loyalty
to them, who didn't
join them and stick to

01:04.133 --> 01:06.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their rules, this
lieutenant says.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They considered them outlaws.

01:09.300 --> 01:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After several hours searching,
they come across this man, who
they believe may have escaped

01:15.433 --> 01:16.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the current clashes
in the Old City.

01:16.766 --> 01:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is arrested immediately.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you believe he
is an ISIS fighter?

01:21.600 --> 01:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
I think he is.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is not from this area.

01:27.433 --> 01:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No one has ever seen here.

01:29.233 --> 01:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People here don't know him.

01:30.466 --> 01:32.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He is very thin, and
the I.D. card is fake.

01:32.466 --> 01:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, probably he is ISIS.

01:34.733 --> 01:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
For no reason, the militias
took my son five months ago.

01:52.033 --> 01:53.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't know where.

01:53.366 --> 01:54.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We are not ISIS.

01:54.633 --> 01:56.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My son is a shepherd.

01:56.266 --> 01:58.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If we were ISIS, you
could come and kill me.

01:58.600 --> 02:03.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ask anyone here.

02:09.466 --> 02:14.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

MARCIA BIGGS: Just last week,
this photo emerged of suspected
ISIS fighters rounded up and

02:44.166 --> 02:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
held in a small dark room in
the 120-degree heat, an eye for
an eye, as the captors become

02:51.300 --> 02:53.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
captive.

02:53.266 --> 02:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Mansour Maarouf Mansour
was working in Qayyarah General
Hospital when this video

02:58.666 --> 03:00.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was taken last spring.

03:00.700 --> 03:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The hospital was inundated
with unidentified bodies
coming down the Tigris River.

03:05.033 --> 03:07.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The morgue could barely
handle the grim deluge.

03:07.633 --> 03:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A local resident described the
what he saw at the riverbank.

03:10.900 --> 03:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
They had their hands
tied behind their backs.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They were blindfolded
and shot in the head.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They were floating
down the river.

03:17.933 --> 03:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: And just last
week, even more bodies.

03:21.933 --> 03:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You received a lot of bodies
that looked to have been the
victims of execution, is that

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Yes.

03:28.533 --> 03:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: What was the state
of the bodies that you received?

03:29.466 --> 03:31.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MANSOUR MAAROUF MANSOUR, Iraq:
Yes, most of them were killed
by shooting to the head.

03:33.866 --> 03:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very little in compared
to those who were killed by
the liberation process, through

03:40.466 --> 03:44.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the mines, land mines,
or the bombs, mortar
bombs, or airstrike.

03:45.933 --> 03:50.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: The number
of civilian casualties
has been staggering.

03:50.233 --> 03:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former Kurdish Deputy Prime
Minister Hoshyar Zebari says
at least 40,000 dead, many of

03:57.333 --> 04:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them at the hands of coalition
airstrikes, which include both
Iraqi and American firepower.

04:03.633 --> 04:08.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As residents return
home to a Mosul depleted
of ISIS fighters, the
new campaign may be

04:08.566 --> 04:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of collective
punishment against possible
ISIS sympathizers.

04:15.633 --> 04:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We traveled to a village just
south of the city, where many
of the residents collaborated

04:18.966 --> 04:21.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with ISIS.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had heard reports of
so-called revenge death squads
coming for them in the dead of

04:25.933 --> 04:28.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
night.

04:28.400 --> 04:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Um Nazim's husband was a taxi
driver, and she says he just
joined the group to survive.

04:34.533 --> 04:36.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He was later killed
in an airstrike.

04:36.366 --> 04:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was too scared to let
us show her full face.

04:38.966 --> 04:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UM NAZIM, Iraq (through
translator): They told us, if
your sons and husbands do not

04:42.933 --> 04:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
declare loyalty, we will bring
back the religious police
and we will behead them.

04:47.100 --> 04:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was an old man when we were
threatened, so he was scared.

04:49.766 --> 04:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He thought it would be
better to declare loyalty.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is better than being killed.

04:54.233 --> 04:58.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: Since the
liberation of her town
from ISIS, she says
local militias have

05:00.800 --> 05:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threatened her, demanding
that she leave, even shooting
up and raiding her home.

05:04.266 --> 05:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UM NAZIM (through translator):
We have lost our minds.

05:08.166 --> 05:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every night when we sleep,
we don't know if we will
be alive in the morning.

05:11.466 --> 05:13.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is our life?

05:13.533 --> 05:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were all throwing their
clothes in bags, but we
didn't know where to go.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't have money to
leave or even to rent a car.

05:19.833 --> 05:22.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't know what
to do, where to go.

05:22.566 --> 05:24.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I was pacing back and
forth in the front yard.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I told them, kill me.

05:26.833 --> 05:28.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's better than this.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Come on and kill me
and end my suffering.

05:30.300 --> 05:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The Iraqi
government maintains that any
abuse is being dealt with in due

Commander: We don't lead eagles.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We lead humans.

05:43.366 --> 05:48.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, our soldiers,
our police, they are
human, not eagles.

05:50.300 --> 05:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe someone make some bad
thing, but the majority, the
general of our forces deal very

06:00.100 --> 06:02.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
good with the people.

06:02.166 --> 06:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: So what do you

06:27.800 --> 06:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

MARCIA BIGGS: Human rights

06:41.966 --> 06:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM PORTEOUS, Deputy Program
Director, Human Rights Watch:
The Iraqi government sometimes

06:45.066 --> 06:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
responds to our reports and
our advocacy by making the
right sort of noises and making

06:53.866 --> 06:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the right kinds of statements,
but it's never followed up with
a proper procedure to secure

07:00.200 --> 07:02.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
accountability for the
abuses that we document.

07:02.933 --> 07:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can win the war militarily
against the Islamic State, but
if you continuing to commit

07:11.133 --> 07:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
abuses with impunity, then you
are simply sowing the seeds for
the reemergence of extremism

07:19.433 --> 07:21.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and radicalism in Iraq.

07:21.500 --> 07:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Like many Sunni
Arabs that lived under ISIS, Um
Nazim feels she is under siege

07:27.833 --> 07:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the Shia-dominated government
and militias that fought and
won the battle against ISIS.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you hope that
ISIS will come back?

07:34.866 --> 07:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UM NAZIM (through translator):
I don't hope that ISIS will
come back, but there was peace

07:39.500 --> 07:42.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and no one interfered in
the life of anyone else.

07:42.133 --> 07:43.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No one oppressed anyone.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The situation was calmer.

07:45.333 --> 07:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: For you, but
for those who weren't part of
ISIS, they were very scared.

07:48.433 --> 07:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UM NAZIM (through translator):
No, no one in Iraq was scared.

07:51.966 --> 07:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everybody was living in peace
under ISIS, not just us, because
my husband was with ISIS.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: But
how can you say that?

07:59.266 --> 08:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have heard so many stories
of people who were killed,
people who were repressed, who

08:05.600 --> 08:07.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
couldn't go to school?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UM NAZIM (through
translator): I don't know.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I didn't go out.

08:10.133 --> 08:11.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I didn't see anything.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm only responsible for
myself, not for others.

08:14.533 --> 08:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I didn't see anyone kill
anyone else in front of me.

08:17.633 --> 08:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I heard people say that
others were killed, but
who knows who killed them.

MARCIA BIGGS: What do you say
