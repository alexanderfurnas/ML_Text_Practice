JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:07.474 --> 00:12.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
a fight for Afghanistan's
largest province.

00:12.212 --> 00:17.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afghan forces, with the help of
U.S. airstrikes,
are pushing back, as Taliban
fighters make

00:17.818 --> 00:19.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gains in Helmand Province.

00:19.686 --> 00:25.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Then, this Christmas
Eve, time
to talk about how some gifts can
be life-changing.

00:25.092 --> 00:31.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the power,
appeal, and
craftsmanship of the holiday
classic song

00:31.231 --> 00:33.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"White Christmas."

00:33.066 --> 00:36.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW, Composer: Now,
every Christmas,
there's a new recording of new
Christmas songs,

00:36.036 --> 00:40.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the whole idea of secular
Christmas songs
really didn't exist before
Berlin. No one

00:40.307 --> 00:42.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was actually dreaming of white
Christmases
before him.

00:43.010 --> 00:51.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.118 --> 00:53.887 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:53.921 --> 01:04.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Christmas
holiday turned into
Christmas horror overnight, as
killer storms

01:04.097 --> 01:10.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blasted parts of the South.
Today, communities
were left to count their dead
and damages,

01:10.203 --> 01:15.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
including at least 11 killed and
scores hurt.

01:15.075 --> 01:19.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One after another, tornadoes
touched down
across five states Wednesday
evening.

01:19.646 --> 01:24.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Monster tornado. Can't tell
if it's on
the ground because of the trees,
but that

01:24.885 --> 01:26.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sure looks like it.

01:26.787 --> 01:30.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The worst was in
Northern Mississippi,
where more than a dozen twisters
spun down.

01:30.691 --> 01:35.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A state of emergency stretched
across seven
counties, from the Arkansas
border in the

01:35.996 --> 01:40.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
west, to Tennessee in the north,
and near
Alabama in the east.

01:40.867 --> 01:43.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Governor Phil Bryant visited the
region today.

01:43.070 --> 01:48.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. PHIL BRYANT (R),
Mississippi: It is difficult,
particularly this time of year,
to see such

01:48.275 --> 01:53.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
damage and know that heartbreaks
go along
with that damage, that families
have lost

01:53.547 --> 02:00.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
loved ones. Seven Mississippians
have been
lost in this storm. Funerals
will be planned.

02:00.320 --> 02:07.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This should be a joyous holiday
season. And
it will not be for many.

02:07.661 --> 02:12.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: A string of
Mississippi towns
fell victim, starting with
Clarksdale, where

02:12.532 --> 02:17.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a twister flipped small
airplanes at the local
airport.

02:17.170 --> 02:22.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sixty miles to the northeast,
the volunteer
fire department in Three Forks
was wiped out.

02:22.509 --> 02:25.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEY JACKSON, Three Forks
Volunteer Fire Department:
It's kind of devastated. I mean,
we don't

02:25.145 --> 02:29.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have any -- we run EMS and fire
both. And
we don't have anything.

02:29.049 --> 02:33.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Eighteen-wheelers
were toppled
in the town of Sardis, while, in
HollyÂ®MDNM/

02:33.220 --> 02:40.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spring, a 7-year-old boy was
among those killed,
as a twister tossed cars and
blew homes off

02:40.494 --> 02:44.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their foundations. It left some
people feeling
lucky to be alive.

02:44.931 --> 02:52.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANCE MEEKS, Survivor: Uproot
trees, cut trees
in half. And I don't know why
I'm still standing

02:52.039 --> 02:54.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here talking to you.

02:54.041 --> 02:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the aftermath,
Mississippi
police and first-responders went
door to door,

02:59.713 --> 03:01.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
checking for survivors.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAY HALL, Mississippi Highway
Patrol: That's
the number one -- our number one
priority

03:03.250 --> 03:06.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that if we do have someone that
is stranded
or someone that is trapped,
we're trying to

03:06.887 --> 03:12.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clear each street, each county
road, each
highway, going door to door, to
make sure

03:12.592 --> 03:15.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we can eliminate all the
possibilities
that there's still someone that
needs help.

03:15.762 --> 03:21.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Meanwhile, in
Central Tennessee,
emergency crews worked overnight
to clear

03:21.468 --> 03:27.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
roads. And farther north, strong
winds ripped
roofs from homes in Noblesville,
Indiana.

03:27.474 --> 03:33.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A twister was even reported in
Canton, Michigan,
just west of Detroit.

03:33.346 --> 03:37.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The chance of tornadoes
diminished today as
the storm system pushed east.
But it still

03:37.818 --> 03:43.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brought the prospect of heavy
rain and flooding,
and almost freakishly warm
weather for Christmas

03:43.156 --> 03:44.991 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Eve.

03:45.025 --> 03:49.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In New York City, residents and
tourists alike
donned T-shirts and shorts in
record-breaking,

03:50.030 --> 03:51.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
70-degree temperatures.

03:51.865 --> 03:58.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: What else can you say?
It's perfect.
We're doing some sights and
walking around

03:58.138 --> 03:59.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the city. It's beautiful.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: This is my first time in
New York,
and I was expecting snow and
freezing cold

04:02.109 --> 04:04.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
temperatures, but I'm still
enjoying it, still
enjoying it.

04:05.011 --> 04:10.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Forecasters say it's
mostly due
to the current El Nino effect, a
warming of

04:10.117 --> 04:16.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Pacific Ocean that's driving
warmer air
east and pushing back the
colder, arctic air.

04:16.256 --> 04:21.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the same effect that's
helping generate
warm weather and severe storms
in the South

04:21.561 --> 04:26.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and East has also brought heavy
rain and snow
to the Rockies and Pacific
Northwest.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Elsewhere, this
day, Christmas
Eve festivities unfolded around
the world.

04:32.272 --> 04:38.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Bethlehem, Christian pilgrims
and tourists
alike flocked to Manger Square,
the traditional

04:38.411 --> 04:44.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
birthplace of Jesus. Other
celebrations were
canceled, as four more
Palestinians died in

04:44.885 --> 04:46.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
clashes with Israeli forces.

04:46.987 --> 04:52.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, at the Vatican,
thousands of worshipers
packed into St. Peter's
Basilica, where Pope

04:52.859 --> 04:55.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Francis presided over midnight
mass.

04:55.195 --> 04:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through
translator): We need to
cultivate a strong

04:59.866 --> 05:09.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sense of justice to discern and
to do God's
will. And in a culture of
indifference, which

05:09.676 --> 05:17.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not infrequently turns ruthless,
our lifestyle
should be a lifestyle of
devotion filled with

05:17.984 --> 05:19.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
empathy, compassion, and mercy.

05:20.020 --> 05:27.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The holiday
period also means
a record travel season across
the United States.

05:27.093 --> 05:33.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AAA estimates that 100 million
Americans will
venture out between Christmas
and New Year's.

05:33.700 --> 05:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 90 percent will drive,
taking advantage
of the lowest gas prices in
years.

05:39.206 --> 05:45.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There's been another
migrant tragedy
this Christmas Eve; 19 people,
including six

05:45.178 --> 05:51.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children, drowned today when
their boat capsized
in the Aegean Sea off the coast
of Turkey.

05:51.117 --> 05:55.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Turkish coast guard
delivered the bodies
to shore, and the coffins were
later taken

05:56.022 --> 06:02.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a morgue in the city of
Izmir. It was the
third such incident in as many
days. Rescuers

06:02.095 --> 06:04.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were able to save at least 21
passengers.

06:04.698 --> 06:09.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, there's
word the Obama administration
plans raids

06:09.903 --> 06:16.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and mass deportations next year
of hundreds
of families who arrived in the
country illegally

06:16.743 --> 06:20.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
within the last two years. Most
came from
Central America.

06:20.981 --> 06:25.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post reports the
campaign could
start in January and target
people who've

06:25.952 --> 06:30.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
already been ordered to leave
the country.
The plan still needs final
approval.

06:30.957 --> 06:37.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Oscar-nominated
actor Robert Downey
Jr. won a pardon today for a
drug conviction

06:37.264 --> 06:42.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going back nearly 20 years. The
office of
California Governor Jerry Brown
said Downey

06:42.369 --> 06:47.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has -- quote -- "lived an honest
and upright
life" since he spent a year in
prison. The

06:47.707 --> 06:51.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actor is best known for his
roles in the Iron
Man and Avengers movie
franchises.

06:51.878 --> 06:57.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Wall Street
closed early
for Christmas on a day of light
trading. The

06:57.317 --> 07:05.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dow Jones industrial average
lost 50 points
to finish at 17552. The Nasdaq
rose two points,

07:05.425 --> 07:07.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but the S&amp;P 500 was down three.

07:07.794 --> 07:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the
"NewsHour":
losing ground to the Taliban in
Afghanistan;

07:13.533 --> 07:20.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
payments to the hostages held
captive in Iran
more than 30 years ago;
education in post-communist

07:20.674 --> 07:24.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Romania; and much more.

07:24.444 --> 07:38.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: Afghanistan,
where government
forces are trying to blunt a
Taliban drive

07:38.825 --> 07:41.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a key southern region.

07:41.194 --> 07:45.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afghan troops had been losing
ground, but
officials say reinforcements and
American

07:45.999 --> 07:55.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airpower repelled the onslaught
overnight,
killing a Taliban commander and
50 fighters.

07:55.508 --> 08:01.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afghan army convoys rolled north
toward Sangin
district, as police searched
cars and people

08:01.481 --> 08:06.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on a main road. The
strategically important
section of Helmand Province has
been under

08:07.020 --> 08:10.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
siege by Taliban insurgents.

08:10.323 --> 08:16.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fighting spiked this week, but,
today, the
provincial governor rejected
Taliban claims

08:16.162 --> 08:18.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they'd routed the
defenders.

08:18.098 --> 08:21.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIRZA KHAN, Helmand Governor
(through translator):
The district is completely under
the control

08:21.701 --> 08:26.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the government security
forces. The enemy
never took control of Sangin
district. We

08:26.573 --> 08:30.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have arrived there by air and by
ground. The
military operation is ongoing
now.

08:30.977 --> 08:37.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They were helped
by U.S. airstrikes
overnight, hours after
Afghanistan's defense

08:37.083 --> 08:40.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minister warned his forces
aren't getting
air support.

08:40.653 --> 08:43.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MASOOM STANEKZAI, Afghan Acting
Defense Minister:
When the U.S. and the British
forces were

08:43.123 --> 08:48.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there, how many enablers they
had, how many
jets they had, how many
helicopters they had,

08:48.228 --> 08:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and how many we have today? The
way we are
fighting today, I think you
cannot compare

08:53.266 --> 08:55.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with any of those forces.

08:55.435 --> 09:00.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The fighting in
Helmand is
one part of a Taliban offensive
across much

09:00.540 --> 09:04.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Afghanistan that's testing
U.S. strategy.

09:04.677 --> 09:11.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama came into office
calling for
a troop surge in 2009 to defeat
the Taliban,

09:11.418 --> 09:13.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and then:

09:13.253 --> 09:13.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
We're starting this drawdown
from a position

09:13.920 --> 09:15.822 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of strength.

09:15.855 --> 09:20.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In 2011, the
president announced
a plan for phased withdrawals of
combat units.

09:20.927 --> 09:27.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, in May of 2014, he said
virtually all
American forces would be out of
Afghanistan

09:27.500 --> 09:29.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by the end of 2016.

09:29.469 --> 09:36.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in October, faced with
Taliban gains,
Mr. Obama reversed course and
ordered some

09:36.309 --> 09:41.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
5,500 troops to stay into 2017.

09:41.247 --> 09:46.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To explore why the security
environment has
deteriorated so much over the
past year in

09:46.386 --> 09:51.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afghanistan, we turn to two
people who've
been intimately involved in
formulating U.S.

09:51.658 --> 09:55.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policy toward that country
during the Obama
administration.

09:55.562 --> 10:01.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
David Sedney was deputy
assistant secretary
of defense for Afghanistan,
Pakistan and Central

10:01.534 --> 10:08.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Asia from 2009 to 2013. He's
currently a senior
associate at the Center for
Strategic and

10:08.541 --> 10:14.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
International Studies. And
Barnett Rubin was
a senior adviser at the U.S.
State Department

10:14.080 --> 10:21.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from 2009 to 2013. He's now a
senior fellow
at New York University's Center
on International

10:21.187 --> 10:22.755 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Cooperation.

10:22.789 --> 10:23.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we welcome you both.

10:23.923 --> 10:25.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Barney Rubin, let me start with
you.

10:25.758 --> 10:32.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Why has the situation in
Afghanistan, security
situation, deteriorated so much
in the past

10:32.499 --> 10:34.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year?

10:34.334 --> 10:35.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARNETT RUBIN, Director, Center
on International
Cooperation, New York
University: I think

10:35.869 --> 10:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that a more realistic question
would be, why
hasn't it deteriorated more?

10:39.205 --> 10:44.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bear in mind that, a couple of
years ago,
there were, I think -- David,
correct me if

10:44.544 --> 10:50.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these figures are wrong --
100,000 U.S. and
maybe 30,000 or 40,000 other
NATO troops in

10:50.250 --> 10:57.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afghanistan. And those are the
best military
forces in the world, with, as
Defense Minister

10:57.390 --> 11:01.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stanekzai, was saying, the most
up-to-date
equipment and so on. And now
they're down

11:01.661 --> 11:05.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to, I think, 8,000 U.S. and
about 4,000 European.

11:05.365 --> 11:09.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And each of those soldiers cost
a million
dollars a year. So we were
spending over a

11:09.802 --> 11:15.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hundred billion dollars a year.
So, if you
withdraw them from the
battlefield, of course

11:15.742 --> 11:20.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's going to be a change in
the security
situation. But the fact is that,
despite the

11:20.446 --> 11:25.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
withdrawal of that huge force,
the Afghan
government and the Afghan
military, for all

11:25.518 --> 11:31.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the problems they have, have
held on extremely
well, and have not lost any
major population

11:31.758 --> 11:33.426 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
centers.

11:33.459 --> 11:35.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David Sedney,
is it largely
due to the drawdown of U.S.
forces?

11:35.862 --> 11:38.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SEDNEY, Former Defense
Department Official:
It's partly due to the draw
down. I agree

11:38.731 --> 11:40.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with Barney on that.

11:40.533 --> 11:46.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Afghan forces have done very
well. But
we built a large Afghan army.
And the numbers

11:46.839 --> 11:50.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are there. And the Afghans are
willing to
fight. The big problem is, is,
we didn't put

11:50.443 --> 11:55.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the enablers that Defense
Minister Stanekzai
was talking about, air support,
helicopters,

11:55.782 --> 12:00.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intelligence. We ripped those
out of Afghanistan
before the Afghan forces were
ready to operate

12:00.353 --> 12:02.121 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on their own.

12:02.155 --> 12:07.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're now paying the price.
But the causes
go beyond that. The Taliban have
mounted in

12:07.493 --> 12:13.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the last two years, since we
stopped fighting,
we stopped using combat forces,
their largest

12:13.166 --> 12:18.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offensives ever. More Afghans
are dying today
than at any time since before
2001.

12:18.104 --> 12:20.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the hands of
the Taliban?

12:20.473 --> 12:24.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SEDNEY: At the hands of
the Taliban.
This offensive is enabled by
sanctuaries in

12:24.978 --> 12:32.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pakistan. And it has also been
enabled by
an internecine struggle among
different Taliban

12:32.285 --> 12:37.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
factions and with a new factor
in Afghanistan,
Da'esh, the Islamic State, which
is seeking

12:37.123 --> 12:38.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
inroads there as well.

12:38.725 --> 12:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This adds all up to much more
violence and
many more deaths.

12:41.694 --> 12:46.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Barney Rubin, are
these factors
that the U.S. should have
anticipated, or

12:46.933 --> 12:53.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did they just pop on the scene,
to everyone's
surprise, particularly the
Pakistan and the

12:53.406 --> 12:55.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Da'esh, or ISIS, presence?

12:55.742 --> 13:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARNETT RUBIN: Well, I mean, by
the U.S.,
that would be David and me and
our bosses.

13:02.982 --> 13:11.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think that we did
anticipate it. And
the fact is, we didn't -- you
know, the president

13:11.591 --> 13:17.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decided that the national
interest of the
United States wasn't served by
having our

13:17.864 --> 13:22.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
military, with all those
resources, in Afghanistan
for more than 15 years.

13:22.368 --> 13:27.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We understood that that would
mean a deterioration
of the military situation. And
that means

13:27.040 --> 13:31.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it's more important than
ever for us
to move ahead with the
diplomatic and political

13:31.611 --> 13:35.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
solution, and also with the
investment in
regional infrastructure which is
just getting

13:35.882 --> 13:37.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
off the ground now.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, there were some
people in our
government who thought you could
just postpone

13:40.386 --> 13:45.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those things until the military
option was
successful. But, of course, that
was never

13:46.025 --> 13:50.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
realistic. We're paying the
price for that
partly now, but, in fact, we
still are moving

13:50.196 --> 13:51.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in that direction.

13:51.931 --> 13:56.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And despite the serious
deterioration, the
increase in violence that David
has talked

13:56.269 --> 14:03.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about, again, bear in mind,
possibly taking
Sangin district, which you
called strategic

14:03.710 --> 14:12.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- I'm not sure why -- in
Helmand Province
is a long way from taking Kabul
or any major

14:13.019 --> 14:14.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
provincial center.

14:14.420 --> 14:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean because
of the size
and the location of it?

14:18.024 --> 14:22.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARNETT RUBIN: Yes. The Taliban
took over
Khanashin District in Helmand.
I'm not sure

14:22.662 --> 14:26.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that any government ever
controlled Khanashin
District. It's mostly empty.

14:26.099 --> 14:31.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Sedney,
what about the
other argument we sometimes hear
that prolonging

14:31.204 --> 14:37.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the presence of large numbers of
U.S. forces
in that part of the world, it
basically embolden

14:37.677 --> 14:43.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- it makes the other side,
whether it's the
Taliban or ISIS, want to fight
the U.S. even

14:43.049 --> 14:44.317 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more?

14:44.350 --> 14:46.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDNEY: Well, the last two
years have
proved that wrong.

14:46.352 --> 14:51.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, as we have withdrawn,
as Barney said
-- we had over 140,000 U.S. and
other countries'

14:51.691 --> 14:57.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces there two-plus years ago
-- we barely
have 10,000 there now. As those
forces have

14:57.330 --> 15:02.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reduced, the Taliban offensive
has increased.
The Taliban use of violence has
increased

15:02.468 --> 15:04.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as foreign forces have
decreased.

15:04.737 --> 15:09.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's not the question of
presence of foreign
forces. It's a question of
control and power.

15:09.308 --> 15:14.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Taliban have made clear they
want to rule
Afghanistan. When the Taliban
have taken more

15:14.447 --> 15:18.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
territory this year -- and they
have -- they
have gone out and killed civil
society people.

15:19.018 --> 15:23.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have persecuted women. They
have gone
back to exactly the same kind of
things that

15:23.356 --> 15:28.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were doing before 2001 that
made Afghanistan
such a hellish place to live for
most Afghans.

15:28.594 --> 15:32.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Barnett
Rubin, that being
the case, what can the U.S.,
what can the

15:32.298 --> 15:35.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Afghan government do to counter
that?

15:35.301 --> 15:40.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARNETT RUBIN: Well, we are --
first of all,
again, to come back to David's
most important

15:40.940 --> 15:46.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point, this is not just a
conflict between
the Taliban and the Afghan
government.

15:46.179 --> 15:51.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a regional conflict, and
particularly
the basic source of it is the
conflict between

15:51.717 --> 15:55.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afghanistan and the state of
Pakistan. The
Taliban wouldn't be able to
mount all these

15:55.822 --> 16:00.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offensives and so on, though
they would exist
and they would have to be dealt
with politically,

16:00.393 --> 16:03.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they didn't have undisturbed
sanctuaries
in Pakistan.

16:03.996 --> 16:08.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reasons for that, other
than Pakistan
being evil or
terrorist-supporting, Pakistan

16:08.301 --> 16:13.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has certain interests in the
region. And we
are now trying to address those
diplomatically.

16:13.573 --> 16:17.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's extremely difficulty. We
have to have
enough forces on the ground in
Afghanistan,

16:17.410 --> 16:23.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that the situation remains
relatively stable
to give us the space to do that
diplomatic

16:23.616 --> 16:25.351 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

16:25.384 --> 16:27.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're now getting much more
support in that
work from China and so on. So, I
think that

16:27.787 --> 16:35.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the focus that the media have on
the back
and forth of controlling 100
meters there

16:35.228 --> 16:39.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and 100 meters somewhere else in
different
remote parts of the country is
missing the

16:39.298 --> 16:41.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
point.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The main weakness on the
Afghanistan government
side is not whether their forces
can fight

16:43.870 --> 16:49.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Taliban. It's the political
divisions
within the Afghan government
which sometimes

16:49.575 --> 16:55.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
undermine the forces. And on the
other side,
the main issue is that the
Taliban's sanctuary

16:55.948 --> 16:58.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Pakistan, not how strong or
angry they
are.

16:58.684 --> 17:03.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Sedney, how
do you see
what the U.S. and others need to
do to turn

17:03.522 --> 17:05.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this around?

17:05.324 --> 17:07.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SEDNEY: I agree that the
eventual aim
is peace. And, ideally, that
would be peace

17:07.793 --> 17:12.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talks with the Taliban. But, in
the meantime,
the Taliban offensive has to be
stopped.

17:12.064 --> 17:16.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
German Defense Minister de
Maiziere, when
she was in Afghanistan last
week, acknowledged

17:17.003 --> 17:22.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the NATO-U.S. withdrawal
had been too
hasty and ill-prepared and
pledged that Germany

17:22.208 --> 17:25.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would increase by over 15
percent its troops
in Afghanistan.

17:25.745 --> 17:30.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just today, Turkish Prime
Minister Erdogan,
meeting with President Ghani,
pledged that

17:30.716 --> 17:35.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey would keep its military
presence and
work for peace through strength.
We need to

17:35.288 --> 17:40.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reverse the mistakes we made in
the past and
give the Afghans the help that
Defense Minister

17:40.326 --> 17:43.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Stanekzai asked for earlier in
your program.

17:43.162 --> 17:46.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Otherwise, people will die well
before peace
talks have a chance to start.

17:46.766 --> 17:50.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if 5,500
troops into 2017
is not enough, what is the right
number?

17:50.670 --> 17:53.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDNEY: There's no real
right number.
It's right capabilities.

17:53.506 --> 17:57.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't need combat troops
there. We need
the enablers that Defense
Minister Stanekzai

17:57.576 --> 18:03.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asked for. The Afghans need air
support, intelligence
support, the logistics support
and well-trained

18:03.783 --> 18:08.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advisers. A few years ago, we
disbanded the
group that the Army had -- the
U.S. Army had

18:08.621 --> 18:12.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
created to train people on how
to build other
countries' armies.

18:12.425 --> 18:16.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're now sending advisers
to Afghanistan
who just, unfortunately, don't
know what they're

18:16.562 --> 18:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing. We need to give the
Afghans the help
they need. They're ready to
fight. We don't

18:20.499 --> 18:23.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
need combat troops. But they do
need our help.

18:23.069 --> 18:27.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We appreciate
your perspective,
both of you, at the end of this
year.

18:27.640 --> 18:38.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Sedney, Barnett Rubin,
thank you.

18:38.584 --> 18:49.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Iran hostage
crisis was one
of the defining moments of the
1970s, and

18:49.795 --> 18:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it fractured a relationship
between two nations
that has never healed.

18:54.100 --> 19:02.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, 36 years after it began,
the former hostages
are finally getting
compensation. It was November

19:02.908 --> 19:11.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
4, 1979. The U.S. Embassy in
Tehran was overrun
by militant Iranian students.
Eventually,

19:11.350 --> 19:17.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
53 American hostages, many of
them diplomats,
were held. Some were paraded
around, exposed

19:17.990 --> 19:23.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to mock firing squads and
beatings. Some were
placed in solitary confinement.
They were

19:23.829 --> 19:31.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
held 444 days, as the nation
watched and waited.
One major rescue attempt failed.

19:31.470 --> 19:38.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fifty-two were released on
January 20, 1981,
just as Ronald Reagan was being
sworn in.

19:38.744 --> 19:42.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One other hostage was released
earlier because
of illness.

19:42.815 --> 19:48.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their families celebrated. But
the crisis
helped end Jimmy Carter's
presidency and led

19:48.521 --> 19:54.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a three-decade-plus rupture
between Iran
and the United States. And for
many of the

19:54.860 --> 20:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
former captives, the ordeal left
a lasting
toll, including depression. But,
until now,

20:01.033 --> 20:06.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they have received no
compensation for the
ordeal. The massive spending
legislation passed

20:06.705 --> 20:14.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Congress last week changes
that, awarding
each hostage $10,000 for each
day of captivity.

20:14.380 --> 20:20.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The settlement also provides the
potential
for compensation for victims of
other incidents,

20:21.020 --> 20:26.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including the 1998 U.S. Embassy
bombings in
East Africa and the 9/11
attacks.

20:26.792 --> 20:30.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Herszenhorn of The New
York Times has
been combing through this
settlement and speaking

20:30.429 --> 20:33.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with former hostages. He joins
me now.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David, how much money in total
are we talking
about here?

20:36.235 --> 20:38.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID HERSZENHORN, The New York
Times: Well,
we actually don't know yet,
because some of

20:38.904 --> 20:43.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the money depends on court cases
that are
ongoing and judgments that have
already handed

20:43.409 --> 20:46.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down in the courts, where there
may be awards.
They haven't been paid yet.

20:46.779 --> 20:50.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the Supreme Court will
soon, next
month, be hearing a case about
this. But we're

20:50.783 --> 20:58.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
starting out with a pot of
roughly $4 billion,
a big chunk of which goes to 911
victims,

20:58.491 --> 21:02.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
$1 billion of which will go to
the Iran hostages.

21:02.361 --> 21:06.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You mentioned the
Supreme Court.
Hasn't this very thing been
litigated before?

21:06.532 --> 21:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Has it gone as far as the
Supreme Court and
said, no, there will be no
compensation?

21:10.136 --> 21:11.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID HERSZENHORN: Well, that's
right.

21:11.937 --> 21:16.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we have now is basically a
congressional
judgment. The Iran hostages were
denied at

21:16.442 --> 21:21.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every turn, in large part
because the agreement
that secured their release known
as the Algiers

21:21.881 --> 21:28.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Accord barred them from seeking
any compensation.
So the courts repeatedly
rejected any claims,

21:28.387 --> 21:32.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
citing this treaty effectively
in 1981 that
secured their release.

21:32.057 --> 21:37.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Congress has done is step
in with legislative
relief and said, Congress is
basically giving

21:37.062 --> 21:39.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to them the equivalent of a
court judgment.

21:39.064 --> 21:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

21:40.866 --> 21:43.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID HERSZENHORN: And now, with
this bigger
group of victims, they each have
their claim,

21:43.335 --> 21:47.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what some victims may have been
awarded in
court, what the Iran hostages
were awarded

21:47.540 --> 21:51.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the Congress, and a special
master will
dole out the money that exists.

21:51.944 --> 21:56.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It starts with a big chunk of a
settlement,
really a landmark fine, penalty
paid by the

21:56.849 --> 22:02.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bank BNP Paribas, which had
violated sanctions
against Iran, Sudan, and Cuba.

22:02.454 --> 22:05.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So the pot of money
that this
is coming from, even though it's
in a budget

22:05.824 --> 22:07.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bill, is not really coming from
the budget?

22:07.593 --> 22:09.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID HERSZENHORN: That's right.

22:09.461 --> 22:15.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was one of the political
tools in crafting
this settlement, in making this
possible,

22:15.301 --> 22:19.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there was a ready and
available pot of
money that didn't have to come
right out of

22:19.939 --> 22:21.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
taxpayers' pockets, so to speak.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And it also didn't
come out of
the Iranian government's pocket
either.

22:24.376 --> 22:27.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID HERSZENHORN: And that's
been some disappointment
to some of the hostages, who
really do feel

22:27.780 --> 22:31.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Iran ought to pay for what
happened directly.

22:31.116 --> 22:36.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, sanctions had a
role. Did
the nuclear negotiations that we
watched so

22:36.488 --> 22:37.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
closely have a role?

22:37.523 --> 22:39.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID HERSZENHORN: There's no
question.

22:39.258 --> 22:45.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the nuclear accord was being
developed,
Congress certainly got much more
involved,

22:45.764 --> 22:49.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was paying much more attention
to the idea
that the relationship between
the United States

22:49.768 --> 22:52.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Iran was going to begin to
thaw, that
sanctions might be eased. And
there were many

22:52.871 --> 22:56.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, hostages included, who
said, wait
a minute, we're not comfortable
with this

22:56.809 --> 23:01.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relationship thawing when we
haven't addressed
the reason, one could say, it
ruptured in

23:01.847 --> 23:05.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first place, or a big part
of the reason,
that defining moment, as they
say, in the

23:05.851 --> 23:08.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
1970s, where the embassy is
overrun.

23:08.120 --> 23:13.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Why did this also
include victims
of other attacks? Why not just
keep it specifically

23:13.926 --> 23:15.761 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to Iran?

23:15.794 --> 23:19.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID HERSZENHORN: Well, that's
a political
question, but also one of
fairness and equity

23:19.531 --> 23:22.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think in the minds of some of
the lawmakers.

23:22.334 --> 23:26.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Iran has been accused of
sponsoring terror
in many different locations on
many different

23:26.872 --> 23:33.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
occasions. Victims and family
members of victims
of the two bombings in Beirut,
1983-'84, trucking

23:33.412 --> 23:39.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bombing killed Marines and
others, are included
here. And there has been
difficulty, even

23:39.752 --> 23:43.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the victims who have been
able to pursue
their claims in court.

23:43.289 --> 23:47.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Winning a judgment has been
possible for a
number of victims, but getting
paid has not

23:47.993 --> 23:51.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been possible, because, of
course, Iran is
not coming up with money. There
was one rare

23:51.630 --> 23:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
instance where Libya was looking
to get back
into the good graces of the rest
of the world

23:55.934 --> 23:57.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and was willing to pay
compensation.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: But this is
different.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID HERSZENHORN: That's right.

23:59.872 --> 24:02.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, here, they really had to
come up with
a solution where some of these
folks would

24:02.675 --> 24:10.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see some payback after, you
know, losing loved
ones or having been injured
themselves, because

24:10.115 --> 24:13.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the court decision was just
that. It was just
a number on paper, but there was
no money

24:13.786 --> 24:15.621 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behind it.

24:15.654 --> 24:18.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You talked to some
of these surviving
hostages after -- in the course
of writing

24:18.957 --> 24:23.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the story about the settlement.
How have they
reacted? It's been a long time.

24:23.429 --> 24:28.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID HERSZENHORN: They are
exhausted, is
one word. Certainly, there's a
very big mix

24:28.600 --> 24:30.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of emotions.

24:30.536 --> 24:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some are quite satisfied,
they're quite relieved,
quite grateful to Congress for
not forgetting

24:33.772 --> 24:37.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about them. Many of them felt
forgotten really
until the movie "Argo" came out.
And "Argo"

24:37.076 --> 24:40.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wasn't even about their case. It
was about
six folks who had escaped.

24:40.045 --> 24:42.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Ben Affleck
movie that won
the Oscar a couple of years ago.

24:42.915 --> 24:44.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID HERSZENHORN: That's right.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They felt that that renewed
attention. But,
until then, they really had a
sense that younger

24:47.920 --> 24:51.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, it's not something in
their memory.
This is something that was
really forgotten.

24:51.623 --> 24:57.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, they were also
outraged by
Benghazi, where yet again
diplomatic personnel

24:57.696 --> 25:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working for the United States
government in
dangerous places overseas were
put at risk.

25:01.934 --> 25:05.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there's a sense of closure
for some of
them. Many said it was too soon
to see know

25:05.104 --> 25:10.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exactly how they feel about it.
But the comment
that struck me the most, Barry
Rosen, who

25:10.876 --> 25:15.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a press attache -- he's a
New Yorker -- said,
"I really don't want to talk
about it." He

25:15.481 --> 25:17.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said, "We have been through
enough."

25:17.249 --> 25:20.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that seemed to be a
sentiment I think
all of them can agree on. They
went through

25:20.185 --> 25:21.887 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
enough.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, nearly four
decades later,
it probably feels like more than
enough.

25:24.123 --> 25:27.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Herszenhorn of The New
York Times, thank
you for this.

25:27.559 --> 25:33.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID HERSZENHORN: You're
welcome.

25:33.565 --> 25:41.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

25:41.106 --> 25:47.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
gifts to cure
bad habits; the subtleties that
make the song

25:47.279 --> 25:52.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"White Christmas" a classic; and
a Christmas
poem from our troops overseas.

25:52.785 --> 25:59.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, we continue our
coverage of the
global education crisis with a
look at our

25:59.158 --> 26:04.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New York public station WNET's
documentary
series "Time for School."

26:04.663 --> 26:09.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For 12 years, PBS has followed
six children
from around the world who are
simply trying

26:09.902 --> 26:11.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to get a basic education.

26:11.703 --> 26:17.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we meet Raluca from
post-communist
Romania, whose parents have been
working long

26:17.409 --> 26:22.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
hours to give her every
opportunity in the
country's new free market
economy.

RALUCA IFRIMESCU, Romania
(through translator):
This is my bed where I sleep.
And this is

26:29.621 --> 26:32.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sylvester, the cat that I sleep
with.

26:32.958 --> 26:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the drawer where I keep
a lot of books.
And this is a book that shows
you everything

26:41.433 --> 26:49.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about nature: the earth,
animals, people.
This book shows you everything.
You should

26:49.575 --> 26:56.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
buy it. And this is from my mom
and dad's
wedding. They're really
wonderful people for

26:56.315 --> 26:58.183 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

26:58.217 --> 27:04.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Raluca Ifrimescu is 8
years old
and lives in Bucharest, Romania,
with her

27:04.056 --> 27:05.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
parents, Cristi and Mirela.

27:05.824 --> 27:08.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRISTI IFRIMESCU, Father of
Raluca (through
translator): What counts is for
the child

27:08.160 --> 27:12.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not to lack anything. We
struggle for it.

27:12.664 --> 27:18.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Though Raluca's family
seems to
enjoy a comfortable life,
economic security

27:18.136 --> 27:24.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not something they take for
granted. Romania
is a work in progress. When
communism ended

27:24.776 --> 27:31.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in 1989, the country began a
transition to
capitalism.

27:31.316 --> 27:35.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Raluca's parents are trying to
give her every
opportunity to succeed in the
new free market

27:35.521 --> 27:44.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economy, and they know the best
possible education
is essential. Her family can't
afford a baby-sitter,

27:44.129 --> 27:49.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so Raluca commutes 45 minutes to
school on
her own every day to attend a
public school

27:49.968 --> 27:51.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
considered one of the finest in
Bucharest.

27:51.937 --> 27:54.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRISTI IFRIMESCU (through
translator): (through
translator): She knows she's not
supposed

27:54.940 --> 27:56.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to talk to strangers.

27:56.742 --> 27:59.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIRELA IFRIMESCU, Mother of
Raluca (through
translator): When she was in
kindergarten,

27:59.311 --> 28:04.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she once told a lady, "I'm not
allowed to
talk to you because when Red
Riding Hood talked

28:04.583 --> 28:17.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the wolf, he ate her."

28:17.129 --> 28:24.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Elementary school is
free in Romania,
but even in first grade, Cristi
and Mirela

28:24.903 --> 28:27.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
find that the little extras add
up.

28:27.205 --> 28:33.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIRELA IFRIMESCU (through
translator): By
the end of the month, we have no
money left.

28:33.512 --> 28:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We wonder how the others who
make less money
than us can manage. How do they
survive?

28:40.586 --> 28:46.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Cristi works as a
technician at
a printing press, and Mirela is
an accountant.

28:46.892 --> 28:51.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRISTI IFRIMESCU (through
translator): It's
a great thing that we both have
a job. It

28:52.030 --> 29:02.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
matters a lot. We hope, since we
consider
ourselves still young, that
things will change.

29:02.774 --> 29:04.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we hope for a better life.

29:05.010 --> 29:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RALUCA (through translator): On
manga anime,
I have 2,145 posts. I also
moderate some Web

29:12.651 --> 29:18.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sites, and I'm the administrator
of others,
and that practically takes up
all my time.

29:18.423 --> 29:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRISTI IFRIMESCU (through
translator): She's
ambitious. And she wants to do
something with

29:27.866 --> 29:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her life. We didn't think of
that when we
were kids, because you could
only reach a

29:32.671 --> 29:37.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
certain level, and then you had
to stop.

29:37.142 --> 29:46.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It wasn't important if you were
smart or not.
It was important who you knew,
if you knew

29:46.618 --> 29:50.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
someone who had an important
position in the
Communist Party.

29:50.088 --> 29:56.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIRELA IFRIMESCU (through
translator): Now,
you have to be very good to
succeed.

29:56.194 --> 30:02.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Raluca's middle school
is a pressure
cooker, with intense competition
for high

30:02.167 --> 30:03.902 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
marks.

30:03.935 --> 30:07.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
Calculate the
median line for a trapezoid with
a base of

30:07.439 --> 30:09.441 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
10.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RALUCA IFRIMESCU (through
translator): I felt
from the first day that there
was a huge difference

30:11.910 --> 30:21.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between them and me, but I
caught up, and
now I'm one of the good
students. I want to

30:21.853 --> 30:25.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be one of the best and have only
10s.

30:25.724 --> 30:31.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: It's the night before
a big exam,
and Raluca is having a meltdown.

30:31.229 --> 30:35.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RALUCA IFRIMESCU (through
translator): Based
on this mark, I could end up in
a good high

30:35.467 --> 30:40.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school or a bad one. My future
depends on
it.

30:40.272 --> 30:45.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Only those who test at
the very
top will be admitted to the most
competitive

30:45.577 --> 30:46.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
high schools.

30:46.912 --> 30:51.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CRISTI IFRIMESCU (through
translator): Please,
try to relax.

30:51.283 --> 31:02.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RALUCA IFRIMESCU (through
translator): I hope
the test will be easy and I hope
I won't panic,

31:02.194 --> 31:15.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because I tend to panic whether
I know the
answers or not. God gives me
confidence.

31:15.173 --> 31:23.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Raluca did manage to
test into a
good high school. And five years
later, everyone's

31:23.715 --> 31:25.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hard work has paid off.

31:25.684 --> 31:30.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RALUCA IFRIMESCU (through
translator): This
is the building where I spent my
four years

31:30.288 --> 31:35.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of high school. They were the
most important
years of my life, because I have
learned so

31:35.927 --> 31:37.796 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

31:37.829 --> 31:44.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: She graduated from
Bucharest's Economics
High School with a near-perfect
score and

31:44.202 --> 31:45.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was named valedictorian.

31:46.004 --> 31:48.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RALUCA IFRIMESCU (through
translator): My
guidance counselor had told me I
would graduate

31:48.073 --> 31:53.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first in the class. My average
grade was 9.9
out of 10. So she told me to
expect something

31:53.879 --> 32:00.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big. It was a beautiful moment,
because I
hadn't really expected it. Was
that really

32:00.352 --> 32:05.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me? I was so emotional. I'm
surprised I didn't
trip over something.

32:05.123 --> 32:16.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Memories. I love these guys. I
will always
remember each person and what
they were like.

32:16.434 --> 32:23.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will miss them, yes.

32:23.074 --> 32:27.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Raluca will be leaving
Romania -- an
international business degree at
the University

32:27.879 --> 32:35.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Warwick in the U.K.,
something her parents
could never have done. Living
under communism,

32:35.487 --> 32:37.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they weren't allowed to leave
the country.

32:37.355 --> 32:41.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRISTI IFRIMESCU (through
translator): I hope
she will become somebody
important as quickly

32:41.726 --> 32:50.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as possible. I also hope her
dreams will come
true. We live vicariously
through her dreams.

32:50.969 --> 32:58.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Raluca's chances for
success may
be better abroad. Despite
progress, Romania

32:58.376 --> 33:03.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is still one of the poorest
countries in the
E.U., and one in four
20-somethings are out

33:03.215 --> 33:08.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a job. So, Cristi and Mirela
are preparing
to let go of their only child.

33:08.820 --> 33:12.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRISTI IFRIMESCU (through
translator): Can
we buy an apartment on campus
while you're

33:12.290 --> 33:13.158 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in college?

33:13.191 --> 33:14.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:14.492 --> 33:17.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RALUCA IFRIMESCU (through
translator): No,
I don't think so.

33:17.696 --> 33:26.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will probably be happy on the
first month,
because I will be like, oh, I am
free now.

33:26.338 --> 33:32.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can do anything I want. And my
mother will
not come at 11:00 or 12:00 and
say, turn off

33:32.277 --> 33:34.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the computer. You are making so
much noise.

33:34.179 --> 33:35.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:36.014 --> 33:40.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RALUCA IFRIMESCU But after --
and after the
first month, I will miss them
and probably

33:40.051 --> 33:47.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will cry a lot. But I know
that I'm going
to have fun and those years will
be one of

33:47.826 --> 33:51.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the amazing things that will
happen to me
ever.

33:51.429 --> 33:53.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What a story.

33:53.732 --> 33:59.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can watch the entire "Time
for School"
series on WNET's Web site.
That's Thirteen.org.

33:59.938 --> 34:13.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now for a little
holiday spirit.

34:13.718 --> 34:18.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We start with a look at a few
gifts, apps
and tech toys that can nudge you
and others

34:18.823 --> 34:20.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
toward better living.

34:20.892 --> 34:26.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman has the
story as part of his weekly
take, Making Sense,

34:26.564 --> 34:29.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which airs every Thursday on the
"NewsHour."

34:29.401 --> 34:38.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Demoing a favorite
gadget coming
out of Santa's workshop in
recent years, an

34:38.877 --> 34:46.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ideal gift for the
hard-to-rouse, a behavioral
economics alarm clock.

34:46.251 --> 34:52.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Clocky is among numerous
products based on
insights from one of the newest
and fastest

34:52.090 --> 34:54.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
growing branches of economics.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Harvard's Sendhil Mullainathan
is a pioneer.

34:56.628 --> 35:02.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SENDHIL MULLAINATHAN, Harvard
University:
We're used to biological science
or semiconductors

35:02.467 --> 35:07.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leading to new inventions. But
now we're starting
to see how behavioral science,
just not new

35:07.806 --> 35:12.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
technologies, but new
understandings of the
human mind, are leading to new
inventions.

35:12.944 --> 35:18.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, last holiday
season, we asked
Mullainathan and his team at
ideas42, a New

35:18.550 --> 35:23.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York-based behavioral economics
consultancy,
to suggest some holiday gifts
already on the

35:23.955 --> 35:25.690 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
market.

35:25.724 --> 35:30.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first was a simple new take
on an old
invention: for the overeaters
among us, a

35:30.729 --> 35:32.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
smaller plate.

35:32.530 --> 35:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SENDHIL MULLAINATHAN: This plate
is actually
the size of plates from the
1960s. So it's

35:35.100 --> 35:38.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just our waistlines that
have gotten bigger.
It's our plates that have gotten
bigger.

35:38.236 --> 35:41.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, smaller plates
and more helpful
ones.

35:41.272 --> 35:42.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SENDHIL MULLAINATHAN: This is a
product that
basically measures out and tells
you, this

35:43.008 --> 35:46.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is how much vegetables and
fruit, this is
how much starch, this is your
proteins.

35:46.311 --> 35:50.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then once we have got it all
loaded up,
voila. Now, that's portion
control.

35:50.915 --> 35:56.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But for those of us
who really
can't resist seconds, fourths,
ninths, there

35:56.855 --> 35:58.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was the kitchen safe.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SENDHIL MULLAINATHAN: You see
what's on here?
There's a timer.

36:00.291 --> 36:02.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Yes.

36:02.127 --> 36:04.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SENDHIL MULLAINATHAN: You set
it. This is
set for 11 minutes. I have had
my one Hershey's

36:04.496 --> 36:05.463 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Kiss.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Right. That's all
we should have.

36:07.165 --> 36:10.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SENDHIL MULLAINATHAN: And then
you hear the
lock, and now you can't get
anymore.

36:10.702 --> 36:15.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Me and almonds,
this would be
life-changing.

36:15.907 --> 36:21.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's now a year later and I can
offer a verbal
affidavit: The kitchen safe
works. My almond

36:21.579 --> 36:29.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consumption has gone from
promiscuous to measured.
So we returned to ideas42 to see
what's new.

36:29.120 --> 36:36.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This year's interlocutor,
ideas42 scientific
director Eldar Shafir, who took
me first to

36:36.227 --> 36:38.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the bathroom.

36:38.096 --> 36:39.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ELDAR SHAFIR, Scientific
Director, ideas42:
This is sort of a cute device,
the water pebble.

36:39.697 --> 36:41.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The Water Pebble.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELDAR SHAFIR: The Water Pebble.
It almost
looks like a pebble. It's
intended to help

36:44.002 --> 36:45.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you save water and energy.

36:45.804 --> 36:49.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Though the Water
Pebble is meant
for the shower, modesty required
we make do

36:49.541 --> 36:56.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a sink to demo the device,
which trains
you to take shorter showers, the
green light

36:56.314 --> 37:02.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
giving way to yellow, meaning
time to wrap
it up, and then red, meaning
turn off the

37:02.620 --> 37:04.522 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
spigot.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELDAR SHAFIR: One of the big
issues in behavioral
research is that we have a lot
of intentions,

37:06.658 --> 37:08.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then the problem is acting
on them.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Right.

37:10.395 --> 37:13.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELDAR SHAFIR: So, you got the
red light, you
stopped, you leave the shower,
and you did

37:13.465 --> 37:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something good and you feel good
about it.

37:15.200 --> 37:20.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Having done your
part to reduce
some of the 1.2 trillion gallons
of water

37:20.271 --> 37:24.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Americans use, and often waste,
at home each
year.

37:24.776 --> 37:29.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And speaking of going down the
drain, how
about all the time and energy we
waste looking

37:29.948 --> 37:34.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for lost stuff? Turns out
there's a new product,
and an app, for that.

37:35.019 --> 37:40.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: This is Tile. Tile helps
you buy things,
anything.

37:40.058 --> 37:47.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Tile is a Bluetooth
tracking
device that you pair with your
phone. Then

37:47.265 --> 37:54.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you name it for and attach it to
whatever
it is you tend to lose track of,
like my computer

37:54.139 --> 37:54.806 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bag.

37:54.839 --> 37:56.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELDAR SHAFIR: You lost a bag?

37:56.040 --> 37:59.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So you go to bag,
hit find.

37:59.043 --> 37:59.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELDAR SHAFIR: Correct.

38:00.011 --> 38:01.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: All right.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ELDAR SHAFIR: Oh, I hear
something.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Wait.

38:04.249 --> 38:06.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELDAR SHAFIR: Do you hear that?

38:06.184 --> 38:07.552 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PAUL SOLMAN: Ah.

38:07.585 --> 38:11.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELDAR SHAFIR: You hear it? Oh,
in the closet.
Fabulous. Fabulous.

38:11.089 --> 38:12.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Fantastic.

38:12.423 --> 38:14.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But, wait, there's more.

38:14.225 --> 38:17.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELDAR SHAFIR: It used to be the
case that
you needed your phone to find
the Tile. And

38:17.095 --> 38:20.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was a problem, because
sometimes you couldn't
find your phone. Now you can use
the Tile,

38:20.665 --> 38:23.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the one that was in your bag, to
find the
phone. So it goes both ways.

38:23.635 --> 38:27.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: All right, I'm
going to test
that. We haven't set that up, I
don't think,

38:28.006 --> 38:29.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but you have a phone booth, I
see.

38:29.674 --> 38:31.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELDAR SHAFIR: An old phone
booth.

38:31.376 --> 38:34.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: All right, so I
will put my phone
in the old-fashioned phone
booth.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELDAR SHAFIR: Yes.

38:35.580 --> 38:38.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, hmm, where did
I put that
phone?

38:39.017 --> 38:44.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Simply double-press Tile to
ring your
phone, even if it's on silent

38:44.055 --> 38:45.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And there.

38:45.123 --> 38:46.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELDAR SHAFIR: You hear it?

38:46.424 --> 38:47.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Yes. Yes. Yes.

38:47.725 --> 38:50.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELDAR SHAFIR: There it is, in
the old phone
booth.

38:50.295 --> 38:56.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And the Tile has
found my phone,
like the phone found the Tile.
No, this is

38:56.367 --> 39:01.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amazing, because this is the
best gift that
I'm ever going to steal from a
shoot.

39:01.506 --> 39:02.740 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:02.774 --> 39:05.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, I guess I
have earned it
or something.

39:05.677 --> 39:11.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But behavioral scientist Shafir
wasn't as
happy as its new owner with the
behavioral

39:11.749 --> 39:13.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
economics of Tile.

39:13.518 --> 39:16.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELDAR SHAFIR: It's a nice
product, in the
sense that it recognizes
behavioral failure,

39:16.154 --> 39:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
namely, forgetfulness, and helps
you deal
with it. It's not behaviorally
sophisticated,

39:20.592 --> 39:25.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the sense that it doesn't
induce better
behavior. It doesn't help you
remember things

39:25.530 --> 39:29.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
better. It just allows you to
forget them,
maybe even more than before, but
to quickly

39:29.767 --> 39:31.569 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
recover.

39:31.603 --> 39:34.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, the folks here
at ideas42
aren't simply thinking about
gifts that improve

39:34.372 --> 39:36.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your life.

39:36.140 --> 39:41.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hannah Spring says they're
always trying to
improve the world, one
behavioral nudge at

39:41.846 --> 39:43.648 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a time.

39:43.681 --> 39:46.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANNAH SPRING, ideas42: We're
working on over
50 projects in more than 20
countries. We're

39:46.551 --> 39:51.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working in Mexico, helping to
apply behavioral
science to get more people to
save for retirement.

39:51.256 --> 39:55.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're also working with
low-income Americans
who are currently not in the
formal banking

39:55.893 --> 39:57.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system, helping them to get
access to that.

39:58.029 --> 40:02.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And helping
students manage their
debt, for example, with a simple
aid to filling

40:02.700 --> 40:05.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out the student loan form.

40:05.036 --> 40:12.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But since our project is a
behavioral economics
holiday gift guide, let's get
back to it with

40:12.410 --> 40:19.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a couple of watch-like devices,
the Vivofit
2, an activity monitor that
reminds you with

40:19.183 --> 40:25.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
audible alerts and a red bar to
get up and
move around after an hour of
inactivity.

40:25.957 --> 40:33.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Though, in the short time
allotted, my ping-pong
game, however vigorous, couldn't
get rid of

40:33.097 --> 40:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the red line. So the red line is
still here.

40:35.733 --> 40:39.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELDAR SHAFIR: In theory, you
should be getting
a calorie count in addition to
the red line

40:39.070 --> 40:40.571 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disappearing.

40:40.605 --> 40:44.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And then there's
the Tikker,
billed as the happiness watch.

40:44.275 --> 40:47.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I would like to talk to you
about the
day you're going to die.

40:47.512 --> 40:50.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: With one of the
most depressing
promotional videos ever.

40:50.848 --> 40:56.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Tikker, the death watch
that counts down
your life, just so you can make
every second

40:56.921 --> 40:57.522 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
count.

40:57.555 --> 40:59.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In my case...

40:59.390 --> 41:04.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELDAR SHAFIR: Eighteen years,
one month, 13
days, eight hours, 59 minutes
and 51, 50,

41:04.429 --> 41:06.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
49 seconds, life expectancy.

41:06.864 --> 41:14.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, I can wear this
as, oh, my
God, the sands of time running
out in the

41:14.238 --> 41:19.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hourglass of my life, or, what a
lucky son
of a gun I am that I have...

41:19.944 --> 41:21.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELDAR SHAFIR: This fantastic
gift.

41:21.245 --> 41:23.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that much time
left.

41:23.614 --> 41:31.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Time for carpe diem or an
18-year funk. But
for behavioral economic effect,
Shafir thinks

41:31.589 --> 41:33.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tikker should be tinkered with.

41:33.424 --> 41:37.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELDAR SHAFIR: So, you could
imagine actually
being motivated to alter small
behaviors that

41:37.095 --> 41:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would actually increase the
expectancy you
have counting on this, on this
gadget, on

41:42.333 --> 41:44.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this Tikker, as opposed to being
stable.

41:44.035 --> 41:48.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But perhaps the way
to maximize
Tikker is with headspace.

41:48.473 --> 41:51.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Think of it like a gym
membership for
the mind.

41:51.642 --> 41:56.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A guided meditation
app that
I now use every day.

41:56.280 --> 42:06.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: And with the next out
breath, just gently
closing the eyelids, and again
just feeling

42:06.324 --> 42:08.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the weight of the body.

42:08.059 --> 42:14.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And it can be given
as a gift,
monthly, yearly, forever, which
in my case

42:14.632 --> 42:17.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seems to be about 18 years, one
month and
a week from today.

42:17.702 --> 42:25.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the end, my favorite new
gift was
the behaviorally incorrect one,
Tile, one

42:25.276 --> 42:33.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of which I put in an item I'm
forever misplacing.
It's in my hat. Done.

42:33.451 --> 42:39.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Paul Solman, economics
correspondent for the
"PBS NewsHour," reporting from
ideas42 in

42:39.690 --> 42:44.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
New York.

42:44.529 --> 42:56.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: By the way, we
think he is
going to live a lot longer than
18 years.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And lose his hat.

42:57.708 --> 42:59.444 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:59.477 --> 43:02.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next for this
holiday season:
a new way to look at a classic
song, Bing

43:02.847 --> 43:08.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Crosby's "White Christmas." It's
the best-selling
single of all time with more
than 50 million

43:08.953 --> 43:10.721 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
copies sold.

43:10.755 --> 43:15.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown recently sat down
with composer
and pianist Rob Kapilow, who
deconstructs

43:15.893 --> 43:21.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
music for the "NewsHour" from
time to time.
They met up in Arlington,
Virginia at the

43:21.165 --> 43:23.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Signature Theatre for our latest
installment.

43:23.367 --> 43:25.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Rob Kapilow,
welcome back.

43:25.870 --> 43:29.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW, Composer: So nice
to be here.

43:29.240 --> 43:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so
"White Christmas,"
a touching, beautiful, nostalgic
song, but

43:35.246 --> 43:37.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
started life very differently,
as a kind of
parody.

43:37.281 --> 43:40.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Yes, you know, we
now think of
it as this perfect, sentimental
depiction

43:40.685 --> 43:46.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Christmases past. But, in
fact, it originally
started with a verse the no one
sings anymore,

43:46.390 --> 43:50.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and that Berlin actually
eliminated from the
song, that sets the song in
Beverly Hills,

43:50.394 --> 43:52.129 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
L.A.

43:52.163 --> 43:55.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It actually started, the sun is
shining, the
grass is green, the orange and
palm trees

43:55.233 --> 44:00.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sway. And it's actually sung by
somebody in
Beverly Hills around a pool
dreaming of Christmas

44:00.071 --> 44:03.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up north. So, originally, it was
a send-up
of the very song that it's
become.

44:03.875 --> 44:07.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Set in Beverly
Hills, but,
of course, came to be known and
came to touch

44:07.111 --> 44:14.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so many people because of the
historical moment,
1942, American military
personnel far away

44:14.919 --> 44:15.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the first time.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROB KAPILOW: It's true.

44:17.321 --> 44:20.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, Berlin says that songs
make history,
and history makes songs. And
this is a song

44:20.992 --> 44:24.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was completely made by its
history. When
he wrote it, it was just for the
movie "Holiday

44:24.829 --> 44:27.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Inn," and it was just going to
be a lovely
Christmas song.

44:27.632 --> 44:31.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then, all of a sudden,
December 7, 1941,
we have Pearl Harbor, we get
into the war,

44:31.903 --> 44:36.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the song and the movie come
out just when
the Americans are spending their
first winter

44:36.707 --> 44:42.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
away from home. And, suddenly,
that nostalgic
tug of Christmases past, of that
mythic American

44:42.780 --> 44:47.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
past, for all the Americans
overseas, as well
as their families at home
missing them, suddenly

44:47.485 --> 44:51.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made the song immensely popular
in a way that
Berlin never anticipated.

44:51.489 --> 45:05.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BING CROSBY, Actor: I'm dreaming
of a white
Christmas just like the ones I
used to know.

45:05.336 --> 45:10.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It also, though,
created an
idea of Christmas.

45:10.074 --> 45:12.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Yes, it's true.
It's sort of
an invented Christmas.

45:12.877 --> 45:14.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the things that is so
wonderful is
you...

45:14.879 --> 45:16.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because it's so
familiar to
us now.

45:16.047 --> 45:17.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROB KAPILOW: It is.

45:17.214 --> 45:17.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right. There are
many songs
like that.

45:17.615 --> 45:19.250 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

45:19.283 --> 45:20.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROB KAPILOW: Now every
Christmas, there's
a new recording of new Christmas
songs.

45:20.384 --> 45:22.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Yes.

45:22.153 --> 45:23.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: But the whole idea
of secular
Christmas songs really didn't
exist before

45:23.988 --> 45:28.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Berlin. No one was actually
dreaming of white
Christmases before him.

45:28.092 --> 45:30.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Composers and publishers
thought, why write
a Christmas song? They will only
play it once

45:30.995 --> 45:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a year. But, in fact, the
success of this
actually launched a whole genre
of secular

45:34.999 --> 45:40.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christmas songs. And all of a
sudden, we invented
an American Christmas based on a
mythic golden

45:40.438 --> 45:44.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
past that never existed in this
rural New
England that came purely out of
his imagination.

45:45.009 --> 45:50.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And done through
seemingly
simple music and lyrics. Show us
the music

45:50.114 --> 45:51.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here and how he did it.

45:51.882 --> 45:55.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Sometimes, the
words themselves
aren't nearly as beautiful or as
meaningful

45:55.186 --> 45:56.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as the notes behind them.

45:56.988 --> 46:01.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he starts off, even a simple
chord. Anyone
else would have begun like this,
for "I'm,"

46:01.359 --> 46:06.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very straightforward chord.
But he adds
one extra note, and that's what
gives it all

46:06.430 --> 46:10.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the warmth and all the yearning,
not this,
but this.

46:10.301 --> 46:16.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, even the first chord already
has a different
warmth. "I'm." Now, anyone else
would have

46:16.140 --> 46:22.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
written "dreaming of a." But
each chord has
one different chord that makes
it so emotion-filled,

46:22.580 --> 46:27.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"dreaming." And then listen to
this wonderful
dissonant one.

46:27.585 --> 46:31.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's almost like fog on the
window as you're
looking out at those snowflakes.
That's just

46:31.522 --> 46:35.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two measures of music. The words
are just
"I'm dreaming," but the music is
what tells

46:35.993 --> 46:38.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us what that dreaming feels
like.

46:39.030 --> 46:44.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Great composers don't set words
to music.
They set the emotion behind the
words. So,

46:44.368 --> 46:48.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're now dreaming of this white
Christmas.
Anyone else would have written
this for white

46:48.439 --> 46:55.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christmas. That would have been
fine. But
instead, he writes all that
yearning.

46:55.846 --> 47:01.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, we have started with long
note, fast
notes, long note, fast notes.
Anyone else

47:01.952 --> 47:09.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would have done another long
note, "just like
the ones I know." But, instead,
he pushes

47:09.126 --> 47:14.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
higher to the highest note of
the entire song.
All this yearning.

47:14.365 --> 47:17.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Lifted you right
out of the
chair, didn't it?

47:17.201 --> 47:18.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Absolutely. I mean,
that's what
it's meant to do.

47:19.003 --> 47:22.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, "where the treetops
glisten." Who knows
what that feels like, but listen
to the music

47:22.440 --> 47:28.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
underneath. He could have easily
written this,
"where the treetops glisten."
Would have been

47:28.079 --> 47:35.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fine. But listen to the emotion
in "treetops."
And now listen to this.

47:35.786 --> 47:40.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what made this song so
famous, the
beautiful harmony on "glisten."
Then we do

47:40.157 --> 47:45.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it lower. He could have easily
written, "children
listen," but listen to the
beautiful left

47:45.863 --> 47:51.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hand, "children." And now listen
to this minor
color, "listen."

47:51.168 --> 47:57.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BING CROSBY (singing): To hear
sleigh bells
in the snow.

47:58.008 --> 48:03.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: I mean, that's what
this yearning
is all about.

48:03.547 --> 48:08.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's almost a melancholy
behind this song
that you wouldn't think from the
words themselves.

48:08.219 --> 48:12.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that's basically the whole
song. Everything
repeats, everything repeats, and
then we come

48:12.289 --> 48:16.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the magic moment that really
makes it spectacular.
Everything's an exact copy.

48:16.393 --> 48:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We come back to the same music.
"May your
days be merry." The first time,
we went down

48:22.700 --> 48:26.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to this note, but now we go...

48:26.337 --> 48:32.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BING CROSBY AND MARJORIE
REYNOLDS, ACTRESS
(singing): Be merry and bright.

48:32.276 --> 48:37.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: And if that's not
beautiful enough,
then there's this minor color.

48:37.381 --> 48:40.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It takes us back
down.

48:40.651 --> 48:43.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Takes us back. I
mean, it's such
a complex mix. It seems like
it's a seemingly

48:43.888 --> 48:48.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
simple song, but there's all the
melancholy,
the disappointment of what
Christmas is about,

48:48.459 --> 48:50.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as well as the brightness of
Christmas.

48:50.795 --> 48:57.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we end beautifully.
And, again, could
have written the same chord
twice. Not him.

48:57.701 --> 49:05.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, not a simple ending,
but each
one is a different chord, a
different emotion.

49:05.910 --> 49:15.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BING CROSBY AND MARJORIE
REYNOLDS (singing):
And may all your Christmases be
white.

49:15.953 --> 49:26.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BING CROSBY AND MARJORIE
REYNOLDS (singing):
And may all your Christmases be
white.

49:26.230 --> 49:30.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Makes me hear the
song a whole
different way, Judy.

49:30.968 --> 49:33.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm never going
to listen to
it the same from now on.

49:33.437 --> 49:34.738 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:34.772 --> 49:36.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now she will sing it
for us when
we go off the air.

49:36.473 --> 49:38.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Maybe not.

49:38.309 --> 49:40.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, also, during
the holidays,
as you can tell, our thoughts
turn to the

49:40.811 --> 49:45.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
music that we remember best, but
they also
turn to those farthest away from
us, not least

49:45.716 --> 49:50.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of which the military men and
women serving
their country around the world.

49:50.387 --> 49:54.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This year, we asked the folks at
the Pentagon
to reach out to some of them on
our behalf

49:54.658 --> 49:57.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to bring you a special video
greeting.

49:57.161 --> 50:03.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this Christmas Eve, we
present Clement
Clarke Moore's 19th century
classic "A Visit

50:03.367 --> 50:07.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from St. Nicholas." You may know
it as "'Twas
the Night Before Christmas."

50:07.771 --> 50:12.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BLACK SEA ROTATIONAL FORCE, U.S.
Marine Corps:
'Twas the night before
Christmas, when all

50:12.176 --> 50:15.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
through the house, not a
creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.

50:15.813 --> 50:20.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPC. SAMANTHA VADNAIS, U.S.
Army: The stockings
were hung by the chimney with
care, in hopes

50:21.018 --> 50:22.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that St. Nicholas soon would be
there.

50:22.820 --> 50:24.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PO2 EDWARD HUBBLE, U.S. Navy:
The children
were nestled all snug in their
beds, while

50:24.221 --> 50:26.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
visions of sugar plums danced in
their heads.

50:26.991 --> 50:30.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A1C MAKAELA RICHARDSON, U.S. Air
Force: And
mamma in her kerchief, and I in
my cap had

50:30.594 --> 50:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just settled our brains for a
long winter's
nap.

50:32.930 --> 50:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CPL. JIMMY HARKER, U.S. Marine
Corps: When,
out on the roof, there arose
such a clatter,

50:36.433 --> 50:38.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I sprang from my bed to see what
was the matter.

50:38.235 --> 50:41.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SR. AIRMAN MICHAEL KANTACK, U.S.
Air Force:
Away to the window, I flew like
a flash, tore

50:41.972 --> 50:43.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
open the shutter and threw up
the sash.

50:43.774 --> 50:47.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SR. AIRMAN WILLIAM SHERROD, U.S.
Air Force:
The moon on the breast of the
new-fallen snow

50:47.411 --> 50:49.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gave a luster of midday to
objects below.

50:49.580 --> 50:53.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. J.G. ADAM GUARNO, U.S. Coast
Guard: When
what to my wondering eyes should
appear, but

50:53.384 --> 50:55.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a miniature sleigh and eight
tiny reindeer.

50:55.352 --> 50:59.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AIRMAN DENISE ZAMORA, U.S. Air
Force: With
a little old driver so lively
and quick, I

50:59.390 --> 51:01.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
knew in that moment it must be
St. Nick.

51:01.926 --> 51:06.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAPT. KENNETH CONKLIN, U.S.
Army: More rapid
than eagles, his coursers they
came, and he

51:06.730 --> 51:08.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whistled, and shouted, and
called them by
name.

51:09.033 --> 51:13.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SGT. ARTHUR HARING, U.S. Army:
Now Dasher!
Now Dancer! Now Prancer and
Vixen! On, Comet!

51:13.504 --> 51:15.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On, Cupid! On, Donner and
Blitzen!

51:15.306 --> 51:18.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CPL. JULIO GOTAYMENDOZA, U.S.
Marine Corps:
To the top of the porch, to the
top of the

51:18.375 --> 51:20.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wall, now dash away, dash away,
dash away
all."

51:20.711 --> 51:24.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TECH SGT. RANDALL ABELLA, U.S.
Air Force:
As dry leaves that before the
wild hurricane

51:24.315 --> 51:28.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fly, when they meet with an
obstacle, mount
to the sky,

51:28.252 --> 51:31.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAMAN JAMES HUNT, U.S. Navy: So
up to the
housetop the coursers they flew,
with the

51:31.889 --> 51:34.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sleigh full of toys, and St.
Nicholas too.

51:34.191 --> 51:39.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAPT. KENNETH CONKLIN: And then,
in a twinkling,
I heard on the roof the prancing
and pawing

51:39.163 --> 51:40.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of each little hoof.

51:40.831 --> 51:43.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SGT. JOSH JOYNER, U.S. Army: As
I drew in
my head, and was turning around,
down the

51:43.867 --> 51:45.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chimney, St. Nicholas came with
a bound.

51:45.836 --> 51:50.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PO3 JORDANA BERRYMAN, U.S. Navy:
He was dressed
all in fur, from his head to his
foot, and

51:50.441 --> 51:52.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his clothes, they were all
tarnished with
ashes and soot.

51:52.977 --> 51:55.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CPL. JUSTIN UPDEGRAFF, U.S.
Marine Corps:
A bundle of toys, he had flung
on his back,

51:56.013 --> 51:58.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he looked like a peddler
just opening
his pack.

51:58.449 --> 52:03.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SGT. ARTHUR HARING: His eyes,
how they twinkled,

on his chin was as white as the

all the stockings, then turned
with a jerk.

aside of his nose, and giving a
