JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:06.673 --> 00:07.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.674 --> 00:08.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: And I'm Audie
Cornish.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:10.477 --> 00:12.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I listened to a bunch of stuff
last night

00:12.646 --> 00:15.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on television that was
disgraceful.

00:15.849 --> 00:21.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
defends his
immigration ban, as its fate
hangs in the

00:21.355 --> 00:23.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
balance of the courts.

00:23.090 --> 00:26.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Also ahead, Judy
sits down
with House Speaker Paul Ryan to
talk about

00:26.627 --> 00:29.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how he is working with the Trump
White House,
and the fight over immigration.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.198 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

00:31.231 --> 00:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: This
isn't a Muslim ban.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it were, I would be opposed
to it, but
the rhetoric surrounding it
makes it look

00:37.204 --> 00:39.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like a ban on a religion or a
religious test.

00:39.473 --> 00:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And debate over
one of the
president's Cabinet picks leads
to a rare

00:44.211 --> 00:48.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vote in the Senate to silence
Democratic opposition.

00:48.248 --> 00:51.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talk with Senator Elizabeth
Warren about
the decision.

00:51.151 --> 00:55.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Plus: After
doctors told her
she had just a few months to
live, how one

00:55.589 --> 00:58.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
woman fought her cancer by
betting on a novel
treatment.

00:58.358 --> 01:03.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELINDA WELSH, Cancer Sufferer:
I think it
actually took a day or two to
fully sink in

01:03.130 --> 01:05.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that my calendar had expanded.

01:05.432 --> 01:11.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead of the coming demise
that we expected,
I was feeling fine.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the cancer was retreating.

01:13.273 --> 01:16.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:16.276 --> 01:20.514 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:20.547 --> 01:33.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm joined again
tonight by
Audie Cornish of NPR's "All
Things Considered."

01:33.593 --> 01:34.561 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome, Audie.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Thanks so much.

01:36.596 --> 01:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the legal
fight over President
Trump's seven-country travel ban
remains unresolved

01:40.634 --> 01:42.502 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight.

01:42.536 --> 01:46.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A trio of federal appeals court
judges spent
this day considering whether to
uphold a district

01:46.974 --> 01:50.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
court judge in Seattle who
blocked the order
last Friday.

01:50.711 --> 01:53.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Meanwhile, the president wasn't
holding back.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang reports from the White
House.

01:55.749 --> 02:01.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, President
Trump escalated
his war of words with the
federal judges considering

02:01.655 --> 02:03.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
challenges to his immigration
order.

02:03.590 --> 02:06.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I don't ever want to call a
court biased,

02:06.059 --> 02:07.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so I won't call it biased.

02:07.961 --> 02:18.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But courts seem to be so
political, and it
would be so great for our
justice system if

02:18.572 --> 02:21.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they would be able to read a
statement and
do what's right.

02:21.875 --> 02:26.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What's right, both
Mr. Trump and
Justice Department lawyers say,
is that immigration

02:26.813 --> 02:31.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law gives the president the
authority to bar
any foreign citizen from
entering the United

02:31.084 --> 02:33.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States if it's in the national
interest.

02:33.620 --> 02:36.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You don't have to
be a lawyer.

02:36.590 --> 02:41.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you were a good student in
high school
or bad student in high school,
you can understand

02:41.228 --> 02:42.896 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

02:42.929 --> 02:48.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's really incredible to me
that we have
a court case that is going on so
long.

02:48.969 --> 02:53.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Two state attorneys
general say
the order is unconstitutional
because it discriminates

02:53.774 --> 02:55.242 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against Muslims.

02:55.275 --> 02:58.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president said they don't
realize the
risk to the nation's safety.

02:58.679 --> 03:04.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I think our
security is at risk
today, and it will be at risk
until such time

03:04.851 --> 03:10.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as we are entitled and get what
we are entitled
to as citizens of this country.

03:10.924 --> 03:14.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have learned a lot in the last
two weeks.

03:14.961 --> 03:21.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And terrorism is a far greater
threat than
people of our country
understand.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we're going to take care of
it.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're going to win.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to take care of it,
folks.

03:27.307 --> 03:31.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Hours later, he
followed up with
a tweet: "Big increase in
traffic into our

03:31.678 --> 03:36.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country from certain areas,
while our people
are far more vulnerable."

03:36.283 --> 03:40.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a House Democratic retreat in
Baltimore,
Leader Nancy Pelosi called the
president's

03:40.687 --> 03:42.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
order dangerous and immoral.

03:42.255 --> 03:43.990 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader:
As long as the president
continues down this

03:45.358 --> 03:48.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
path, there's nothing Democrats
can work with
him on.

03:49.029 --> 03:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To protect the security of our
nation, to
future of our working families,
and the sanctity

03:53.400 --> 03:59.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our Constitution, Democrats
will fight
this administration every day,
with every

03:59.239 --> 04:01.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fiber of our being.

04:01.274 --> 04:05.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Also today, an Oval
Office announcement
the White House says advances
another signature

04:05.712 --> 04:09.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign promise: creating U.S.
jobs.

04:09.749 --> 04:14.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Standing next to the president,
Intel chairman
Brian Krzanich announced plans
to build a

04:14.654 --> 04:20.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$7 billion factory in Phoenix,
which he said
would create up to 10,000 new
jobs.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House officials said the
plant had been
in the works for four years.

04:23.997 --> 04:28.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIAN KRZANICH, CEO, Intel: It's
really in
support of the tax and
regulatory policies

04:28.168 --> 04:34.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we see the administration
pushing forward,
that really make it advantageous
to do manufacturing

04:34.274 --> 04:36.076 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the U.S.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Krzanich opposes the
immigration
order, but White House officials
said it didn't

04:39.579 --> 04:42.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come up in his meeting with Mr.
Trump.

04:42.549 --> 04:46.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump's attacks on federal
judges has
now drawn a response from his
own Supreme

04:46.987 --> 04:48.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Court nominee.

04:48.655 --> 04:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An administration official who's
working on
the confirmation process
confirms that in

04:52.826 --> 04:58.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a meeting on Capitol Hill with
the senator,
Neil Gorsuch said that the
attacks are demoralizing

04:58.832 --> 05:00.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and disheartening.

05:00.634 --> 05:05.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Mr. Trump also took to
Twitter to attack
Nordstrom, the retailer, for
dropping his

05:05.572 --> 05:07.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
daughter Ivanka's fashion line.

05:07.874 --> 05:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They cited poor sales for that
decision.

05:10.477 --> 05:14.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said on Twitter that they
treated her unfairly.

05:14.314 --> 05:20.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Asked about the propriety of a
president supporting
or getting involved in a child's
private business

05:20.820 --> 05:25.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
affairs, White House Press
Secretary Sean
Spicer was said that Mr. Trump
as a father

05:25.659 --> 05:29.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was within his rights to stand
up for his
family -- Judy.

05:29.729 --> 05:34.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: In the day's
other news, the
Senate wrapped up an all-night
and all-day

05:34.834 --> 05:38.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate to confirm Jeff Sessions
as attorney
general.

05:38.505 --> 05:42.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats argued that the
Republican senator
from Alabama is too close to
President Trump

05:42.409 --> 05:44.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and is hostile to minorities.

05:44.711 --> 05:46.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans defended him as a
man of integrity.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will look at the confirmation
fight later
in the program.

05:49.482 --> 05:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This was the
first day on the
job for Betsy DeVos as the U.S.
secretary

05:54.154 --> 05:57.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of education, and she used it to
try to rally
the troops.

05:57.958 --> 06:03.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It took a tie-breaking vote by
Vice President
Pence yesterday to get DeVos
confirmed.

06:03.697 --> 06:08.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Michigan billionaire faced
criticism over
her lack of experience with
public schools.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Today, she appealed to
department staffers
for unity.

06:11.972 --> 06:16.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETSY DEVOS, U.S. Education
Secretary: Let
us set aside any preconceived
notions and

06:16.776 --> 06:24.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let's recognize that while we
may have disagreements,
we can and must come together,
find common

06:24.651 --> 06:27.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ground, and put the needs of
students first.

06:27.721 --> 06:34.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we do disagree, let's
set an example
by being sincere and honest,
passionate, but

06:34.628 --> 06:36.496 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
civil.

06:36.529 --> 06:40.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: DeVos has
championed charter
schools and other alternatives
to public education.

06:40.800 --> 06:45.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: In Afghanistan,
an ambush by
suspected Islamic State
militants ended in

06:45.839 --> 06:49.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the deaths of six Afghan workers
for the International
Red Cross.

06:49.676 --> 06:55.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Red Cross team was trying to
deliver supplies
to a northern town paralyzed by
snowstorms.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After the attack, the agency
suspended operations
in Afghanistan.

06:57.917 --> 07:02.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: It was a region we knew
very well, and
it's really very experienced
colleagues.

07:02.889 --> 07:07.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then knowing that they have
been killed,
attacked directly, is the worst
possible news.

07:07.560 --> 07:11.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, the shock is
first to realize
what it means for our actions in
Afghanistan,

07:11.865 --> 07:14.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what it means for Afghans, for
the family,
for the colleagues.

07:14.534 --> 07:19.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: The Taliban
denied it had anything
to do with the attack, and
promised to help

07:19.139 --> 07:20.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
find those responsible.

07:20.940 --> 07:26.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A United Nations
report warns
that more than 120,000 people in
Nigeria will

07:26.846 --> 07:30.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
likely face "catastrophic
famine" this summer.

07:30.283 --> 07:35.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than half live in Borno
state, where
the Islamist militant group Boko
Haram has

07:35.755 --> 07:37.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
disrupted food supplies.

07:37.691 --> 07:43.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Overall, the U.N.'s Food and
Agriculture Organization
says 11 million Nigerians face
severe food

07:43.897 --> 07:47.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shortages in a nation of more
than 170 million.

07:47.200 --> 07:52.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Once again, a
Russian court
has found opposition leader
Alexei Navalny

07:52.072 --> 07:53.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
guilty of fraud.

07:53.740 --> 07:57.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An earlier conviction had been
overturned
by the European Court of Human
Rights.

07:57.711 --> 08:02.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This new decision formally
disqualifies Navalny
as a candidate for president
next year.

He says the Kremlin engineered
the verdict
to sabotage his bid.

ALEXEI NAVALNY, Russian
Opposition Leader
(through translator): What we
saw now is a

08:10.924 --> 08:14.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of telegram which was sent
from the Kremlin,
saying that they believe that
the people whose

08:14.627 --> 08:19.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
views I voice are too dangerous
to allow us
to take part in the election
campaign.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nevertheless, we don't recognize
this ruling.

08:21.434 --> 08:25.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have every right to take part
in the election,
according to the constitution,
and I will

08:25.038 --> 08:26.806 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do so.

08:26.840 --> 08:31.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Navalny was
convicted for the
embezzlement of $270,000 worth
of timber.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He was given a five-year
suspended sentence.

08:33.313 --> 08:37.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, a North
Carolina court temporarily
blocked a state

08:37.951 --> 08:42.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law that stripped the new
Democratic governor
of some of his powers.

08:42.122 --> 08:46.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican-controlled
legislature passed
the measure after the November
election.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It requires state Senate
confirmation for
Cabinet members.

08:50.430 --> 08:53.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The court still has to rule on
the merits
of the law itself.

08:53.800 --> 08:58.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Former Republican
Secretary
of State James Baker went to the
White House

08:58.204 --> 08:59.739 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

08:59.773 --> 09:03.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wants the administration to
embrace a carbon
tax to combat climate change.

09:03.076 --> 09:06.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Baker and another former
secretary of state,
George Shultz, wrote in The Wall
Street Journal

09:06.980 --> 09:10.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- quote -- "There is mounting
evidence of
problems with the atmosphere
that are growing

09:10.984 --> 09:13.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
too compelling to ignore."

09:13.153 --> 09:16.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other former Reagan and Bush
administration
officials back the idea, but
it's not clear

09:16.990 --> 09:18.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans in Congress will
join them.

09:18.892 --> 09:24.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On Wall Street
today, the Dow
Jones industrial average lost
about 36 points

09:24.063 --> 09:25.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to close at 20054.

09:25.432 --> 09:30.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose eight points,
and the S&amp;P
500 added one point.

09:31.004 --> 09:36.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
my interview
with House Speaker Paul Ryan;
Senator Elizabeth

09:36.643 --> 09:42.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Warren on recent clashes over
the president's
Cabinet picks; using the body's
natural immune

09:42.715 --> 09:56.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system to fight cancer; and much
more.

09:56.663 --> 10:00.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now to my interview with the
speaker of the
House of Representatives, Paul
Ryan.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We sat down at the Capitol.

10:02.802 --> 10:07.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I began by asking about his
relationship
with President Trump, after some
tension during

10:07.474 --> 10:08.441 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the campaign.

10:08.475 --> 10:09.676 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

10:09.709 --> 10:10.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: We're
doing fine.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're getting along very well,
speak fairly
frequently.

10:14.881 --> 10:16.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mike is coming up for lunch
today.

10:16.583 --> 10:19.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we have spent a lot of time
together coordinating
our strategy.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The vice
president.

10:20.186 --> 10:21.154 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL RYAN: Yes, the vice
president.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we get along very well.

10:24.023 --> 10:25.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you speak
often, but do
they consult you not just on the
routine things

10:25.959 --> 10:31.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like the legislative calendar,
but, for example,
did you know ahead of time about
the immigration

10:31.130 --> 10:32.098 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ban?

10:32.131 --> 10:33.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: On that one, I
didn't.

10:34.934 --> 10:37.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have decided, on a
go-forward basis,
that we are going to have more
consulting

10:37.237 --> 10:40.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and make sure that no one's
caught by surprise
on things.

10:40.373 --> 10:44.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have basically mapped out
what 2017 looks
like from a legislative
perspective.

10:44.711 --> 10:45.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Already?

10:45.712 --> 10:46.679 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

10:46.713 --> 10:47.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL RYAN: Absolutely.

10:47.847 --> 10:48.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what you do when you're
running a legislature.

10:48.715 --> 10:50.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You plan your year.

10:50.483 --> 10:55.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so Senator McConnell and I
walked the
president through basically what
we see 2017

10:55.955 --> 10:57.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
looking like.

10:57.790 --> 11:01.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there is a lot of
deadline-driven events,
statutory deadlines that you
have to meet.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there are plenty of
other priorities
that we're working on.

11:04.230 --> 11:10.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so just that planning
process gets you
talking about the big issues,
the big picture

11:10.370 --> 11:12.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and all the things we're trying
to get done
and when we're trying to get
them done.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I want to
stay with the
immigration ban for just a
moment, because

11:15.575 --> 11:18.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
former CIA Director Michael
Hayden, whom you
know...

11:19.012 --> 11:19.979 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: I know Mike well,
yes.

11:21.781 --> 11:23.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... joined a
legal brief with
a number of other national
security experts

11:23.583 --> 11:27.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in saying that they not only
don't think this
is going to make the United
States safer,

11:27.921 --> 11:33.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they don't see a threat from
these seven countries,
but they think it could make the
country less

11:33.326 --> 11:37.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
safe, because it is going to be
easier to
attract people who want to work
with terrorist

11:37.130 --> 11:39.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
groups against the U.S., to say
the U.S. is
anti-Muslim.

11:39.832 --> 11:40.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

11:40.833 --> 11:41.801 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PAUL RYAN: Yes.

11:43.069 --> 11:44.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think the rhetoric is
damaging, no two ways
about it.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's back up for a second.

11:46.606 --> 11:51.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the Paris shooting, we
brought the Department
of Homeland Security and FBI up
to Capitol

11:51.511 --> 11:54.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hill to say, what is happening?

11:54.514 --> 11:56.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Could this happen here?

11:56.349 --> 11:59.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because, if you remember, at the
Paris shooting,
there was an infiltration of
ISIS among the

11:59.619 --> 12:01.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syrian refugee population into
Europe.

12:01.621 --> 12:03.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it turned out
there were
not refugees involved.

12:03.856 --> 12:04.857 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: But that was the
issue at the time.

12:06.693 --> 12:09.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what Homeland Security
and the FBI
told us was, they can't vet
these people.

12:09.662 --> 12:12.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There -- there isn't a Siri (ph)
to talk to,
to vet these people.

12:12.865 --> 12:18.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what we discovered was,
there was a
hole in the vetting process to
guard against

12:18.771 --> 12:21.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people trying to infiltrate the
refugee population.

12:21.074 --> 12:25.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that is why we passed
legislation then
about a year ago.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bill passed the House, but
it got filibustered
in the Senate.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it never actually went into
law.

12:29.816 --> 12:34.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have been long on record
on a bipartisan
basis that we need to get these
vetting standards

12:34.187 --> 12:37.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right and we need to take a
pause in these
programs to make sure that we
have the vetting

12:37.890 --> 12:39.692 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
standards right.

12:39.726 --> 12:42.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The reason these seven
countries, which were
identified by the Obama
administration, are

12:42.996 --> 12:49.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
listed is because we have a hard
time corroborating
the veracity of people's claims
coming from

12:49.168 --> 12:50.970 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those countries.

12:51.004 --> 12:55.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those countries in particular,
we have a hard
time discerning who exactly
these people are

12:55.642 --> 12:57.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that are coming into the
country.

12:57.443 --> 13:03.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That is why it's totally
reasonable and rational
to have a pause in this program,
so that we

13:03.216 --> 13:07.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can update and upgrade our
vetting standards,
so that we can be better secured
to make sure

13:07.453 --> 13:09.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we don't have somebody
trying to infiltrate
the network.

13:09.956 --> 13:13.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But there haven't
been terrorist
incidents perpetrated by people
from these

13:13.259 --> 13:14.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
countries.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, that's...

13:15.261 --> 13:16.729 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: From these countries
or from -- through
the refugee population?

13:18.131 --> 13:20.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From these countries,
absolutely, from the
refugee population.

13:20.099 --> 13:21.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.902 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:22.935 --> 13:25.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: But the point is we
know that ISIS
is trying to infiltrate refugee
populations.

13:25.371 --> 13:27.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is intelligence that has
already been
unclassified.

13:27.774 --> 13:30.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the question is, are we
doing everything
we need to guard against that?

13:30.743 --> 13:34.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The point -- I think you made a
good point,
though, which is, this isn't a
Muslim ban.

13:34.881 --> 13:37.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If it were, I would be opposed
to it.

13:37.050 --> 13:41.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the rhetoric surrounding it
makes it look
like it's a ban on a religion or
a religious

13:41.621 --> 13:42.922 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
test.

13:42.955 --> 13:45.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that rhetoric is
inflammatory
and doesn't help us.

13:45.992 --> 13:49.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that raises
the question,
because the president himself
and others around

13:49.362 --> 13:54.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him have talked about -- they
have talked
about their preference for a
Muslim ban.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.234 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Yes, and I disagree
with that.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I disagree with that.

13:57.470 --> 13:58.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you confident
that there
will not...

13:58.271 --> 13:59.639 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:59.672 --> 14:00.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: I disagree with it
now and I disagreed
with it then.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that's not what this is.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I understand
that.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But my question is, are you
confident this
administration is not going in
the direction

14:04.243 --> 14:05.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ever of a Muslim ban?

14:05.545 --> 14:07.280 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

14:07.313 --> 14:08.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Yes, because we will
-- we will
-- I and many others around here
would oppose

14:08.648 --> 14:10.249 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A little bit more
about your
relationship with the White
House.

14:12.151 --> 14:17.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that you are good
friends with fellow
Wisconsinite Chief of Staff
Reince Priebus.

14:17.757 --> 14:18.725 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

14:18.758 --> 14:19.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: He's my constituent.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's right.

14:21.627 --> 14:24.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My question is, how is your
relationship with
Steve Bannon, who, when he was
at Breitbart

14:24.897 --> 14:30.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
News, took a special interest in
you, called
you the enemy after you became
speaker?

14:30.870 --> 14:31.838 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

14:31.871 --> 14:32.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Yes, I don't really
know him.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have gotten to know him two or
three times.

14:34.674 --> 14:35.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have had a few meetings.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have gotten along fine.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's not someone I have a
history with.

14:39.245 --> 14:44.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, I didn't know him
when he was opposing
me all those times.

14:44.283 --> 14:45.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're different kinds of
conservatives.

14:45.418 --> 14:49.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's something I can safely
say, I think.

14:49.188 --> 14:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we're serving a purpose,
which is to get
this agenda passed.

14:52.024 --> 14:56.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on this agenda that we have
rolled out,
that we ran on, on that, we
agree.

14:56.496 --> 15:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I see a person in which I
have a common
cause and purpose with.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're different kinds of
conservatives.

15:02.168 --> 15:05.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We really don't know each other,
but we're
all trying to get this agenda
enacted.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's why I don't see a
problem here.

15:07.373 --> 15:09.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Russia.

15:09.342 --> 15:13.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have said on a number of
occasions you
want to see the sanctions
against Russia continued.

15:13.813 --> 15:17.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump, though, has
made some not
just conciliatory, but even
complimentary

15:17.517 --> 15:21.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comments in the last few days
about President
Putin.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Were you shocked by that?

15:22.421 --> 15:23.389 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Yes, I just don't see
it that way.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I just see it differently.

15:26.359 --> 15:32.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, first of all, I don't
subscribe to
relativism, whether it's in
political philosophy,

15:32.698 --> 15:34.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
foreign policy or in life.

15:34.567 --> 15:38.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I don't think there is a
moral equivalency
here at all.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I just disagree with any
kind of notion
of a moral equivalency.

15:41.607 --> 15:47.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a gaping difference
between the United
States of America and Putin's
Russia.

15:47.246 --> 15:49.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's point number one.

15:49.115 --> 15:53.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Point number two, I think what
the president
is trying to do is not unlike
what the past

15:53.052 --> 15:54.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
two presidents did with Russia.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just don't think it's going to
work.

15:57.023 --> 15:59.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember when George W. Bush
said I could
see through his soul or
something like that?

15:59.759 --> 16:00.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trying to get
close to Russia.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.495 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:02.528 --> 16:03.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Yes, he was trying to
get close
to Russia and trying to get
close to Putin.

16:03.095 --> 16:04.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
George Bush did that.

16:04.363 --> 16:06.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't think it worked.

16:06.265 --> 16:10.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember Hillary Clinton with
the reset button
on behalf of Barack Obama,
trying to get close

16:10.169 --> 16:12.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Russia, trying to smooth
things out with
Russia?

16:12.872 --> 16:14.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
New administrations do this.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, it's logical as to why they
want to do
this.

16:17.810 --> 16:21.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are instances in which our
interests
align with Russia and there are
those where

16:21.647 --> 16:23.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they don't.

16:23.449 --> 16:28.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the question is, can we
help steer
Russia to being something that
doesn't conflict

16:28.054 --> 16:31.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with our interests and something
that -- and
a country that aligns with our
interests?

16:31.791 --> 16:33.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't personally -- I'm not
going to hold
my breath on that.

16:33.893 --> 16:37.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if this
president were
to relax sanctions against
Russia...

16:37.396 --> 16:38.364 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:38.397 --> 16:39.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Yes, I don't support
that.

16:39.765 --> 16:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... would you
support legislation
to prevent it?

16:40.666 --> 16:41.868 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:41.901 --> 16:43.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Yes, no, I think the
advantages
were overdue.

16:43.936 --> 16:46.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think President Obama should
have done them
a year ago.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you would
support legislation
to keep them strong?

16:48.741 --> 16:50.376 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:50.409 --> 16:52.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Yes, I do support --
yes, I have
long supported sanctions on
Russia.

16:52.311 --> 16:57.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Turning domestic,
to a subject
that I think is close to your
heart, tax reform.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has been your top legislative
agenda.

16:59.585 --> 17:00.553 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

17:00.586 --> 17:01.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Yes, you see the
smile?

17:01.654 --> 17:02.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just -- I love the issue of
tax reform.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We haven't done it since 1986.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, we think it's a
once-in-a-generation
opportunity.

17:05.892 --> 17:08.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, here we are,
however many
years that is later, 31 years.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.429 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL RYAN: Yes, I got my
driver's license
the last year we did tax reform.

17:12.398 --> 17:16.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Will the
individual and the
corporate tax cuts that you're
interested

17:16.869 --> 17:20.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the House passing be
permanent?

17:20.039 --> 17:25.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And will these cuts be
revenue-neutral or
will they require offsets?

17:25.077 --> 17:26.045 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

17:26.078 --> 17:27.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL RYAN: Yes and yes.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, to be revenue-neutral,
they will require
offsets.

17:29.148 --> 17:33.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, we're planning
revenue-neutral tax reform,
which means you have to take
away loopholes

17:33.519 --> 17:36.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and special interest deductions
if you're
going to lower tax rates.

17:36.155 --> 17:37.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's clearly what we're
working on doing.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what the House blueprint
that we ran
on does do.

17:40.660 --> 17:45.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It does affect both what we call
the individual
side of the tax code and the
business side

17:45.264 --> 17:46.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the tax code.

17:46.699 --> 17:50.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we propose it on a
revenue-neutral basis.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we also propose permanent
tax reform.

17:53.339 --> 17:58.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we did the 2001 and 2003
tax cuts in
the Bush administration, those
were only individual

17:58.811 --> 18:02.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tax cuts, which you can actually
make those
temporary.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You can't do that on the
business side of
the code.

18:04.283 --> 18:06.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It actually doesn't work.

18:06.052 --> 18:08.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It produces a lot of uncertainty
for businesses.

18:08.421 --> 18:12.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't completely redesign
the budget tax
system for nine-and-a-half
years, and then

18:12.792 --> 18:15.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
flip it back in 10 years.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't work like that.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it has to be permanent.

18:17.797 --> 18:23.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, we do envision
revenue-neutral tax reform
that is permanent.

18:23.135 --> 18:27.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With good comprehensive
across-the-board tax
reform, we really believe we can
get the kind

18:27.573 --> 18:31.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of economic growth we need which
will solve
so many problems we have in this
country.

18:31.277 --> 18:37.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And fundamental tax reform is
critical, because
now we have the worst tax code
in the industrialized

18:37.350 --> 18:38.317 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
world, bar none.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, no domestic
spending cuts?

18:40.219 --> 18:43.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I ask because a Republican study
group last
year was talking about $7.5
trillion in spending

18:43.522 --> 18:44.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cuts for 10 years.

18:44.523 --> 18:45.491 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

18:45.524 --> 18:46.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: That's to balance the
budget.

18:46.525 --> 18:47.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not to pay for tax
reform.

18:47.526 --> 18:48.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I understand.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the public, the voters are
going to look
at this as connected.

18:50.896 --> 18:52.465 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

18:52.498 --> 18:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Yes, we have a budget
problem,
which is, we have a big budget
deficit.

18:54.367 --> 18:57.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have a debt crisis in the
future because
of spending.

18:57.303 --> 19:01.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you have to reduce spending
and reform
the spending programs in and of
themselves.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Put tax reform aside.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's no way -- it's
mathematical.

19:05.077 --> 19:09.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are not going to be able to
raise the kind
of tax revenues to chase the
kind of spending

19:09.148 --> 19:10.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that is coming in the future.

19:10.950 --> 19:14.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you have to get spending
under control
if you're going to avert a debt
crisis down

19:14.720 --> 19:16.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the road.

19:16.655 --> 19:20.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Affordable
Care Act, you
have committed to repealing,
replacing Obamacare.

19:20.926 --> 19:25.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One of your colleagues,
Congressman Jim Jordan,
has said -- and I'm quoting him
-- "It's so

19:25.331 --> 19:27.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bad."

19:27.233 --> 19:30.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, Congress has to get rid
of -- quote
-- "every bit of it, every tax,
every regulation,

19:30.536 --> 19:31.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every mandate.

19:31.537 --> 19:33.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It all has to be eliminated."

19:33.439 --> 19:39.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Given that view, which a lot of
Republicans
share, would any piece of the
current Affordable

19:39.445 --> 19:40.479 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Care Act stand?

19:40.513 --> 19:42.281 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

19:42.314 --> 19:46.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Yes, so the reason
Jim Jordan says
that is because the architecture
is just so

19:46.519 --> 19:48.421 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wrong.

19:48.454 --> 19:51.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that was in reaction
to some suggesting
that we should sort of tinker
around the edges

19:51.891 --> 19:55.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and try and refine and repair
the existing
law.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is collapsing.

19:57.129 --> 19:59.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's not viable.

19:59.198 --> 20:03.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what we propose -- and we
ran on a
replacement plan, by the way.

20:03.502 --> 20:06.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we have had a -- long had a
replacement
plan for Obamacare.

20:06.772 --> 20:11.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's exactly what we're
focused on right
now is building a replacement
plan, so we

20:11.644 --> 20:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
repeal Obamacare and replace it
with patient-centered
health care, which we are
convinced will give

20:16.248 --> 20:18.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us a better system at the end of
the day.

20:18.684 --> 20:22.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Remember the promises of
Obamacare, lower
prices, more choices.

20:22.688 --> 20:24.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those things didn't happen.

20:24.590 --> 20:29.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We believe we can make good on
those kind
of promises, which is improve
access to affordable

20:29.261 --> 20:30.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health care coverage.

20:30.629 --> 20:32.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, people aren't getting
affordable
health care coverage.

20:32.498 --> 20:36.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we really do believe, to
get this right,
you have to repeal and replace
this law with

20:36.769 --> 20:37.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
something better.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's exactly what we ran
on in 2016.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Including
preexisting conditions
are covered?

20:41.640 --> 20:42.608 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

20:42.641 --> 20:43.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Absolutely, yes.

20:43.642 --> 20:45.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have long supported...

20:45.411 --> 20:46.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Not something
called continuous
coverage, which isn't the same
thing?

20:46.212 --> 20:47.913 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: No, no, there's
different ways
of achieving preexisting
conditions reform.

20:50.349 --> 20:54.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We think Obamacare went about it
the exact
wrong way to guarantee that
people with preexisting

20:54.920 --> 20:57.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
conditions can get good
affordable coverage.

20:57.723 --> 21:02.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The goal here is, can people
with preexisting
-- can a woman who got breast
cancer when

21:02.361 --> 21:06.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she was 45 still afford her
health insurance?

21:06.699 --> 21:08.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a goal we absolutely
share.

21:08.534 --> 21:13.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we think there is a better
way of achieving
that goal than Obamacare, which
just so you

21:13.439 --> 21:16.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, Judy, five states only
have one plan
left to choose from.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One out of three counties in
America have
only one plan to choose from.

21:19.745 --> 21:21.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Those are monopolies.

21:21.647 --> 21:24.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Seventy percent of counties in
America have
one or two plans to choose from.

21:24.783 --> 21:25.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Those are duopolies.

21:25.784 --> 21:26.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're
also...

21:26.785 --> 21:28.120 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

21:28.154 --> 21:28.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL RYAN: Massive price
increases, massive
deductible increases.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The law is collapsing while we
speak.

21:30.856 --> 21:34.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have talked
about a split
between -- a trillion-dollar
infrastructure

21:34.326 --> 21:37.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
split between the federal
government and the
private sector.

21:37.263 --> 21:38.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What would the split be?

21:38.264 --> 21:39.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are we looking at a 50/50?

21:39.265 --> 21:40.332 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

21:40.366 --> 21:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Yes, I don't know the
answer to
that.

21:41.333 --> 21:42.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's something we would have
to develop.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have asked our Transportation
Committees.

21:44.136 --> 21:49.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have Elaine Chao, who just
got sworn in
as secretary of transportation,
who has a

21:49.375 --> 21:54.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long history and experience in
transportation,
to figure out how best we can
maximize private

21:54.947 --> 21:59.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sector dollars and leverage
private sector
dollars with public money to get
the best

21:59.451 --> 22:02.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bang for our buck on building
out our infrastructure.

22:02.288 --> 22:06.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's something that
we're trying
to figure out how best we can do
for part

22:06.225 --> 22:08.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of our legislative agenda later
this summer.

22:08.060 --> 22:11.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But to the extent
you're counting
on the private sector to get
involved, it's

22:11.964 --> 22:17.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
known -- we talk to the experts
-- they say
private businesspeople don't get
involved

22:17.303 --> 22:20.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in something like this unless
there is an
incentive, that they get some
tax breaks.

22:20.406 --> 22:21.373 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

22:21.407 --> 22:22.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL RYAN: That's right,
absolutely.

22:22.408 --> 22:24.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what we believe.

22:24.210 --> 22:27.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We believe, instead of just
having a dollar
of taxpayer money go to pay for
a dollar of

22:27.713 --> 22:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
road construction, why don't we
take a dollar
of taxpayer money to try and
leverage many

22:32.351 --> 22:38.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dollars of private sector money,
so we have
more money, federal, you know,
taxpayer money,

22:38.224 --> 22:41.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
private sector money combined,
so that we
have even more impact on
upgrading and modernizing

22:42.027 --> 22:43.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our infrastructure?

22:43.862 --> 22:49.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The point is, how much bang for
our buck can
we get to have the best impact
on modernizing

22:49.902 --> 22:51.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
American infrastructure?

22:51.637 --> 22:52.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what we're trying to
figure out.

22:53.005 --> 22:56.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A couple of
questions about
you in this position.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael Gerson, conservative
thinker, writer...

22:58.777 --> 22:59.912 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

22:59.945 --> 23:00.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: We used to work
together for Jack
Kemp.

23:00.846 --> 23:02.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's an old friend of mine.

23:02.448 --> 23:03.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's right.

23:03.449 --> 23:04.583 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Admires you, has written
positively about
you for years.

23:06.518 --> 23:11.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wrote yesterday that, with
your acceptance
of President Trump, he said you
have embraced

23:11.357 --> 23:16.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what he calls a Faustian bargain
with open
eyes, he said, a chance to enact
legislation

23:16.662 --> 23:20.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important to you, as long as you
occasionally
ignore your conscience.

23:20.432 --> 23:21.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

23:21.533 --> 23:23.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Oh, I -- that's just
a bunch of
bull.

23:23.168 --> 23:24.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
First of all, acceptance.

23:24.870 --> 23:28.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The man got elected president of
the United
States.

23:28.974 --> 23:31.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We live in a constitutional
republic.

23:31.944 --> 23:36.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what's the suggestion here,
that we should
just ignore democracy, ignore
the will of

23:36.415 --> 23:39.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the people, ignore the Electoral
College,
and not work with who was
elected president?

23:39.885 --> 23:42.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I worked with the last
president, Barack Obama.

23:42.221 --> 23:45.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't agree with him on much,
but I worked
with him.

23:45.157 --> 23:51.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now I have a president who
agrees with and
embraces the agenda that we ran
on in 2016,

23:51.597 --> 23:56.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who gives us a great chance of
fixing really
big problems in America.

23:56.302 --> 23:58.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Have we seen eye to eye on
everything over
the last year?

23:58.704 --> 23:59.672 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Of course not.

23:59.705 --> 24:01.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No two people do.

24:01.473 --> 24:07.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But -- so I just -- I reject the
premise of
this notion that the head of the
legislative

24:07.546 --> 24:12.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
branch of government should just
reject the
duly elected head of the
executive branch

24:12.685 --> 24:13.652 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of government.

24:13.686 --> 24:15.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That makes no sense to me.

24:15.487 --> 24:18.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what people want to see
happen in
government is people work
together to solve

24:18.657 --> 24:20.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
problems.

24:20.592 --> 24:24.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People work together to iron out
their differences,
to make good on making a
difference in people's

24:24.263 --> 24:26.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lives and fix this country's
problems.

24:26.365 --> 24:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is what I believe I was
elected to do.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's what I'm doing.

24:29.802 --> 24:33.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What came through
to me in
what Michael Gerson wrote was
that he doesn't

24:34.006 --> 24:38.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sense that you're standing up to
this president
on things that he thought,
Michael Gerson

24:38.043 --> 24:39.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thought you believed in.

24:39.044 --> 24:40.746 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

24:40.779 --> 24:42.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: I'm just not going to
comment on
the tweet of the hour, the
comment of the

24:42.514 --> 24:43.482 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

24:43.515 --> 24:45.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm focused on getting an agenda
done.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm focused on making Congress
work.

24:46.919 --> 24:51.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm focused on making good on
our promises
that we made when we ran that
I'm trying to

24:51.190 --> 24:53.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
implement now that we have --
now that the
election is over.

24:53.826 --> 24:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I'm just not going to spend
my days focusing
on things that are outside of my
control as

24:59.098 --> 25:00.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
speaker of the House.

25:00.899 --> 25:04.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to focus on my days
focusing on
making progress on the issues
that care to

25:04.670 --> 25:07.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people and not on the random
comment of the
day.

25:07.339 --> 25:11.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In connection
with that, your
great mentor was the late
congressman, New

25:11.977 --> 25:15.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
York Congressman Jack Kemp,
described himself
as a big-tent Republican.

25:15.914 --> 25:16.849 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

25:16.882 --> 25:18.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PAUL RYAN: Yes.

25:18.717 --> 25:21.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot of people
look at Donald
Trump, they don't see a big-tent
Republican.

25:21.754 --> 25:22.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you reconcile?

25:22.755 --> 25:23.689 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

25:23.722 --> 25:24.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Yes, well, I think he
is.

25:24.823 --> 25:25.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's just a different kind of a
big-tent Republican.

25:25.891 --> 25:27.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I am more of the Jack Kemp
aspirational, inclusive.

25:27.192 --> 25:32.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I believe in the Kempian
philosophy and the
style of politics.

25:32.498 --> 25:36.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Donald Trump brought a whole
bunch of
blue-collar -- I can tell you,
just in Wisconsin,

25:36.902 --> 25:41.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
just the numbers, he won
Wisconsin for the
first time since 1984.

25:41.507 --> 25:43.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's expanding the Republican
tent.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He won Michigan, Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin.

25:45.978 --> 25:48.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's expanding the Republican
tent.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We used to call them Reagan
Democrats.

25:50.315 --> 25:52.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now they're Trump Democrats.

25:52.651 --> 25:56.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are people I grew up with,
went to high
school with, worked at the GM
plant that's

25:56.188 --> 26:02.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
gone now in Janesville,
blue-collar, union
households that just now voted
for a Republican

26:02.060 --> 26:03.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for president.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's expanding the tent, I
would say.

26:05.297 --> 26:10.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, the only
thing that
I am told that Paul Ryan of
Wisconsin might

26:11.003 --> 26:14.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like as much as tax cuts and the
Republican
Party is the Green Bay Packers.

26:14.873 --> 26:15.841 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

26:15.874 --> 26:16.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL RYAN: That's right.

26:16.975 --> 26:17.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, after the
Sunday Super
Bowl...

26:17.876 --> 26:18.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: I'm one of the team
owners.

26:20.512 --> 26:20.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, after the
Sunday Super
Bowl, do you now acknowledge
that...

26:20.879 --> 26:22.080 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

26:22.114 --> 26:22.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Oh, you're going to
put me in this
position.

26:22.881 --> 26:24.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is the hardest question.

26:24.483 --> 26:27.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tom Brady, best
NFL quarterback
ever?

26:27.519 --> 26:28.654 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

26:28.687 --> 26:31.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Look, the Lombardi
Trophy is what
you get.

26:31.123 --> 26:35.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I will concede that Bill
Belichick is probably
the best coach ever.

26:35.861 --> 26:37.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brady and Rodgers aren't done
with their careers
yet.

26:37.729 --> 26:39.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, ask me when the two of them
are done with
their careers.

26:39.531 --> 26:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're not
ready to concede
that?

26:41.333 --> 26:43.135 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

26:43.168 --> 26:44.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: I'm not ready to
concede, because
neither of them are done with
their careers.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I will concede Belichick.

26:47.272 --> 26:48.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:48.507 --> 26:51.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Speaker of the
House Paul Ryan,
thank you.

26:51.343 --> 26:52.377 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

26:52.411 --> 26:57.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Thank you, Judy.

26:57.716 --> 27:05.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Moving over to
the Senate,
where the debate over the
nomination of Jeff

27:05.524 --> 27:09.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sessions ran deep into the night
and partisan
tensions spilled over.

27:09.695 --> 27:11.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins starts us off.

27:11.163 --> 27:12.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: The senator from
Massachusetts.

SEN.

27:13.532 --> 27:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WARREN (D),
Massachusetts: Thank
you, Mr. President.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: She was midway
through her
speech opposing attorney general
nominee Jeff

27:17.769 --> 27:18.737 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Sessions.

SEN.

27:20.506 --> 27:23.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WARREN: Coretta Scott
King also
wrote to the Judiciary Committee
about the

27:23.342 --> 27:25.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sessions nomination in 1986.

27:25.878 --> 27:31.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: When
Massachusetts Senator
Elizabeth Warren turned to a
decades-old letter

27:31.083 --> 27:37.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the widow of Martin Luther
King Jr., opposing
Sessions' nomination to a
judgeship.

27:37.322 --> 27:41.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mrs. King called his record on
race at that
point, reprehensible.

27:41.827 --> 27:42.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Warren read out loud:

27:42.828 --> 27:44.630 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

27:44.663 --> 27:49.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WARREN: "Mr. Sessions
has used the
awesome power of his office to
chill the free

27:49.434 --> 27:56.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exercise of the vote by black
citizens in
the district he now seeks to
serve as a federal

27:56.808 --> 27:57.910 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
judge.

27:57.943 --> 28:01.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This simply cannot be allowed to
happen."

28:01.113 --> 28:03.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Warren was
interrupted multiple
times.

SEN.

28:04.650 --> 28:05.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WARREN: ...
enforcement of those
laws.

28:05.984 --> 28:09.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: The senator is reminded
that is a violation
of Rule 19.

28:09.054 --> 28:11.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Told she'd
broken a rule.

28:11.056 --> 28:12.391 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

28:12.424 --> 28:15.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

SEN.

28:18.063 --> 28:19.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: I
object.

28:19.565 --> 28:20.499 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIZABETH WARREN: I appeal the
ruling.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Objection is heard.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The senator will take her seat.

28:25.537 --> 28:29.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: The
rarely-invoked rule bans
senators from criticizing one
another directly

28:29.875 --> 28:31.410 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the chamber.

28:31.443 --> 28:32.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republican Leader Mitch
McConnell:

28:32.644 --> 28:34.346 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL: The senator has
impugned
the motive and conduct of our
colleague from

28:36.315 --> 28:37.983 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Alabama.

28:38.016 --> 28:44.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Now, this led
to an unusual
vote over whether to silence
Warren.

28:44.389 --> 28:49.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She lost, and now cannot speak
again during
Sessions' confirmation debate.

28:49.861 --> 28:53.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator McConnell later told
reporters -- quote
-- "She was warned.

28:53.332 --> 28:55.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She was given an explanation.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nevertheless, she persisted."

28:57.803 --> 28:59.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is a time of rancor.

28:59.905 --> 29:04.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That rare vote to silence a
sitting senator
came as Democrats have forced
two overnight

29:04.376 --> 29:05.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
debates in a row.

29:05.510 --> 29:08.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is their protest of Trump's
nominees.

29:08.180 --> 29:11.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And those overnights may
continue into the
weekend.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump weighed in on it
all last
night on Twitter.

29:14.853 --> 29:19.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He tweeted: "It is a disgrace
that my full
Cabinet is still not in place."

29:19.925 --> 29:24.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's critics point out,
several of his
nominees didn't complete their
paperwork quickly.

29:24.596 --> 29:30.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Labor nominee Andrew Puzder
submitted his
final ethics documents to a
committee today.

29:30.469 --> 29:33.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins
at the U.S. Capitol.

29:33.905 --> 29:38.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: I spoke with
Senator Elizabeth
Warren a short time ago to get
her take on

29:38.210 --> 29:39.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the 11th-hour drama in the
Senate.

29:40.012 --> 29:44.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I began by asking if she
believed Jeff Sessions
would use his power as attorney
general to

29:44.950 --> 29:46.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
work against minority voters.

29:46.652 --> 29:48.353 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

29:48.387 --> 29:52.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WARREN: What I know is
what Jeff
Sessions has actually done, and
I think it

29:52.190 --> 29:55.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is an important part of the
record.

29:55.560 --> 30:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was shut down for saying
exactly that sentence,
repeating it out of Coretta
Scott King's letter.

30:01.667 --> 30:07.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I urge everybody, read the
whole letter,
because what it talks about is,
when Jeff

30:07.906 --> 30:13.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sessions was U.S. attorney for
Alabama, he
prosecuted civil rights workers
for doing

30:13.845 --> 30:14.980 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
what?

30:15.013 --> 30:20.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For trying to help elderly
African-Americans
vote.

30:20.819 --> 30:27.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when he came up then for a
federal judgeship,
both Senator Ted Kennedy and
Coretta Scott

30:27.392 --> 30:29.761 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
King said no.

30:29.795 --> 30:37.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Coretta Scott King sent a
letter to the
United States Senate, which was
Republican-controlled,

30:37.169 --> 30:42.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and ultimately that
Republican-controlled
Senate said no to his nomination
to the federal

30:42.841 --> 30:44.643 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bench.

30:44.676 --> 30:49.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I assume at least part of
the reason for
that was the information
contained in Coretta

30:49.915 --> 30:51.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Scott King's letter.

30:51.717 --> 30:55.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AUDIE CORNISH: But the
Republican-led Senate
right now is planning to say
yes, right?

30:55.287 --> 30:58.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the discussion you're
locked out of.

30:58.123 --> 31:03.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What aspect of the attorney
general's power
do you think that Jeff Sessions
could use

31:03.428 --> 31:04.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against the voters?

31:04.429 --> 31:05.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are you most concerned
about?

31:05.430 --> 31:06.631 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH WARREN: I'm concerned
about every
part of it.

31:08.433 --> 31:14.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attorney general, as the
ultimate law
enforcement official in the
United States,

31:14.539 --> 31:19.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the one who decides whether
or not you
prosecute violations of the
Voting Rights

31:19.778 --> 31:21.546 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Act.

31:21.580 --> 31:26.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is the one who ultimately
will have the
word on how our immigration laws
are carried

31:26.284 --> 31:28.053 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

31:28.086 --> 31:33.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the one who will make the
decision whether
or not the Justice Department is
there for

31:33.592 --> 31:37.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
African-Americans, whether it's
there for
Latinos, whether it's there for
women, whether

31:37.629 --> 31:43.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's there for people whose
rights are being
violated, or whether it's a
Justice Department

31:43.268 --> 31:46.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who just stands on the side of
the rich and
the powerful.

31:46.271 --> 31:51.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Now, recently
speaking before
progressive activists in
Baltimore, you said

31:51.076 --> 31:55.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Democrats who are focused
on just kind
of changing the party message
need to grow

31:55.046 --> 31:56.481 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a backbone.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you mean by that and are
you seeing
them grow that backbone now?

31:58.984 --> 32:00.719 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

32:00.752 --> 32:05.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WARREN: Look, I think
we have to
get out and fight for what we
believe in.

32:05.157 --> 32:06.958 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I get it.

32:06.992 --> 32:11.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't have the tools in the
Senate to be
able to stop the nomination of
Jeff Sessions

32:11.763 --> 32:16.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be the attorney general,
unless we can
get some help from the
Republicans.

32:16.034 --> 32:21.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't have the tools to be
able to stop
someone like Betsy DeVos, who
doesn't believe

32:21.072 --> 32:24.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in public education, to become
the secretary
of education.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I could continue to go
through the list.

32:26.912 --> 32:31.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what we have got to do is,
we have got
to get in there and make our
case.

32:31.082 --> 32:35.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got to make our case for
the fact
that, you know, I get it that
Donald Trump

32:35.821 --> 32:39.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I are not of the same party,
we don't
see the world the same way.

32:39.424 --> 32:44.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he is not nominating people
who are just
conservative Republicans.

32:44.863 --> 32:47.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's going out to the way
fringes.

32:47.833 --> 32:53.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's bringing in someone to run
the EPA who
doesn't believe in climate
change, someone

32:53.572 --> 32:59.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to run the Treasury Department
who made money
by foreclosing against families
who had been

32:59.945 --> 33:01.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cheated on mortgages.

33:01.146 --> 33:03.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have got to make our case.

33:03.949 --> 33:09.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, ultimately, this one's
going to be about
democracy, getting enough people
around this

33:09.521 --> 33:16.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country to say, I'm watching, I
care what
happens in Washington, and I'm
going to be

33:16.561 --> 33:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pushing back on any of my
senators, any of
my representatives, and on the
president of

33:22.167 --> 33:28.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States if they do not
represent
the values of the people of this
country.

33:28.907 --> 33:30.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: What do you think
the next
step should be?

33:30.842 --> 33:35.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are going to be votes on
Tom Price to
be health and human services
secretary, Steve

33:35.447 --> 33:37.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mnuchin, as you mentioned, for
Treasury.

33:37.582 --> 33:41.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you said, the Democrats can't
stop these
nominee from going forward.

33:41.086 --> 33:45.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you have in the power --
in the way
of oversight to effectively
watch over these

33:45.190 --> 33:47.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people that you have really
raised the alarm
about?

33:47.125 --> 33:48.927 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

33:48.960 --> 33:52.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WARREN: Well, part of
it is why
I wanted everyone to read
Coretta Scott King's

33:52.764 --> 33:53.865 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
letter.

33:53.899 --> 33:55.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a deeply moving letter.

33:55.800 --> 34:01.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It lays out the facts about Jeff
Sessions,
but it also reminds us of a
moment in history

34:01.539 --> 34:06.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when people came together and
said, I don't
care how many times you knock us
down, we're

34:06.978 --> 34:11.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to get back up and we're
going to fight
for what is right, we're going
to change this

34:11.283 --> 34:15.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wasn't country into a better
country, a country
that works not just for those at
the top,

34:15.921 --> 34:18.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a country that works for all of
us.

34:18.423 --> 34:20.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that's what we have to
do now.

34:20.759 --> 34:26.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what we're called on to
do, to use
every possible tool that we can
to do that.

34:26.831 --> 34:30.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that means, for example,
with Jeff Sessions.

34:30.135 --> 34:32.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, I hope everyone will
go read her
letter.

34:32.537 --> 34:34.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I put it on my Facebook.

34:34.205 --> 34:36.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I tweeted about it.

34:36.041 --> 34:44.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I hope that, even if the
Republicans lock
arms and go ahead and confirm
him as attorney

34:44.416 --> 34:50.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general of the United States,
that everybody
stays involved, that we are
there every day

34:50.822 --> 34:56.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to look over his shoulder, to
look at every
judgment made by the Department
of Justice

34:56.695 --> 35:00.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and make sure that this
government works,
not just for those who have
already made it,

35:00.765 --> 35:02.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but this government works for
everybody.

35:02.867 --> 35:07.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Democrat and
Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren, thank
you for speaking

35:07.038 --> 35:09.641 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with us.

35:09.674 --> 35:12.110 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

35:12.143 --> 35:21.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WARREN: Thank you.

35:21.886 --> 35:27.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

35:27.625 --> 35:33.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
massive crack
in an ice shelf forces Antarctic
researchers

35:33.264 --> 35:36.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to evacuate.

35:36.101 --> 35:41.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: the emerging field of
immunotherapy,
and its potential to help fight
cancer in

35:41.573 --> 35:43.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some patients.

35:43.208 --> 35:47.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan has a
conversation about
its promise and limits in a
minute.

35:48.013 --> 35:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We begin with the story of a
cancer patient
who was told at one point that
she only had

35:53.418 --> 35:54.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
six months to live.

35:54.953 --> 35:59.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has now lived several years
beyond that,
thanks to her novel treatment.

35:59.691 --> 36:03.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those kind of treatments are the
focus of
our weekly segment, the Leading
Edge.

36:03.762 --> 36:06.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MELINDA WELSH, Cancer Sufferer:
My name is
Melinda Welsh.

36:06.364 --> 36:11.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm a writer, and was editor of
The Sacramento
News and Review for around 25
years.

36:11.569 --> 36:18.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I was diagnosed with
cancer, it just
came naturally, I guess, to
write about it.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was shocking to hear.

36:20.645 --> 36:21.913 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I felt stunned.

36:21.946 --> 36:24.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is squamous cell carcinoma.

36:24.115 --> 36:30.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And after we learned that the
cancer had metastasized,
we went to see some specialists.

36:30.088 --> 36:35.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I asked each of them how much
time I had left,
and that's when they told me,
you know, six

36:35.226 --> 36:38.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to nine months, months to a
year, a year-ish.

36:38.763 --> 36:45.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I started writing
again, and I felt
I had something to say that
might mean something

36:45.470 --> 36:50.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to other people because of the
lessons I was
learning facing death.

36:50.308 --> 36:56.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"The enormity of the news didn't
sink in fully,
not at first, even after my
doctor uttered

36:56.514 --> 37:00.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the words, 'I'm sorry, we did
find cancer.'

37:00.085 --> 37:07.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have turned my attention to
the question,
how do I best spend the time
that I have left?

37:07.058 --> 37:11.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My answer is writing, family and
friends,
the pleasures of small things.

37:11.963 --> 37:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was told, don't skip dessert,
so we don't.

37:15.800 --> 37:20.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have taken to getting up a
few early mornings
a week and driving out to see
the sunrise

37:20.138 --> 37:22.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over the flatlands of our mostly
rural county."

37:23.007 --> 37:24.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can't believe this.

37:24.342 --> 37:26.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is going to be a great day.

37:26.644 --> 37:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"I will take solace in the idea
that, once
gone, I may come to occupy a
small space in

37:32.817 --> 37:38.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the hearts of the people who
loved me most,
and perhaps from there, I will
be the source

37:38.790 --> 37:46.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a few simple reminders: Time
is limited,
life is miraculous, and we are
beautiful."

37:46.498 --> 37:47.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I always loved my life.

37:47.999 --> 37:53.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I felt very lucky, my meeting up
with Dave,
my love of my life, best friend.

37:53.471 --> 38:02.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, having cancer, it just made
me want my
life, but more so.

38:02.780 --> 38:05.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After that first piece was
published, we had
a breakthrough.

38:05.783 --> 38:08.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I started immunotherapy.

38:08.987 --> 38:15.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Dr. Algazi, who is our -- my
oncologist,
surprises us by showing up in
the infusion

38:15.460 --> 38:16.427 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
room.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he says, "I just talked to
the radiologist.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The neck tumor has vanished.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so have the other tumors."

38:23.201 --> 38:24.502 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

38:24.536 --> 38:25.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAIN ALGAZI, Skin Cancer
Specialist: My name
is Alain Algazi.

38:25.203 --> 38:26.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm an oncologist.

38:26.437 --> 38:29.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I specialize in head, neck
cancer, and melanoma.

38:29.707 --> 38:33.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I work at the University of
California, San
Francisco.

38:33.711 --> 38:36.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Melinda presented with squamous
cell cancer
in a lymph node.

38:36.514 --> 38:42.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was metastatic, but she was
diagnosed at
a time when we had access to
several new drugs.

38:42.253 --> 38:45.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those drugs turn the immune
cells back
on that are in the tumor, and
allow them to

38:45.423 --> 38:47.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fight more effectively against
the cancer.

38:47.659 --> 38:51.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, basically, they're taking
your native
immune response and enhancing
it.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we caused the tumors to
regress and go
away.

38:54.966 --> 39:00.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELINDA WELSH: I think it
actually took a
day or two to fully sink in that
my calendar

39:01.005 --> 39:02.974 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had expanded.

39:03.007 --> 39:10.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead of the coming demise
that we expected,
I was feeling fine, and the
cancer was retreating.

39:10.381 --> 39:15.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, on the anniversary of all
the doctors
giving me a year to live, it was
time to write

39:15.920 --> 39:17.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
part two.

39:17.722 --> 39:21.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"In the weeks that followed my
public coming
out about the grim news, a
benevolent tidal

39:21.559 --> 39:26.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wave of comments and e-mails
washed over me
from friends, co-workers and
many thousands

39:26.798 --> 39:28.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of strangers.

39:28.566 --> 39:33.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now when I run into friends on
the streets
of my town, they hug me and tell
me I look

39:33.471 --> 39:35.240 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
great.

39:35.273 --> 39:39.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I can see it in their eyes;
what they
really want to say is, aren't
you dead yet?

39:39.577 --> 39:41.346 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
"Well, no.

39:41.379 --> 39:46.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As it turns out, I became a
terminal cancer
patient at a time of sea change
in research

39:47.018 --> 39:48.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the disease.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.421 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What changed?

39:50.455 --> 39:55.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Immunotherapy, a new set of
medicines that
help patients like me use our
bodies' natural

39:55.293 --> 39:56.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
defenses to fight cancer."

39:56.794 --> 39:58.563 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

39:58.596 --> 40:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAIN ALGAZI: Basically, there
are brake pedals
on immune cells, so when you
turn off the

40:02.233 --> 40:05.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brake pedal, you allow the
immune system to
function, you allow it to fight.

40:05.436 --> 40:08.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the cancer is always
there, and
it's a battle between the immune
system and

40:08.840 --> 40:10.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the cancer.

40:10.541 --> 40:13.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELINDA WELSH: "Nobody knows how
long the
good news will last for me or
other cancer

40:13.411 --> 40:16.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
patients who are responding to
immunotherapy.

40:16.381 --> 40:22.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like me they probably feel a
miraculous gift
-- unanticipated time of unknown
duration

40:22.954 --> 40:25.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- has been dropped into their
laps."

40:25.156 --> 40:26.324 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

40:26.357 --> 40:28.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAIN ALGAZI: It's like working
for NASA in
the 1960s.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know, can you imagine?

40:30.928 --> 40:33.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That sense of discovery, that
sense that you're
changing the world, or at least
there while

40:33.798 --> 40:36.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world is changing, and
you're able to
really help.

40:36.301 --> 40:40.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELINDA WELSH: Unfortunately,
many people
have cancers that there's no
immunotherapy

40:40.805 --> 40:44.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for, they can't get access to
trials.

40:44.375 --> 40:45.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The drugs are very expensive.

40:45.977 --> 40:50.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, a lot of people who do
qualify for immunotherapy
simply don't respond.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

40:52.583 --> 40:56.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAIN ALGAZI: Melinda is, in a
sense, an example
of both the potential and the
limitation.

40:56.587 --> 40:59.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen so much progress
with her with
immune therapy.

40:59.891 --> 41:02.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But the cancer didn't go away.

41:02.260 --> 41:06.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we're trying to do is
increase the chances
that you're going to stay in
remission indefinitely.

41:06.898 --> 41:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A few years ago, she wouldn't
survive.

41:09.267 --> 41:11.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now she might survive.

41:11.102 --> 41:14.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't know what's going to
happen for certain,
but there's this enormous
potential.

41:14.405 --> 41:16.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MELINDA WELSH: We don't want to
hope for too
much.

41:16.341 --> 41:21.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't want to go into denial
that I have
got this deadly disease that's
trying to kill

41:21.446 --> 41:22.413 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

41:22.447 --> 41:23.681 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I do.

41:23.715 --> 41:26.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I'm making milestones that I
didn't think
I would make.

41:26.317 --> 41:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't think I would be alive
to reach my
60th birthday.

41:30.121 --> 41:34.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't think I would make it
to my 35th
wedding anniversary, which is
coming in April,

41:34.926 --> 41:36.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I'm assuming I will still be
here.

41:36.728 --> 41:38.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to live fully in the
present.

41:38.730 --> 41:44.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, just a little
bit of future
is awfully wonderful mixed in
with that.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.436 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

41:45.470 --> 41:47.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAIN ALGAZI: People come to me,
and they
have low expectations.

41:47.105 --> 41:48.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People think, I'm going to die.

41:48.973 --> 41:51.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my thought is, it doesn't
have to be that
way.

41:51.409 --> 41:56.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have now ways of keeping
people well, not
just for a few months, but for
potentially

41:56.547 --> 41:57.515 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

41:57.548 --> 41:59.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So this is a time of hope.

41:59.417 --> 42:03.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELINDA WELSH: "I am still
coming to terms
as best I can with my own
unequivocal transience.

42:03.287 --> 42:06.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But, no, I'm not dead yet.

42:06.991 --> 42:11.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When people are surprised to see
me, I tell
them I'm among the early
fortunate.

42:11.963 --> 42:16.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Facing death on a close horizon
has heightened
my awareness that our time on
Earth is finite.

42:16.734 --> 42:24.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But quite unexpectedly, it has
also made me
a living, breathing
advertisement for humanity's

42:24.575 --> 42:25.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hopeful new edge on cancer."

42:25.877 --> 42:29.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That was
Melinda Welsh with
her story.

42:29.113 --> 42:33.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's get a broader look at what
these treatments
may offer and their limits.

42:33.651 --> 42:36.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Bluestone is a leading
researcher
in this field.

42:36.053 --> 42:40.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is the president and CEO of
the Parker
Institute for Cancer
Immunotherapy.

42:40.224 --> 42:45.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's also a professor of
metabolism and endocrinology
at the University of California,
San Francisco,

42:45.363 --> 42:47.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
School of Medicine.

42:47.098 --> 42:51.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Matt Richtel is a science
writer who has
covered this extensively for The
New York

42:51.202 --> 42:53.104 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Times.

42:53.137 --> 42:55.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Bluestone, I want to start
with you before
all of our viewers start to call
their oncologists

42:55.706 --> 42:57.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if they're facing this.

42:57.608 --> 43:02.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is still not quite at the
phase where
we're seeing it effective in,
say, lung cancer,

43:02.313 --> 43:06.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and prostate cancer, and breast
cancer and
the major cancers that so many
people face.

43:06.451 --> 43:08.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BLUESTONE, CEO, Parker
Institute for
Cancer Immunotherapy: Well,
actually, we have

43:08.486 --> 43:11.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made a tremendous amount of
progress, for
instance, in lung cancer.

43:11.756 --> 43:17.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These so-called immune drugs,
these checkpoint
inhibiters, are now treating a
lot of non-small

43:17.728 --> 43:24.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cell lung cancers with great
success, in 30
to 40 to 50 percent response
rate, so very

43:24.302 --> 43:27.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
high, as in melanoma, as in some
head and
neck cancer.

43:27.305 --> 43:31.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, there are a lot of cancers
we still have
a long ways to go, but in some
of the cancers

43:31.375 --> 43:33.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you mentioned, we have actually
made tremendous
progress.

43:33.611 --> 43:35.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's great
to hear.

43:35.279 --> 43:37.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Matt Richtel, you have covered
this.

43:37.248 --> 43:41.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have chronicled people who
have fought
through their cancers, had this
sort of immunotherapy

43:41.652 --> 43:43.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
work, and also some who haven't.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What are some of the
shortcomings or limitations?

43:45.790 --> 43:47.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT RICHTEL, The New York
Times: Yes.

43:47.558 --> 43:52.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
First of all, that was a
marvelous piece that
captured just how remarkable
this science

43:52.430 --> 43:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is on the very edge of life and
death.

43:55.833 --> 43:57.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you have asked a great
question.

43:57.702 --> 44:04.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the answer is the very thing
that makes
this therapy so potentially
powerful or powerful

44:04.475 --> 44:07.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
also causes some challenges.

44:07.144 --> 44:08.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that is this.

44:08.946 --> 44:14.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you soup up or unleash the
immune system,
you have an opportunity to have
it attack

44:14.051 --> 44:16.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
healthy organs, healthy cells.

44:16.587 --> 44:22.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so sometimes you see very
challenging
stories where a cancer -- a
tumor will disappear,

44:23.027 --> 44:26.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but the person will become sick
with the equivalent
of an autoimmune disorder.

44:26.230 --> 44:31.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, we have with Dr.
Bluestone just
an amazing authority to probably
elaborate

44:31.869 --> 44:32.837 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on that.

44:32.870 --> 44:34.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mr. Bluestone,
go ahead.

44:34.772 --> 44:35.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BLUESTONE: Yes.

44:35.940 --> 44:38.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that what Matt said
is absolutely
true.

44:38.809 --> 44:41.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The immune system is an
incredibly powerful
force.

44:41.612 --> 44:45.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's designed to recognize
everything that
is foreign.

44:45.283 --> 44:49.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the process of doing
that, and when
you unleash it the way these new
drugs do,

44:49.487 --> 44:55.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can often, not that often,
rare compared
to the response rate get these
autoimmune

44:55.626 --> 44:57.395 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
diseases.

44:57.428 --> 45:00.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At UCSF, we have had several
cases in the
last couple years of patients
who developed

45:00.998 --> 45:06.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune
disease that
causes the destruction of your
insulin-producing

45:06.671 --> 45:08.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cells.

45:08.539 --> 45:12.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And trying to understand how to
control these
side effects is one of the key
areas for the

45:12.176 --> 45:15.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Parker Institute, at UCSF as
well.

45:15.279 --> 45:21.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the goal here is to have
this unleashing
of the immune system, which is
key to eliminating

45:21.485 --> 45:27.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the cancer, while moderating
this unwanted
attack on your own tissues.

45:27.792 --> 45:31.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Matt Richtel,
with all of
the different scientists that
you have spoken

45:31.262 --> 45:35.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to, where are we in this arc?

45:35.266 --> 45:38.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the people who have been
profiled
in your story say this is almost
like where

45:38.169 --> 45:40.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NASA engineers were in the '60s.

45:41.005 --> 45:42.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT RICHTEL: Yes.

45:42.573 --> 45:46.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I love that comparison, and I
have heard various
ones along the same lines.

45:46.811 --> 45:50.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can't tell you how wide the
breadth of potential
is.

45:50.448 --> 45:56.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's somewhere on the continuum
from, you
know, marvel of science to
change the world.

45:56.354 --> 45:59.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's what I mean, and then I
will answer
your question directly.

45:59.657 --> 46:05.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Absolutely, we are seeing at
least a marvel
of science, in that people who
were not previously

46:05.262 --> 46:08.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
savable from cancer are being
saved.

46:08.232 --> 46:10.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That alone is marvelous.

46:10.167 --> 46:14.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the change-the-world end of
the continuum,
we're certainly not there yet,
but the potential

46:14.872 --> 46:19.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exists to attack one of the
biggest killers
in the world.

46:19.944 --> 46:25.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have done away with a lot of
the low-hanging
fruit of what kills us through
things like

46:25.282 --> 46:27.051 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
antibiotics.

46:27.084 --> 46:32.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So now cancer, which many people
never survived
to even get, is the second
leading killer

46:32.089 --> 46:33.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this country.

46:33.658 --> 46:36.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It could change the world if
this hangs on.

46:36.627 --> 46:39.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why are we just still at the
beginnings of
that?

46:39.296 --> 46:43.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because, as Jeff -- as Dr.
Bluestone underscored
and as lots of scientists have
told me at

46:44.001 --> 46:51.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this point, we can't yet tell if
more people
will either suffer side effects
or relapse

46:51.842 --> 46:55.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ultimately than we know of now.

46:55.112 --> 46:59.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's so early on that we
just can't answer
that question and we probably
won't be able

46:59.650 --> 47:01.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to for a decade or so.

47:01.819 --> 47:05.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jeffrey
Bluestone, is that
about the right timeline?

47:05.956 --> 47:10.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are still those hurdles,
as we heard
in the piece, that the drugs are
still expensive,

47:10.227 --> 47:12.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that there are still lots of
nonresponsive
patients.

47:12.730 --> 47:16.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, as you mentioned, how
do you calibrate
the immune system per patient,
so that it

47:16.701 --> 47:20.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't kind of go overboard and
attack what
we need to survive?

47:20.037 --> 47:26.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BLUESTONE: Yes, we're
certainly at
absolutely the change inflection
point.

47:26.177 --> 47:29.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The world has changed for cancer
therapy with
immunotherapy.

47:29.647 --> 47:34.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's hard to even explain how
different this
approach is.

47:34.852 --> 47:40.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead of using poisons to kill
cancer or
to wipe out the cancer cell,
we're actually

47:40.658 --> 47:42.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
using our own body to do this.

47:43.027 --> 47:47.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, in this kind of
transformational science,
there's a lot to learn.

47:47.264 --> 47:49.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to learn, what are the
fundamental
rules?

47:49.867 --> 47:55.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have to learn how to
moderate the drugs
in a way that maximize the
efficacy and minimize

47:55.940 --> 47:57.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the toxicity.

47:57.742 --> 48:03.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I cannot imagine that, over
the next 10
years, we don't start see a
dramatic change

48:03.147 --> 48:06.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the long-term survival of
many of the patients
with many of the cancers.

48:06.617 --> 48:08.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have already seen it in
melanoma.

48:08.886 --> 48:13.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have gone from 5 percent
five-year survival
to 40 percent five-year
survival.

48:13.090 --> 48:14.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have seen it in certain lung
cancers.

48:14.725 --> 48:16.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, yes, we're right at the
beginning.

48:16.994 --> 48:21.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we're already seeing a
dramatic change
in a lot of these patients.

48:21.098 --> 48:25.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I believe this new science
-- and it truly
is -- bringing together the
science of the

48:25.703 --> 48:30.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immune system and immunology
with the science
of cancer in ways that we could
never have

48:30.708 --> 48:32.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
believed we would be at, at this
point.

48:33.010 --> 48:34.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, sure, I'm optimistic.

48:34.578 --> 48:36.313 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm excited.

48:36.347 --> 48:40.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm -- every day I go to work, I
just can't
believe we're in this world we
live in now.

48:40.684 --> 48:42.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

48:42.119 --> 48:44.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT RICHTEL: Could I just
underscore something
Dr. Bluestone said?

48:44.455 --> 48:46.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You mentioned I have chronicled
patients.

48:46.123 --> 48:49.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of them was a good high
school friend
named Jason Greenstein.

48:49.760 --> 48:54.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when Dr. Bluestone says
treatments have
changed, let me just tell you a
quick anecdote

48:54.532 --> 48:56.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that underscores how much.

48:56.934 --> 49:01.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over several years, this friend
of mine, Jason,
went through the traditional
chemotherapy.

49:01.172 --> 49:07.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it ate him alive, just as
chemotherapy
can do, because you're giving
someone toxins.

49:07.912 --> 49:14.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the course of literally
weeks when he
took an immunotherapy drug, you
could watch

49:14.185 --> 49:21.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what was like a pumpkin-sized
tumor in his
back disappear by the day in
picture after

49:21.225 --> 49:22.193 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
picture.

49:22.226 --> 49:24.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so that's the kind of
quantum leap.

49:24.128 --> 49:27.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, ultimately, he -- my friend
succumbed.

49:27.331 --> 49:31.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's the kind of quantum
change that
Dr. Bluestone is describing.

49:31.168 --> 49:34.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Matt Richtel
of The New York Times, Jeffrey
Bluestone of

49:34.305 --> 49:36.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UCSF and the Parker Institute,
thanks so much.

49:36.974 --> 49:40.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT RICHTEL: Thank you.

49:40.678 --> 49:47.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BLUESTONE: Thank you.

49:47.484 --> 49:53.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

49:53.891 --> 49:55.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

49:55.793 --> 50:00.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more than 60 years, British
researchers
have monitored changes in the
world's atmosphere

50:00.130 --> 50:02.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from a remote lab in Antarctica.

50:02.233 --> 50:06.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, for the first time ever,
this facility
will close, at least
temporarily, to protect

50:06.403 --> 50:08.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the safety of its residents.

50:08.138 --> 50:10.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Julia Griffin
explains.

50:10.341 --> 50:17.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: At the bottom of
our planet,
on top of more than 400 feet of
ice, sits

50:17.515 --> 50:20.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a state-of-the-art research
station called
Halley VI.

50:20.718 --> 50:23.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID VAUGHAN, Director of
Science, British
Antarctic Survey: It's an
extraordinary place

50:23.420 --> 50:29.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be, sitting in this, what
feels like a
large ship on the ice, looking
out across

50:29.460 --> 50:32.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the vast expanse of essentially
nothingness.

50:32.429 --> 50:37.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: David Vaughan is
director of
science for British Antarctic
Survey, which

50:37.835 --> 50:39.336 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
runs Halley VI.

50:39.370 --> 50:43.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID VAUGHAN: The science that
we do at Halley
isn't just about exploring.

50:43.474 --> 50:51.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's actually making
measurements that really
inform how we interact with our
planet, about

50:51.181 --> 50:57.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the risk of severe space weather
storms that
might knock out our satellite
GPS systems.

50:57.054 --> 51:03.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about looking at the
emissions of carbon
dioxide and methane at the last
place on Earth

51:03.327 --> 51:05.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that is seeing those emissions.

51:05.129 --> 51:10.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: To do that,
Halley VI is a
feat of engineering in one of
the most extreme

51:10.501 --> 51:12.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
environments.

51:12.336 --> 51:19.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its eight interlocking pods
shield up to 70
researchers and support staff
from freezing.

51:19.743 --> 51:25.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special hydraulic legs lift the
pods as snow
accumulates, and when the time
comes, the

51:25.582 --> 51:28.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pods can be towed on their
ski-like feet.

51:28.252 --> 51:31.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID VAUGHAN: The ice shelf
itself moves.

51:31.221 --> 51:36.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if we're going to maintain
the same geographical
position, we have to be able to
move across

51:36.627 --> 51:37.761 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the ice.

51:37.795 --> 51:40.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Another reason
they might want
to move?

51:40.331 --> 51:44.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Should that ice shelf threaten
to become an
iceberg.

51:44.501 --> 51:50.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This summer -- yes, it's summer
in the Southern
Hemisphere -- Halley VI was
already being

51:50.207 --> 51:58.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
towed 15 miles inland to avoid
this decades-old
chasm, when a new, nearly
30-mile-long crack

51:58.716 --> 52:01.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opened suddenly on its other
side.

52:01.385 --> 52:05.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID VAUGHAN: The crack that
you are seeing
goes all the way down to the
ocean.

52:05.089 --> 52:09.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you can look deep enough
in there,
you would see seawater.

52:09.460 --> 52:15.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Really, the potential
interaction between
those two cracks and how then
the ice shelf

52:15.566 --> 52:18.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would respond as a whole, that
we actually
find very unpredictable.

52:18.669 --> 52:24.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: The agency has
decided to vacate
the station altogether before
winter.

52:24.875 --> 52:31.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID VAUGHAN: In the summer, we
have the
opportunity to remove people
relatively rapidly

52:31.248 --> 52:35.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the station, but, during
the winter,
when it is cold and dark and
stormy for many

52:35.953 --> 52:40.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months at a time, that's the
point at which
we would find it quite hard to
get people

52:40.357 --> 52:42.092 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

52:42.126 --> 52:44.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: While other ice
shelves on
the Antarctic Peninsula have
been impacted

52:44.428 --> 52:48.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by climate change, Vaughan
thinks this might
be part of a natural cycle.

52:48.298 --> 52:53.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID VAUGHAN: Maybe the ice
shelf will go
back to a new equilibrium in
time, but, at

52:53.670 --> 52:58.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the moment, we just can't
predict with any
certainty how long that will
take.

52:58.675 --> 53:04.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: This marks the
first time scientists
will be removed from a Halley
station.

53:04.314 --> 53:08.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
British Antarctic Survey hopes
they will return
next November.

53:08.819 --> 53:12.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
