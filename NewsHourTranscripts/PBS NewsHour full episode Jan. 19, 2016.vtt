JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:03.203 --> 00:05.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
U.S. Supreme
Court will take up a challenge
to President

00:05.138 --> 00:06.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama's immigration orders,
which shield more
than four million immigrants
from deportation.

00:06.974 --> 00:07.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then, we will get a
behind-the-scenes look
at the Iran prisoner swap from
Brett McGurk,

00:07.674 --> 00:09.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the lead American negotiator.

00:09.509 --> 00:10.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the first in our series on
Understanding
Autism, a history of how it was
discovered,

00:10.377 --> 00:12.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and why it may be more prevalent
today.

00:12.079 --> 00:13.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVE SILBERMAN, Author,
"NeuroTribes": I
spoke to older parents who had
been told by

00:13.814 --> 00:14.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their psychiatrists to quietly
remove the
pictures of their children from
the family

00:14.681 --> 00:15.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
album and never speak of them
again.

00:15.949 --> 00:16.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:16.250 --> 00:18.085 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:18.118 --> 00:19.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. Supreme
Court has
set the stage for a major
election-year decision

00:19.920 --> 00:21.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on immigration policy. The
justices announced
today they will consider whether
President

00:21.755 --> 00:22.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama overstepped his authority
when he allowed
millions of people to avoid
deportation. We

00:22.990 --> 00:24.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will explore this in full right
after the
news summary.

00:24.992 --> 00:26.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's word that three
Americans who disappeared
in Baghdad last week were
kidnapped by a Shiite

00:26.793 --> 00:32.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
militia. Reuters reported that
today, citing
Iraqi and U.S. sources. It said
the group

00:32.065 --> 00:37.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is backed by Iran, but that U.S.
officials
don't think Iran's government
was involved

00:37.404 --> 00:39.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the abduction.

00:39.439 --> 00:43.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi civilians are being killed
at a -- quote
-- "staggering rate" since the
rise of the

00:44.011 --> 00:52.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Islamic State group. A U.N.
report now says
that at least 18,800 Iraqis died
from violence

00:52.219 --> 00:55.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between the start of 2014 and
last October.

00:55.355 --> 01:01.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in Geneva, the U.N. human
rights office
said today the toll is even
higher when you

01:01.128 --> 01:02.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
count other factors.

01:03.030 --> 01:04.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAVINA SHAMSADANI, Spokeswoman,
United Nations
High Commissioner for Human
Rights: It doesn't

01:04.898 --> 01:08.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
include those people who have
died as a result
of malnutrition, as a result of
lack of access

01:08.802 --> 01:14.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to medical care, and as a result
of lack of
access to the basic facilities
that they need

01:14.841 --> 01:18.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the vulnerable population,
for people
with disabilities, for the
elderly. So, this

01:18.612 --> 01:20.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is really the tip of the
iceberg.

01:20.514 --> 01:26.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.N. agency
also said that
Islamic State militants are
holding some 3,500

01:26.086 --> 01:30.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iraqis as slaves, many of them
women and children.

01:30.157 --> 01:35.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In economic news, China
announced today that
its economy met fourth-quarter
projections,

01:35.495 --> 01:42.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but, for the year, it grew at
the lowest rate
since 1990, 6.9 percent. In
turn, the International

01:42.803 --> 01:48.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Monetary Fund announced in
London that it's
revising its global forecast
down again.

01:48.875 --> 01:53.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAURICE OBSTFELD, International
Monetary Fund:
Turbulence in financial markets
has returned

01:53.046 --> 01:58.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amid renewed concern about risks
to global
economic growth. China's slower
growth and

01:58.318 --> 02:04.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rising financial market risks,
the fall in
commodity prices, notably the
price of oil,

02:04.458 --> 02:11.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and asynchronous trends in
monetary policy
mainly between the U.S. and most
other advanced

02:12.032 --> 02:13.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
economies.

02:13.834 --> 02:17.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will take a
closer look
at the Chinese economy later in
the program.

02:17.371 --> 02:23.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New estimates have growth in the
U.S. slowing,
too, as federal deficits start
rising again.

02:23.977 --> 02:28.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Congressional Budget Office
said today
that it expects this year's
deficit will top

02:28.081 --> 02:35.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$540 billion, $100 billion more
than last
year. The main cause is
Congress' recent decision

02:35.522 --> 02:41.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make a number of tax cuts
permanent and
to increase spending. At the
same time, the

02:41.128 --> 02:47.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economy will grow 2.7 percent,
down from an
earlier estimate.

02:47.534 --> 02:52.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the presidential race,
Republican Donald
Trump has won the backing of
former Alaska

02:52.706 --> 02:59.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor Sarah Palin. She was
the party's
vice presidential nominee in
2008, and has

02:59.046 --> 03:02.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since become a major voice in
the Tea Party
movement.

03:03.016 --> 03:09.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street struggled today.
The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 28
points to close

03:09.489 --> 03:17.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at 16016. The Nasdaq was down 11
points, and
the S&amp;P 500 added just one
point.

03:17.898 --> 03:22.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the Supreme
Court to review President
Obama's actions

03:22.536 --> 03:29.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to block deportations; the lead
U.S. negotiator
on the Iranian prisoner swap;
dark clouds

03:29.976 --> 03:40.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the horizon for the global
economy; and
much more.

03:40.020 --> 03:46.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the horizon for the global
economy; and
much more.

03:46.693 --> 03:51.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's official: The Supreme Court
will hear
a case this term that could
decide the fate

03:51.798 --> 03:57.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of one of President Obama's
major immigration
moves. It would defer
deportation for more

03:57.604 --> 04:04.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than four million undocumented
immigrants
and permit them to work legally
in the U.S.

04:04.411 --> 04:09.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lower courts have sided with the
26 states
that sued the federal government
over the

04:09.316 --> 04:13.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
program, and those courts have
put the program
on ice for now.

04:13.787 --> 04:18.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the White House said today
the administration
is confident the high court will
rule in its

04:18.992 --> 04:20.827 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
favor.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
The kinds of executive actions
that the president

04:22.796 --> 04:28.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took a little over a year ago
now to try to
bring some much-needed reforms
and greater

04:28.101 --> 04:33.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accountability to our broken
immigration system
were clearly consistent with the
precedent

04:33.340 --> 04:38.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was established by other
presidents,
and clearly within the confines
of his authority

04:38.545 --> 04:40.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as president of the United
States.

04:40.347 --> 04:45.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But that is the
issue that
26 states dispute. Texas is one
of those states,

04:45.852 --> 04:50.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and its attorney general, Ken
Paxton, said
today in a statement -- quote --
"There are

04:50.423 --> 04:56.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
limits to the president's
authority, and those
limits enacted by Congress were
exceeded when

04:56.096 --> 05:01.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president unilaterally
sought to grant
lawful presence to more than
four million

05:01.801 --> 05:05.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unauthorized aliens who are in
this country
unlawfully."

05:05.906 --> 05:10.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the case, we turn to
our regular,
Marcia Coyle of "The National
Law Journal."

05:10.644 --> 05:12.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And, Marcia, welcome.

05:12.078 --> 05:13.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Judy, thank you.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, some
background first.
This order the president made
has been challenged

05:17.551 --> 05:19.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
almost from the very beginning,
hasn't it?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: It was.

05:21.021 --> 05:28.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The executive action came in
November of 2014.
Less than a month later, 26
Republican-led

05:28.662 --> 05:30.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
states challenged it in federal
district court.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what was the
basis?

05:32.666 --> 05:38.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: The states are
making a number
of claims here. One, they claim
that the action

05:38.605 --> 05:44.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
violates the take care clause of
the federal
Constitution. That's in Article
2, Section

05:45.011 --> 05:52.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
3 of the Constitution. And it
says the president
must enforce -- I'm sorry --
must faithfully

05:52.052 --> 05:53.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
enforce the laws.

05:53.920 --> 06:01.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also claim that his action
is arbitrary
and capricious, his action
violates the notice

06:01.228 --> 06:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and public comment requirement
of the Administrative
Procedure Act. That's a law that
governs how

06:07.234 --> 06:10.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agencies go about making rules
and regulations.

06:10.203 --> 06:15.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know the
justices
don't ever, I guess, give a
reason for taking

06:15.609 --> 06:19.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up a case, but why is it thought
that they're
doing this?

06:19.613 --> 06:24.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, I think it
was understood
that they probably would take
this case. You

06:24.851 --> 06:32.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a federal court, a federal
appellate
court blocking a major federal
government

06:32.359 --> 06:34.160 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

06:34.194 --> 06:38.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The top lawyer for the
administration in the
Supreme Court, the solicitor
general of the

06:38.198 --> 06:43.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States, went to the
Supreme Court after
the injunction was issued and
said, please

06:43.570 --> 06:47.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
take this case and resolve these
legal questions.

06:47.307 --> 06:50.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it was a given that
the court
would step into it.

06:50.076 --> 06:55.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you mentioned
that this
is -- they're looking at the
take care clause,

06:55.115 --> 07:00.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which I read today hasn't -- is
something
the court hasn't done in 70
years. So, this

07:00.320 --> 07:02.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has historic consequences,
presumably.

07:02.656 --> 07:07.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: It has potentially
major consequences.

07:07.427 --> 07:14.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The take care clause really will
go to the
relationship between the
executive branch

07:14.167 --> 07:19.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Congress. So, what the court
says, if
it deals with it, and it doesn't
have to -- even

07:19.706 --> 07:25.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
though it has asked the parties
to address
it, it could rule narrowly or
address the

07:25.178 --> 07:26.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
take care clause.

07:26.946 --> 07:32.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But whatever the court says
could affect all
kinds of executive actions that
the White

07:32.452 --> 07:38.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
House would take beyond
immigration. So, that's
a potentially very broad
question. Also, there's

07:38.825 --> 07:43.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very important threshold
issue, and that
is whether Texas even had the
right to sue

07:43.563 --> 07:45.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

07:45.332 --> 07:51.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration claims
it didn't
have the kind of concrete injury
this -- that

07:51.504 --> 07:57.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is required for standing to sue.
This action,
the government says, doesn't
require Texas

07:57.377 --> 08:03.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to do anything or not do
anything. However,
the lower court said Texas would
have the

08:03.083 --> 08:08.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
cost of issuing driver's
license, which is
under Texas law, and that was
the injury to

08:08.822 --> 08:10.557 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Texas.

08:10.590 --> 08:15.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marcia, it's also
clear from
the reading of this that the
court added the

08:15.061 --> 08:19.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
threshold of constitutionality
to what they're
looking at. What's the
significance of that?

08:19.833 --> 08:26.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: The take care
clause question
was in the lawsuit to begin
with. Texas had

08:26.573 --> 08:28.341 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
raised that.

08:28.375 --> 08:35.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It may be that the justices want
to get all
of the issues out on the table
when they sit

08:35.048 --> 08:40.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down to finally make a decision.
It may be
that certain justices were
interested in the

08:40.253 --> 08:46.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take care clause issue. Or it
may be that
certain justices had read a
"Harvard Law Journal"

08:46.526 --> 08:54.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
article by a former clerk and
current presidential
candidate, guess who, who wrote
all about

08:54.434 --> 09:01.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the take care clause and talked
in that article
about the egregious overreaching
by the Obama

09:01.441 --> 09:03.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
administration on immigration
and other issues.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you were
telling me this
is Senator Ted Cruz...

09:05.845 --> 09:07.080 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's correct.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... who has, of
course, a legal
background.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: I do think it's
the least -- that's
the least likely reason they
took the case,

09:12.185 --> 09:18.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but since this is becoming a
very political
kind of case, he did write about
it.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And presumably
not a coincidence.

09:20.326 --> 09:22.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But on the timing of it, it is
an election
year.

09:23.029 --> 09:24.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Yes.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about the
timetable for
the court deciding?

09:26.332 --> 09:30.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: The court will
probably hear
the arguments in April, and
there would probably

09:30.470 --> 09:35.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be a decision by the end of
June. That's the
regular schedule at the court.

09:35.442 --> 09:40.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there is a decision in June,
as you well
know and we all know, that's in
the middle

09:40.146 --> 09:46.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the election cycle, and
immigration is
already a huge, contentious
issue. The court

09:46.319 --> 09:50.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
itself now becomes a player in
that very contentious
debate.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marcia Coyle, we
thank you.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure, Judy.

09:54.928 --> 10:01.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now, for two
opposing perspectives
on this case, Marielena is the
executive director

10:01.734 --> 10:07.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the National Immigration Law
Center. And
Josh Blackman is associate
professor of law

10:07.540 --> 10:12.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the South Texas College of
Law. Both of
them have followed this case
closely as it

10:12.178 --> 10:14.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moved up through the federal
courts.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the program.

10:17.050 --> 10:22.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marielena Hincapie, let me start
with you.
Is this something you welcome or
you worry

10:22.222 --> 10:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about, that the court is finally
taking this
up?

10:24.290 --> 10:26.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE, Executive
Director, National
Immigration Law Center: Thanks,
Judy.

10:26.092 --> 10:31.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We definitely welcome this
decision. We're
very delighted that the court
decided to hear

10:31.097 --> 10:38.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this case, because it has the
potential life-changing
impact on over four million
parents of U.S.

10:38.505 --> 10:43.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizen children. And, most
importantly, it
really has the ability to bring
much-needed

10:43.209 --> 10:48.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stability to five million U.S.
citizen children
whose parents would benefit from
these programs.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, definitely, this is a
welcome day.

10:49.983 --> 10:54.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Josh Blackman,
posing the same
question to you, is this
something you look

10:54.120 --> 10:56.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
forward to or are you concerned?

10:56.055 --> 10:58.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BLACKMAN, Constitutional
Law Professor,
South Texas College of Law:
Well, the separation

10:58.625 --> 11:01.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of power dispute between the
president and
Congress is fairly rare.

11:01.594 --> 11:05.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I think it's quite
significant, as my
good friend Marcia mentioned a
moment ago,

11:05.164 --> 11:09.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the court chose to address
the take care
clause issue. She mentioned this
hasn't been

11:09.569 --> 11:13.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reversed in 70 years. I actually
went back
to look at the briefs for this
-- the seizure

11:13.473 --> 11:17.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case, the Youngstown case from
1954. It barely
mentioned the take care clause
there either.

11:17.977 --> 11:22.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, by my cursory research, this
may be first
time the court has ever asked
for briefings

11:22.982 --> 11:27.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the take care clause. And to
make the point
a little bit more clearly, they
didn't add

11:27.720 --> 11:32.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this case -- this question just
to tie up
loose ends. Even if the court
rules in favor

11:32.825 --> 11:36.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Obama administration on
administrative
grounds, that still leaves the
constitutional

11:36.529 --> 11:38.331 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
issue lingering.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they really need to resolve
this question
once and for all, so that Texas
doesn't just

11:41.034 --> 11:46.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sue right back in the same court
once the
president goes through the
proper administrative

11:46.139 --> 11:47.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
channels.

11:47.974 --> 11:53.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marielena
Hincapie, is -- how
strong is the argument from the
administration

11:54.013 --> 12:00.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the president was acting
within the constitutional
-- his constitutional role when
he issued

12:00.787 --> 12:07.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this order saying that these
four million-plus
immigrants may not be deported?

12:07.060 --> 12:11.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: Yes, Judy,
the legal precedent
is pretty well-established, and
the majority

12:11.965 --> 12:15.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of legal scholars agree with the
administration,
as do we at the National
Immigration Law Center.

12:16.002 --> 12:21.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as Marcia mentioned,
there's historical
precedent as well. Both
Republican and Democratic

12:21.341 --> 12:25.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administrations, every single
administration
since President Eisenhower, has
exercised

12:25.545 --> 12:27.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very similar executive actions.

12:27.914 --> 12:33.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think the administration
knew what it
was doing. It took its time. And
it acted

12:33.119 --> 12:35.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both on historical and strong
solid legal
ground.

12:35.688 --> 12:39.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In that case,
Josh Blackman,
then what is it that the states
-- what is

12:39.993 --> 12:45.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the strongest argument that
these 26 states
have in saying the president
overstepped his

12:45.565 --> 12:47.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bounds?

12:47.367 --> 12:49.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BLACKMAN: Well, with
respect to my good
friend Marielena, we have done
this a few

12:49.102 --> 12:51.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
times before, I don't think the
precedents
going back to Eisenhower are
that clear.

12:51.938 --> 12:56.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To give you an example, deferred
action has
often been used as a bring to
get a person

12:56.509 --> 13:00.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from one status to another. So,
for example,
if you were a student at Tulane
University

13:00.780 --> 13:05.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New Orleans, Hurricane
Katrina hits, you're
a foreign student, you just lost
your status.

13:05.284 --> 13:09.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Bush used deferred
action to bridge
you from when you had a status
and you lost

13:09.088 --> 13:12.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, and said, if you get another
degree and
you enroll at another university
in a few

13:12.625 --> 13:14.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
months, you can keep your
status.

13:14.961 --> 13:18.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Deferred action has been used on
a case-by-case
basis. What's frankly
unprecedented about

13:18.731 --> 13:23.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president's action is the
size and scale
that has been done. On a scale
of five million

13:23.636 --> 13:27.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, you have a standard
that's very, very
vague that basically everyone
who applies

13:27.240 --> 13:29.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will be granted for it.

13:29.042 --> 13:32.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no precedent to justify
this scope
of executive power and granting
deferred access

13:32.779 --> 13:34.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to so many aliens.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marielena
Hincapie, you're
shaking your head.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: Yes,
absolutely not.

13:38.117 --> 13:43.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Josh -- Josh knows this.
Deferred
action is adjudicated on a
case-by-case basis.

13:43.289 --> 13:47.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is nothing that the
administration is
saying that there is absolutely
categorical

13:47.894 --> 13:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eligibility and approval for.
Individuals
will have to come forward
voluntarily. A parent

13:53.733 --> 13:58.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a U.S. citizen will need to
make that risk
and benefit -- cost-benefit
analysis of coming

13:58.438 --> 14:02.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
forward to the federal
government, paying
a fine, going through a national
security

14:02.975 --> 14:07.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and criminal background check,
and then providing
the evidence that they meet the
criteria.

14:07.714 --> 14:11.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An individual agent from the
U.S. Citizenship
and -- Citizenship and
Immigration Services

14:11.884 --> 14:17.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will determine whether that
individual is
eligible or not or deny them.
So, this isn't

14:17.490 --> 14:21.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- this is exactly what the
president did
in 2012 with the deferred action
for childhood

14:21.394 --> 14:26.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
arrivals, for example.
Interestingly, Texas
and 25 states didn't sue the
president over

14:26.099 --> 14:27.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DACA.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that,
Josh Blackman?

14:28.634 --> 14:33.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BLACKMAN: So, the grant
rate for the
2012 program was over 97
percent.

14:33.239 --> 14:36.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government has not been able
to find a
single instance where a person
was denied

14:36.142 --> 14:41.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for discretionary reasons, not
one (INAUDIBLE)
two years. They could not find a
single instance

14:41.047 --> 14:45.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where a person was denied DACA,
the 2012 program,
for discretionary reasons.

14:45.051 --> 14:49.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the government wants to hedge
its case
on how discretionary DACA was, I
think they're

14:49.355 --> 14:54.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to lose. The broader issue
is that this
is not really a case about Texas
vs. the United

14:54.694 --> 14:58.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States. As Marcia mentioned,
this is a case
about Congress vs. the United
States. The

14:58.865 --> 15:02.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president has decided he didn't
like the law
Congress gave him. Congress
didn't vote for

15:02.101 --> 15:06.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the law he wanted, so he decided
to achieve
as much as possible that he
could.

15:06.172 --> 15:11.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one point I would like to
stress is, even
if this decision is rendered in
July of 2016,

15:11.277 --> 15:15.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama cannot possibly
execute this
on his watch. This will fall to
the next president

15:15.281 --> 15:18.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to actually implement. So, in
many respects,
it doesn't matter what the court
does here,

15:18.818 --> 15:20.653 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

15:20.686 --> 15:24.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the court rules for Texas,
then the issue
is over. If the court rules for
the president,

15:24.991 --> 15:28.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then the next presidential
election will continue
it, because a Republican
president will not

15:28.094 --> 15:32.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continue this policy, and a
Democratic president
will, and maybe achieve
legislative reform.

15:32.365 --> 15:36.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, no matter what happens in
July, this will
be a matter for the American
people to vote

15:36.469 --> 15:38.104 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

15:38.137 --> 15:41.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marielena
Hincapie, do you
agree that either way it's
something that

15:41.474 --> 15:43.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is going to be up to the public?

15:43.476 --> 15:45.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: Definitely.

15:45.311 --> 15:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think I disagree with Josh in
terms of the
implementation of it. The
administration was

15:48.447 --> 15:54.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ready to start implementing the
expansion
of DACA the day after Judge
Hanen issued his

15:54.086 --> 15:58.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decision and it was blocked, so
they will
be able to start implementing
that very quickly.

15:58.724 --> 16:02.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then with DACA, it will
probably take,
I don't know, weeks, maybe a
couple of months.

16:03.029 --> 16:09.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think that this is
going to be part
of the thinking of U.S. citizens
who have

16:09.669 --> 16:13.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigrant family members. U.S.
citizens will
go to the ballot and they will
vote for their

16:13.706 --> 16:18.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family's interest. They will
vote for a president
that will continue President
Obama's executive

16:18.878 --> 16:22.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actions, especially if they are
given the
green light by the Supreme
Court.

16:22.915 --> 16:27.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Watching it
closely. We thank
both of you, Josh Blackman,
Marielena Hincapie.

16:27.119 --> 16:27.954 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

16:27.987 --> 16:28.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: Thank you,
Judy.

16:29.021 --> 16:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSH BLACKMAN: Thank you.

16:34.894 --> 16:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For the past 14
months, a small
team of Americans from the State
Department

16:49.542 --> 16:55.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and other agencies met in secret
with Iranian
negotiators. And the two sides
eventually

16:55.147 --> 17:00.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worked out a deal to release
prisoners Iran
was holding and grant a pardon
to individuals

17:00.820 --> 17:02.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
charged in the U.S.

17:02.355 --> 17:09.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, we heard for the first
time from one
of five Americans released.

17:09.262 --> 17:16.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati
emerged today
in Landstuhl, Germany, and said
he feels born

17:16.135 --> 17:17.870 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIR HEKMATI, Freed Prisoner: I
was at the
point where I had just sort of
accepted the

17:19.805 --> 17:26.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact that I was going to be
spending 10 years
in prison. So, this was a
surprise, and I

17:26.045 --> 17:30.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just feel extremely blessed to
see my government
do so much for me and the other
Americans.

17:30.316 --> 17:35.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hekmati is being
evaluated
at a U.S. military hospital,
along with a

17:35.855 --> 17:42.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christian minister, Saeed
Abedini, and Washington
Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who
was seen

17:42.962 --> 17:47.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the first time today with
his wife in
video from The Post.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was reported their release
was delayed
Sunday, when Iranian officials
blocked Rezaian's

17:54.106 --> 18:00.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wife and mother from boarding a
plane in Tehran.
The New York Times said
Secretary of State

18:00.246 --> 18:04.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Kerry had to make a phone
call to put
the exchange back on course.

18:04.984 --> 18:09.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIR HEKMATI: As soon as we got
out of Iranian
airspace, the champagne bottles
were popped.

18:10.022 --> 18:13.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Swiss are amazing, their
hospitality,
chocolates. Veal was served.

18:13.893 --> 18:17.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to be
resolved, the fate
of American Robert

18:17.430 --> 18:22.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Levinson, who disappeared from a
resort in
Iran nearly nine years ago.

18:22.902 --> 18:29.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Iranians, too, are
celebrating,
as international economic
sanctions end under

18:29.241 --> 18:35.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the terms of the nuclear deal.
But Iran's
supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, made

18:35.414 --> 18:39.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
clear today he remains
suspicious of U.S.
intentions.

18:39.819 --> 18:45.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a letter to President Hassan
Rouhani, he
said: "I reiterate the need to
be vigilant

18:45.725 --> 18:51.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the deceit and treachery
of arrogant
countries, especially the United
States, in

18:51.664 --> 18:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this nuclear issue and other
issues."

18:54.600 --> 19:00.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, White House
Press Secretary
Josh Earnest pointed to the
nuclear deal and

19:00.172 --> 19:06.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the prisoner release as examples
of principled
diplomacy. It's now clear that
the prisoner

19:06.312 --> 19:12.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
swap negotiations proceeded on a
secret and
separate track from the nuclear
talks.

19:12.785 --> 19:18.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The effort was led by Brett
McGurk, special
presidential envoy on fighting
the Islamic

19:18.824 --> 19:20.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
State group since 2015.

19:20.926 --> 19:26.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I sat down with McGurk earlier
today, and
began by asking him what it was
like to be

19:26.932 --> 19:31.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first to see the released
Iranian-Americans
on the plane when they landed in
Geneva.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRETT MCGURK, Special
Presidential Envoy for
the Global Coalition to Counter
ISIL: It was

19:34.740 --> 19:37.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just overwhelming. That's really
the only
word that I can use.

19:37.076 --> 19:42.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been working on this in
secret for
14 months, and I have been in
regular contact

19:42.615 --> 19:48.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the families. It was an
incredibly difficult
process. Until the last moment
that the plane

19:48.220 --> 19:54.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
took off from Tehran and
actually left Iranian
airspace, you never really knew.

19:54.060 --> 20:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The night before, we had an
episode in which
Jason Rezaian's mother and his
wife could

20:00.599 --> 20:07.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not be located. We finally
located Mary Rezaian,
Jason's mother, at about 4:00
a.m. Geneva

20:07.706 --> 20:11.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, very early morning in
Tehran time. I
spoke with her on the phone and
told her to

20:11.410 --> 20:14.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stay where she was. We worked
with the Swiss
to pick her up.

20:14.713 --> 20:20.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But until they were on the plane
and actually
left Iranian airspace, nothing
was really

20:20.186 --> 20:26.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certain. So, in Geneva, when
they landed,
I -- they were greeted by the
Swiss state

20:26.425 --> 20:29.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secretary, because Switzerland,
the Swiss
government was critical for this
entire thing.

20:29.595 --> 20:35.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I got on the plane and
welcomed them out
of Iran, told them that your
country, the

20:36.001 --> 20:39.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States, is going to do
everything we
possibly can for you and can't
wait to get

20:39.405 --> 20:41.240 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you hope.

20:41.273 --> 20:48.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was just an incredibly
emotional moment.
I honestly will never forget it.
And to see

20:48.080 --> 20:53.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them all together, it's hard to
even put it
into words.

20:53.385 --> 20:57.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How difficult was
this process?
I mean, some people have looked
at this and

20:57.823 --> 21:02.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, well, the Iranians really
were planning
to release them all along, but
they just weren't

21:02.094 --> 21:03.095 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to say so.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRETT MCGURK: Well, not quite.

21:05.264 --> 21:10.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hekmati was sentenced to death
in 2011. And
Amir Hekmati's sentence was
later reduced,

21:10.803 --> 21:16.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but he was going to be in prison
through about
2022. Saeed Abedini was
sentenced in 2012

21:16.041 --> 21:20.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and he was serving a prison term
until 2021.

21:20.312 --> 21:23.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jason Rezaian had not been
sentenced yet,
but he had been imprisoned for
18 months,

21:23.849 --> 21:27.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the sentence that he was
facing -- his
trial had already been over --
was going to

21:27.419 --> 21:30.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be in a period of decades at
least.

21:30.389 --> 21:34.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I completely disagree.
It's contrary
to all the information that we
have. And I

21:34.093 --> 21:37.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think, had we not been able to
find a way
forward here, I think these
Americans were

21:37.596 --> 21:42.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking at a very substantial,
many, many
years in Evin prison.

21:42.234 --> 21:47.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why do you think
you were successful?
What were the forces inside Iran
that made

21:47.106 --> 21:49.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this work, working with you?

21:49.041 --> 21:55.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRETT MCGURK: This process came
out of the
nuclear negotiation, but in the
nuclear negotiations,

21:55.181 --> 21:59.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primarily, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs
and some other elements of the
Iranian system

21:59.351 --> 22:03.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that don't have the
decision-making authority
over the security apparatus and
the people

22:03.989 --> 22:06.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that actually hold the keys to
the prison
cells.

22:06.392 --> 22:12.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we had to open up a parallel
track and
begin negotiations with those
elements of

22:12.431 --> 22:19.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Iranian system, who we have
really not
had any engagement with. And so
one reason

22:19.171 --> 22:23.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it took a long time is that this
was the first
substantial engagement we really
ever had

22:23.275 --> 22:25.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with that element of the system.

22:25.444 --> 22:29.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think my Iranian counterpart,
it's safe
to say I may have been first
American they

22:29.048 --> 22:37.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have really ever met. And for
many months,
it was just a lot of back and
forth about

22:37.156 --> 22:41.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
historical narratives and
competing visions
of what has actually happened
between our

22:41.627 --> 22:45.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two countries. And, of course,
we didn't give
any ground about their history
of hostage-taking

22:45.497 --> 22:50.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and support for terrorism, and
they would
go through their narrative.

22:50.402 --> 22:55.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eventually, I said, look, we
could do this
for months, or we can decide
whether there

22:55.574 --> 23:00.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is a way to actually get
something done. We
wanted our American citizens
home, period.

23:00.045 --> 23:04.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why we were there. And if
there was
no way to talk about
practicalities of how

23:04.416 --> 23:06.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do that, there was no reason
to have a
discussion.

23:06.819 --> 23:12.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, eventually, really after
the nuclear
agreement came to fruition,
things started

23:12.424 --> 23:14.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to accelerate a little bit.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Who were these
people you were
dealing with, and are they the
people who

23:17.029 --> 23:22.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. can do business with in
the future
and get productive things done
with in the

23:22.601 --> 23:23.535 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future?

23:23.569 --> 23:25.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRETT MCGURK: I mean, we will
have to see.

23:25.371 --> 23:29.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was so tough. And even in
the last 72
hours, it was literally some
real shouting

23:29.608 --> 23:36.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
matches. And we did this all
bilaterally,
but the Swiss were always there,
and sometimes

23:36.315 --> 23:41.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we would bring the Swiss in to
mediate, because
it's just incredibly difficult.

23:41.453 --> 23:47.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have agreed to have a
process, a channel,
a consular channel to continue
discussions,

23:47.726 --> 23:52.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should that be necessary. The
case of Robert
Levinson, of course, was the
topic of conversation

23:52.731 --> 23:57.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every single round. As we said
in 2011, we
have to reason to believe he's
not being held

23:57.636 --> 23:59.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Iran, so it's a different
case.

23:59.705 --> 24:08.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There is another
American -- Iranian-American
still being held, Mr. Namazi.
How cruel is

24:08.147 --> 24:11.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it to leave them behind and let
these others
-- other five out?

24:11.550 --> 24:15.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRETT MCGURK: Any other cases, I
can't really
discuss in detail, for privacy
reasons and

24:15.587 --> 24:20.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things, but I would just say
we're going to
continue to work, work this
every day.

24:20.159 --> 24:23.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In terms of what
happened,
there are critics in this
country who are

24:23.996 --> 24:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying this swap should never
have happened,
that these people were -- should
never have

24:29.001 --> 24:33.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been held in the first place and
the U.S.
shouldn't have done anything in
return to

24:33.372 --> 24:35.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
win their release.

24:35.240 --> 24:40.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRETT MCGURK: I think the
reality is, if you
take that position, then Jason
Rezaian should

24:41.013 --> 24:44.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have stayed in Evin prison for
decades. Amir
Hekmati would have been in
prison through

24:44.850 --> 24:48.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2022, and Saeed Abedini until
about the same
time.

24:48.987 --> 24:53.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that was the reality that you
face. There
was no way to simply say, they
have to be

24:53.892 --> 24:56.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
released, release them. Of
course, they're
wrongfully detained, and we have
made that

24:57.029 --> 25:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clear consistently, particularly
with the
Iranians. These were totally
unjust detentions,

25:02.034 --> 25:03.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
imprisonments.

25:03.869 --> 25:09.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, to get them out, you
can't get them
out by just saying, hey, get
them out. And

25:09.074 --> 25:16.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so we had to figure out a
formula. And I think
if you really look at it, in
terms of, on

25:16.648 --> 25:25.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Iranian side, you're looking
at nonviolent
individuals, all -- some of them
quite elderly,

25:25.090 --> 25:30.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who in some cases their
sentences were
about the run in less than a
year anyway.

25:30.729 --> 25:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of them would have been out
of prison
before even the first of the
Americans were

25:34.666 --> 25:41.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be out of prison. Given the
category of
cases we're talking about, of
sanctions violations,

25:41.907 --> 25:46.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
three of them had been
convicted, three of
them were pending trial, and one
was about

25:46.044 --> 25:50.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to plead his case. So, only
three were actually
in prison.

25:50.816 --> 25:54.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think if you look at that and
you consider
what the stakes were if we could
not find

25:54.219 --> 25:59.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a way forward here for these
Americans in
Evin prison, at the end of the
day, I think

25:59.591 --> 26:01.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president made the right
call here.

26:01.360 --> 26:06.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You said that
there is no way
to know whether this deal, these
deals will

26:06.265 --> 26:11.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lead to something productive in
the future
between the U.S. and Iran. But,
specifically,

26:11.203 --> 26:16.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do you see something, some
movement on their
part when it comes to Syria?

26:16.108 --> 26:18.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRETT MCGURK: We have this
Vienna process
in which the Iranians are at the
table and

26:18.811 --> 26:23.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Saudis are at the table for
the first
time since the Iranian -- Syrian
civil war

26:23.749 --> 26:25.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
broke out about five years ago.

26:25.784 --> 26:29.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's encouraging, but
that's a very
difficult process. I think,
look, Iran is

26:29.822 --> 26:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a country that's going --
undergoing some
fundamental questions about its
future. It

26:33.759 --> 26:38.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has elections coming up here in
about a month.
For the first time in the
history since the

26:38.630 --> 26:42.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iranian Revolution, they have
parliamentary
elections the same day as
they're electing

26:42.534 --> 26:45.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their assembly of experts, which
will select
the next supreme leader.

26:45.704 --> 26:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you will have a very high
turnout. And,
already, you can see what's
happening with

26:49.541 --> 26:53.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the supreme leader trying to ban
a number
of reformist candidates. So,
within Iran,

26:53.679 --> 26:59.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is this big competition
for the reins
of power. And how that plays out
I think will

26:59.184 --> 27:00.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
say a lot about what's possible.

27:00.919 --> 27:04.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But that's something the
Iranians have to
figure out. The United States
will continue

27:04.056 --> 27:08.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to protect our interests in the
region. We
define our interest based upon
our own national

27:08.393 --> 27:12.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security interests. And when it
comes to Americans
sitting in Evin prison, I think
that's something

27:12.097 --> 27:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we have taken with the
utmost seriousness.

27:14.399 --> 27:20.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, obviously, other than the
families, we
didn't tell anybody about this
channel, because,

27:20.772 --> 27:24.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had it not been secret, it would
have been
impossible to make any progress.

27:24.476 --> 27:29.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Special
Presidential Envoy
Brett McGurk, thank you very
much.

27:29.281 --> 27:37.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRETT MCGURK: Judy, thank you.

27:37.456 --> 27:41.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:41.760 --> 27:47.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
rethinking autism,
what's really behind the
seemingly sudden

27:47.065 --> 27:53.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rise in diagnoses; and very
early learning,
health care and education that
starts before

27:53.972 --> 27:56.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
birth and continues after.

27:56.441 --> 28:02.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, worries over global
economic growth,
falling markets, and China's
connection to

28:02.681 --> 28:03.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what's happening.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown zeros in on the
China piece
of the story.

28:06.552 --> 28:11.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Six-point-nine
percent annual
growth, it doesn't sound so bad,
but context

28:11.723 --> 28:16.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and direction are everything.
And China's
latest quarterly GDP numbers
were lower than

28:16.528 --> 28:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expected, and the year showed
the slowest
pace of growth there in 25
years, all of course

28:21.867 --> 28:26.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with huge implications for the
rest of the
world, the U.S. very much
included.

28:26.104 --> 28:30.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get perspective from two who
watch this
closely, Ken Lieberthal, a
political scientist

28:30.442 --> 28:34.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Brookings Institution,
and Cornell
University economist Eswar
Prasad.

28:34.813 --> 28:35.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome back to both of you.

28:36.014 --> 28:37.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ken Lieberthal, let me start
with you.

28:37.783 --> 28:42.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much of a slowdown, downturn
is it? How
do you characterize China's
economy today?

28:42.588 --> 28:44.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH LIEBERTHAL, Brookings
Institution:
Well, it's a significant
slowdown, but let's

28:44.690 --> 28:47.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
keep in mind they wanted the GDP
rate to slow
down.

28:47.859 --> 28:49.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: They wanted it?

28:49.728 --> 28:53.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH LIEBERTHAL: They wanted
it. The question
is, can they use this slowdown
to transition

28:53.865 --> 28:58.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to a different economic model?

28:58.270 --> 29:04.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're having a rocky time
doing that.
That is in progress, but it's a
tough balancing

29:04.176 --> 29:06.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
act, and I think it's not going
quite as smoothly
as they had hoped.

29:07.012 --> 29:09.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, we
will get to the
larger model change.

29:09.615 --> 29:13.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Eswar Prasad, first, this
big question:
How much of a slowdown? What do
you see?

29:13.085 --> 29:15.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ESWAR PRASAD, Professor of Trade
Policy, Cornell
University: China's economy has
been powered

29:15.721 --> 29:19.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the manufacturing sector.
There has been
a lot of investment in the
economy, not all

29:19.758 --> 29:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of it very good investment.

29:21.627 --> 29:25.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China has to some extent relied
on exports.
And they're trying to shift
towards a model

29:25.464 --> 29:29.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of growth that is largely driven
by the services
sector, which is much better at
generating

29:29.801 --> 29:33.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
employment. They'd like more
consumption in
the economy, with private
consumption taking

29:33.972 --> 29:35.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the lead.

29:35.741 --> 29:40.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're making very gradual
progress.
Right now, it turns out that in
2015 private

29:40.212 --> 29:44.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consumption did contribute a
little more than
half of GDP growth. The services
sector now

29:44.816 --> 29:46.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accounts for more than half of
GDP.

29:46.718 --> 29:51.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is a big ocean liner.
It's very difficult
to turn around, but they're very
gradually

29:51.623 --> 29:55.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turning it around in the right
direction.
The problem is that slowing
growth makes it

29:55.827 --> 29:59.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
harder to put in place the
reforms to get
the ship staying on the right
road.

29:59.731 --> 30:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The numbers
themselves, though,
first, how accurate are they,
right? Do we

30:06.071 --> 30:09.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
believe the numbers that come
from China on
their GDP?

30:09.041 --> 30:11.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KENNETH LIEBERTHAL: It's very
hard to tell.

30:11.543 --> 30:18.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Keep in mind that their
statistical system
was really quite good at
capturing the -- what's

30:18.550 --> 30:23.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
now the old economy, the
industrial economy,
the export economy that Eswar
was just talking

30:23.789 --> 30:30.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about. That economy is not doing
well. They're
now trying to grow, as he
mentioned, the service

30:30.429 --> 30:32.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
economy and consumption economy.

30:32.230 --> 30:38.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The statistics are not collected
as effectively
on that part of the economy. So
there's a

30:38.336 --> 30:41.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fudge factor here that, frankly,
makes it
hard to be very precise.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So this is the
model that you're
both talking about, this change,
right, from

30:44.910 --> 30:49.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a manufacturing to a more
consumer-oriented,
a service economy.

30:49.081 --> 30:55.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH LIEBERTHAL: And also
more of an innovative
economy, where they end up not
being the assemblers

30:55.053 --> 31:00.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of high-tech things produced
elsewhere, where
they bolt them together in China
for export

31:00.358 --> 31:01.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or domestic consumption.

31:02.027 --> 31:07.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They want to become an
innovative, higher
value-added kind of economy. And
that's a

31:07.099 --> 31:08.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
difficult transition.

31:08.934 --> 31:12.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And would you
agree that part
of that is inevitable, as the
economy becomes

31:12.237 --> 31:16.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- well, as Ken was saying, that
they want
to, in part -- some of this has
to happen,

31:16.108 --> 31:16.641 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

31:16.675 --> 31:18.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ESWAR PRASAD: It has to.

31:18.443 --> 31:22.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if it doesn't, there is
going to be a
huge cost on China, because the
model that

31:22.447 --> 31:28.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been in place so far,
investment-driven,
industrial-led growth, it's led
to a lot of

31:28.653 --> 31:32.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very inefficient investment, and
China is
living with the consequences to
this day.

31:32.891 --> 31:37.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are lots of loans taken by
state-owned
enterprises that are not going
to be paid

31:37.562 --> 31:39.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back, and somebody is going to
have to pay
the bill.

31:39.498 --> 31:44.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Although this isn't likely to
lead to a financial
crisis, it's still a big bill
for Chinese

31:44.035 --> 31:48.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
citizens. Plus, the
environmental consequences
of this industrial-led growth
have not been

31:48.406 --> 31:51.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
great, and it's not been that
great at generating
employment.

31:51.276 --> 31:56.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in terms of GDP growth, it's
been a great
model, but in terms of the
environmental,

31:56.748 --> 32:01.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
human consequences and
consequences in terms
of the benefits for the average
Chinese citizen,

32:01.453 --> 32:03.355 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not so great.

32:03.388 --> 32:05.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Part of those
human consequences,
of course, an aging population
as well, right,

32:05.791 --> 32:07.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a work force?

32:07.592 --> 32:12.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH LIEBERTHAL: Yes. That's
a result in
part of their one-child policy.
And they're

32:12.697 --> 32:18.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really now paying the price for
that, because
they have had a large number of
people entering

32:18.303 --> 32:22.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the work force for years, and a
large number
of working age.

32:22.340 --> 32:27.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the number of people of
working age in
China is actually beginning to
decline every

32:27.179 --> 32:34.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year, and it isn't being made up
by kids too
young to work. Rather, they have
an explosion

32:34.820 --> 32:39.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the number of people who are
now retiring
and, you know, getting much
older, and therefore

32:39.324 --> 32:43.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a lot more demands for
health care and
all kinds of other things that
are going to

32:43.261 --> 32:44.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tax their system.

32:44.996 --> 32:47.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, to the extent
that you
are both saying this is about
managing this

32:47.299 --> 32:52.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change -- Eswar, you can start
with this -- where
do you see the country, the
government doing

32:52.170 --> 32:53.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well? Where do you see it doing
poorly?

32:53.972 --> 32:57.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ESWAR PRASAD: Over the last
year, there have
been some reforms put in place,
but largely

32:57.876 --> 33:02.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in terms of the financial
system. They started
getting some changes instituted
in the banking

33:02.280 --> 33:04.015 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system.

33:04.049 --> 33:07.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're trying to make the
currency float
more freely. But the real side
reform, the

33:07.986 --> 33:12.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reforms to liberalize the
services sector
so it can grow faster, generate
more employment,

33:12.691 --> 33:17.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take on the burden of growth,
the reform of
the state-owned enterprises, all
of those

33:17.128 --> 33:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are real side, supply-side
reform, including
the reforms to increase
innovation, as Ken

33:22.234 --> 33:24.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mentioned, those are not going
so fast.

33:24.436 --> 33:28.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if those reforms don't
supplement the
financial sector reforms, this
economy is

33:28.673 --> 33:30.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not going to go in the right
direction.

33:30.508 --> 33:33.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What would you
add to that?
And bring in -- and, of course,
we're talking

33:33.245 --> 33:37.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the -- inevitably about
the political
system's impact on the economy,
right?

33:37.282 --> 33:39.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KENNETH LIEBERTHAL: Yes.

33:39.150 --> 33:44.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in China, local levels of
the political
system, you know, province --
most provinces

33:44.956 --> 33:50.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are as big as countries are in
Europe, for
example -- province on down,
really have a

33:50.328 --> 33:56.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
huge role to play in this
system. They have
been generators of the kind of
GDP growth

33:56.201 --> 33:58.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we have seen over the
years.

33:58.270 --> 34:03.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The way this is being approached
now has the
heads of these local political
systems running

34:03.775 --> 34:09.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very scared, unclear what will
be rewarded
and what will be punished,
afraid of being

34:09.414 --> 34:14.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tagged with corruption, not
getting the kinds
of rewards they used to get.

34:14.419 --> 34:20.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the way they're pursuing
this is in
some ways making it very
difficult to implement

34:20.292 --> 34:24.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of these headline programs
that you see
announced at the top. It's a
kind of hidden

34:24.930 --> 34:29.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
story that, in fact, I think
it's having -- is
slowing down the real economy
reforms quite

34:29.734 --> 34:30.969 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a bit.

34:31.002 --> 34:32.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, Eswar, we
just have about
30 seconds.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have been talking on this
program,
of course, and everywhere,
talking about the

34:35.807 --> 34:41.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impact of all this on the rest
of the word,
right, markets and all kinds of
things. That

34:41.513 --> 34:43.315 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will continue.

34:43.348 --> 34:45.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ESWAR PRASAD: There's a lot of
bad news coming
out of China. The stock market
hasn't been

34:45.817 --> 34:49.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing well, the currency is
plunging, but
all of this doesn't mean that
the real economy

34:49.754 --> 34:51.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is really collapsing or even
stalling.

34:51.823 --> 34:56.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there is decent momentum
in the underlying
economy. And what we should all
be looking

34:56.328 --> 35:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for is not how fast China grows,
but how it
grows. And I think it's slowly
moving in the

35:01.466 --> 35:03.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right direction, but there's a
lot of work
to be done still.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A lot of changes
to come that
will impact us.

35:06.237 --> 35:07.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ESWAR PRASAD: Indeed.

35:07.706 --> 35:14.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Eswar Prasad, Ken
Lieberthal,
thank you both very much.

35:14.212 --> 35:17.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KENNETH LIEBERTHAL: Thank you.

35:17.983 --> 35:21.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ESWAR PRASAD: Thank you.

35:21.786 --> 35:27.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the first of
two looks
we're taking at the history of
autism.

35:27.292 --> 35:32.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There seems to be more and more
instances
of it, but in this edition of
the "NewsHour"

35:32.764 --> 35:38.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bookshelf, science writer Steve
Silberman
argues that the rise of autism
is not some

35:38.069 --> 35:44.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mysterious byproduct of the
modern world,
but instead a result of our
growing understanding

35:44.075 --> 35:46.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the full range of the
disorder.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William Brangham spoke with him
recently in
New York.

35:49.080 --> 35:54.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The most
recent federal
data shows one in every 68
American children

35:54.519 --> 36:00.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is diagnosed with autism.
Fifteen years ago,
it was one in every 150
children.

36:00.859 --> 36:05.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his book "NeuroTribes," Steve
Silberman
explores the history behind that
dramatic

36:06.031 --> 36:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
increase. "NeuroTribes" has been
lauded as
one of the best scientific books
of the past

36:10.368 --> 36:15.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year. It won the 2015 Samuel
Johnson Prize
for Non-Fiction and made the
best-of lists

36:15.640 --> 36:19.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for over half-a-dozen newspapers
and magazines.

36:19.144 --> 36:23.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Silberman says the genesis of
the book came
more than 15 years ago, after he
wrote this

36:23.114 --> 36:28.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
story for "Wired" magazine about
autistic
kids in Silicon Valley. After it
ran, Silberman

36:28.820 --> 36:32.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was swamped with e-mails from
others who were
struggling with the disease.

36:32.257 --> 36:35.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVE SILBERMAN, Author,
"NeuroTribes": People
were wrestling with very
profound day-to-day

36:35.760 --> 36:41.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problems with finding health
care, finding
employment, finding schools for
their kids.

36:41.366 --> 36:47.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the entire world was
having a conversation
about autism, but it was a
completely different

36:47.572 --> 36:52.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conversation. It was about
whether or not
vaccines caused autism. And that
dominated

36:52.877 --> 36:57.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
virtually every mention of
autism in the media.
Certainly, if there was an
article about autism

36:57.949 --> 37:03.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that didn't mention vaccines,
the comment
thread on the Internet would be
about vaccines.

37:03.221 --> 37:08.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I started to think that
there was a
disjunction between the problems
that autistic

37:08.259 --> 37:13.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people and their families were
dealing with
every day of their lives and
what the whole

37:13.164 --> 37:14.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
world was talking about.

37:14.999 --> 37:20.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I learned that what happened has
less to do
with the slow and cautious
progress of science

37:20.705 --> 37:23.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than it does with the seductive
power of storytelling.

37:23.141 --> 37:27.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Silberman's
deep dive into
the world of autism took him
back to the very

37:27.479 --> 37:31.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first researchers who tried to
define and
diagnose the condition.

37:31.316 --> 37:36.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE SILBERMAN: The true
discover of autism
was a guy named Hans Asperger in
Vienna in

37:36.287 --> 37:42.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the mid-1930s, and he and his
colleagues discovered
what we would now call the
autism spectrum.

37:42.994 --> 37:49.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a very, very broad
condition with many
different manifestations ranging
from kids

37:49.200 --> 37:53.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who couldn't talk at all and
would need help
every day of their lives to one
of his former

37:53.938 --> 37:57.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
patients became an astronomy
professor, actually,
but he was still autistic.

37:57.709 --> 38:02.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And Asperger
saw those people
at this end and at that end, and
said they

38:02.347 --> 38:04.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all share something similar.

38:04.282 --> 38:09.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE SILBERMAN: They all share
a very distinctive
constellation of traits. And he
had no illusions

38:09.387 --> 38:14.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about that he would cure them.
He just wanted for them to take
on the challenge

38:14.125 --> 38:17.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of living in a world that wasn't
built for
them.

38:17.362 --> 38:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one of the things about Hans
Asperger
was that he believed that autism
was very,

38:22.233 --> 38:27.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very common, that once you
recognize the distinctive
traits of autism, you would see
them everywhere.

38:27.839 --> 38:32.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Asperger and
his colleagues
documented the range of patients
they classified

38:32.177 --> 38:37.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as having autism, but as Adolf
Hitler came
to power and invaded Austria,
the work ceased

38:37.815 --> 38:40.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and several of Asperger's
colleagues fled
to the United States.

38:40.451 --> 38:44.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE SILBERMAN: They had to
leave. Otherwise,
they would have been sent to a
concentration

38:44.556 --> 38:46.291 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
camp.

38:46.324 --> 38:50.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were rescued by a guy named
Leo Kanner
in Baltimore. Leo Kanner was one
of the first

38:50.495 --> 38:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
child psychiatrists in America.
Kanner framed
autism very, very differently
than Asperger

38:56.134 --> 39:01.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had done. Whereas Asperger saw
that it was
common and a lifelong condition,
Leo Kanner

39:01.539 --> 39:05.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saw it as a very, very rare form
of childhood
psychosis.

39:05.677 --> 39:11.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was quoted in "TIME" magazine
as saying
that parents caused autism by
being too caught

39:12.016 --> 39:19.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up in their own careers and too
unloving.
And he called them refrigerator
parents, basically.

39:19.357 --> 39:24.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And by blaming parents, that
opened the door
for psychologists to come in and
say, well,

39:24.429 --> 39:26.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actually, we know what to do
with these children.

39:26.965 --> 39:31.869 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
And the recommended course of
treatment for
autism for most of the 20th
century was
institutionalization.

39:31.903 --> 39:34.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Take the kids
away from
their families?

39:35.006 --> 39:39.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE SILBERMAN: Exactly,
because the families
were considered toxic, in a
sense. And so

39:39.277 --> 39:46.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they were put in mental
institutions, psych
wards, state schools, where they
were subjected

39:46.684 --> 39:48.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to very, very brutal treatments.

39:48.586 --> 39:54.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, kids were subjected to
shock treatments,
lobotomies, kept in
straitjackets. They were

39:54.425 --> 39:58.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also put in wards with people
who were not
like them. They were often put
in wards with

39:58.730 --> 40:02.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
adult psychotics. Those children
didn't thrive.

40:02.767 --> 40:08.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Leo Kanner eventually had to
admit that -- A,
that parents didn't cause
autism, which created

40:08.573 --> 40:11.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a terrible nightmare for
families for decades.

40:11.643 --> 40:16.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Sure. I mean,
imagine being
a parent who is obviously, one,
struggling

40:16.080 --> 40:19.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the difficulty of having a
child struggling
with this condition...

40:19.050 --> 40:20.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEVE SILBERMAN: Yes.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: ... and then
let alone having
the world think that you were to
blame because

40:22.754 --> 40:23.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you were cold-hearted.

40:23.488 --> 40:25.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVE SILBERMAN: Exactly.

40:25.223 --> 40:31.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I spoke to older parents who
had been
told by their psychiatrists to
quietly remove

40:31.162 --> 40:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the pictures of their children
from the family
album and never speak of them
again.

40:35.533 --> 40:40.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Silberman
reports that it
wasn't until the early 1980s
that Asperger's

40:40.171 --> 40:42.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
contributions were rediscovered.

40:42.040 --> 40:46.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's when a British
psychiatrist named Lorna
Wing, herself the mother of an
autistic child,

40:46.878 --> 40:50.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
began taking a census of
autistic kids in
a particular suburb of London.

40:50.882 --> 40:55.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE SILBERMAN: She and a
research assistant
named Judith Gould went to
special schools.

40:55.753 --> 40:59.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They went to clinics. They were
digging through
medical records.

40:59.424 --> 41:05.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what they found was, yes, a
bunch of autistic
kids who met Kanner's strict
criteria, but

41:05.196 --> 41:11.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they found a bunch of other kids
who clearly
had autistic traits, but didn't
quite meet

41:11.169 --> 41:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kanner's criteria for diagnosis.

41:12.737 --> 41:13.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The strict
criteria.

41:14.005 --> 41:15.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE SILBERMAN: The strict
criteria.

41:15.807 --> 41:20.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, she was like, who are these
kids? Like,
why has no one noticed these
children before?

41:20.845 --> 41:26.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She didn't know what to make of
her data,
until she came across a
reference to Hans

41:26.284 --> 41:32.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Asperger's 1944 paper. She read
it. She said,
yes, this is it. This is exactly
what I'm

41:32.557 --> 41:34.359 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
seeing.

41:34.392 --> 41:38.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so she worked behind the
scenes for several
years with the people who were
developing

41:38.396 --> 41:43.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the definition of autism in the
Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders,

41:43.668 --> 41:49.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the bible of psychiatry, to
broaden the criteria
for diagnosis to include what we
would now

41:49.273 --> 41:51.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
call the autism spectrum.

41:51.042 --> 41:55.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Silberman
argues it was
this broadened definition of
autism, that

41:55.246 --> 42:00.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coupled with better diagnostic
tools and better
public education, that explains
the dramatic

42:00.184 --> 42:05.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rise in the number of diagnosed
cases, not
the repeatedly debunked theory
that vaccines

42:05.757 --> 42:07.558 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cause autism.

42:07.592 --> 42:12.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In your book, you argue that we
should think
of autism as a disability, but
don't we already

42:12.430 --> 42:13.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
think of it in that way?

42:14.031 --> 42:19.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE SILBERMAN: I think we tend
to think
of autism as not only a disease,
but as a

42:19.103 --> 42:20.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
historical aberration.

42:20.905 --> 42:26.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if it's not vaccines, it's
Wi-Fi or it's
pesticides or it's
antidepressants in the

42:26.244 --> 42:32.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water supply. It's some factor
in the toxic
modern world. But once we
realize that autism

42:32.417 --> 42:36.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and autistic people have always
been part
of the human community, that
there were always

42:36.954 --> 42:41.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
autistic people there, but they
were hidden
away, either behind the walls of
institutions

42:41.726 --> 42:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or behind other diagnostic
labels, not getting
the help that they need, we
understand that

42:48.499 --> 42:54.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
autism is a very, very common
disability,
as Hans Asperger believed.

42:54.338 --> 43:00.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not some rare form of
childhood psychosis
caused by parenting, as Leo
Kanner believed.

43:00.311 --> 43:06.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because we have thought of it as
the toxic
byproduct of our modern world,
we haven't

43:06.050 --> 43:10.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
thought about making
accommodations for, for
instance, the many autistic
adults that are

43:10.321 --> 43:11.556 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out there.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: OK. Steve
Silberman, thank
you very much.

43:12.924 --> 43:15.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE SILBERMAN: Thank you. It's
great to
be here.

43:15.526 --> 43:20.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will
continue our Understanding
Autism series tomorrow with a
conversation

43:20.665 --> 43:32.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with two reporters about the
challenges facing
adults with autism.

43:32.310 --> 43:46.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Next: a look at a political
rarity: an expanding
health program supported by both
Democrats

43:46.290 --> 43:48.226 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Republicans.

43:48.259 --> 43:50.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Cat Wise
reports.

43:50.528 --> 43:54.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIMBERLY HIRST, Registered
Nurse: I have a
book for you guys today.

43:54.165 --> 43:59.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: In Aurora, Colorado,
registered
nurse Kimberly Hirst (ph) is
checking in on

43:59.470 --> 44:02.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
19-year-old Sinai Herrera (ph)
and her 2-year-old
son, Caleb (ph).

44:02.940 --> 44:04.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KIMBERLY HIRST: One, two, buckle
my shoe.

44:04.909 --> 44:09.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The visits are part of
a rapidly
expanding program called the
Nurse Family

44:09.247 --> 44:15.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Partnership. The partnership
combines old-fashioned
social services with the latest
brain science,

44:15.820 --> 44:18.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
all to help low-income
first-time mothers
and their children.

44:19.023 --> 44:24.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIMBERLY HIRST: Time and time
again, I see
these young girls drop out of
school, so they're

44:24.362 --> 44:26.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at risk for that and living in
poverty forever.

44:26.931 --> 44:32.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The regular visits
begin in pregnancy
and continue until the children
are 2 years

44:32.837 --> 44:36.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
old. Nurses offer advice on
health, parenting,
and self-sufficiency.

44:36.340 --> 44:42.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIMBERLY HIRST: It's really so
much more educational,
rather than clinical. And so I
feel like sometimes

44:42.780 --> 44:44.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm, like, a life coach.

44:44.815 --> 44:52.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Improved outcomes,
like a 48 percent
reduction in child abuse and an
82 percent

44:52.823 --> 44:58.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
increased employment for
mothers, have been
so significant that Congress
recently voted

44:58.129 --> 45:04.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to infuse home-visit programs
with $800 million
in new funding.

45:04.235 --> 45:09.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But while the Nurse Family
Partnership is
focused on health and poverty,
another outcome

45:09.574 --> 45:15.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is catching the attention of
early learning
experts. Kids from the program
are showing

45:15.813 --> 45:18.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up at school better prepared.

45:18.583 --> 45:24.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Olds, the project's
founder and a professor
of pediatrics at the University
of Colorado's

45:24.088 --> 45:28.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
School of Medicine, says the
educational benefits
are no surprise.

45:28.459 --> 45:31.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID OLDS, University of
Colorado School
of Medicine: Nurse-visited
mothers are spending

45:31.195 --> 45:32.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more time talking to their
babies, guiding
them.

45:32.964 --> 45:34.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Where does the A go?

45:35.032 --> 45:38.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILD: A go right there.

45:38.235 --> 45:45.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID OLDS: All of that earliest
process that
gets set in motion sets in
motion a positive

45:45.643 --> 45:51.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cycle of interaction that leads
to significant
reductions in children's
behavioral problems

45:51.649 --> 45:56.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
when they enter school,
significant improvements
in their language development.

45:56.921 --> 46:02.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: On this day, Hirst
uses simple props
to explain the importance of
talking to Caleb

46:02.593 --> 46:04.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
long before he can talk back.

46:04.862 --> 46:11.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIMBERLY HIRST: So, way before
Caleb could
talk, he was learning how to
talk by hearing

46:11.102 --> 46:18.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you talk. All of these things
were adding
to him having language. When you
read to him

46:18.576 --> 46:25.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every night, when you told him
what things
were, it bubbled over into
language.

46:25.149 --> 46:26.083 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHILD: Baseball.

46:26.117 --> 46:27.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIMBERLY HIRST: A baseball?

46:27.251 --> 46:27.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILD: Yes, baseball.

46:27.952 --> 46:28.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIMBERLY HIRST: Yes, baseball.

46:28.619 --> 46:29.654 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHILD: Go -- it.

46:29.687 --> 46:33.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KIMBERLY HIRST: Go get it? Go
get the baseball?

46:33.424 --> 46:35.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILD: Yes, get ball.

46:35.226 --> 46:43.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIMBERLY HIRST: It seems so
simple, but if
he only hears 500 words an hour
verses 3,000

46:43.601 --> 46:47.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
words an hour, it makes a huge
difference
and it's a lasting difference.

46:47.138 --> 46:53.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Clinical trials show a
50 percent
reduction in language delays by
age 2 and

46:53.144 --> 46:59.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a 67 percent reduction in
intellectual problems
by age 6. Such results bolster a
growing area

46:59.417 --> 47:03.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of brain science that looks at a
baby's early
environment.

47:03.087 --> 47:07.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here at the Laboratories of
Cognitive Neuroscience
at Boston's Children's Hospital,
researchers

47:07.925 --> 47:12.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are studying how a child's early
learning
experiences can shape their
developing brain

47:12.496 --> 47:14.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and impact early learning.

47:14.198 --> 47:17.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES NELSON, Harvard Medical
School: What
many of us are starting to argue
is that,

47:17.201 --> 47:23.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to foster success as children
make the transition
to school, you need to invest in
what's going

47:23.074 --> 47:24.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on in those first few years.

47:24.909 --> 47:29.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Charles Nelson is a
professor of
pediatrics and neuroscience at
Harvard Medical

47:29.513 --> 47:31.248 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
School.

47:31.282 --> 47:34.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES NELSON: Over those first
few years,
basically, the general
architecture of the

47:34.051 --> 47:37.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brain forms in a way that sets
it up for the
rest of your life.

47:37.455 --> 47:42.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: At the Nelson Lab,
researchers use
noninvasive sensors to pick up
communication

47:42.960 --> 47:44.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
between brain cells.

47:44.762 --> 47:48.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES NELSON: Millions and
millions and
millions of brain connections
are being built.

47:48.399 --> 47:53.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so as we build the
scaffolding for subsequent
learning in those first few
years, that scaffolding

47:53.971 --> 47:56.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enables learning that occurs
over the lifespan.

47:56.607 --> 47:58.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAT WISE: Tell me what we're
seeing here.

47:58.576 --> 48:01.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES NELSON: So, we're doing
is, we're
presenting babies with images of
different

48:01.579 --> 48:07.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
facial expressions. We want to
determine at
what age are they able to
discriminate different

48:07.485 --> 48:12.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
emotions? So the baby sees the
different emotions
by different people, and as they
do that,

48:12.456 --> 48:14.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
each time the picture comes up,
we're recording
the brain activity,

48:14.725 --> 48:19.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Nelson believes
emotions play a
big role in brain development.
When parents

48:19.463 --> 48:24.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are depressed, afraid, or
stressed, their
babies' brain development can
suffer.

48:24.268 --> 48:30.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES NELSON: If you look
here, she's clearly
happy, and she's clearly angry,
and she's

48:30.141 --> 48:35.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
afraid. Infants who are brought
up in environments
where they do not see happy, mom
is depressed

48:35.212 --> 48:40.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or there's something else going
on the environment,
respond very differently to
facial emotion.

48:40.351 --> 48:44.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Development is seriously
impacted. And, more
importantly, if they don't get
them in the

48:44.989 --> 48:49.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first two or three years,
development probably
is derailed permanently.

48:49.927 --> 48:58.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: Nelson says
high-poverty homes,
like the kind targeted in Nurse
Family Partnership,

48:58.302 --> 49:01.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are vulnerable to stress,
depression, and
abuse.

49:01.806 --> 49:08.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In these homes, he says, early
intervention
can make a big difference in
brain development.

49:08.112 --> 49:13.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Sinai Herrera discovered
her junior year
of high school that she was
pregnant, it was

49:13.050 --> 49:14.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a tough time for her.

49:14.852 --> 49:19.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KIMBERLY HIRST: She was
struggling with some
depression and trying to figure
out what her

49:19.323 --> 49:21.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
life was going to look like.

49:21.091 --> 49:25.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Hirst directed Herrera
into mental
health counseling, and
ultimately back to

49:26.030 --> 49:27.865 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school.

49:27.898 --> 49:31.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: With that counseling, I
know I'm a
good mom now. And I know that I
can do everything

49:31.702 --> 49:33.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that he needs me to do.

49:33.571 --> 49:39.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: For Stormee Duran, who
went through
the program with her first
child, Sophia (ph),

49:39.410 --> 49:44.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the issue was an abusive
relationship. Duran
says her nurse gave her the
strength to move

49:44.915 --> 49:46.817 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

49:46.851 --> 49:48.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STORMEE DURAN, Nurse Family
Partnership Participant:
She was really there to help me
through that

49:48.686 --> 49:53.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deep, dark place that I was in.
I have always
had low self-esteem issues, and
so I didn't

49:53.991 --> 49:56.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want my daughter to grow up like
that.

49:56.594 --> 50:01.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The home visits are
not cheap. Each
family-nurse two-year
partnership costs on

50:01.866 --> 50:09.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average $10,000. But a RAND
Corporation analysis
found the investment actually
saves money.

50:09.240 --> 50:13.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Every dollar spent today
prevents another
$5 of social welfare spending in
the future.

50:13.878 --> 50:19.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID OLDS: This is work that is
not just
somebody's good idea, but has
been developed

50:19.516 --> 50:23.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and tested and retested using
rigorous approaches.

50:23.087 --> 50:28.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The nurse-family home
visits have
expanded to 43 states and
recently became

50:28.425 --> 50:33.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
part of the Obama
administration's push for
early learning initiatives.

"Supplements and Safety"
explores how vitamins
are marketed and regulated,
looks at cases

51:04.828 --> 51:10.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of contamination and serious
health problems,
and examines how it's often hard
to know what's

51:10.768 --> 51:13.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really in the bottles you buy.

51:13.437 --> 51:20.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: It's estimated there
are 85,000
dietary supplements for sale in
the United

51:20.978 --> 51:23.147 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
States today.

51:23.180 --> 51:28.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: This is an herb that would
be great for
older individuals.

51:28.786 --> 51:30.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Essential nutrients like
chromium.

51:30.654 --> 51:35.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: With so many pitches
and promises,
you might assume that some
government agency

51:35.459 --> 51:38.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
has approved them before
allowing them on
to the market.

STEPHEN OSTROFF, Acting FDA
Commissioner:
The FDA doesn't do any review of
dietary supplements

51:46.470 --> 51:52.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before they come onto the
market, and I think
that all consumers need to
understand this.

51:53.010 --> 51:58.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: No testing, no
obligation to provide
any evidence a product is
effective or even

51:58.916 --> 52:05.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
safe. The one thing
manufacturers do have
to show is that they follow good
manufacturing

52:05.089 --> 52:11.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
practices. The FDA conducts
inspections for
that, but it's limited by
resources and by

52:12.029 --> 52:13.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information.

52:13.831 --> 52:19.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN OSTROFF: We actually
don't know the
total number of manufacturers
that we need

52:19.670 --> 52:26.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be able to inspect because
there is no
formal registration system that
is required

52:26.243 --> 52:32.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of manufacturers that make
dietary supplements.
And so we do inspections of the
ones that

52:32.416 --> 52:33.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we know about.

JUDY WOODRUFF: "Frontline" airs
tonight on
most PBS stations.

52:38.355 --> 52:43.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online: Making
good financial
decisions is a challenge for a
lot of people,

52:43.927 --> 52:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it becomes even harder in
the face of
poverty. How does being poor
actually affect

52:49.066 --> 52:55.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people's spending? Behavioral
economist Dan
Ariely explains how mental
depletion plays

52:55.472 --> 53:02.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a role in succumbing to
temptation. That's
on our home page,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:02.479 --> 53:03.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.
