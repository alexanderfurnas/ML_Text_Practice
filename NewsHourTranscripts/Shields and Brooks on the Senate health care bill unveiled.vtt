00:01.433 --> 00:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And to the
analysis of Shields and Brooks.

00:03.466 --> 00:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

00:05.733 --> 00:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
David, let me start with you.

00:07.766 --> 00:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's start talking about
the health care plan that the
Senate rolled out this week.

00:10.433 --> 00:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You surprised at what is
different, what's the same
between the House bill?

00:13.600 --> 00:16.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: I'm
a little surprised.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
First, it's sort
of Obamacare-lite.

00:18.933 --> 00:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not going to work.

00:20.966 --> 00:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's functionally
nonoperational, because
it will encourage, when
they're healthy, to

00:23.633 --> 00:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exit the system and
then go back into the
system when they're sick.

00:27.300 --> 00:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's a recipe for a death
spiral in a lot of places.

00:29.433 --> 00:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think, functionally,
it's not going to work.

00:31.133 --> 00:34.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Politically, I have to
say, it's kind of canny.

00:34.866 --> 00:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mitch McConnell had these
two wings of his party.

00:37.866 --> 00:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think he steered as well
as is possible to steer down
the middle to give the right,

00:44.766 --> 00:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Ted Cruz folks the cuts
in Medicaid and Medicare
and stuff like that.

00:48.333 --> 00:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He gave the center basically
the structure of Obamacare
with some of the rules about

00:52.566 --> 00:54.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
preexisting conditions.

00:54.066 --> 00:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think, politically,
it's an act of skill.

00:56.133 --> 01:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as I look forward, is this
thing going to pass, I still
think probably not because

01:00.833 --> 01:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think you can get the
whole Republican Party behind
this thing, but I'm reminded

01:05.400 --> 01:07.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not to underestimate
Mitch McConnell.

01:07.433 --> 01:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Have the
Republicans made the case that
this is something better or

01:10.800 --> 01:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just that this is not Obamacare?

01:12.733 --> 01:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: It's
not Obamacare.

01:14.933 --> 01:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What it does -- you ought
to start with, what kind
of country are we in?

01:18.600 --> 01:21.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're in a country where
-- widening inequality.

01:21.833 --> 01:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think it's possible to
be a conservative and to support
market mechanisms basically

01:28.300 --> 01:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to redistribute wealth down
to those who are suffering.

01:30.700 --> 01:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This bill doesn't do that.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It goes the other way.

01:33.700 --> 01:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think, fundamentally, it
doesn't solve the basic problem
our country has, which is

01:36.466 --> 01:39.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a lot of people are
extremely vulnerable.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I do think, as a solution
any the range of health care
problems, I don't think it's

01:42.833 --> 01:44.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

01:44.100 --> 01:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't even think
repealing Obamacare.

01:45.266 --> 01:47.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a cheaper
version of Obamacare.

01:47.100 --> 01:48.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mark?

01:48.533 --> 01:53.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Two things
hit me, first of all.

01:53.533 --> 01:56.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We know there's been
no debate, no hearings,
so that's been a cry.

01:56.633 --> 02:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's interesting, because
there is no public case to
be made for the Republican

02:01.366 --> 02:03.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
plan, none.

02:03.900 --> 02:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, at least with
the Obamacare, Affordable
Care Act, you could
say, no lifetime limit,

02:09.833 --> 02:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a children -- children
could stay on their
parents' plan until the
age of 26, no preexisting

02:14.966 --> 02:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
condition will deny you
coverage, no lifetime
illness will knock you off.

02:19.300 --> 02:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There was a case.

02:20.533 --> 02:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You could argue
against the case.

02:22.533 --> 02:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is no public case
that has been made in either
the House or the Senate.

02:26.166 --> 02:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they hold no hearings,
and there is no public debate,
because they don't want to

02:32.800 --> 02:36.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
take the time to make
the case for it because
they don't have a case.

02:36.100 --> 02:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they don't want to give
the other -- opposition
a case to make -- the
time to make the case

02:39.666 --> 02:41.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against it.

02:41.766 --> 02:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what it is, the only thing
that the House and the Senate
are consistently faithful on

02:46.933 --> 02:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is that it's a major tax cut.

02:47.900 --> 02:50.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is a redistribution.

02:50.966 --> 02:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama, who was, you know, if
anything, overly moderate for
many tastes, did, in fact, lay

03:00.200 --> 03:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it on the most advantaged among
us to pay, to cover people
who couldn't afford it in

03:06.166 --> 03:08.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his plan.

03:08.300 --> 03:12.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And a 3.8 percent tax
on unearned income for
those earning over a
quarter of a million

03:14.533 --> 03:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dollars became the rallying
cry, the organizing
principle for the opposition.

03:19.266 --> 03:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the one constant
that has been through it all.

03:21.700 --> 03:26.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Warren Buffett, to his
everlasting credit,
pointed out that he
will get a tax cut under

03:27.866 --> 03:31.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Republican plan
this year of $630,000.

03:33.933 --> 03:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the redistribution.

03:36.500 --> 03:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, in the
richest nation in the
history of the world, it
is a terrible indictment,

03:41.900 --> 03:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a sad commentary that the
most vulnerable among us, the
least -- the least among us

03:48.100 --> 03:50.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are really tossed off as
a political statement.

03:50.966 --> 03:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, what's
the Democratic counter to this?

03:53.500 --> 03:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I realize that they support
Obamacare at is core, but what
about the things that they

03:57.866 --> 04:00.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can agree on that
need improvements?

04:00.100 --> 04:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why not come up with some
sort of a counter and
a fix and propose that?

04:02.900 --> 04:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Good question.

04:04.866 --> 04:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's one of the reasons
there has been no debate is
threat at there hasn't been the

04:07.733 --> 04:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
opportunity for debate.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have foreclosed it.

04:11.100 --> 04:15.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, no, the Democrats
have chosen to focus all
attention on the other.

04:15.433 --> 04:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's one of the
problems the Democrats have.

04:18.100 --> 04:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they learned this week
in the Georgia 6 that there are
limits to being against Donald

04:24.666 --> 04:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Trump, although Donald
Trump expands the limits
on a regular basis.

04:27.833 --> 04:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are limits to
being against him as a
political strategy and to
have political relevance

04:33.666 --> 04:34.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to voters.

04:34.666 --> 04:36.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have to be for.

04:36.700 --> 04:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What
do you think about the
likelihood of passage?

04:38.733 --> 04:42.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: You
know, I am not sure.

04:42.966 --> 04:45.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mitch McConnell is a
master inside player.

04:45.033 --> 04:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's a terrible outside player.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He doesn't make a
public case for it.

04:48.866 --> 04:51.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, inside, he knows
the Senate well.

04:51.233 --> 04:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, what, we have had now
five Senate say that they would
have problems with it, which

04:57.333 --> 04:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is sort of the
opening negotiation.

04:59.933 --> 05:04.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Dean Heller, who we
saw earlier in Nevada,
is in real trouble.

05:06.933 --> 05:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's up for reelection in
a tough state, in a state
that has expanded Medicaid.

05:08.833 --> 05:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, Medicaid, Hari,
I think, is health care
for poorer Americans.

05:15.266 --> 05:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what this plan does is
essentially starve Medicaid.

05:19.066 --> 05:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Senate does it slower.

05:20.533 --> 05:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The House does it faster.

05:22.033 --> 05:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He brought
up the special elections.

05:23.966 --> 05:25.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have had five now.

05:25.866 --> 05:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Republicans seem to be
holding, if not winning.

05:27.933 --> 05:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is this trouble
for the Democrats?

05:29.033 --> 05:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think so.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think the Georgia
loss is a big loss.

05:32.300 --> 05:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think it's, oh, this is
always a Republican district,
it's not such a big deal.

05:36.300 --> 05:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the Democrats are going to
pick up seats, it is going to
be in upscale, highly educated

05:39.933 --> 05:41.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
suburban seats.

05:41.533 --> 05:45.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And this was tailor-made
for that, a seat that
Trump barely won.

05:45.866 --> 05:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so if after all that's
happened in the last four or
five months, they can't pick

05:49.366 --> 05:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
up the seat, that to
me is an indictment.

05:51.900 --> 05:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's first a sign that
there are limits to being
anti-Trump, second, that
the Trump phenomenon

05:58.700 --> 06:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was not just a fluke, that it's
based on some deep structural
things in the economy that

06:02.566 --> 06:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are driving people to
support the Republicans,
some deep structural
things in the country,

06:07.066 --> 06:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that people are
extremely distrustful of
government and extremely
distrustful of Washington.

06:14.033 --> 06:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's also a sign that the
Republicans, despite all that's
happened, are still considered

06:15.866 --> 06:17.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the party of change.

06:17.566 --> 06:20.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And if they want change,
they're still likely to
go to the Republicans.

06:20.100 --> 06:23.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, finally, it's a
sign the Democratic
Party is too coherent.

06:23.133 --> 06:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have got a Bernie Sanders,
which is strong and coherent,
but that's not the kind of wing

06:29.300 --> 06:31.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's going to work
in this district.

06:31.266 --> 06:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Democratic center,
aside from the one candidate
they had down there, is meager.

06:37.566 --> 06:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And without that, there are
going to be just a lot of
districts you're not going to do

06:39.033 --> 06:40.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so great in.

06:40.533 --> 06:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mark, he
had a four-point answer.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

06:42.033 --> 06:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: He did.

06:43.033 --> 06:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I will cut it down to two.

06:44.433 --> 06:45.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

06:45.700 --> 06:48.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
No, politics isn't
like the Olympics.

06:48.600 --> 06:52.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In the Olympics, you
get a silver medal,
you get a bronze medal.

06:52.333 --> 06:53.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's only one winner.

06:53.833 --> 06:55.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And David's right.

06:55.833 --> 07:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Close only counts in
horseshoes and hand
grenades and slow-dancing.

07:02.833 --> 07:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming in second, and even
a good second and a close
second, doesn't do it.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Winning is coming in first.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the Republicans did win.

07:10.400 --> 07:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, yes, it's a district
that Mitt Romney carried by 24
points and John McCain carried

07:15.966 --> 07:18.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by 19 points.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one of the things that
turned out was, when you spend
that much money -- and give

07:22.333 --> 07:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Republicans credit.

07:23.633 --> 07:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They turned out the
Republican vote.

07:26.166 --> 07:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you spend that much
money, then the intensity
and the passion of the
opposition, who were

07:31.933 --> 07:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Democrats in
this case, is kind of
neutralized by the turnout.

07:35.500 --> 07:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were 260,000 people who
voted Tuesday in a special
election, which is 50,000 more

07:42.166 --> 07:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than voted in the
2014 general election.

07:45.266 --> 07:48.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I mean, it was a
remarkable turnout.

07:48.333 --> 07:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can't argue that, gee,
if we just had two more days,
it would have been a -- I

07:53.233 --> 07:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think the Democrats have to
come up with what they are for,
what is it, rather than simply

07:59.400 --> 08:01.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
being against Donald
Trump, which is...

08:01.500 --> 08:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I do think -- I
would be curious to hear Mark's
view on this -- I do think,

08:04.666 --> 08:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on net, Nancy Pelosi can be
a very masterful leader again
inside, but I do think she's

08:09.600 --> 08:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
become a central liability
for people around the country.

08:12.833 --> 08:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the question will be,
OK, if they got rid of Nancy
Pelosi as party leader, would

08:15.966 --> 08:18.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the next person be
just as unpopular?

08:18.166 --> 08:20.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, potentially, but I
think potentially not.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I do think, if you're a
Democrat, you do have to think
about, who is currently the

08:23.600 --> 08:25.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
face of our party?

08:25.100 --> 08:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Pelosi
says she's worth the cost.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well,
Nancy Pelosi, I have
said before, was the most
effective House speaker

08:32.400 --> 08:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in my time in Washington.

08:33.833 --> 08:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What she did -- we talk about
the Affordable Care Act.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Barack Obama didn't pass
the Affordable Care Act.

08:39.766 --> 08:41.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nancy Pelosi passed the
Affordable Care Act.

08:41.933 --> 08:43.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She passed it three
times through the House
of Representatives.

08:43.766 --> 08:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She has raised $141 million
last cycle for Democrats.

08:48.766 --> 08:51.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sadly, tragically,
money does matter.

08:51.233 --> 08:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Ryan's political action
committee, with unnamed donors,
spent $7 million in this special

08:58.266 --> 09:00.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I think, you know,
Republicans have been
running since 1984,
when Jeane Kirkpatrick

09:03.966 --> 09:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gave the keynote address
at the convention, against
San Francisco Democrats.

09:10.900 --> 09:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, maybe Nancy
Pelosi, not a dress designer,
and buy off the rack or whatever

09:16.433 --> 09:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
else, but I don't think
it's going to change.

09:18.500 --> 09:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think she will be
the determining factor on the
ballot in voters' minds in 2018.

09:24.733 --> 09:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, some
of the statements that have been
coming out of the White House,

09:27.233 --> 09:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more specifically from Donald
Trump, yesterday saying he
didn't know that there were any

09:31.100 --> 09:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tapes or any recordings,
that he didn't make any, this
follows a dozen false statements

09:37.266 --> 09:39.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at the rally that he
had in Iowa this week.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then you kind of just go
right back to how President
Obama bugged Trump Tower or

09:42.433 --> 09:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the millions of illegal votes
for Hillary or the size of
the crowd at the inauguration.

09:47.433 --> 09:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Any structural consequence
to the office of this?

09:49.866 --> 09:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Because it doesn't seem to
be having an impact on him.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

09:53.466 --> 09:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I wonder, what's going
to happen to our debate?

09:56.800 --> 10:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After Trump leaves,
whenever that is, do we snap
back to what we consider
the normal standards

10:03.000 --> 10:05.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of honesty, or is
this the new norm?

10:05.066 --> 10:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why, even though
it doesn't seem like Trump to
point out, as my paper did,

10:08.100 --> 10:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a long list today, the
definitive guide to the lies
of Donald Trump, I think it's

10:12.500 --> 10:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still worth making that case,
because a lot - - the thing we
have to fear most is essentially

10:19.566 --> 10:23.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a plague of intellectual
laziness, a plague of
incuriosity, a plague
of apathy about honesty.

10:26.233 --> 10:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And once the whole political
system gets affected by
that, then we're really sunk.

10:30.666 --> 10:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I do think keeping his
feet on the fire, no matter
how little he pays a price

10:34.700 --> 10:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for it, is still worth doing.

10:35.866 --> 10:36.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mark?

10:36.866 --> 10:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I would say this.

10:38.900 --> 10:42.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's paying a price,
in the sense The Wall
Street Journal/NBC
poll asked voters, whom

10:42.933 --> 10:45.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do you believe, James
Comey or Donald Trump?

10:45.766 --> 10:50.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And by a 2-1 margin, voters
believe James Comey, who, until
a month ago, was a villain

10:52.266 --> 10:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to so many Democrats because
of the Hillary Clinton race.

10:55.466 --> 11:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Overwhelmingly, Americans
do not believe that he's
honest, or he's trustworthy,
he's knowledgeable,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's experienced or he
has the right temperament.

11:04.333 --> 11:09.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
By a 48-16 margin, they
believe the opposite.

11:09.300 --> 11:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is a real
liability for anybody who
wants to lead a country.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But in that
same poll, you see that it's
78 percent of Dems, 26 percent

11:15.933 --> 11:18.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Republicans who have
that trust in that case.

11:18.266 --> 11:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Mark Shields, David
Brooks, we will leave it there.

11:19.933 --> 11:20.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.
