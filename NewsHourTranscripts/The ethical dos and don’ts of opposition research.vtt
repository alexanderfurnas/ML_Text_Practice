00:02.033 --> 00:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we just heard,
the president defended his older
son's meeting with a Russian

00:04.566 --> 00:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
lawyer last year, saying
that it was standard
opposition research.

00:08.966 --> 00:11.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But some have
questioned that premise.

00:11.300 --> 00:15.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
To discuss all this,
we are joined now by
two campaign veterans.

00:15.200 --> 00:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tim Miller was the former
communications director for Jeb
Bush's presidential campaign.

00:22.100 --> 00:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is also co-founder of
the Republican opposition
research group America Rising.

00:27.433 --> 00:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Christina Reynolds, she
was the deputy communications
director for Hillary Clinton's

00:33.566 --> 00:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2016 presidential campaign,
and she's now the senior vice
president for Global Strategy

00:37.766 --> 00:40.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Group, a Democratic
research firm.

00:40.366 --> 00:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we welcome both of
you to the "NewsHour."

00:42.000 --> 00:43.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Christina, I'm going
to start with you.

00:43.966 --> 00:46.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tell our audience, what
is opposition research?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS, Former
Hillary Clinton Campaign Deputy
Communications Director: Well,

00:47.566 --> 00:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when I started, we used to call
it quotes, votes and anecdotes.

00:49.600 --> 00:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is gathering public
information to tell a
story about your opponent.

00:53.766 --> 00:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we look at public sources.

00:55.866 --> 01:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We look at everything from
votes to tax records to personal
stories that you can find out

01:01.466 --> 01:02.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about someone.

01:02.966 --> 01:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tim Miller,
what would you add to that?

01:04.900 --> 01:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM MILLER, Former Jeb Bush
Campaign Communications
Director: I think that's right.

01:06.033 --> 01:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I call it full
information awareness.

01:08.033 --> 01:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You want to know everything
you can about your opponent,
everything they have ever said,

01:11.700 --> 01:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any way they have ever made
money, any way they have ever
spent money, and so that you

01:16.033 --> 01:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can use it to your advantage
in the campaign and so voters
know their entire record.

01:19.866 --> 01:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Christina
Reynolds, is it anything goes?

01:23.966 --> 01:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Anything about their medical
records, their personal life?

01:26.500 --> 01:28.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: No.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, first and foremost,
you have to -- we used to have
a rule that said, if you can

01:30.833 --> 01:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cite it, you can write it.

01:33.333 --> 01:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You need a publicly
available source for
something to be credible
in the news, for something

01:37.866 --> 01:39.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be credible in ads.

01:39.933 --> 01:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, second of all, if you
go into things like medical
records and things like that,

01:43.533 --> 01:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then you start getting into
worrying about blowback
for your own candidate.

01:46.433 --> 01:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's not anything goes.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have to be careful.

01:48.600 --> 01:49.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:49.866 --> 01:51.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
do you mean blowback?

01:51.966 --> 01:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: I mean,
at some point, there's a risk
that the actual gathering of

01:54.933 --> 01:59.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the information may be
considered worse then
the public -- than
the information that's

01:59.066 --> 02:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
found, if it's considered
dirty tricks, so to speak.

02:01.900 --> 02:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tim Miller,
are there lines drawn around
what's considered acceptable

02:06.466 --> 02:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opposition research or not?

02:08.233 --> 02:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIM MILLER: Of course there are.

02:10.233 --> 02:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We started an opposition
research firm America Rising
that has been very successful.

02:14.566 --> 02:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And -- but what try to do is
ensure that we stay inside
these lines, both legal lines

02:20.733 --> 02:22.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and ethical -- and
ethical boundaries.

02:22.833 --> 02:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think both of those are
in play here with regards to
the president's son's meeting.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's like Christina said.

02:30.966 --> 02:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You saw this with the Ted Cruz
campaign in Iowa, that they
had blowback when they were

02:37.466 --> 02:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spreading information that Ben
Carson was going to drop out
of the race, when that wasn't

02:39.400 --> 02:41.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
true.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to be careful that
your opposition research is
correct, first and foremost, but

02:44.333 --> 02:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also within legal
and ethical bounds.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's what I
want to pursue with both of you.

02:49.500 --> 02:54.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What is inside and what
is outside the bounds
of what you can do?

02:54.033 --> 02:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, we're asking
you all this because of what
happened with regard to Donald

02:58.366 --> 03:02.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Trump Jr., the meeting
he took with a Russian
- - representative of
the Russian government.

03:02.633 --> 03:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: Sure.

03:04.733 --> 03:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I can tell you, in
my experience in research,
what he did is not normal.

03:08.266 --> 03:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that what's inside
the bounds is things that
are publicly available.

03:12.833 --> 03:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You do a lot of Freedom
of Information Act
records requests.

03:16.966 --> 03:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You certainly talk to people,
but you do so with people that
you know and trust are giving

03:23.566 --> 03:26.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you solid information
and information that you
can then go and prove.

03:26.600 --> 03:31.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And you certainly don't
do something with a
hostile government,
you know, being on your

03:32.666 --> 03:34.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
side.

03:34.666 --> 03:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, the best example of
this is when Al Gore's campaign
got a debate book FedExed

03:39.866 --> 03:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to them, a George
Bush debate book.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first thing they did was
call the FBI, because you
wonder, are you being set up?

03:46.000 --> 03:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You wonder, is this something
that's valid, that's real?

03:50.500 --> 03:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's something that you
don't take every meeting.

03:53.366 --> 03:55.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People call with tips.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You make sure that you
trust the veracity of the
information and the source.

03:58.333 --> 04:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tim Miller, had
you ever, before this instance,
heard of a time when someone

04:03.300 --> 04:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was offered information by a
foreign hostile government?

04:06.533 --> 04:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM MILLER: Well, I will tell
you, almost to the question,
I -- like President Trump,

04:13.566 --> 04:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been called by anonymous
people, friends of friends with
information about him, frankly,

04:19.533 --> 04:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and about Hillary Clinton when
I was working for Jeb Bush.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you have to make a
decision about whether
this is a credible person.

04:25.700 --> 04:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to talk to lawyers
to make sure, if you have
the conversation, it's within

04:29.933 --> 04:31.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
legal bounds.

04:31.900 --> 04:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, those conversations,
while maybe some would consider
to be a little bit sketchy,

04:37.900 --> 04:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pale in comparison to the idea
of getting a call from somebody
who explicitly says they're

04:42.600 --> 04:44.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
here from the
Russian government.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not just a
foreign government, Judy.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It wasn't Switzerland who
had called Donald Trump Jr.

04:47.633 --> 04:50.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

04:50.166 --> 04:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM MILLER: It was a
country that is out there
to undermine our interests
on the world stage.

04:52.366 --> 04:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's so far beyond the pale,
that it's kind of almost silly
to compare it to some of these

04:57.133 --> 05:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other gray area opposition
research efforts, because
there is nothing gray about it.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Christina, were
you ever aware of being offered
or hear of anybody in a campaign

05:05.533 --> 05:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being offered something
from a foreign hostile...

05:06.966 --> 05:08.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: From
a foreign government?

05:08.200 --> 05:09.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

05:09.633 --> 05:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS:
That's an easy answer: No.

05:11.700 --> 05:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so, when
a question arises about what
you're -- whether you're being

05:17.100 --> 05:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
offered or what someone's trying
to tell you, if there is any
question about it, what do

05:20.133 --> 05:22.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you do?

05:22.133 --> 05:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: I think,
as Tim mentioned, sometimes,
you talk to lawyers.

05:24.933 --> 05:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You think about, will I be
able to give this to a reporter
and know that it's true?

05:31.933 --> 05:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Would I have my candidate
say it out loud and
feel confident in that?

05:35.766 --> 05:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You think through those
things, and I think you
set a really high bar.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we learned anything from the
Donald Trump's election, from
the past campaign and Trump's

05:42.500 --> 05:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election, it's that no one
story can kill a campaign, but
you don't want to be the one

05:48.933 --> 05:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is -- you know, that is
seen as playing dirty tricks.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are people
-- I know every campaign is
different, Tim Miller, in the

05:56.466 --> 06:00.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
way it's organized, the
hierarchy and so forth.

06:00.633 --> 06:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But are there rules that are
shared, that are known by people
in modern American politics

06:06.566 --> 06:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about what's OK and what isn't?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You just count on
the lawyers you hire?

06:11.500 --> 06:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know every campaign
has lawyers to tell you
that, or how does that work?

06:18.466 --> 06:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM MILLER: Yes, look, I
think that there are norms
within opposition research.

06:20.666 --> 06:22.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We also run a candidate
tracking organization.

06:22.866 --> 06:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the guys that -- and gals
that follow around candidates
with a video camera to get

06:28.733 --> 06:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
whatever they say on the record.

06:30.233 --> 06:32.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And there are rules.

06:32.833 --> 06:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We work with a Democratic
opposition research firm,
you know, and we would
have an off-the-record

06:38.266 --> 06:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conversation to kind of set
boundaries, you know, that we
weren't going to go videotape

06:42.766 --> 06:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their family dinner, right?

06:44.700 --> 06:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're not going to go
dumpster-diving in there in the
trash can outside their house.

06:51.333 --> 06:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like I said, there are going to
be areas where there are some
-- where there are gray areas.

06:55.033 --> 06:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Opposition research is not
all just fun and games.

06:58.366 --> 07:02.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's serious business,
especially running
for high office.

07:02.466 --> 07:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are legal lines and
then there are also just decency
boundaries, you know, like

07:08.566 --> 07:10.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the example I mentioned
about the family.

07:10.666 --> 07:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right, but even
if -- Christina, even if the
campaign says, we're not going

07:16.133 --> 07:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do this, there are other
tabloids and others out there
who may be engaging in this kind

07:20.333 --> 07:21.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of research.

07:21.266 --> 07:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: Sure.

07:23.333 --> 07:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think one thing -- Tim
will probably back me up on
this -- one thing that is true

07:26.366 --> 07:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of all researchers
is, we all see black
helicopters a little bit.

07:30.133 --> 07:31.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are all just a
little bit paranoid.

07:31.933 --> 07:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you worry about a setup.

07:34.600 --> 07:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You worry that just the
giving of that information
may be more interesting
news than the information

07:40.233 --> 07:41.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
itself.

07:41.700 --> 07:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so you use your best
judgment, as Tim mentioned.

07:45.733 --> 07:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, you use your lawyers
and you use your best judgment,
and you make sure that

07:49.933 --> 07:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you don't do anything that's
going to damage the campaign.

07:51.633 --> 07:53.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Experience counts.

07:53.766 --> 07:57.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM MILLER: You go back
to that '08 campaign
with Hillary Clinton and
Obama, Hillary Clinton's

07:57.566 --> 08:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oppo research on Obama, I think
-- Christina would know better
-- backfired more than it

08:02.266 --> 08:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helped, because people didn't
want there to be, within a
family, intraparty squabbles

08:08.866 --> 08:10.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that were that personal.

08:10.133 --> 08:13.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so you have to be
careful about that.

08:13.200 --> 08:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are electoral implications
to consider, in addition to
the legal and ethical ones.

08:17.400 --> 08:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it is --
it's a subject that doesn't
get a lot of attention, but,

08:21.900 --> 08:24.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
right now, everybody
is asking questions.

08:24.233 --> 08:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tim Miller, Christina
Reynolds, we thank you both.

08:26.233 --> 08:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: Thank you.

08:27.233 --> 08:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIM MILLER: Thanks, Judy.
