GWEN IFILL: Good evening.

00:05.873 --> 00:06.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.874 --> 00:07.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:07.875 --> 00:08.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:08.876 --> 00:10.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

00:10.677 --> 00:11.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK SCOTT (R), Florida: If
you're watching
and living in an evacuation
zone, you need

00:11.845 --> 00:13.580 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to leave now.

00:13.614 --> 00:17.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A state of emergency
in Florida,
Georgia and South Carolina, as
the deadly

00:17.985 --> 00:21.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Hurricane Matthew gains
strength, barreling
toward the U.S.

00:21.855 --> 00:26.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then, in our
series on the
issues shaping this election, we
take a look

00:26.927 --> 00:30.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at where the candidates stand
and differ on
guns.

00:30.530 --> 00:35.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Jeffrey Brown
sits down with
the master of horror, Stephen
King, to talk

00:35.535 --> 00:38.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about his new novel and the art
of writing.

00:38.171 --> 00:40.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN KING, Author, "End of
Watch": I got
where the story leads.

00:40.674 --> 00:44.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And sometimes it's a little bit
outrageous.

00:44.745 --> 00:45.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I relish that.

00:45.879 --> 00:49.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I sort of want to be as much on
the edge as
I can.

00:49.917 --> 00:57.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:57.424 --> 01:00.193 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:00.227 --> 01:09.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It keeps coming
closer and getting
stronger.

01:09.436 --> 01:15.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hurricane Matthew's winds are
back up to 140
miles an hour as it plows toward
Florida tonight,

01:15.275 --> 01:23.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in its wake, up to 140 dead,
nearly all of
them in the island nation of
Haiti.

01:23.483 --> 01:28.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From the skies above
Southwestern Haiti, the
destruction looks complete.

01:28.855 --> 01:33.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Entire neighborhoods have been
wiped out in
Jeremie, the region's main city.

01:33.327 --> 01:37.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): All
the money we
had has been lost.

01:37.197 --> 01:38.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everything is lost.

01:38.198 --> 01:39.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We're lost.

01:39.199 --> 01:40.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We don't know.

01:40.534 --> 01:43.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We could see the destruction,
and we asked
for help, but no.

01:43.670 --> 01:48.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Aid workers are
finally getting
to some of the most heavily
damaged areas,

01:48.976 --> 01:51.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they're reporting near total
losses.

01:51.845 --> 01:56.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Holly Frew with the aid
organization CARE
is monitoring the situation from
the Haitian

01:56.583 --> 01:58.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
capital of Port-au-Prince.

01:58.352 --> 02:03.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOLLY FREW, CARE: About 80
percent of the
buildings and homes are damaged
or destroyed

02:04.024 --> 02:05.258 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in that area.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everyone is kind of in a state
of shock.

02:07.461 --> 02:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just utter devastation in
that western
side of southern bluff where the
hurricane

02:12.766 --> 02:14.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
eye just took a direct hit.

02:14.701 --> 02:20.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Despite the sweeping
destruction,
Tim Callaghan with the U.S.
Agency for International

02:20.640 --> 02:24.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Development, is holding out hope
that the
human cost may be less than
feared.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM CALLAGHAN, USAID: The damage
observed
from the air was structural
damage and not

02:25.312 --> 02:27.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
heavy rain damage.

02:27.147 --> 02:33.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A lot of people were not
observed in the aerial
overflight, which would indicate
that people

02:33.453 --> 02:37.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were in shelters or people were
in homes.

02:37.791 --> 02:43.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Eastern Cuba is also
assessing
damage from the hurricane's
passage, and,

02:43.363 --> 02:45.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
overnight, the storm blew
through the Bahamas,
too.

02:45.832 --> 02:50.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. mainland is the next
target, with
Matthew expected to blast north
along the

02:50.971 --> 02:55.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
entire length of Florida's
Atlantic Coast
beginning tonight.

02:55.742 --> 03:00.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After that, it's likely to rake
Georgia and
South Carolina, before weakening
and veering

03:00.247 --> 03:01.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out to sea.

03:01.882 --> 03:06.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Overall, about two million
people in those
states are being warned to flee.

03:06.686 --> 03:07.854 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RICK SCOTT (R), Florida:
Evacuate, evacuate,
evacuate.

03:09.956 --> 03:14.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Florida Governor
Rick Scott was
out early and often today,
telling people

03:14.394 --> 03:15.362 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to leave.

03:15.395 --> 03:16.730 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK SCOTT: Are you willing to
take a chance
to risk your life?

03:18.465 --> 03:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are you willing to take a
gamble?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's what you're doing.

03:22.669 --> 03:27.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're reluctant to evacuate,
just think
of all the people this storm has
already killed.

03:27.174 --> 03:31.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Many heeded the
warnings, as heavy
rain began falling in Miami.

03:31.978 --> 03:36.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Interstate highways across the
region were
turned into one-way routes to
speed the exodus.

03:36.983 --> 03:40.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I'm thinking just to get as
far away
from the flood zone as possible.

03:40.353 --> 03:44.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Others hastily
boarded up homes
and businesses, and thousands
checked into

03:45.025 --> 03:46.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shelters.

03:46.893 --> 03:51.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: It's too risky to stay,
and just wanted
to stay safe and really hope we
have the grace

03:51.965 --> 03:53.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to accept the aftermath.

03:53.834 --> 03:58.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: You cannot replace your
child's life
or your mom's life or your
kid's, dad's, anybody's

03:58.505 --> 04:00.006 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Things are material.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can always replace your
things.

04:02.876 --> 04:07.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And whether they
were going or
staying, people everywhere
flocked to buy

04:07.314 --> 04:09.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gasoline, food and water.

04:09.916 --> 04:15.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The threat of Matthew is also
forcing widespread
cancellations and closures of
everything from

04:15.856 --> 04:20.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
college football to theme parks
to airline
routes.

04:20.093 --> 04:24.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This afternoon, President Obama
declared a
state of emergency for Florida
and ordered

04:24.164 --> 04:27.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
federal aid to help on
the-ground efforts
there.

04:27.367 --> 04:32.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Federal Emergency Management
Agency, or
FEMA, has deployed people and
supplies there

04:32.038 --> 04:34.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and to Georgia and the
Carolinas.

04:34.174 --> 04:39.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I spoke to the agency
administrator coordinating
the federal response, Craig
Fugate, from FEMA

04:39.679 --> 04:41.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
headquarters late this
afternoon.

04:41.314 --> 04:45.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I began by asking how FEMA
prepares for such
a massive storm.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG FUGATE, Administrator,
Federal Emergency
Management Agency: Well, we
basically get

04:47.754 --> 04:52.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ready based on the storm track,
potential
impacts and looking at four
states.

04:52.993 --> 04:57.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we divided up teams to go
into each of
the state emergency operation
centers, and

04:57.330 --> 05:02.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have set up some supply bases
that can
support multiple states, so we
can shift to

05:02.502 --> 05:04.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wherever the heaviest impacts
are.

05:04.337 --> 05:07.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have been getting ready
for the storm
for the last couple of days,
just like a lot

05:07.574 --> 05:10.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of the states and local
governments have been
doing, before this storm makes
impact.

05:10.377 --> 05:15.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, you have been
trying to preposition
resources in places where they
might be needed.

05:15.182 --> 05:19.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you tell where that is,
the places
that might be -- it might be
needed, but might

05:19.486 --> 05:22.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also be the hardest-hit part of
the impact?

05:22.956 --> 05:25.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG FUGATE: Well, part of it
is looking
at the overall track guidance to
making some

05:25.892 --> 05:30.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decisions about, where can we
move things
close to, but not in the area of
impact, and

05:30.830 --> 05:33.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then shift it as we get more
information on
the storm track.

05:33.900 --> 05:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, right now, we have moved
stuff into Albany
and Fort Bragg.

05:37.204 --> 05:42.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Working with the state of
Florida, we're actually
moving stuff down to their
operations center

05:42.175 --> 05:44.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where they have a big logistics
base in Orlando.

05:44.244 --> 05:50.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we try to move as the storm
shifts to just
stay outside of the heavy-hit
areas, but close

05:50.550 --> 05:53.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough where we're going to be
able to get
in quickly to support the state
and local

05:53.820 --> 05:55.589 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
responders.

05:55.622 --> 05:58.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What do you do when
the governor
of a state, for instance, of
Florida, said

05:58.825 --> 06:01.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evacuate, evacuate, evacuate,
and people don't
do it?

06:01.528 --> 06:05.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG FUGATE: Well, I have been
in that role
at the state level and at the
local level.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's one of our
challenges.

06:07.834 --> 06:11.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's one of the things you
can help,
explaining to people, showing
them the hazards.

06:11.271 --> 06:15.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think people understand we
don't have
enough certainty of track
forecast to tell

06:15.208 --> 06:17.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, you're not going to be
at risk or
you're at risk.

06:17.477 --> 06:20.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have to warn the area based
upon the forecast.

06:20.380 --> 06:24.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And sometimes it's not that bad,
and that's
actually good, because you can
go back home.

06:24.718 --> 06:28.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But if it is as bad as
forecasted, I have
actually listened to the 911
calls.

06:29.022 --> 06:33.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There will be a point tonight
where it's too
late, people cannot be rescued,
they didn't

06:33.860 --> 06:36.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go in time, they're going to run
out of options.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, unfortunately, that means
they may lose
their lives.

06:39.165 --> 06:41.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is all about life safety.

06:41.668 --> 06:45.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why we're so adamant
about getting
people to evacuate out of these
areas.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, yes, if it's not bad, go
back home.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you have something to go
back to.

06:49.776 --> 06:52.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We can always rebuild, but we
cannot replace
lives lost.

06:52.379 --> 06:56.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What about coastal
infrastructure
like NASA launch pads, for
instance?

06:56.683 --> 06:59.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's right at the center of
the potential
hit zone.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CRAIG FUGATE: Well, we have a
lot of critical
infrastructure.

07:02.022 --> 07:02.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You have NASA.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have several military bases.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have the Port of
Jacksonville.

07:06.793 --> 07:09.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have Port Canaveral.

07:09.396 --> 07:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of things that
have not been
through hurricane conditions in
a very long

07:13.466 --> 07:16.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time, if ever, for the life of
those structures.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, again, we get ready for the
impacts.

07:19.606 --> 07:25.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We expect to have substantial
damage if that
eye wall is coming ashore at a
Category 4

07:25.211 --> 07:27.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or Category 3.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we can't really do much
about that right
now.

07:29.482 --> 07:33.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we can do is get people to
safety and
then be prepared to respond
afterwards to

07:33.586 --> 07:35.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
begin the response.

07:35.422 --> 07:40.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What have you
learned from past
disasters like Hurricane Hugo, I
think, 1989,

07:40.493 --> 07:42.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that prepares you for now?

07:42.228 --> 07:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG FUGATE: Well, one of the
things you
will see along this part of the
coast is,

07:46.733 --> 07:51.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as you get further north, storm
surge values
will now go -- I think you're
seeing in a

07:51.204 --> 07:53.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lot of areas 10 to 12 feet.

07:53.239 --> 07:56.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you move into the Carolinas,
particularly
South Carolina and Northern
Georgia, it even

07:56.776 --> 07:58.578 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gets higher.

07:58.611 --> 08:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things we saw in
Hurricane Hugo
is how far inland storm surge
can go, in some

08:02.982 --> 08:08.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cases over 30 feet of water that
went in miles
and flooded communities that
didn't even think

08:08.355 --> 08:10.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they were on the coast.

08:10.156 --> 08:13.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why it's important that
people heed
those evacuation orders,
particularly around

08:13.827 --> 08:18.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rivers and the tributaries like
the St. John's,
the St. Mary's, up through the
Savannah River

08:18.798 --> 08:23.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and all those basins, because
water can travel
far inland and cause flooding
well away from

08:23.536 --> 08:25.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the coast, if people aren't
aware of it.

08:25.338 --> 08:30.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Which is more
dangerous, or is
it possible to quantify it, the
actual landfall

08:30.443 --> 08:32.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or the surge that you're talking
about?

08:32.379 --> 08:36.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG FUGATE: If you go back in
history, the
most deadly parts of the
hurricane has been

08:36.649 --> 08:38.385 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
water.

08:38.418 --> 08:42.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the majority of that and the
large loss
of life has been due to storm
surge events

08:42.856 --> 08:44.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
followed by heavy rainfall.

08:44.691 --> 08:49.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wind is actually not as deadly
as people think
it is, although they tend to
look at the wind

08:49.129 --> 08:51.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
field and look at that as a
risk.

08:51.531 --> 08:56.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What has historically killed
people in past
from hurricanes has been water,
storm surge.

08:56.503 --> 08:59.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That coastal flooding has been
the leading
cause of death.

08:59.973 --> 09:03.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why we're so adamant
about getting
people to evacuate.

09:03.476 --> 09:07.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We spend a lot of time and
resources to map
those areas ahead of time.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it only works if people heed
those evacuations
and go to higher ground.

09:10.483 --> 09:13.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How many people
would you say
-- there are so many tourist
destinations

09:13.953 --> 09:19.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this particular stretch of
the coast -- will
be stranded tonight as a result
or tomorrow?

09:19.225 --> 09:23.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CRAIG FUGATE: Well, they
shouldn't be stranded,
because, again, a lot of times,
as we work

09:23.396 --> 09:29.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the local levels -- and this
is something
that when I was in the county in
Gainesville.

09:29.202 --> 09:32.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We used to worked with the
hotels and motels,
like when we would have football
games.

09:32.105 --> 09:37.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And most recently, we just got
the update
that the Florida-LSU game is
going to be postponed.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We look at our tourist as some
of the groups
we need to get out early.

09:39.712 --> 09:42.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Many times, they don't know the
plan.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't know where to go.

09:44.417 --> 09:48.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we work with the local
visitors and convention
bureaus to make sure they get
out safely,

09:48.555 --> 09:51.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because that's one of the things
we have learned
in the tourism business.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The safety of our guests is of
paramount importance.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We want them to get to safety
first.

09:55.628 --> 09:59.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will get the rest of the
population out
and then we get ready to start
the recovery

09:59.265 --> 10:01.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

scaled back

10:22.188 --> 10:28.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

10:28.328 --> 10:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

10:47.447 --> 10:49.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on Syrian army positions.

10:49.616 --> 10:53.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One should realize that Russian

so-called honor

11:13.439 --> 11:15.341 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
killings.

11:15.375 --> 11:19.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 1,000 Pakistani women
were murdered
last year by male relatives,
mostly for marrying

11:19.612 --> 11:21.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or dating without the family's
approval.

11:21.781 --> 11:24.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Current law allowed most of the
killers to

11:35.295 --> 11:38.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The proposal had sparked mass

The Nasdaq fell nine points.

12:52.672 --> 12:55.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The S&amp;P 500 added one.

Rod Temperton was 66 years old.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we will always remember that
song.

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the presidential
candidates' starkly different
views on guns;

13:52.999 --> 13:58.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why universities pay millions of
dollars to

some are calling

13:58.705 --> 14:13.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a turning point in the fight

14:58.998 --> 15:00.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and never giving up.

15:00.600 --> 15:05.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I want our success to be
measured by theirs.

15:05.571 --> 15:10.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: What does electing
Donald Trump
president mean for you?

15:10.109 --> 15:15.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Families making $60,000 a year,
you get a
20 percent tax rate reduction.

15:15.248 --> 15:20.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Working moms, you get paid
maternity leave
and an average $5,000 child care
tax reduction.

15:20.953 --> 15:26.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the
running mates
were on the road in
Pennsylvania.

15:26.225 --> 15:29.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican Mike Pence toured the
Civil War
battlefield at Gettysburg.

15:29.962 --> 15:37.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier, on NBC's "Today Show,"
he defended
his repeated denials, in Monday
night's debate,

15:37.069 --> 15:38.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of past statements by Donald
Trump.

GOV.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
And the mischaracterizations and
the way Tim

15:42.742 --> 15:47.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kaine and Hillary Clinton
continue to take
Donald Trump's statements out of
context,

15:47.180 --> 15:49.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was something I just wasn't
going to tolerate
during the debate.

15:49.982 --> 15:55.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton's number
two, Tim Kaine,
campaigned in Pittsburgh,
exhorting supporters

15:55.721 --> 15:57.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to keep Trump out of the White
House.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.392 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:59.425 --> 16:01.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
There's no room for second place
here.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no room for doubt here.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no silver medal in this
one.

16:06.365 --> 16:08.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We got to get the gold medal.

16:08.301 --> 16:12.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, "The
Atlantic" offered
its endorsement in the
presidential campaign,

16:12.638 --> 16:18.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only the third time it's done
so, after Abraham
Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson.

16:18.511 --> 16:25.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The magazine backed Clinton and
branded Trump
-- quote -- "the most
ostentatiously unqualified

16:25.084 --> 16:28.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
major party candidate in
history."

16:28.187 --> 16:34.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, 30 former Republican
members of Congress
published a letter urging
Republicans not

16:34.727 --> 16:36.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to vote for Trump.

16:36.662 --> 16:41.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neither Trump nor Clinton has
any public events
scheduled for tomorrow, ahead of
Sunday night's

16:41.868 --> 16:44.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
debate in Saint Louis.

16:44.303 --> 16:49.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And late today, France's
President Francois
Hollande said that he hopes
Hillary Clinton

16:49.342 --> 16:50.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wins in November.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He told a Paris audience, "There
isn't even
a choice."

16:53.579 --> 16:57.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now we continue our
series on
issues shaping this election.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tonight, we focus on guns.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

17:01.888 --> 17:07.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In their first
debate, a rare moment
of harmony, as the two
presidential candidates

17:07.627 --> 17:10.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually agreed on a highly
contentious subject:
guns.

17:10.997 --> 17:16.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
We finally need to pass a
prohibition on anyone

17:16.335 --> 17:20.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who's on the terrorist watch
list from being
able to buy a gun in our
country.

17:20.806 --> 17:24.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're too dangerous to fly,
you are too
dangerous to buy a gun.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I agree with you.

17:25.978 --> 17:29.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When a person is on a watch list
or a no-fly
list -- and I have the
endorsement of the

17:29.782 --> 17:32.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NRA, which I'm very proud of.

17:32.084 --> 17:35.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are very, very good
people, and they're
protecting the Second Amendment.

17:35.254 --> 17:39.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think we have to look very
strongly
at no-fly lists and watch lists.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But that's where the
agreement
ends.

17:42.328 --> 17:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is running as a
strong defender
of gun rights and says Hillary
Clinton wants

17:47.400 --> 17:49.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to take guns away.

17:49.568 --> 17:53.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last month, Trump said, if
Clinton wants to
restrict access to guns, she
should start

17:53.973 --> 17:55.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with her Secret Service detail.

17:55.808 --> 18:00.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I think that her
bodyguards
should drop all weapons.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They should disarm, right?

18:02.882 --> 18:03.950 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

18:03.983 --> 18:06.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think they should disarm
immediately.

18:06.552 --> 18:07.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you think?

18:07.553 --> 18:09.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She doesn't want guns.

18:09.055 --> 18:11.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Take their -- let's see what
happens to her.

18:11.190 --> 18:15.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Take their guns away.

18:15.461 --> 18:21.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The National Rifle
Association
is running ads supporting Trump.

18:21.867 --> 18:24.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: She keeps a firearm in
this safe
for protection.

18:24.570 --> 18:30.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Hillary Clinton could take
away her right
to self-defense, and, with
Supreme Court justices,

18:30.643 --> 18:31.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hillary can.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clinton says she just
wants tougher
gun control.

18:34.146 --> 18:39.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I'm not
here to repeal
the Second Amendment.

18:39.785 --> 18:43.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not here to take away your
guns.

18:43.289 --> 18:50.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just don't want you to be shot
by someone
who shouldn't have a gun in the
first place.

18:50.196 --> 18:52.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

18:52.131 --> 18:56.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: She vows to expand
background checks
for gun buyers by closing the
Internet sales

18:56.235 --> 19:01.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and gun show loopholes, using
executive orders
if Congress won't act.

19:01.607 --> 19:05.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After the Pulse nightclub
shooting in Orlando,
Clinton doubled down.

19:05.277 --> 19:10.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I
believe weapons
of war have no place on our
streets.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

19:12.551 --> 19:20.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: And we
may have our
disagreements about gun safety
regulations,

19:20.192 --> 19:24.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but we should all be able to
agree on a few
essential things.

19:24.630 --> 19:30.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clinton has used
urban gun violence
to give urgency and a human face
to her call

19:30.202 --> 19:32.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for stricter gun control.

19:32.138 --> 19:37.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier this year, she spoke at
a fund-raiser
for the Circle of Mothers, a
group that supports

19:37.676 --> 19:41.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women whose children have been
killed by gun
violence.

19:41.113 --> 19:44.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, she spoke about the
issue at a
black church in Charlotte, North
Carolina.

19:44.717 --> 19:51.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: We have
to fight for
commonsense reforms to stop the
epidemic of

19:51.290 --> 19:54.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gun violence in our communities.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.262 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

19:56.295 --> 20:03.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Gun
violence is by
far the leading cause of death
for young black

20:03.269 --> 20:07.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
men, more than the next nine
causes combined.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Adam Winkler is a
UCLA Law professor.

20:10.342 --> 20:14.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ADAM WINKLER, UCLA Law
Professor: All of Secretary
Clinton's proposals are at the
very top of

20:14.380 --> 20:19.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the gun control agenda,
universal background
checks, restrictions on assault
weapons, and

20:19.718 --> 20:21.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things like a no-buy list for
terrorists.

20:21.520 --> 20:26.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Trump opposes
restrictions on assault
weapons and increased background
checks.

20:26.559 --> 20:31.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says if a gun owner has a
permit to carry
a concealed weapon, it should
apply nationwide.

20:31.597 --> 20:37.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ADAM WINKLER: It would
effectively mean that
a state that has the easiest,
loosest, most

20:37.269 --> 20:42.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
permissive carry laws will set
the laws for
the entire nation.

20:42.508 --> 20:48.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This would be a radical reform
of America's
gun laws, undermining states'
right and lead

20:48.514 --> 20:51.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to far more people carrying
guns.

20:51.750 --> 20:56.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Immediately after the
Pulse nightclub,
Trump said more guns would have
helped.

20:56.589 --> 21:01.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: If you had some
guns in that
club the night that this took
place, if you

21:01.894 --> 21:05.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had guns on the other side, you
wouldn't have
had the tragedy that you had.

21:05.164 --> 21:09.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: After the Sandy Hook
school shooting,
Trump tweeted that President
Obama's call

21:09.368 --> 21:14.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for stricter gun control spoke
for him and
every American.

21:14.039 --> 21:18.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now Trump wants to eliminate
gun-free zones
around schools and parks.

21:18.911 --> 21:24.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fate of either candidates'
proposals is
likely to rest with whoever
controls Congress.

21:24.183 --> 21:29.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, no matter who wins the White
House in
November, the battle over gun
control isn't

21:29.855 --> 21:31.524 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
likely to end.

21:31.557 --> 21:33.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

21:33.826 --> 21:38.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This week,
Longwood University
in rural Virginia took its turn
under the

21:38.931 --> 21:41.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hot lights of the presidential
campaign.

21:41.567 --> 21:46.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we unpack the decision
and the kind
of money that goes into choosing
which schools

21:46.939 --> 21:51.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
host a debate, and what remains
when everyone
leaves campus.

21:51.477 --> 21:56.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Roben
Farzad has this
week's Making Sense, which airs
every Thursday.

21:56.515 --> 22:02.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ROBEN FARZAD: Farmville,
Virginia, has a population
of just over 8,000.

22:02.855 --> 22:07.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that swelled this week as
hordes of journalists,
political operatives and
security details

22:07.626 --> 22:12.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crammed into town and onto
Longwood University.

22:12.698 --> 22:18.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Staging a debate broadcast to 37
million viewers
brings the kind of media
spotlight most colleges

22:18.304 --> 22:20.039 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cannot fathom.

22:20.072 --> 22:21.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Many just can't afford it.

22:21.974 --> 22:27.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But past debate site hosts
estimate the attention
is equivalent to $45 million to
$50 million

22:27.379 --> 22:29.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of paid advertising.

22:29.215 --> 22:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAYLOR REVELEY, President,
Longwood University:
Hosting one of these crucial
debates is a

22:32.351 --> 22:34.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
genuinely once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

22:34.687 --> 22:39.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Longwood President
Taylor Reveley
is a presidential scholar
himself and the

22:39.391 --> 22:42.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
third member of his family to
run a Virginia
university.

22:42.695 --> 22:48.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The debate cost Longwood, a
public institution,
about $5.5 million, including $2
million paid

22:48.701 --> 22:50.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the Commission on
Presidential Debates.

22:50.903 --> 22:56.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says that specially earmarked
fund-raising,
not student fees or scholarship
funds, financed

22:56.375 --> 23:01.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Longwood's debate effort, adding
that the
buzz around the debate increased
the number

23:01.080 --> 23:03.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of alumni donors by almost 25
percent this
year.

23:04.016 --> 23:11.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAYLOR REVELEY: The general
election season
is like a Super Bowl buy, but,
in reality,

23:11.357 --> 23:13.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's much more than that.

23:13.225 --> 23:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For our students, this is a
genuinely once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to see history
unfold.

23:21.100 --> 23:25.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It takes a volunteer army to
pull off this
kind of event.

23:25.704 --> 23:31.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So much of the rest of the world
would deeply
envy to have candidates in a
democracy showing

23:32.011 --> 23:34.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up on a stage together shaking
hands.

23:34.280 --> 23:37.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: This is town where
a lot has
happened.

23:37.650 --> 23:43.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From colonial times to the Civil
War to the
civil rights movement, Farmville
and Longwood

23:43.188 --> 23:46.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
University have been no
strangers to history.

23:46.525 --> 23:51.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 1865, Confederate General
Robert E. Lee
surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant
just up the

23:51.864 --> 23:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
road at Appomattox Court House.

23:54.166 --> 23:58.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A century later, in a defining
showdown of
the civil rights movement, black
high school

23:58.537 --> 24:03.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students protesting segregation
joined the
landmark Supreme Court case
Brown v. Board

24:03.442 --> 24:05.010 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Education.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Janet Brown heads the Commission
on Presidential
Debates.

24:06.845 --> 24:09.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANET BROWN, Executive Director,
Commission
on Presidential Debates: These
are historic.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.317 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Each is unique.

24:11.350 --> 24:13.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are memorable.

24:13.285 --> 24:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They give the students, as well
as the university
or college community, a chance
to participate

24:18.023 --> 24:20.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in something unlike anything
else that they
will see.

24:20.492 --> 24:24.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Up to five dozen
schools apply
to hold one of these debates
every general

24:24.797 --> 24:26.432 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're a winner, you pay the
commission
production fees and a whole lot
more.

24:30.002 --> 24:34.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This summer, Wright State pulled
out of the
running to host the first
presidential debate,

24:34.139 --> 24:36.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
citing worries about costs and
security.

24:36.308 --> 24:40.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In its place, Hofstra University
hosted its
third debate.

24:40.279 --> 24:43.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brown says there are returns to
a school beyond
the bottom line.

24:43.148 --> 24:46.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANET BROWN: There are returns
on reputation
certainly for the school.

24:46.085 --> 24:50.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will tell you one that is not
well-covered,
and I find it fascinating.

24:50.189 --> 24:55.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is an example of management
and leadership,
in terms of the team effort that
is required

24:55.461 --> 24:57.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to put this together.

24:57.196 --> 25:00.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Centre College in
Danville,
Kentucky, thought the experience
of hosting

25:00.933 --> 25:06.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the vice presidential debate in
2000 was so
worthwhile that it came back for
seconds in

25:06.839 --> 25:08.640 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2012.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Centre College continues to
benefit, according
to the school spokesman Michael
Strysick.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL STRYSICK, Spokesperson,
Centre College:
The debate keeps on giving.

25:13.412 --> 25:18.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A year later, two years later,
if the candidates
are in the news, they end up
using photos

25:18.917 --> 25:22.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the debate that end up
providing media
value.

25:22.421 --> 25:28.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I would caution to debate
hosts is to
not look for an immediate return
on the investment,

25:28.927 --> 25:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but perhaps to be mindful of
what Ben Franklin
called the eighth wonder of the
world, compound

25:34.633 --> 25:36.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interest.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Assuming, of
course, the candidates
remember the name of your
school.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.139 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

25:40.172 --> 25:40.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
Thank you to Norwood University
for their

25:40.739 --> 25:42.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wonderful hospitality.

25:42.674 --> 25:46.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Even before
Pence's flub, veteran
ad executive John Adams tempered
talk of return

25:46.612 --> 25:49.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on investment, audience reach,
and media impressions.

25:49.181 --> 25:52.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN ADAMS, Advertising
Executive: Longwood
is not the star of the show
here.

25:52.684 --> 25:53.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Longwood is the setting.

25:53.952 --> 25:55.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Longwood is the venue.

25:55.721 --> 25:58.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, there's a great deal
of name awareness
that gets built as a result of
it.

25:58.957 --> 26:02.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will see beautiful
pictures of the
university and so forth.

26:02.928 --> 26:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the real test is, what does
that name
awareness and what does -- the
rub-off, positive

26:07.599 --> 26:09.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rub-off over time?

26:09.201 --> 26:12.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: The same holds
true for the
potential boost to town
commerce.

26:12.304 --> 26:17.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I stopped by Uptown Coffee Cafe
in Farmville
and talked to owner Jason
Mattox.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you stockpile?

26:18.510 --> 26:20.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you prepare for something
that's largely
unknown?

26:20.579 --> 26:22.347 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do you buy?

26:22.381 --> 26:24.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON MATTOX, Owner, Uptown
Coffee Cafe: We
have had our kitchen manager
really prepare

26:24.249 --> 26:25.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the back.

26:25.717 --> 26:27.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have got extra cheese slices.

26:27.052 --> 26:30.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have got extra deli meats
ready.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have put a shed out back for
our disposables.

26:32.624 --> 26:34.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We ordered extra coffee beans.

26:34.393 --> 26:39.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Either we're going to be really
prepared and
never run out, or we're going to
scrape the

26:39.865 --> 26:40.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bottom.

26:40.866 --> 26:42.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm hoping we will scrape
the bottom.

26:42.835 --> 26:49.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Back on campus,
organizers were
pulling out all the stops, from
voter registration,

26:49.942 --> 26:55.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to academic lectures on the
foundations of
democracy, to engaging all ages
in the presidential

26:55.180 --> 27:00.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election, from preschoolers to
high-schoolers
from around the state, to
raffling tickets

27:00.252 --> 27:04.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the actual debate, and a tour
of the area's
civil rights landmarks.

27:04.823 --> 27:09.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joy Cabarrus Speakes was one of
the students
who walked out of Farmville's
Moton High School.

27:10.028 --> 27:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was considered the student
birthplace of
America's civil rights movement
for providing

27:14.566 --> 27:18.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a majority of the plaintiffs in
the Brown
v. Board of Education case.

27:18.036 --> 27:19.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The debate put a spotlight on
that history.

27:19.905 --> 27:22.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOY CABARRUS SPEAKES,
Participated in Moton
High School Walkout: It's
bringing a lot of

27:22.774 --> 27:28.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information on the civil rights
movement to
the nation, because a lot of
people never

27:28.046 --> 27:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even knew about Prince Edward
County.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They never knew about the story.

27:32.284 --> 27:36.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now it's going to bring it front
and center,
you know, to the world.

27:36.221 --> 27:37.756 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

27:37.789 --> 27:39.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
This is a very special place.

27:39.691 --> 27:43.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBEN FARZAD: In fact,
Democratic vice presidential
candidate Tim Kaine made
reference to that

27:43.061 --> 27:44.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rich history at the debate.

27:44.296 --> 27:45.898 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

27:45.931 --> 27:49.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE: Barbara Johns led a
walkout of
her high school, Moton High
School.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She made history by protesting
school segregation.

27:52.004 --> 27:56.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: It's that kind of
civic and
academic engagement that
Longwood's president

27:56.441 --> 27:58.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hopes will keep paying
dividends.

27:58.110 --> 28:02.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAYLOR REVELEY: We have been in
the midst
of revising our core curriculum,
which is

28:02.281 --> 28:05.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a process that runs a number of
years.

28:05.183 --> 28:09.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had been working on it for 18
months before
we knew about the debate.

28:09.321 --> 28:16.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we have used the debate
to essentially
run pilot courses for what the
new curriculum

28:16.295 --> 28:20.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's really going to have
citizenship as
its North Star.

28:20.132 --> 28:26.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: After spending
millions in two
years on debate planning,
Longwood is banking

28:26.171 --> 28:28.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the country remembering its
name.

28:28.540 --> 28:32.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Farmville, Virginia, I'm
Roben Farzad for
the "PBS NewsHour."

28:32.077 --> 28:36.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Online, we have your
guide to
what to watch for in the
presidential debate

28:36.615 --> 28:39.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sunday at Washington University
in Saint Louis.

28:39.484 --> 28:44.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have special live
coverage beginning
at 9:00 p.m. Eastern.

28:44.056 --> 28:48.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LLOYD BENTSEN (D), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
Senator, you are no Jack
Kennedy.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERALDINE FERRARO (D), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
I almost resent, Vice President
Bush, your

28:50.596 --> 28:51.997 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
patronizing...

28:52.030 --> 28:53.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITT ROMNEY (R), Presidential
Candidate: Whole
binders full of women.

28:53.865 --> 28:55.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL DUKAKIS (D),
Presidential Candidate:
That I have opposed the death
penalty during

28:55.167 --> 28:56.969 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all of my life.

28:57.002 --> 29:01.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Interact with all the
general election
debates on our Web site,
watchthedebates.org.

29:01.473 --> 29:04.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

29:04.843 --> 29:10.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
role drug
companies play in the opioid
epidemic; Stephen

29:10.182 --> 29:16.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
King reveals his writing
process; and a man
uses his own tragedy to help
others facing

29:16.188 --> 29:18.023 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
death.

29:18.056 --> 29:22.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: The international
climate agreement
is set to take effect next month
after enough

29:22.561 --> 29:26.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries pushed it past a key
threshold this
week.

29:26.431 --> 29:29.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The European Parliament voted to
ratify the
accord.

29:29.501 --> 29:35.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means that more than 60
countries, accounting
for at least 55 percent of the
world's greenhouse

29:35.073 --> 29:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gas emissions, have ratified it.

29:37.309 --> 29:42.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The agreement, reached in Paris
less than
a year ago, aims to lessen the
effects of

29:42.080 --> 29:43.415 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
climate change.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the commitments are
voluntary.

29:45.917 --> 29:49.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama, who pushed for
the deal,
hailed the moment in the Rose
Garden yesterday.

29:49.821 --> 29:53.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Today's a historic day in the
fight to protect

29:53.325 --> 29:56.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
our planet for future
generations.

29:56.595 --> 30:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ten months ago in Paris, I said
before the
world that we needed a strong
global agreement

30:02.000 --> 30:07.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to reduce carbon pollution and
to set the
world on a low-carbon course.

30:07.239 --> 30:12.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the Paris agreement alone
will not solve
the climate crisis.

30:12.844 --> 30:19.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if we meet every target
embodied in the
agreement, we will only get to
part of where

30:19.284 --> 30:21.119 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we need to go.

30:21.153 --> 30:26.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But make no mistake, this
agreement will help
delay or avoid some of the worst
consequences

30:26.958 --> 30:28.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of climate change.

30:28.226 --> 30:31.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton
also supports
the accord.

30:31.096 --> 30:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Donald Trump has said he
would withdraw
from it and he called it a bad
deal.

30:36.001 --> 30:40.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, his deputy
policy director
wrote it -- quote -- "ignores
the reality

30:40.372 --> 30:44.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it will cost the American
economy trillions
of dollars.

30:44.142 --> 30:49.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will also impose enormous
costs on American
households through higher
electricity prices

30:49.581 --> 30:51.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and higher taxes.

30:51.216 --> 30:54.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More of our coal miners will be
forced out
of work."

30:54.386 --> 30:58.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We look closer now at what takes
effect under
the treaty, the limits of what
can be done,

30:58.724 --> 31:02.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and what climate science says
about carbon
dioxide and warming.

31:02.828 --> 31:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gavin Schmidt is a climatologist
and he's
the director of NASA's Goddard
Institute for

31:08.433 --> 31:09.468 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Space Studies.

31:09.501 --> 31:12.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gavin Schmidt, welcome to the
"NewsHour."

31:12.704 --> 31:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is the significance of this
accord, when
even the president of the United
States, who's

31:17.375 --> 31:20.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a supporter, says it's only
going to get us
part of the way we need to go?

31:20.879 --> 31:24.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAVIN SCHMIDT, Director, NASA
Goddard Institute
for Space Studies: Well, like
the old proverb

31:24.149 --> 31:29.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says, a journey of 1,000 miles
starts with
a single global agreement.

31:29.421 --> 31:31.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is where we're at.

31:31.189 --> 31:36.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have an agreement now that
encompasses
-- that's in effect that
encompasses every

31:36.428 --> 31:38.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
country in the world.

31:38.296 --> 31:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every country in the world is
thinking that
this is something that they need
to get behind.

31:41.967 --> 31:50.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every country has promised to
reduce emissions
to the level that they signed up
for.

31:50.142 --> 31:55.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While President Obama is correct
that, in
and of itself, this is not going
to stop global

31:55.647 --> 31:59.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
warming, that's a much bigger
task.

31:59.217 --> 32:01.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this is a step in that right
direction.

32:01.553 --> 32:09.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what the hope is, is that,
with experience,
with seeing the best practices
that other

32:09.594 --> 32:15.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries have adopted, great
ideas, new technologies,
that people will be able to
increase their

32:15.700 --> 32:21.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commitments under this agreement
at each of
the next update stages, which
come every few

32:21.406 --> 32:23.208 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

32:23.241 --> 32:25.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But how do you --
how confident
are you, though, that you are
going to be

32:25.644 --> 32:31.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to even take that baby
step, when you
still have critics out there
saying things

32:31.283 --> 32:36.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like, this is going to raise
people's electricity
bills, fundamental costs of
living, that it's

32:37.022 --> 32:39.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to take jobs away in the
fossil fuel
industry?

32:39.891 --> 32:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAVIN SCHMIDT: So, but then
there are jobs
going to be created in renewable
fuels.

32:44.596 --> 32:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are going to be jobs
created in new
technologies that are more
efficient.

32:48.400 --> 32:55.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are many different things
that are happening,
both in building resiliency to
future climate

32:55.373 --> 33:01.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change, but also building the
infrastructure
of the future that is ongoing
right now.

33:01.913 --> 33:09.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you can get a little bit
caught up
with the supposed balance
between the economy

33:09.287 --> 33:10.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or the environment.

33:10.956 --> 33:14.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that these things
actually aren't
opposed, for the most part.

33:14.960 --> 33:19.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, this week,
Gavin Schmidt,
we saw one of the world's most
important sites

33:19.531 --> 33:26.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for measuring carbon dioxide
levels tell us
levels now recently have risen
above a symbolically

33:26.171 --> 33:30.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
important figure of 400 parts
per million.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was a site in Hawaii.

33:32.143 --> 33:33.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GAVIN SCHMIDT: That's right.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They say it's
likely to stay
that way for the indefinite
future.

33:35.280 --> 33:38.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I guess my question is, how
important is this?

33:38.783 --> 33:45.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, as scientists work on
this issue,
do you feel it's just a constant
uphill battle?

33:45.156 --> 33:48.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAVIN SCHMIDT: So, you have to
remember what
the context is here.

33:48.793 --> 33:52.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The pre-industrial level, so
where we were
in the 19th century, was 280
parts per million;

33:53.031 --> 33:59.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
400 parts per million is a 40
percent increase
over that, and this is a level
that hasn't

33:59.371 --> 34:05.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been seen in the climate since
perhaps the
Pliocene period, which was three
million years

34:05.076 --> 34:06.044 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

34:06.077 --> 34:07.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, in other
words...

34:07.078 --> 34:08.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GAVIN SCHMIDT: It's a big deal.

34:08.813 --> 34:14.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're saying
it's a big
deal, but you can't get
discouraged about

34:14.052 --> 34:15.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
something like that?

34:15.921 --> 34:25.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAVIN SCHMIDT: Well, so, what's
happening
is that we are already a
geological force

34:25.430 --> 34:27.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the climate.

34:27.232 --> 34:31.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, the fingerprint of
human activity
on the climate, not just in
carbon dioxide,

34:31.102 --> 34:35.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but in many, many other aspects,
is very,
very clear.

34:35.774 --> 34:40.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The agreements like the Paris
agreement and
efforts that are going on not
just at the

34:40.545 --> 34:46.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national, but at the state and
city and individual
levels, are attempts to kind of
make that

34:46.885 --> 34:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not quite as large an impact as
we have already
had.

34:50.989 --> 34:53.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it's a tough vote.

34:53.325 --> 35:00.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, to stabilize, so just to
keep carbon
dioxide levels at the same level
in perpetuity,

35:00.765 --> 35:04.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
we would need to reduce
emissions by 80 percent
globally.

35:04.436 --> 35:08.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a huge task, and it's not
something
that's going to be accomplished
today, or

35:08.406 --> 35:10.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tomorrow or in one electoral
cycle.

35:10.442 --> 35:15.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, at a time,
Mr. Schmidt,
when I think many of us
certainly in the United

35:15.447 --> 35:23.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States are focused on this big
hurricane heading
for the United States mainland,
this has to

35:23.421 --> 35:27.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
give -- and we know scientists
have spoken
about this, these big storms,
the concern

35:27.425 --> 35:29.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they're going to get even
bigger.

35:29.227 --> 35:31.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GAVIN SCHMIDT: Right.

35:31.096 --> 35:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How should
Americans and others
think about climate change in
the face of

35:35.367 --> 35:36.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
something like this?

35:36.668 --> 35:39.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAVIN SCHMIDT: So, one of the
key things is
sea level rise.

35:39.838 --> 35:46.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, sea level has risen about 10
foot, is
actually rising faster on the
Eastern Seaboard

35:46.344 --> 35:48.079 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than elsewhere.

35:48.113 --> 35:53.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For every extra foot of sea
level rise, a
storm surge, even if the climate
of storms

35:53.852 --> 35:57.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doesn't change, the storm surge
has more damage.

35:57.455 --> 36:01.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is many, many thresholds,
that, you
know, if the water rises five
foot, you're

36:01.760 --> 36:07.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fine, but if it goes up six
feet, then it
overtops a levee, it over -- it
floods a subway.

36:07.132 --> 36:09.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It has much greater damages.

36:09.534 --> 36:16.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, sea level rise is one of
those aspects
of change that multiply the
damages that are

36:16.041 --> 36:22.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
caused by just the natural
variation of climate
and the natural variation of
hurricanes and

36:22.280 --> 36:24.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
storms that we see.

36:24.115 --> 36:30.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, we have some expectation
that hurricanes
themselves and storms themselves
will become

36:30.055 --> 36:34.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more intense, perhaps less
frequent, but more
intense, and then that,
obviously, adds to

36:34.859 --> 36:36.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the damages as well.

36:36.961 --> 36:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's an
occasion to think
about all of this and to think
about the interconnection.

36:41.766 --> 36:45.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gavin Schmidt with the Goddard
Institute for
Space Studies, we thank you.

36:45.437 --> 36:50.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GAVIN SCHMIDT: Thank you very
much.

36:50.475 --> 37:02.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The abuse of opioids
remains a
major public health concern
around the country.

37:02.954 --> 37:08.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The federal government says more
than 28,000
people died by overdose in 2014.

37:08.259 --> 37:10.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the most recent year for
nationwide
data.

37:11.029 --> 37:16.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The health news site STAT has
been reporting
on the problem and what has been
driving it.

37:16.234 --> 37:19.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Journalist David Armstrong sat
down with Hari
Sreenivasan recently.

37:19.304 --> 37:23.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David, your
investigation
looks at a number of big
pharmaceutical countries

37:23.675 --> 37:28.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you say helped sow the
seeds for some
of this epidemic that we have
today.

37:28.146 --> 37:29.848 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
How so?

37:29.881 --> 37:35.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ARMSTRONG, STAT: Well, the
way they
sowed the seeds was by making
this drug widely

37:35.053 --> 37:36.688 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
used.

37:36.721 --> 37:40.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the way they did that was to
downplay
the addictive properties of this
drug when

37:40.992 --> 37:46.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marketing it to doctors, in a
way that was
later shown to be false and
misleading.

37:46.097 --> 37:50.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, doctors
can prescribe
drugs off-label for something
that it wasn't

37:50.902 --> 37:55.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
originally designed to, but how
were the pharma
companies abusing this?

37:55.373 --> 38:00.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ARMSTRONG: Well, they were
primarily
abusing it in the way they were
assuring doctors

38:00.678 --> 38:07.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that these powerful opioids that
are a controlled
substance would not be addictive
in the way

38:07.585 --> 38:12.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they later proved to be
addictive and
could be used for things like
chronic pain,

38:12.757 --> 38:15.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which we now know they're not
very effective
at.

38:15.860 --> 38:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they were able to broaden the
market through
a series of misrepresentations
and through

38:21.799 --> 38:23.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a series of aggressive marketing
tactics.

38:23.701 --> 38:25.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How much money
are we talking
about?

38:25.670 --> 38:27.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did they stand to gain?

38:27.038 --> 38:30.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID ARMSTRONG: Well, let's
just look at
OxyContin.

38:30.975 --> 38:37.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When that came on the market in
1996, sales
of the drug were about $50
million.

38:37.115 --> 38:43.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By 2002, sales of this drug were
$1.6 billion,
and they have continued at that
clip ever

38:43.955 --> 38:47.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since, exceeding well over $30
billion in
sales.

38:47.358 --> 38:48.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's just one drug.

38:48.860 --> 38:53.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that gives you an idea of the
scale here
of the amount of money involved.

38:53.631 --> 38:58.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You were also
able to take
a look at documents through
Freedom of Information

38:58.269 --> 39:06.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Act requests that were sealed
that show how
these drugs were being marketed.

39:06.311 --> 39:07.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Explain that.

39:07.312 --> 39:09.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID ARMSTRONG: Yes.

39:09.314 --> 39:13.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one of the interesting
things is, in the
case of OxyContin, Purdue
Pharma, which manufactures

39:13.484 --> 39:19.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the drug, and its partner in
marketing at
Abbott Laboratories, they were
sued over 1,000

39:19.591 --> 39:24.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
times collectively for problems
related to
this drug.

39:24.462 --> 39:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in a lot of those cases, in
fact, the
vast majority of them, the
documents involved

39:29.167 --> 39:32.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in those cases were either
destroyed or sealed.

39:32.470 --> 39:36.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we have been trying to unseal
some of those
in several jurisdictions, and we
have been

39:36.474 --> 39:38.109 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
successful.

39:38.142 --> 39:41.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in West Virginia, for
instance, we saw
some of the tactics that Abbott
used.

39:41.846 --> 39:45.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They did things like a
dine-and-dash program.

39:45.250 --> 39:50.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is where they would meet a
doctor at
a restaurant, pay for his
takeout order, and

39:50.121 --> 39:54.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
while waiting to pay for the
order, sell him
on the benefits of OxyContin.

39:54.892 --> 39:59.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we wrote about a
doctor, a surgeon
who had a sweet tooth, a
fondness for junk

39:59.264 --> 40:01.132 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
food.

40:01.165 --> 40:05.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these salespeople brought
him a sheet
cake filled with donuts and
snack cakes spelled

40:05.036 --> 40:07.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out to say OxyContin.

40:07.372 --> 40:09.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that did the trick.

40:09.173 --> 40:12.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was interested in hearing
more about the
drug at that point, and they
would go back

40:12.410 --> 40:15.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every week and get him to switch
patients
over to OxyContin.

40:15.813 --> 40:17.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those are just a few of the
things.

40:17.282 --> 40:19.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the sales
reps were
rewarded for these tactics?

40:19.717 --> 40:22.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID ARMSTRONG: Very
generously.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were rewarded with luxury
trips.

40:24.856 --> 40:31.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were $20,000 scratch
tickets that were
sent out to them as rewards.

40:31.663 --> 40:36.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the compensation was very
lucrative to
get these doctors to switch
patients to these

40:36.968 --> 40:38.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
powerful opioids.

40:38.636 --> 40:43.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There are
people who do
need significant pain
medications.

40:43.574 --> 40:46.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, they're the ones who
kind of get the
short end of the stick as this
abuse happens.

40:46.844 --> 40:49.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the government's role in
oversight
of this?

40:49.781 --> 40:54.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ARMSTRONG: Well, you're
now seeing,
because we're dealing with a
public health

40:54.385 --> 41:00.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crisis -- we have tens of
thousands of people
dying each year now from these
overdoses.

41:00.625 --> 41:05.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're seeing governments, state
governments
in particular, move to restrict
the prescription,

41:05.863 --> 41:10.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
primarily in making sure that
prescriptions
are a limited number of days.

41:10.335 --> 41:14.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before, they would be 30, 60
days, and there
would be plenty of pills left
over.

41:14.706 --> 41:15.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And those would get misused.

41:15.940 --> 41:19.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that's one way, and also
educating prescribers.

41:19.777 --> 41:25.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Nobody wants to see a
prohibition of painkillers
for people who need them, but
one of the keys

41:25.616 --> 41:30.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is to make sure doctors are
educated in who
truly need them and they are
prescribing the

41:30.288 --> 41:32.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right amount and the right drug.

41:32.056 --> 41:35.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
David Armstrong
of STAT joining us from Boston,
thanks so

41:35.426 --> 41:36.394 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

41:36.427 --> 41:39.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID ARMSTRONG: Thank you.

41:39.931 --> 41:53.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: He is the author of
"Carrie,"
"The Shining, "Misery," and so
many more classic

41:53.444 --> 41:55.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and frightening tales.

41:55.413 --> 42:00.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the latest addition to the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf,
Stephen King, master of the
supernatural and

42:00.518 --> 42:04.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suspense, reflects on the art of
writing and
his latest novel, "End of
Watch."

42:04.956 --> 42:08.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spoke with Jeffrey Brown
recently at the
National Book Festival here in
Washington

42:08.726 --> 42:11.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "End of Watch,"
the end of
a trilogy, right?

42:11.963 --> 42:13.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN KING, Author, "End of
Watch": Yes.

42:13.664 --> 42:16.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Does a trilogy
start life as
a trilogy?

42:16.734 --> 42:18.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN KING: That's a very good
question.

42:18.069 --> 42:19.771 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Actually, no.

42:19.804 --> 42:26.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought that the first book in
the trilogy,
"Mr. Mercedes," would be the
only book.

42:26.477 --> 42:31.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I kind of didn't want to let
the characters
go, the main characters.

42:31.382 --> 42:37.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I had an idea for another
book, and realized
when I was working on that that
I had unfinished

42:37.488 --> 42:38.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
business from the first book.

42:38.923 --> 42:41.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I had a nice rounded quality,
the three
of them.

42:41.692 --> 42:44.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So you didn't
know where you
were heading, right?

42:44.529 --> 42:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, did you know -- even
when you start
a character in the first book,
Mr. Mercedes,

42:49.600 --> 42:51.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do you know where that was
going?

42:51.135 --> 42:52.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEPHEN KING: No, I didn't.

42:52.770 --> 42:53.738 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:53.771 --> 42:54.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: ... with you?

42:54.772 --> 42:56.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You don't know where -- you
don't know?

42:56.541 --> 43:01.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN KING: I very rarely --
sometimes,
I have an idea of how the book
will finish

43:01.813 --> 43:06.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up, but it very rarely finishes
up the way
that I think it's going to.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to go where the book
leads you.

43:08.052 --> 43:09.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

43:09.053 --> 43:10.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what about a character?

43:10.888 --> 43:16.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN KING: There is a
novelist called Thomas
Williams, who's passed on now,
and he said

43:16.661 --> 43:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the idea for a novel is
like a little
tiny fire in a dark night.

43:22.567 --> 43:26.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, one by one, the characters
come and stand
around it and warm their hands.

43:26.804 --> 43:30.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have always thought that's
the perfect
metaphor for how it works.

43:30.575 --> 43:32.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Come around
together and warm
their hands.

43:32.577 --> 43:33.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN KING: They stand around
the fire.

43:33.945 --> 43:35.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And little by little, the fire
grows.

43:35.880 --> 43:37.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you see them more clearly.

43:37.682 --> 43:38.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's the novel.

43:39.016 --> 43:39.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And the story
grows.

43:40.017 --> 43:41.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN KING: Yes.

43:41.786 --> 43:46.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You wrote a very
lovely book
that I read years ago on writing
about your

43:46.591 --> 43:49.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
own life and the craft of
writing.

43:49.727 --> 43:54.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you wrote in there, "The
writer's original
perception of a character or
characters may

43:54.632 --> 43:56.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be as erroneous as the
reader's."

43:56.834 --> 43:58.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN KING: Right.

43:58.269 --> 43:59.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, this is the
sense of what
you're talking about.

43:59.770 --> 44:01.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN KING: It is.

44:01.272 --> 44:03.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here's an example of that.

44:03.441 --> 44:11.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a character in "Mr.
Mercedes," the
first book of the Hodges
Trilogy, a woman

44:11.115 --> 44:12.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
named Holly Gibney.

44:12.950 --> 44:17.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as far as I was concerned,
she was just
going to be a walk-on character.

44:17.288 --> 44:19.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's going to come on.

44:19.123 --> 44:22.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's going to be a little
neurotic, and there
is going to be some discussion
with him.

44:22.126 --> 44:26.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then she was going to
disappear from view,
a minor character.

44:26.564 --> 44:29.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, instead, she came in and
took over the
whole book.

44:29.934 --> 44:34.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I let her because that's
what needed to
happen.

44:34.138 --> 44:38.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The worst thing you can try to
do is to steer
the story once it gets going.

44:38.342 --> 44:40.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You just kind of follow along
and see where
it goes.

44:40.978 --> 44:41.946 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's the fun.

44:41.979 --> 44:42.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's the fun of
it.

44:42.980 --> 44:43.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN KING: That's the fun of
it, yes.

44:43.981 --> 44:45.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And it still is
fun for you?

44:45.182 --> 44:48.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN KING: Not every day, but
most days,
it is, yes.

44:48.386 --> 44:50.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I go where the story leads.

44:50.321 --> 44:54.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, sometimes, it is a little
bit outrageous.

44:54.425 --> 44:55.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I relish that.

44:55.560 --> 45:00.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I sort of want to be as much on
the edge as
I can.

45:00.498 --> 45:02.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I want to engage the reader.

45:02.233 --> 45:10.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm an emotional writer, in the
sense that
I would be happy if you re-read
a book for

45:11.008 --> 45:16.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the intellectual or the mental
part of it,
but, the first time, I just like
to reach

45:16.914 --> 45:19.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out and grab you, pull you in.

45:19.550 --> 45:23.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You know, another
thing that
struck me, again going back to
the book on

45:23.087 --> 45:27.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
writing, you say: "Let's get one
thing clear
right now, shall we?

45:27.925 --> 45:34.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no idea dump, no
central story, no
island of buried bestsellers,"
which is to

45:34.532 --> 45:40.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say that stories almost come
from just out
there, right?

45:40.838 --> 45:43.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And your job is to, what, find
them?

45:43.274 --> 45:46.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN KING: I don't think you
find them,
exactly.

45:46.410 --> 45:50.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what you do is, you keep
your sensors
open.

45:50.414 --> 45:57.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's -- the more that you do
the job,
the more you come to understand
in a kind

45:57.788 --> 46:03.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of intuitive way that you're
always -- you
know, your radar is on.

46:03.894 --> 46:06.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the thing is going around
and around and
around.

46:06.631 --> 46:08.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's not picking up any
blips.

46:08.933 --> 46:16.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then something will happen,
and it will
click, and you will say, this is
an idea for

46:16.040 --> 46:17.808 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a story.

46:17.842 --> 46:22.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, for me, I'm usually working
on something,
so that's kind of got to go to
the end of

46:22.113 --> 46:23.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the line.

46:23.881 --> 46:28.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the best thing about that
is, is that
the bad ideas kind of just drop
out of the

46:28.285 --> 46:29.253 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mix.

46:29.286 --> 46:30.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You forget about them.

46:30.287 --> 46:31.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The good ones stick around.

46:31.455 --> 46:32.923 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
So...

46:32.957 --> 46:38.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, does that
mean writing
can be taught, can be learned?

46:38.562 --> 46:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN KING: It can be learned,
but I'm not
sure it can be taught.

46:42.633 --> 46:44.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a self-taught kind of
thing.

46:44.969 --> 46:54.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the best writers are
voracious readers
who pick up the cadences and the
feel of narration

46:54.612 --> 46:56.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through a number of different
books.

46:56.847 --> 47:02.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you begin by maybe copying
the style of
writers that really knocked you
out.

47:02.219 --> 47:06.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, as a teenager, I read a
lot of H.P.

47:06.223 --> 47:07.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lovecraft, so I wrote like H.P.

47:07.958 --> 47:09.727 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lovecraft.

47:09.760 --> 47:14.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in my 20s, I read a lot of
Ross Macdonald
and Raymond Chandler, so I wrote
like those

47:14.632 --> 47:15.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
guys.

47:15.733 --> 47:17.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, little by little, you
develop your own
style.

47:17.902 --> 47:23.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You describe in
"On Writing"
book about learning the
discipline, even the

47:23.774 --> 47:27.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
place where you want to write,
things like
that?

47:27.211 --> 47:28.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN KING: Yes.

47:28.379 --> 47:30.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a kind of self-hypnosis
involved with
it, too.

47:30.915 --> 47:38.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you start at the same time
every day -- most
writers have little routines
they go through.

47:38.089 --> 47:45.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I like to always stop with a
couple of pages
that I haven't -- that are just
raw copy,

47:45.596 --> 47:50.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where I haven't touched it, I
haven't tried
to revise it, I haven't tried to
polish it.

47:50.267 --> 47:52.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's like having a little bit of
a runway.

47:52.369 --> 47:56.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The next day when you sit down,
you have the
comfort of saying, well, I have
got a little

47:56.741 --> 47:58.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bit here, used to be in the
typewriter.

47:58.909 --> 48:00.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now it's in the magic box, the
computer.

48:00.678 --> 48:01.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: I see.

48:01.979 --> 48:05.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's not an empty slate as
you start the
next day?

48:05.416 --> 48:08.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN KING: Cold start is a
hard start.

48:08.486 --> 48:09.587 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:09.620 --> 48:12.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, let me ask
you one more
thing.

48:12.289 --> 48:16.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Can you imagine stopping
writing, not writing?

48:16.594 --> 48:21.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN KING: Well, when people
say, what
scares you, because I have
written a lot of

48:21.766 --> 48:22.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
horror novels.

48:22.867 --> 48:23.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You have written
some scary
novels.

48:23.768 --> 48:25.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN KING: Yes.

48:25.569 --> 48:31.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I say, what really scares me is
Alzheimer's
or premature senility, losing
that ability

48:31.542 --> 48:34.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to read and enjoy and to write.

48:34.178 --> 48:39.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you do it, and some days
maybe aren't
so good, and then some days, you
really catch

48:39.784 --> 48:43.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a wave, and it's as good as it
ever was.

48:43.187 --> 48:46.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's tough to imagine giving
it up.

48:46.524 --> 48:49.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Stephen King,
thank you very
much.

48:49.760 --> 48:55.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN KING: Thank you.

48:55.800 --> 48:57.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pleasure.

48:57.601 --> 49:04.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another of
our Brief
But Spectacular series, where we
ask interesting

49:04.742 --> 49:06.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people to share their passions.

49:06.644 --> 49:13.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from B.J.
Miller, a palliative
care doctor in the San Francisco
Bay Area.

49:13.584 --> 49:18.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He explains how working in end
of life care
can help inform the way we live.

49:18.923 --> 49:20.691 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

49:20.724 --> 49:22.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
B.J. ®MDNM /MILLER, Zen Hospice
Project:
When people find out I'm in
palliative care,

49:22.259 --> 49:26.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first of all, many people -- you
start with,
well, oh, well, what is that?

49:26.096 --> 49:32.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The interdisciplinary pursuit of
quality of
life, and the context is always
advanced or

49:32.870 --> 49:33.838 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
serious illness.

49:33.871 --> 49:35.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Palliative care is irrespective
of the clock.

49:35.172 --> 49:46.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You don't have to be dying
anytime soon.

49:46.483 --> 49:50.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The curiosity from the public
tends to be
-- and I hear this all the time
-- wow, you

49:50.187 --> 49:51.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
know, that must be so
depressing.

49:51.689 --> 49:55.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, you must be depressed
all the time.

49:55.459 --> 50:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not always happy, by a long
shot, but
there is this side effect that
seems to come.

50:02.766 --> 50:07.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By facing mortality, it seems to
inform how
you live.

50:07.605 --> 50:14.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the secret is that facing
death has a
lot to do with living well.

50:14.211 --> 50:17.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The whole reason I went into
medicine was
because I became a patient.

50:17.214 --> 50:22.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In college, sophomore year, my
dear friends
and I were horsing around one
night.

50:23.020 --> 50:24.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We decided to climb a parked
train.

50:24.989 --> 50:29.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I happened to have a metal watch
on, and the
-- and, when I stood up, the
electricity arced

50:29.526 --> 50:31.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the watch, and that was that.

50:31.695 --> 50:40.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was sort of an introduction
to my own death,
my own sense of mortality, my
own finiteness.

50:40.871 --> 50:45.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're the object of a lot of
sympathy, pity,
a lot of head-tilts.

50:45.276 --> 50:49.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At first, it's kind of sweet,
but then it
starts turning a little
saccharine.

50:49.046 --> 50:54.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You quickly look down that road,
and it's
not too long before you realize
that's a dead

50:54.084 --> 50:55.886 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
end.

50:55.920 --> 50:58.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's just another way of
removing yourself
or being removed from the flow
of society.

50:58.656 --> 51:04.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the ways that I got
through some of
the early days was insisting
that this was

51:04.495 --> 51:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a variation on a theme we all
experience,
and that theme is -- basically
is suffering.

51:09.333 --> 51:11.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some way, life is not going to
do what you
want it to do.

51:11.969 --> 51:14.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your body is not going to do
what you want
it to do.

51:14.338 --> 51:15.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You will suffer.

51:15.339 --> 51:17.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's unavoidable.

51:17.308 --> 51:22.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is this unnecessary
rind of suffering,
which is so -- which is the
demoralizing part,

51:22.212 --> 51:23.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because it's the invented stuff.

51:23.981 --> 51:27.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It comes in terms of how we
treat each other,
sometimes poorly.

51:27.551 --> 51:30.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It comes in those moments of
abandonment.

51:30.354 --> 51:35.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We end up warehousing folks who
are sitting
on piles of wisdom and
experience and just

51:35.159 --> 51:37.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
plain hilarious or good stories.

51:37.294 --> 51:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we could sort of shift that a
little bit,
there's a lot more peace waiting
for all of

51:42.900 --> 51:44.668 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
us as we age.

51:44.702 --> 51:48.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a lot of us are really
worried, not
so much about the fact that we
die, but how

51:48.872 --> 51:50.741 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we die.

51:50.774 --> 51:57.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Very often, patients themselves,
the people
doing the dying, will get to a
place of acceptance,

51:57.414 --> 52:00.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beyond acceptance even, you
know, ready to
go.

52:00.284 --> 52:01.251 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're done.

52:01.285 --> 52:03.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're done with this body.

52:03.053 --> 52:06.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of the effort, my effort,
the team's
effort, the hospice
organization's effort,

52:06.457 --> 52:09.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is actually not so much on the
patient, the
person doing the dying.

52:09.927 --> 52:11.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's on the family.

52:11.829 --> 52:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a way, it's harder to accept
the death
of another person than accept
your own, especially

52:16.367 --> 52:19.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when you really love that
person.

52:19.403 --> 52:20.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm B.J. Miller.

52:20.904 --> 52:26.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And this is my Brief But
Spectacular take
on tying dying and living.
