Now to our "NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that may be of interest to

00:04.733 --> 00:06.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you, too.

00:06.800 --> 00:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Allegiances to sports teams
run deep in many families, but
one Virginia man decided to

00:13.200 --> 00:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let the nation's Major
League Baseball franchises
make their own pitch
for his son's affection.

00:17.866 --> 00:19.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The "NewsHour"'s Julia
Griffin explains.

00:19.866 --> 00:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PETE VAN VLEET, Father:
This photo is good for
two Astros tickets.

00:23.333 --> 00:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: So, when are
you going to redeem that?

00:26.033 --> 00:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: If it were
up to me, we're having such a
good year, we'd go this season,

00:29.100 --> 00:30.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but that would be
unfair for Jack.

00:30.466 --> 00:31.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

00:31.900 --> 00:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Right, because
he wouldn't remember it.

00:33.133 --> 00:35.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PETE VAN VLEET: He
wouldn't remember it.

00:35.633 --> 00:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Jack
wouldn't remember a Houston
Astros game because he
was just born in February.

00:40.500 --> 00:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while his father, Pete Van
Vleet, is a lifelong Astros
fan, he wants Jack, like his

00:45.066 --> 00:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
5-year-old daughter, Madeline,
to choose his own allegiance.

00:47.300 --> 00:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: I didn't want
to force anything on my own
kids, especially in the realm of

00:52.133 --> 00:54.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
baseball, so I let them
pick their own team.

00:54.200 --> 00:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: A few seasons
ago, Madeline picked Detroit,
reasoning that Tigers are

00:58.866 --> 01:01.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fierce.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: A friend of
mine asked when, after Jack
was born, is he going to be an

01:02.600 --> 01:03.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Astros fan?

01:03.833 --> 01:06.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I said, no, he can root
for whomever he wants.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then it dawned on me, why
not let the teams have a say?

01:08.633 --> 01:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: When
spring training got under
way, Pete, who, for the
record, is an employee

01:12.633 --> 01:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of PBS, mailed letters to all
30 Major League Baseball teams.

01:18.733 --> 01:21.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The query was
simple, but serious.

01:21.366 --> 01:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: "I want to
give you, the Pittsburgh
Pirates, the San Francisco
Giants, the Washington

01:24.300 --> 01:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nationals, a chance to make
your own case as to why my
son should pick your team to

01:27.966 --> 01:29.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
root for.

01:29.233 --> 01:30.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I must tell you, I do
not take this lightly.

01:30.866 --> 01:32.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Friends may come and go.

01:32.833 --> 01:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Political affiliations and
beliefs in higher powers may
change, but one's team is one's

01:36.500 --> 01:38.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
team forever."

01:38.466 --> 01:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: It wasn't long
before responses, or, arguably,
bribes, began to arrive.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From the Milwaukee Brewers, a
letter and autographed baseball.

01:47.633 --> 01:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: From Matt
Garza, their ace pitcher.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JULIA GRIFFIN: From
the Miami Marlins.

01:52.233 --> 01:56.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETE VAN VLEET: "Billy
the Marlin, our mascot
is goofy, adorable and
is blatantly superior

01:57.466 --> 01:59.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to all other Major
League mascots."

01:59.133 --> 02:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, if he's fishing
for a team, the Marlins
are a good one there.

02:01.733 --> 02:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Pittsburgh
Pirates president Frank
Coonelly wrote a personal note.

02:06.100 --> 02:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: "The Pirate
ship has plenty of room on it
for a young fan from Ashland,

02:09.933 --> 02:12.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Virginia."

02:12.066 --> 02:15.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Nationals
team manager Dusty Baker
sent pint-sized team
gear and an invitation.

02:15.433 --> 02:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: "We want to
get you started by inviting
you to our ballpark to catch a

02:19.100 --> 02:23.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
game, visit the field
during batting practice,
and, of course, a
sharp outfit for you to

02:23.300 --> 02:25.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
start your collection."

02:25.266 --> 02:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: While the Chicago
Cubs sent an array of 2016
world champions memorabilia

02:30.166 --> 02:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and made a play for Madeline.

02:32.166 --> 02:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: "I know big
sisters have a lot of influence
over their little brothers,

02:34.900 --> 02:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so maybe you can help us
convince Jack to be a Cubs fan."

02:38.933 --> 02:39.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why not?

02:39.933 --> 02:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's very smart of them.

02:41.933 --> 02:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Not only did
they send all the swag, but
they are going after the sister

02:43.433 --> 02:44.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vote as well.

02:44.433 --> 02:46.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PETE VAN VLEET: Exactly.

02:46.466 --> 02:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: A total of 13
teams have replied so far, but
have any knocked their argument

02:50.366 --> 02:51.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out of the park?

02:51.533 --> 02:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is 4-month-old Jack persuaded?

02:53.100 --> 02:54.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is a smile.

02:54.366 --> 02:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: Maybe that's it

02:56.600 --> 02:59.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Well,
for now, no comment.

02:59.300 --> 03:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jack is just enjoying the
pennant pursuers' pursuit.

03:03.400 --> 03:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Julia Griffin in
Ashland, Virginia.

03:07.833 --> 03:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just shameless.

03:09.866 --> 03:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I like the team that went
after -- I guess it was the
Cubs, who thought about the big

03:14.100 --> 03:14.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sister.
