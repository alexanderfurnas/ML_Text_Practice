JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.472 --> 00:06.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.473 --> 00:08.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.275 --> 00:11.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I reiterated to Chancellor
Merkel my strong

00:11.979 --> 00:20.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support of NATO, as well as the
need for our
NATO allies to pay their fair
share for the

00:20.220 --> 00:21.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cost of defense.

00:22.022 --> 00:25.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In his first
meeting with the
leader of Germany, President
Trump signals

00:25.726 --> 00:31.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a hard line and confronts
questions about
his charge that President Obama
wiretapped

00:31.798 --> 00:33.567 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

00:33.600 --> 00:38.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then: On a tour of Asian
capitals, Secretary
of State Rex Tillerson talks
tough on dealing

00:38.338 --> 00:41.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with North Korea's nuclear
program.

00:41.475 --> 00:42.776 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's Friday.

00:42.809 --> 00:46.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
analyze this
full week of news.

00:46.980 --> 00:52.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, Jeffrey Brown sits down
with author
Neil Gaiman to discuss the
stories of Norse

00:52.419 --> 00:54.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mythology in his new book.

00:54.254 --> 00:59.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GAIMAN, Author, "Norse
Mythology": From
my perspective, it was the joy
of just going.

00:59.326 --> 01:02.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is part of the heritage of
the human
race.

01:02.195 --> 01:04.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let me give it to a new
generation.

01:04.464 --> 01:12.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:12.205 --> 01:14.975 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:15.008 --> 01:25.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The veteran
leader of Germany
and the new American chief
executive, Chancellor

01:25.485 --> 01:29.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Angela Merkel and President
Trump met today
at the White House in what many
thought would

01:29.990 --> 01:33.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be a moment to smooth relations
after a rocky
start.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Whether that was the outcome is
far from clear.

01:36.630 --> 01:41.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner has our report.

01:41.101 --> 01:47.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Chancellor
Merkel got a warm
presidential welcome at the West
Wing this

01:47.074 --> 01:53.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
morning, yet minutes later, an
odd scene in
the Oval Office, Merkel offering
to shake

01:53.080 --> 01:54.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hands, but getting no response.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through
translator): Do you want to have
a handshake?

01:57.217 --> 02:00.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Thank you very much.

02:00.687 --> 02:04.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: At a joint news
conference
later, the two did exchange
compliments in

02:05.025 --> 02:06.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
prepared statements.

02:06.693 --> 02:11.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Our alliance is a
symbol of
strength and cooperation to the
world.

02:11.164 --> 02:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the foundation of a very,
very hopeful
future.

02:17.304 --> 02:23.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANGELA MERKEL (through
translator): We had
a very good first exchange of
views, so I'm

02:23.910 --> 02:26.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very much looking forward to the
talks we
will have over lunch.

02:27.014 --> 02:31.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But the body
language of
their first meeting wasn't warm,
perhaps reflecting

02:31.885 --> 02:38.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the two leaders' sharply
different styles
and viewpoints, Mr. Trump, the
businessman-turned-politician

02:38.592 --> 02:44.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who campaigned on America first,
and Merkel,
political veteran, now Europe's
most vocal

02:44.698 --> 02:45.899 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
defender.

02:45.932 --> 02:51.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been a touchy long-distance
relationship
up to today.

02:51.471 --> 02:56.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, candidate Trump
accused Merkel
of ruining Germany by accepting
hundreds of

02:56.243 --> 02:57.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thousands of Syrian refugees.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I don't know what
went wrong
with her.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't know what went wrong.

03:01.214 --> 03:02.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Angela, what happened?

03:02.916 --> 03:04.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What happened, Angela?

03:04.751 --> 03:07.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Today, the
chancellor was
asked whether she had any
reservations about

03:07.988 --> 03:10.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the president's combative style.

03:10.223 --> 03:15.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANGELA MERKEL (through
translator): People
have different abilities,
different characteristics,

03:15.662 --> 03:20.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
traits of character, have
different origins,
have found their way into
politics along different

03:20.967 --> 03:21.935 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pathways.

03:21.968 --> 03:24.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, that's diversity, which is
good.

03:24.071 --> 03:28.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, it's difficult to
find compromises,
but that's what we have been
elected for.

03:28.708 --> 03:33.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Two of those
areas of difficulty,
NATO, and the European Union.

03:33.980 --> 03:40.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump has repeatedly
criticized NATO states
for not paying their share of
the common defense.

03:40.087 --> 03:44.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said today he had pressed
Merkel to boost
defense spending to 2 percent of
economic

03:44.791 --> 03:47.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
output, the alliance's stated
goal.

03:47.461 --> 03:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Many nations owe
vast sums of
money from past years.

03:53.266 --> 03:57.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it is very unfair to the
United States.

03:57.270 --> 04:00.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These nations must pay what they
owe.

04:00.607 --> 04:05.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Merkel repeated
Germany's
pledge to get to 2 percent of
GDP within the

04:05.245 --> 04:06.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
next seven years.

04:06.713 --> 04:12.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ANGELA MERKEL (through
translator): NATO is
of prime importance to us.

04:12.085 --> 04:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It wasn't without very good
reason that we
said during our summit meeting
in Wales that

04:16.857 --> 04:19.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also Germany needs to increase
expenditure.

04:19.926 --> 04:23.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We committed to this 2 percent
goal until
2024.

04:23.096 --> 04:29.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The president
has also criticized
Germany for running a huge
manufacturing trade

04:29.736 --> 04:31.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
surplus with the U.S.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.240 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Today, he said:

04:33.273 --> 04:36.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The United States
has been treated
very, very unfairly by many
countries over

04:36.810 --> 04:37.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the years.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that's going to stop.

04:39.546 --> 04:40.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I'm not an isolationist.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm a free trader.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I'm also a fair trader.

04:43.717 --> 04:48.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Germany has done very well with
its trade
deals with the United States.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I give them credit for it.

04:49.956 --> 04:56.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Merkel noted
that any trade
agreement has to between the
U.S. and the

04:56.196 --> 04:57.697 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
E.U.

04:57.731 --> 05:01.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ANGELA MERKEL (through
translator): It will
be of benefit to both countries.

05:01.501 --> 05:03.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let me be very honest and very
candid.

05:04.004 --> 05:08.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A free trade agreement with the
United States
of America has not been all that
popular with

05:08.375 --> 05:10.277 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Germany either.

05:10.310 --> 05:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Merkel's
dealings with President
Trump may affect her own
popularity at a critical

05:14.481 --> 05:16.349 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
moment.

05:16.383 --> 05:20.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's seeking a fourth term as
chancellor
in elections later this year,
and faces challenges

05:20.253 --> 05:22.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
both from the left and the
right.

05:22.622 --> 05:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

05:26.126 --> 05:30.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: President
Trump defended the White House's
handling

05:30.864 --> 05:34.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his claim that President
Obama had him
wiretapped.

05:35.001 --> 05:41.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His press secretary, Sean
Spicer, had quoted
a FOX News analyst who suggested
British intelligence

05:41.541 --> 05:43.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
handled the wiretapping.

05:43.143 --> 05:47.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The British flatly denied it and
complained
to the White House.

05:47.247 --> 05:50.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But at his news conference
today, the president
dismissed the furor.

05:50.817 --> 06:00.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: All we did was
quote a certain
very talented legal mind who was
the one responsible

06:00.293 --> 06:01.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for saying that on television.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I didn't make an opinion on it.

06:03.463 --> 06:08.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was a statement made by a
very talented
lawyer on FOX.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so you shouldn't be talking
to me.

06:09.469 --> 06:11.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You should be talking to FOX.

06:11.371 --> 06:15.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: FOX News issued a
statement
today saying that it has --
quote -- "no evidence

06:15.909 --> 06:21.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of any kind that Mr. Trump was
surveilled
at any time in any way."

06:21.448 --> 06:26.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But with German Chancellor
Merkel looking
on, the president then connected
his own claim

06:26.586 --> 06:32.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to allegations back in 2013 that
the Obama
administration monitored her
phone calls.

06:32.158 --> 06:40.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: As far as
wiretapping, I guess,
by this past administration, at
least we have

06:40.133 --> 06:43.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
something in common, perhaps.

06:43.169 --> 06:45.138 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

06:45.171 --> 06:51.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the
Justice Department
said today that it has complied
with congressional

06:51.244 --> 06:55.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
requests for any information on
surveillance
during the campaign.

06:55.615 --> 06:57.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It gave no details.

06:57.217 --> 07:00.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's new trouble tonight for
the Secret
Service.

07:00.086 --> 07:05.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The agency has confirmed today
that someone
stole a laptop from an agent's
car in New

07:05.625 --> 07:06.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
York yesterday.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was parked near her Brooklyn
home.

07:09.362 --> 07:15.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Secret Service says the
laptop has multiple
security layers and doesn't
contain classified

07:15.135 --> 07:16.903 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information.

07:16.936 --> 07:21.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Agency officials also confirmed
this evening
that a man who jumped a White
House fence

07:21.875 --> 07:27.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a week ago was on the grounds or
16 minutes
before being arrested.

07:27.080 --> 07:31.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't enter the building,
but he got close.

07:31.284 --> 07:35.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump today ramped up
his push for
the Obamacare replacement bill.

07:35.588 --> 07:39.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He met with conservative
Republicans, and
said he's -- quote -- "100
percent" behind

07:39.993 --> 07:40.960 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the measure.

07:40.994 --> 07:44.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Later, he predicted it will pass
pretty quickly.

07:44.064 --> 07:48.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other lawmakers said changes to
the bill are
in the works, and House Speaker
Paul Ryan

07:48.535 --> 07:50.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
said the process is going well.

07:50.236 --> 07:51.971 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: There
are people from middle and from
the right

07:53.673 --> 07:55.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who have various concerns.

07:55.508 --> 07:58.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're trying to make sure
that we address
as many of these concerns as
possible without

07:58.645 --> 08:03.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
destroying the bill and without
losing votes,
but adding votes.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're getting -- we're
really doing well.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We feel very good.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the Senate,
four Republicans
have already come out against
the bill, leaving

08:10.690 --> 08:13.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it short there of a majority.

08:13.526 --> 08:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Yemen, 42 Somali refugees
were killed last
night when they came under
attack at sea.

08:19.499 --> 08:24.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Survivors said they were trying
to flee Yemen
to Sudan, when a naval vessel
and a helicopter

08:24.804 --> 08:26.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gunship opened fire.

08:26.740 --> 08:30.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shiite rebels in Yemen blamed a
Saudi-led
coalition.

08:30.076 --> 08:33.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The coalition had no immediate
comment.

08:33.546 --> 08:39.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pentagon denied today that a
U.S. airstrike
targeted a mosque in Syria's
Aleppo province.

08:39.953 --> 08:44.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Activists and a powerful rebel
group said
the attack killed nearly 50
people, mostly

08:44.991 --> 08:46.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
civilians who had gathered for
prayers.

08:46.993 --> 08:52.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a U.S. military photograph
showed the
mosque still standing, while a
building across

08:52.465 --> 08:54.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the street was destroyed.

08:54.367 --> 08:59.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Pentagon spokesman said the
strike killed
dozens of al-Qaida fighters, not
civilians.

08:59.739 --> 09:05.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The International Energy Agency
reports that
worldwide carbon emissions
remained flat in

09:05.412 --> 09:07.213 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2016.

09:07.247 --> 09:11.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Emissions fell in the United
States and China,
the two largest emitters, thanks
to greater

09:12.018 --> 09:15.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
use of renewable, nuclear and
gas power.

09:15.088 --> 09:22.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, the agency says it's not
enough to
prevent the continued rise of
global temperatures.

09:22.429 --> 09:24.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Wall Street finished the
week on a so-so
note.

09:25.031 --> 09:30.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost nearly
20 points to close at 20914.

09:30.570 --> 09:34.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose a quarter-point,
and the S&amp;P
500 gave up three.

09:35.008 --> 09:40.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, all three indexes
gained a fraction
of a percent.

09:40.146 --> 09:45.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Nobel-winning poet Derek
Walcott died
today at his home on the island
of Saint Lucia.

09:45.852 --> 09:50.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His work focused on the
Caribbean and earned
him renown as one of the
greatest writers

09:50.390 --> 09:52.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the second half of the 20th
century.

09:52.692 --> 09:56.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He won the Nobel Prize for
literature in 1992.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Derek Walcott was 87 years old.

09:59.833 --> 10:04.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the secretary
of state talks tough about North
Korea during

10:04.771 --> 10:10.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his first trip to Asia; a major
physicians
group speaks out against the
Republican health

10:10.743 --> 10:17.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care plan; Mark Shields and
David Brooks analyze
the week's news; an author's
inspiration from

10:17.116 --> 10:31.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Norse mythology; and much more.

10:31.898 --> 10:36.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
at one of
the most tense places on the
planet, the border

10:36.803 --> 10:42.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between North and South Korea,
it's the second
of his stops on an important,
three-country,

10:42.742 --> 10:48.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whirlwind tour of Asia, where
allies and adversaries
are both close at hand.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has that.

10:50.083 --> 10:54.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: Let
me be very clear: The policy of
strategic

10:54.220 --> 10:55.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
patience has ended.

10:55.989 --> 10:59.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: From South
Korea, Secretary
of State Rex Tillerson signaled
a tougher

10:59.325 --> 11:04.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
line on dealing with North
Korea, including
the possibility of a preemptive
military strike.

11:04.964 --> 11:11.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: Certainly, we do
not want to
-- for things to get to a
military conflict.

11:11.304 --> 11:18.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they elevate the threat of
their weapons
program to a level that we
believe that requires

11:18.077 --> 11:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
action, that option is on the
table.

11:19.879 --> 11:23.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tillerson
spoke in Seoul
after visiting the demilitarized
zone that

11:23.750 --> 11:28.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
separates the two countries, and
the truce
village of Panmunjom.

11:28.154 --> 11:31.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korean soldiers looked on,
snapping
pictures.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The secretary arrived at a time
of mounting
tensions.

11:34.694 --> 11:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea has test-fired
ballistic missiles
twice in the last three weeks,
as U.S. and

11:40.500 --> 11:44.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Korean troops conduct
elaborate, annual
joint exercises.

11:44.437 --> 11:48.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The North also carried out two
nuclear tests
last year.

11:48.575 --> 11:53.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Yesterday in Japan, the
secretary said 20
years of attempts to curb
Pyongyang's nuclear

11:53.346 --> 11:55.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ambitions have failed.

11:55.315 --> 11:58.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: In the face of
this ever-escalating
threat, it is clear that a
different approach

11:58.851 --> 12:00.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is required.

12:00.720 --> 12:06.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The purpose of -- part of the
purpose of my
visit to the region is to
exchange views on

12:06.426 --> 12:07.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a new approach.

12:07.927 --> 12:10.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This morning,
President
Trump weighed in via Twitter.

12:10.363 --> 12:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He wrote: "North Korea is
behaving very badly.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been playing the
United States for
years.

12:16.769 --> 12:18.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
China has done little to help."

12:18.938 --> 12:23.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Chinese have condemned North
Korea's nuclear
and missile tests.

12:23.109 --> 12:27.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they also oppose deployment
of the U.S.
ballistic missile defense
system, known as

12:27.780 --> 12:29.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
THAAD, to South Korea.

12:29.616 --> 12:32.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tillerson answered today in
Seoul, before
heading to Beijing tomorrow.

12:32.585 --> 12:37.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REX TILLERSON: While we
acknowledge China's
opposition, its economic
retaliation against

12:37.190 --> 12:40.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
South Korea is inappropriate and
troubling.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We ask China to refrain from
such action.

12:43.429 --> 12:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The South
Korean foreign
minister underscored the U.S.
argument that

12:47.500 --> 12:51.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the missile defense system is
not aimed at
China.

12:51.270 --> 12:55.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the recent ouster of South
Korea's president,
in a corruption scandal, could
change the

12:55.775 --> 12:57.744 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
landscape.

12:57.777 --> 13:01.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The liberal candidate favored to
win the presidency
in May says he will review the
THAAD deployment,

13:01.748 --> 13:03.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and consult with China.

13:03.950 --> 13:07.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the secretary's trip
to Asia,
and the significance of what
Tillerson had

13:07.987 --> 13:11.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to say in South Korea, we turn
to veteran
diplomat Kathleen Stephens.

13:12.025 --> 13:15.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was U.S. ambassador to South
Korea during
the Obama administration.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's now at Stanford
University.

13:17.997 --> 13:20.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How significant were the
secretary's remarks?

13:20.099 --> 13:24.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN STEPHENS, Former U.S.
Ambassador
to South Korea: Well, I think
they were very

13:24.070 --> 13:27.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
significant, and closely
listened to and heard
throughout the region, as well
as here.

13:27.907 --> 13:33.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, I think it's first
somewhat extensive
press conferences as secretary
of state.

13:33.479 --> 13:37.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was indeed a very tough
message, but I
also think he picked his words
pretty carefully.

13:37.750 --> 13:43.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of what he had to say
was a reinforcement
of what had been the Obama
administration

13:43.790 --> 13:46.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
policy, but I think an
indication that he
wants to toughen it up even
more.

13:46.993 --> 13:50.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is this our
chief diplomat
saying diplomacy hasn't been
working, the

13:50.730 --> 13:52.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
talking hasn't been working?

13:52.598 --> 13:57.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN STEPHENS: Well, in
fact, there hasn't
been much talking with North
Korea over the

13:57.937 --> 13:59.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
eight years.

13:59.739 --> 14:06.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one thing that did strike me
about Secretary
Tillerson's remarks was that he
was quite

14:06.446 --> 14:10.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specific and categorical in
saying now is
not the time for talks.

14:10.450 --> 14:16.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I actually would have liked to
have seen him
keep the door a little bit ajar
on that, because

14:16.222 --> 14:20.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, when you do have a new
administration
in Washington, there will soon
be a new administration

14:21.027 --> 14:26.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in Seoul, there's a good
argument for trying
to climb that mountain one more
time and seeing

14:26.132 --> 14:30.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what's possible diplomatically,
because at
the very least, it helps you
build coalitions

14:30.336 --> 14:33.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you need to increase the
pressure if the diplomatic
approach doesn't work.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He's
advocating tougher
sanctions.

14:36.242 --> 14:38.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Will tougher sanctions work
against North
Korea?

14:38.878 --> 14:42.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KATHLEEN STEPHENS: Well,
sanctions are a very
blunt instrument.

14:42.882 --> 14:48.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And sanctions have been --
against North Korea
have been progressively
tightened and broadened

14:48.621 --> 14:54.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
through Security Council
resolutions, through
bilateral action by the United
States, by

14:54.660 --> 14:57.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actions by South Korea and
Japan.

14:57.663 --> 15:03.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China has also participated,
although, of
course, there's never been
satisfaction, I

15:03.336 --> 15:09.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think, with China doing or a
sense that China
is doing as much as it possibly
could.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But will sanctions work?

15:11.043 --> 15:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they can bring pressure
on the regime,
and they are bringing pressure.

15:14.480 --> 15:20.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will they lead Kim Jong-un to
make a strategic
choice that he's ready to trade
his nuclear

15:20.253 --> 15:25.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and missile program for a
lessening of sanctions
and for other benefits?

15:25.691 --> 15:31.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that the chances of that
working are
far less promising perhaps than
they ever

15:31.531 --> 15:32.498 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have been.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it doesn't mean you give up
on sanctions.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think it means it has to
be only one
part of your approach.

15:36.936 --> 15:41.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Given what we
know and we
don't know about North Korea's
leader, is

15:41.040 --> 15:45.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this the type of thing that
prods him to come
to the table, or does it just
anger him more?

15:45.645 --> 15:48.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, at times, his actions have
not been predictable.

15:48.381 --> 15:53.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN STEPHENS: Well, I think
what we know
about Kim Jong-un, who has now
been in power

15:53.119 --> 15:59.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for five years, is that a
priority, his priority
has been to accelerate and
consolidate his

15:59.192 --> 16:01.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nuclear weapon and ballistic
missile capability.

16:01.360 --> 16:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to date, the sanctions, the
isolation,
the -- and, for that matter, the
carrots that

16:08.201 --> 16:11.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been offered to him to do
otherwise have
not been sufficient.

16:11.037 --> 16:13.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I am pessimistic about them.

16:13.472 --> 16:20.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that continued
pressure is important,
because you don't know what the
timeline is

16:20.046 --> 16:21.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for getting somebody to the
table.

16:22.014 --> 16:24.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think Secretary Tillerson
is right.

16:24.183 --> 16:31.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Indeed, it was something that
the Obama administration
emphasized, that China also
plays a very important

16:31.324 --> 16:32.692 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
role.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think sanctions have to be
combined
with some kind of exit ramp.

16:35.528 --> 16:42.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the ramp has to be into
something that
allows him to start to make some
adjustments.

16:42.134 --> 16:46.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And given where he is in the
program, we may
have to lower our sights about
what he needs

16:46.739 --> 16:48.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to do to get into talks.

16:48.274 --> 16:52.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this was one part of Mr.
Tillerson's presentation
that concerned me a bit.

16:52.612 --> 16:57.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He stated, perhaps for tactical
reasons, a
kind of a maximalist approach,
which has long

16:57.216 --> 17:00.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been an approach which has --
that basically
North Korea needs to give up
everything before

17:00.987 --> 17:02.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we get into a diplomatic
process.

17:02.955 --> 17:09.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think it is going to have
to be a process,
probably a slow process, but
certainly the

17:09.328 --> 17:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
principle which was held by
Obama administration,
which Mr. Tillerson reinforced,
that there

17:13.866 --> 17:18.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
needs to be a readiness on the
part of North
Korea to say they are prepared
to move toward

17:18.271 --> 17:20.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
denuclearization, is an
important prerequisite.

17:20.072 --> 17:24.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is one that the Chinese
have also
agreed to and need to reinforce.

17:24.076 --> 17:28.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Something that
has been
of interest in South Korea is
not who Mr.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tillerson met with, but who he
didn't meet
with.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He didn't seem to meet with any
of the opposition
leaders.

17:32.818 --> 17:35.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he kind of talked to an
administration
that is a lame-duck.

17:35.788 --> 17:40.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How significant are things -- or
how much
is it likely to change after
South Korea has

17:40.493 --> 17:41.527 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a new election?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN STEPHENS: Right.

17:43.362 --> 17:48.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's always a tricky question in
the middle
of an election campaign is how
you can manage

17:48.067 --> 17:49.602 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those meetings.

17:49.635 --> 17:54.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I have some sympathy with
the diplomatic
nuances of trying to do that.

17:54.240 --> 17:59.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, certainly, I mean, less
than two months'
time, South Korea will have a
new president.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The election is on May 9.

18:00.680 --> 18:04.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that new president will take
power, I
guess, immediately.

18:04.784 --> 18:11.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it looks now that it's going
to be most
likely a president from the part
of the political

18:11.557 --> 18:15.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spectrum that has tended to lean
towards trying
a little harder on the
engagement angle with

18:16.028 --> 18:17.763 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
North Korea.

18:17.797 --> 18:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In any event, I think any new
South Korean
will want to look at the options
for that.

18:21.534 --> 18:26.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it will be very
important not
to close off too many options
before that

18:26.872 --> 18:32.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new government gets in place,
and then to
see with Seoul, as well as with
Beijing, what,

18:32.078 --> 18:37.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
along with deepened pressure,
deepened sanctions,
more countries participating and
pressuring

18:37.750 --> 18:44.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea, what might be
possible in terms
of a fresh diplomatic approach,
some kind

18:44.056 --> 18:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of grand bargain that addresses
our core interest
in seeing all of the Korean
Peninsula denuclearize

18:50.763 --> 18:56.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and that means no nuclear
weapons in North
Korea -- but finds a way to get
into some

18:56.168 --> 18:57.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of talks on that basis.

18:57.503 --> 18:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Kathleen Stephens,
thanks so much.

18:58.771 --> 19:07.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN STEPHENS: My pleasure.

19:07.847 --> 19:16.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
and the Republican
leadership in the House are
working to pass

19:16.889 --> 19:19.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a health care bill later next
week.

19:19.525 --> 19:25.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's still criticism and
concern about
the impact of this bill,
including among lawmakers,

19:25.331 --> 19:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
governors and, of course, among
voters.

19:27.199 --> 19:31.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are also a number of
powerful interest
groups who are directly involved
in health

19:31.737 --> 19:34.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care and they are expressing
reservations.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, Jeffrey Brown hears one
of those
perspectives.

19:36.976 --> 19:41.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In 2010, the
American Medical
Association, the largest
physicians group

19:41.814 --> 19:45.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the country, lobbied for the
passage of
the Affordable Care Act.

19:45.584 --> 19:50.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fast-forward to today, the group
is publicly
opposing the proposed House
Republican health

19:50.423 --> 19:51.524 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
plan.

19:51.557 --> 19:54.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Dr. Andrew Gurman is its
president, and joins
me now.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

19:55.561 --> 19:56.896 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

19:56.929 --> 19:57.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW GURMAN, President,
American Medical
Association: Thank you.

19:57.563 --> 19:58.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Delighted to be here.

19:58.898 --> 19:59.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Can you boil down
the essence
of the opposition?

19:59.598 --> 20:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is wrong with this plan?

20:00.566 --> 20:01.534 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW GURMAN: Sure.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that people who don't
have health
insurance live sicker and die
younger.

20:05.204 --> 20:10.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it is a basic principle of
ours that people
who have insurance shouldn't
lose it, and

20:10.242 --> 20:12.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people don't have health
insurance should
get it.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're afraid that, under
this bill, that
wouldn't happen.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, take parts of
it.

20:16.749 --> 20:22.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The tax credit part, emphasis of
this, why
wouldn't that work, or who would
that not

20:22.321 --> 20:23.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
work for?

20:23.322 --> 20:24.957 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW GURMAN: Well, we're
concerned that
the poorest and sickest among us
would be

20:26.859 --> 20:27.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the ones most affected.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I will give you an example.

20:29.595 --> 20:32.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These are numbers from the
Kaiser Family Foundation.

20:32.698 --> 20:38.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Someone who is 60 years old
under the Affordable
Care Act might get subsidies of
up to between

20:38.270 --> 20:43.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$9,000 and $13,000 to buy
insurance, depending
on where he or she lived.

20:43.542 --> 20:48.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under the proposed legislation,
that subsidy
would be $4,000 flat, across the
board.

20:48.280 --> 20:49.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't know where you live.

20:49.782 --> 20:53.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is virtually impossible to
purchase insurance
at that age for $4,000.

20:54.019 --> 20:56.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you see an
impact on your
own patients?

20:56.689 --> 20:58.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're already hearing the
worries?

20:58.424 --> 21:00.159 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW GURMAN: The worries that
my patients
have, have to do with high
deductibles and

21:02.628 --> 21:04.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
availability of insurance.

21:04.497 --> 21:09.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can give you example of
someone I saw
last week in my office,
self-employed carpenter,

21:09.835 --> 21:13.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
probably makes somewhere between
$20,000 and
$30,000 in a good year.

21:13.672 --> 21:15.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He needs to have surgery on his
hand.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has a $6,000 deductible.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's a big problem for him.

21:18.544 --> 21:21.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, to push back
a little bit
on you here, many doctors have
also, of course,

21:21.647 --> 21:26.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
complained about the ACA, right,
about the
-- too many regulations, gets in
the way of

21:26.919 --> 21:31.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the doctor-patient relationship,
takes away
choices from patients.

21:31.056 --> 21:35.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You are also getting some
pushback from the
White House about that you and
other interest

21:35.261 --> 21:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
groups are opposed because it
hits you financially,
you doctors financially.

21:40.699 --> 21:41.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you respond?

21:41.700 --> 21:43.369 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

21:43.402 --> 21:45.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW GURMAN: Well, there is no
question
that there are things in the
Affordable Care

21:45.037 --> 21:47.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Act that need to be fixed.

21:47.773 --> 21:50.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are various ways that that
could be
done.

21:50.276 --> 21:53.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Repeal and replace is one of
them, but we
don't know what the replacement
is.

21:53.646 --> 21:59.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the AMA has clearly stated
that we think
that the American people should
see what the

21:59.151 --> 22:03.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proposed replacement is, so that
we can have
a thoughtful discussion
regarding whether

22:03.722 --> 22:05.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's better or worse than what
we have now.

22:05.958 --> 22:10.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are many things in the
Affordable Care
Act that could be fixed, rather
than replaced.

22:10.429 --> 22:15.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The repeated
claim behind all
this, of course, is that
Obamacare is collapsing.

22:15.834 --> 22:16.769 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Do you see that?

22:16.802 --> 22:18.737 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

22:18.771 --> 22:21.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW GURMAN: Well, there's no
question that
the markets which were created
under the Affordable

22:21.440 --> 22:22.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Care Act need to be stabilized.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are lots of ways to do
that.

22:24.510 --> 22:27.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, finally, the
president
says we're going to get through
all this,

22:27.746 --> 22:30.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're going to get a new health
plan.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you think that will happen?

22:32.451 --> 22:34.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What will it take to get the AMA
on board?

22:34.653 --> 22:36.422 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

22:36.455 --> 22:40.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW GURMAN: Well, the AMA
stands ready,
willing and eager to work with
Congress in

22:40.626 --> 22:43.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
order to get this right and to
make it work
for all Americans.

22:43.462 --> 22:45.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, again, do
you think it
will happen?

22:45.798 --> 22:46.765 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDREW GURMAN: I hope so.

22:48.567 --> 22:49.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You do hope so,
even though
you oppose what is on the table
right now?

22:49.702 --> 22:51.437 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

22:51.470 --> 22:52.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW GURMAN: Oh, I hope that,
at the end
of this process, that we have a
health care

22:52.871 --> 22:55.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system that works for everybody
in America.

22:55.674 --> 22:56.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

22:56.675 --> 22:57.776 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

22:57.810 --> 22:58.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW GURMAN: It's already the
envy of the
world.

22:58.677 --> 23:00.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We just need to make it work for
us.

23:00.112 --> 23:04.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Dr. Andrew
Gurman, president
of the AMA, thank you.

23:04.650 --> 23:05.618 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

23:05.651 --> 23:09.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDREW GURMAN: My pleasure.

23:09.588 --> 23:14.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you for having me.

23:14.493 --> 23:18.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to the
analysis of Shields
and Brooks.

23:18.831 --> 23:23.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentleman.

23:24.937 --> 23:29.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's pick up with the
conversation, David,
that Jeffrey Brown was just
having with the

23:29.375 --> 23:32.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
head of the American Medical
Association.

23:32.211 --> 23:37.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump is saying again
today the
health care overhaul is moving
along very

23:37.549 --> 23:40.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well, it's going to move through
the House.

23:40.185 --> 23:41.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you see as the
prospects?

23:41.186 --> 23:42.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It has no critics.

23:42.554 --> 23:43.522 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

23:43.555 --> 23:46.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm first all amazed that they
did it first.

23:46.425 --> 23:50.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of all the issues to tackle,
health scare
is probably the hardest one.

23:50.396 --> 23:55.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so every four or eight
years, some president
decides, you know, let's do
health care first.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it hurts them every single
time.

23:57.636 --> 24:01.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether the prospects of this
bill are good,
I tend to doubt.

24:01.907 --> 24:04.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has very few fans in the
Senate.

24:04.610 --> 24:08.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it has two wings of
opposition which are
in contradiction, what we call
the coverage

24:08.681 --> 24:12.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
caucus, who want a little more
expensive bill
that will cover more people, and
the Freedom

24:12.284 --> 24:15.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Caucus wants a less expensive
bill to cover
less.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't -- they have to win
both of these
groups.

24:17.389 --> 24:19.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how do you do this, when
they are mutually
contradictory?

24:19.958 --> 24:21.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so the Senate is very
daunting.

24:21.760 --> 24:25.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, therefore, you're asking the
House members
to vote for something that will
take away

24:25.864 --> 24:31.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coverage that already exists for
a bill that
probably doesn't have great
prospects in the

24:31.437 --> 24:33.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
long run.

24:33.272 --> 24:34.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I personally bet they get
through the House,
just because it's so hard to go
against the

24:34.873 --> 24:37.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sitting president in his first
major thing.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I wouldn't want to bet on
the eventual
passage of this.

24:39.678 --> 24:42.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, what
we hear is
the main argument they are using
now in the

24:42.214 --> 24:46.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House as it gets closer to the
vote is the
political vote, you can't go
against your

24:46.452 --> 24:47.419 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

24:47.453 --> 24:49.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

24:49.254 --> 24:55.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an argument that used, used
in 1993 for
the Democrats and Bill Clinton
on his major

24:55.894 --> 25:02.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
budget and tax increase, which,
by the way,
per what David was talking
about, included

25:02.434 --> 25:05.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a BTU tax that House members
voted on.

25:05.571 --> 25:11.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It passed the House in a very
difficult vote
and died in the Senate.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Several moderate to conservative
Democrats
walked away from it.

25:13.812 --> 25:19.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it left those House members
with a vote
that they really couldn't -- it
became politically

25:19.485 --> 25:22.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mortal -- fatal in several
instances.

25:22.421 --> 25:25.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the same thing is true
here, and for
good reasons, Judy.

25:25.824 --> 25:31.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the Republicans -- part
of David's
answer -- they pledged in 2010,
they pledged

25:31.463 --> 25:34.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in 2012, they pledged in 2016.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was the one pledge they
had: repeal Obamacare.

25:37.002 --> 25:38.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was an applause line.

25:38.804 --> 25:43.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it really did take on almost
a moral imperative,
or at least a political
imperative.

25:43.709 --> 25:48.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Judy, this is going to
radically overhaul
the Affordable Care Act.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It going to radically overhaul
Medicaid.

25:50.849 --> 25:54.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You heard Dr. Gurman in his
interview with
Jeff.

25:54.453 --> 25:58.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reality is, providers are
not going to
provide coverage.

25:58.657 --> 26:03.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not going to take on as
patients people
under Medicaid, because they are
not going

26:03.362 --> 26:06.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to have the money to pay for it.

26:06.098 --> 26:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are talking -- one figure
that jumps
out, beyond all the questions of
deductibles

26:12.204 --> 26:19.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and everything else, 24 million
Americans.

26:19.044 --> 26:22.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what the Congressional
Budget Office
estimates.

26:22.347 --> 26:24.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Republicans just kind of
recoiled.

26:24.616 --> 26:27.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is the number that has hung
around -- are
going to lose coverage.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.021 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lose coverage.

26:29.054 --> 26:32.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That just is -- that is truly
unforgivable.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's morally indefensible.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, in this case, it
will be politically
indefensible.

26:36.361 --> 26:40.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But we're talking
-- you're
talking, Mark, about the bill as
it sits in

26:40.332 --> 26:41.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the House.

26:41.633 --> 26:44.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the Senate, we may -- we're
almost certain
to see changes.

26:44.069 --> 26:46.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, but which
direction?

26:46.138 --> 26:50.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, on the 24 million, it's a
neat trick
to do that, because simply
repealing Obamacare

26:50.409 --> 26:53.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would have only taken coverage
from 23 million.

26:53.345 --> 26:58.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, somehow, the replacement
subtracts a million,
which is an interesting trick.

26:58.917 --> 27:02.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Republican Party just hasn't
figured out
where it sits on this issue.

27:02.421 --> 27:06.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you could have a very
good free market
system, sort of modeled on
Switzerland, where

27:06.358 --> 27:10.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are a lot of individual
markets, people
actually pay for their health
care, and there's

27:10.062 --> 27:14.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some cost and demand -- supply
and demand
pressures to get costs down.

27:14.233 --> 27:17.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you would have to spend more
to get it
-- make it universal.

27:17.035 --> 27:20.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You business have to make it
universal using
a free market system.

27:20.105 --> 27:22.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Republican Party hasn't
gotten there,
because they don't want to make
it universal,

27:22.708 --> 27:24.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because it probably would be
extensive.

27:24.843 --> 27:28.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so some of them want to go
sort of in
that direction, but a lot, Ted
Cruz, Rand

27:28.847 --> 27:31.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paul, they want to go in the
other direction.

27:31.149 --> 27:36.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they just don't think it's
the government's
job to be in the field of
distribution, redistribution.

27:36.522 --> 27:38.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this ACA was very
redistributionist.

27:38.857 --> 27:40.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Republican Party hasn't
figured it out.

27:40.959 --> 27:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what is interesting to me is
that Donald
Trump hasn't figured it out.

27:43.862 --> 27:45.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He campaigned partially as a
populist.

27:46.031 --> 27:50.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if I was a populist, I would
be handing
things to my people.

27:50.035 --> 27:53.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what this bill does is, it
takes things
from the Trump voters.

27:53.605 --> 27:58.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The middle-aged people, 50 to
64, get hammered
in this bill, the people just
above the Medicaid

27:58.477 --> 27:59.444 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
threshold.

27:59.478 --> 28:01.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The working class, they get
hammered.

28:01.313 --> 28:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what is the one piece of
the bill that
has been there from the
beginning to end in

28:04.182 --> 28:08.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the versions, is the tax cut
for people
making over $250,000.

28:08.287 --> 28:13.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so it's a weirdly
anti-Trumpian bill that
he has sort of gone along with
because, I

28:13.258 --> 28:15.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guess, the House Republicans led
the way.

28:15.861 --> 28:18.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think -- I can't
argue with
any point that David made.

28:18.664 --> 28:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I would just say, it's
inconceivable to me.

28:21.466 --> 28:26.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump changed the face of
the Republican
Party, whatever anyone thinks of
this election.

28:26.104 --> 28:30.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He carried 403 counties that had
voted for
Barack Obama.

28:30.409 --> 28:35.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The counties he carried, Judy,
were considerably
more white than the country is,
and they were

28:35.213 --> 28:37.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
considerably less educated.

28:37.950 --> 28:40.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were struggling working
class.

28:40.052 --> 28:44.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he has turned his back, not
simply on
the health care, this bill does,
but on the

28:44.523 --> 28:45.490 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
budget.

28:45.524 --> 28:47.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It takes from the have-nots.

28:47.059 --> 28:53.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It takes from the have-nots and
the have-lesses,
and gives to the have-mores.

28:53.465 --> 28:58.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is absolutely a
Robin-Hood-in-reverse budget.

28:58.870 --> 29:00.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I just don't understand it.

29:00.639 --> 29:05.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It really, to use David's word,
hammers the
very people who voted for him,
especially

29:05.444 --> 29:06.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in rural areas in America.

29:06.878 --> 29:08.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, what about
the budget
proposal?

29:08.880 --> 29:13.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, just some
things are mystifying.

29:13.251 --> 29:19.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Why they eliminated the
Appalachian regional
development, the thing that --
why they severely

29:19.725 --> 29:25.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cut the Great Lakes regions,
Michigan, Wisconsin,
why they had to put those
specific cuts in

29:25.731 --> 29:30.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the budget, let alone -- fine,
Republicans
are going to try to get rid of
CPB, our beloved

29:30.068 --> 29:32.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CPB, Corporation for Public
Broadcasting.

29:32.504 --> 29:35.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But why they put those things,
it's mystifying.

29:35.807 --> 29:38.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it seems to go in direct
contradiction
to everything he stood for in
the course of

29:38.977 --> 29:40.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the campaign.

29:40.879 --> 29:44.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a theory going
around in political
science which has some resonance
for me today,

29:44.249 --> 29:49.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is that you have moments
where you get
a political party knows what
they believe

29:49.121 --> 29:50.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and they are all on board.

29:50.589 --> 29:54.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then there's periods of
disruption, where
they are internally divided.

29:54.559 --> 29:56.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the argument is, Jimmy
Carter was an example
was this.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Democrats had shifted away
from some old-style
liberalism.

29:59.231 --> 30:01.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They hadn't got to Bill
Clinton's style.

30:01.066 --> 30:04.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they were internally
divided, and that
Donald Trump is like Jimmy
Carter.

30:04.803 --> 30:09.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He comes at a time when the
Republican Party
does not know what it wants, and
that he himself

30:09.207 --> 30:10.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is internally divided.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And you get these weird
contradictions of
campaigning one way, and then
governing in

30:13.979 --> 30:15.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a very opposite way.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And both of you
are saying
the same thing, then, Mark,
about the budget.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I hope not.

30:19.851 --> 30:20.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Well, I hope not.

30:20.819 --> 30:21.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:21.820 --> 30:22.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: There's no point
in watching.

30:22.821 --> 30:23.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At least on this
point.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:25.657 --> 30:27.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, but, Judy,
just to add to
that, David Rogers, a peerless
congressional

30:27.659 --> 30:32.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reporter, wrote in Politico,
these -- they
are turning their backs on
Republican-endorsed

30:32.698 --> 30:34.132 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
programs.

30:34.166 --> 30:37.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was President Jerry Ford who
pitched community
development grants.

30:37.569 --> 30:43.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was Bob Dole who pushed and
was the champion
of food aid overseas.

30:43.041 --> 30:45.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're going to cut that.

30:45.510 --> 30:52.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was Ronald Reagan who found
the money for
heating assistance for poor
people.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just -- it's amazing.

30:54.453 --> 31:00.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's the same budget that
Paul Ryan passed
in 2013.

31:00.392 --> 31:05.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then he was negotiating with
a Democratic
president, because he wanted to
get cuts in

31:05.430 --> 31:12.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
entitlement growth towards his
dream of taming
the budget deficits.

31:12.571 --> 31:17.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now he's got Republican
president, and
they're passing the same budget
with the same

31:17.309 --> 31:18.343 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cuts.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just -- I don't know where
the pickup
is.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

31:21.847 --> 31:24.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm -- was looking for the
political philosophy
that might be inherent in a
budget.

31:24.883 --> 31:28.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of them are just weird,
even for
Republicans, as Mark said, $6
million -- $6

31:28.520 --> 31:30.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
billion off the National
Institutes of Health.

31:30.655 --> 31:34.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That is an investment in
scientific advance
and economic growth.

31:34.159 --> 31:35.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And why would you do that?

31:35.227 --> 31:36.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That doesn't even seem
particularly Republican.

31:37.028 --> 31:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, basically, what you're
doing, they are
investing in everything that is
hard power.

31:41.900 --> 31:45.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They're investing in the
military, in homeland
security, everything that is
about threat

31:45.704 --> 31:47.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and fear.

31:47.539 --> 31:52.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are disinvesting in
everything that
has to do with compassion, with
care, thinking,

31:52.444 --> 31:53.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
innovation.

31:53.445 --> 31:55.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's almost like emotionally
consistent.

31:55.347 --> 31:58.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just hardness and toughness
and fear.

31:58.216 --> 32:00.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And everything else just has to
go.

32:00.051 --> 32:03.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, even some
Republicans
are saying, well, this is just
the first shot

32:03.488 --> 32:06.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the White House, and we
will have our
own crack at it.

32:06.825 --> 32:11.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the few minutes that we have
left, Mark,
let's talk about the president
continuing

32:11.263 --> 32:18.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to double down on his contention
that he was
wiretapped by former President
Obama.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.137 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's said it.

32:19.171 --> 32:20.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He said it again today.

32:20.939 --> 32:26.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His spokesman, Sean Spicer, has
come up with
evidence, they say, or at least
cited news

32:26.745 --> 32:28.580 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stories.

32:28.613 --> 32:30.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, the British
government pressed
back on, pushed back on one of
that -- one

32:30.916 --> 32:33.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the claims that Sean Spicer
made yesterday.

32:33.718 --> 32:38.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does this say that this is
something
the president won't let go of,
in the face

32:38.223 --> 32:42.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of almost universal lack of
evidence?

32:42.627 --> 32:44.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It is universal.

32:44.362 --> 32:48.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you let -- when lose Devin
Nunes, who
is the chairman of the House
Intelligence

32:48.800 --> 32:49.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee...

32:49.801 --> 32:51.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican.

32:51.603 --> 32:54.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Republican, who
has been Donald
Trump's apologist, I mean,
explained that

32:54.372 --> 32:59.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump was actually a
political neophyte,
and you could take things
literally, this

32:59.477 --> 33:04.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a man who ran as, you might
disagree with
him, Judy, but you know what he
says.

33:04.783 --> 33:10.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He stands -- he says what he
believes and
he believes what he says, and he
tells it

33:10.689 --> 33:11.756 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like it is.

33:11.790 --> 33:15.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now we're down to literally
and figuratively.

33:15.694 --> 33:18.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Literally and figuratively, I
don't care about
quotation marks.

33:18.129 --> 33:20.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said this about the president
of the United
States.

33:20.732 --> 33:22.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He accused the president of the
United States.

33:22.400 --> 33:25.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said it was a fact that the
president of
the United States had done this.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.338 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was wrong.

33:26.371 --> 33:27.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was unfounded.

33:27.539 --> 33:28.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was unfair.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.308 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was unjust.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was as unjust as it was when
he charged
that is principal opponent Ted
Cruz's father

33:33.945 --> 33:37.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
had been involved in the
assassination of
President Kennedy, when he
charged that the

33:37.048 --> 33:41.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first African-American president
wasn't an
American, was African, Barack
Obama.

33:41.553 --> 33:43.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But now he's president.

33:43.121 --> 33:44.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now he's president.

33:44.489 --> 33:46.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This isn't a matter of his macho
or his vanity
or his toughness.

33:46.858 --> 33:50.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a question, when a
president of the
United States says anything, it
reassures

33:50.395 --> 33:56.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allies, it confounds the world,
or it reassures
the world, or it alarms people.

33:56.334 --> 34:00.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I said last week, I do not
believe, when
the crisis comes, that there's
going to be

34:00.272 --> 34:01.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
credibility for this man.

34:01.339 --> 34:02.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you
explain it?

34:02.407 --> 34:04.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, there's some
fear.

34:04.142 --> 34:06.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things that struck me
this week
is, Donald Trump is the most
talked-about

34:06.311 --> 34:08.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American in the history of our
country.

34:08.546 --> 34:11.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wherever you go around the
world, people are
talking about Donald Trump.

34:11.249 --> 34:14.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every -- people who go
abroad, that's
all -- anywhere you go in the
world, people

34:14.519 --> 34:16.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want to talk about that.

34:16.354 --> 34:22.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he does it in part through
this, through
saying things that make him
criticized and

34:22.427 --> 34:24.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- but he is the center.

34:24.329 --> 34:27.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the second thing he
demonstrates through
this -- and, again, I'm just
trying to illustrate

34:27.299 --> 34:31.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why -- A, why he got elected
president, and
why these things don't seem to
kill him.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, he's first center of
attention.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Figuratively
speaking.

34:35.307 --> 34:36.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, right.

34:36.841 --> 34:37.809 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Right, exactly.

34:37.842 --> 34:41.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the second is that force.

34:41.446 --> 34:42.414 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He shows force.

34:42.447 --> 34:44.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was listening to a lot of talk
radio today.

34:44.783 --> 34:49.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is a lot of support
for Donald Trump
is that that guy is tough enough
to stand

34:49.087 --> 34:51.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
against everybody and be
forceful.

34:51.356 --> 34:54.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he never withdraws, he never
backs down.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just force, force, force.

34:56.461 --> 35:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you remember when Jeff
Sessions recused
himself from that investigation
on the Russia

35:01.099 --> 35:04.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing, Trump reportedly blew his
top, because
it was a withdrawal.

35:05.003 --> 35:09.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it was a perfectly
legitimate step back,
but it was a partial withdrawal.

35:09.407 --> 35:11.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Trump is always forward,
forward, forward.

35:11.710 --> 35:15.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And no sign of
any change on
that one.

35:15.447 --> 35:25.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All right, David Brooks, Mark
Shields, thank
you both.

35:25.490 --> 35:30.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All right, David Brooks, Mark
Shields, thank
you both.

35:30.895 --> 35:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

35:34.499 --> 35:36.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

35:36.334 --> 35:39.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: a new work
from acclaimed
author Neil Gaiman explores
deities, dwarves

35:39.471 --> 35:40.972 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and giants.

35:41.006 --> 35:44.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jeff is back with this
otherworldly addition
to the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

35:44.409 --> 35:51.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The mighty Thor,
god of thunder,
as portrayed by Jack Kirby in
his 1960s comic

35:51.383 --> 35:58.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
book series, one-eyed Odin,
highest and oldest
of the Gods from Roger Lancelyn
Green's "Myths

35:58.857 --> 36:00.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Norsemen."

36:00.792 --> 36:04.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GAIMAN, Author, "Norse
Mythology": I
would have been 6 years old when
I first encountered

36:04.262 --> 36:06.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the -- just the idea of these
Norse gods.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I remember looking at them and
going, this
is amazing.

36:09.134 --> 36:14.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: These stories of
the Norse
gods were read and absorbed by
the young Neil

36:14.372 --> 36:18.810 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Gaiman.

36:18.843 --> 36:24.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now 56, Gaiman has sold more
than 15 million
books, as one of today's leading
writers of

36:24.749 --> 36:30.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fantasy and science fiction, the
clash of
the very human and the
otherworldly.

36:30.755 --> 36:35.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The British-born Gaiman first
gained fame
for his comic book series "The
Sandman."

36:35.760 --> 36:41.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would go on to write much
more in many
genres, including novels such as
"Neverwhere,"

36:41.232 --> 36:44.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"American Gods," and "The Ocean
at the End
of the Lane."

36:44.569 --> 36:50.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's now done his own
retelling of the
old tales, titled "Norse
Mythology."

36:50.408 --> 36:53.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We spoke recently at Scandinavia
House in
New York.

36:53.244 --> 36:59.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GAIMAN: I had encountered
the stories
of the Greeks, even of the
Egyptians.

36:59.584 --> 37:02.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you look at the supreme
gods, the top
gods.

37:02.654 --> 37:11.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at Zeus, you look at
Ra, and they
are powerful and all-wise and to
be aspired

37:11.196 --> 37:12.464 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

37:12.497 --> 37:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And yet here is Odin.

37:14.966 --> 37:20.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if he turns up at your
house, he will
probably turn up in disguise
and, you know,

37:20.939 --> 37:26.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leave with half your cutlery,
and possibly
having seduced your daughter.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NEIL GAIMAN: These are
unreliable people.

37:28.847 --> 37:32.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I started writing these
stories -- and
I started working on this book
about four

37:33.017 --> 37:39.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
years ago -- from my
perspective, it was the
joy of just going, this is part
of the heritage

37:39.824 --> 37:41.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the human race.

37:41.659 --> 37:43.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let me give it to a new
generation.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Tell me what
you're doing.

37:45.196 --> 37:47.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're not -- you're rewriting
the myths?

37:47.198 --> 38:00.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GAIMAN: I suppose I think
about them
as if I'm taking old folk songs
and then perhaps

38:00.345 --> 38:04.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
orchestrating them, arranging
them for modern
ears.

38:05.016 --> 38:11.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going back to the Icelandic
versions of
these stories that remain to us
written in

38:11.990 --> 38:19.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a post-Christian world, picking
the versions
of the stories that I like, not
changing things,

38:19.230 --> 38:27.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not creating, in the sense of
retelling, retelling
as if you were telling a joke
that you love,

38:27.739 --> 38:29.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but telling it for modern ears.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, you had some
fun with this?

38:30.642 --> 38:31.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEIL GAIMAN: I had a lot of fun
with it.

38:31.643 --> 38:32.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEIL GAIMAN: But what I didn't
do was invent
stories.

38:34.612 --> 38:38.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You write about
these gods
as though they are still with us
to some degree.

38:38.550 --> 38:41.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, in your writing,
that's a
motif.

38:41.186 --> 38:42.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NEIL GAIMAN: Yes.

38:42.487 --> 38:46.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you feel that,
that the
gods are with us in...

38:46.724 --> 38:50.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEIL GAIMAN: I feel like the
gods are ours.

38:50.228 --> 38:52.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we are allowed -- we created
them.

38:52.163 --> 38:57.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Human beings get to create gods,
and human
beings get to tell stories with
gods.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We carry our cultures around
with us.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We carry our background around
with us.

39:01.706 --> 39:08.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We carry our histories and our
families' histories
and our ancestors histories
around with us.

39:08.112 --> 39:15.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Gaiman himself
has long been
a kind of cult hero to his fans,
who follow

39:15.186 --> 39:23.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him and his work in progress on
his blog and
on Twitter.

39:23.595 --> 39:36.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's reached broader audiences
with adaptations,
a film version of his novel
"Coraline," an

39:36.241 --> 39:41.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
upcoming television series based
on "American
Gods," and much more to come.

39:41.279 --> 39:45.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GAIMAN: For me, it's all
part of the
giant, same thing, which is
storytelling.

39:45.817 --> 39:52.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What fascinates me, what drives
me is the
urge to tell stories.

39:52.190 --> 39:57.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What then drives you is going,
where is this
story best told?

39:57.328 --> 39:59.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How can you tell this story as
one thing?

39:59.330 --> 40:03.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How can -- sometimes, how can
you move this
story from one medium into
another?

40:03.735 --> 40:10.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You wrote about
when you achieve
some success, the fear that you
will be uncovered

40:10.441 --> 40:15.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a kind, what your wife called
the fraud
police, right?

40:15.313 --> 40:20.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you refer to it as the
impostor syndrome,
where this is all too good to be
true.

40:20.051 --> 40:23.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GAIMAN: Absolutely, fearing
that it will
be taken away from you at any
moment when

40:23.154 --> 40:26.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people notice that you are
simply making it
up.

40:26.424 --> 40:30.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I guess it's worse for a
writer because
you are simply making it up.

40:31.029 --> 40:32.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, you really
are.

40:32.730 --> 40:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GAIMAN: You know, you look
around, and
you go, well, doctors, they have
at least

40:35.867 --> 40:37.035 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
learned things.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, architects must
know how to
architect.

40:39.537 --> 40:44.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I'm just a guy who makes
stuff up, and
people happen to like it.

40:44.475 --> 40:46.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, maybe tomorrow, they won't
like it.

40:46.544 --> 40:49.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe there will be that knock
on the door,
and there will be that guy in a
suit with

40:49.247 --> 40:51.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a clipboard saying, right, we're
onto you.

40:51.749 --> 40:53.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to go and get a real
job now.

40:53.217 --> 40:55.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the meantime,
look out.

40:55.153 --> 41:00.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "Norse Mythology" ends with
Ragnarok,
the apocalyptic end of the
world.

41:00.158 --> 41:05.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GAIMAN: One of the things
that I love
about Ragnarok is, yes, it's the
end of all

41:05.496 --> 41:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
times, it's terrible, all the
people are killed.

41:08.666 --> 41:10.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everything is destroyed.

41:10.435 --> 41:18.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet, even as Ragnarok
finishes, you're
told, but there are two human
beings whose

41:18.409 --> 41:25.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
names are Life and Life's
Yearning who are
still hiding successfully, and
they will repopulate

41:25.616 --> 41:27.352 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world.

41:27.385 --> 41:32.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yes, the sun is destroyed,
but a new
sun will come up fresher and
brighter than

41:32.056 --> 41:33.758 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the old one.

41:33.791 --> 41:37.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Until then, from
New York,
I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

41:37.395 --> 41:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be
back shortly
to hear a writer's thoughts on
how stories

41:42.166 --> 41:43.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
influence our beliefs.

41:43.935 --> 41:47.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, take a moment to
hear from your
local PBS station.

41:47.905 --> 41:53.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which
helps keep programs like ours on
the air.

41:53.077 --> 41:54.779 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

41:54.812 --> 42:04.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
"Atlantic"
magazine writer Derek Thompson,
author of

42:04.922 --> 42:09.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
"Atlantic"
magazine writer Derek Thompson,
author of

42:09.560 --> 42:19.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the recent book "Hit Makers,"
looks at how
stories help us understand and
even change

42:19.203 --> 42:23.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the way we see the world.

42:23.474 --> 42:27.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the latest installment in
In My Humble
Opinion.

42:27.145 --> 42:28.980 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Have a listen.

42:29.013 --> 42:32.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEREK THOMPSON, Author, "Hit
Makers: How Things
Become Popular": One thing I
learned writing

42:32.150 --> 42:37.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a book about pop culture hits in
entertainment
is that stories are weapons, for
good or ill.

42:37.054 --> 42:39.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Movies like "Frozen" can teach
us female empowerment.

42:39.357 --> 42:42.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Movies like 1915's "The Birth of
a Nation"
can teach us prejudice.

42:42.827 --> 42:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, take one of the
most ancient
and universal myths, vampires.

42:49.534 --> 42:56.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For hundreds of years, people
didn't understand
death or disease.

42:56.374 --> 43:00.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why did people get sick in
bunches?

43:00.211 --> 43:04.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why did people often die after
their friends
did?

43:04.081 --> 43:10.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, all over the world,
different civilizations
made up the same story: Death
comes from the

43:10.822 --> 43:12.390 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
undead.

43:12.423 --> 43:15.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Before the 1800s, the belief in
vampires stretched
from Transylvania to China.

43:16.027 --> 43:21.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Albanian vampires ate
intestines, while their
Indonesian brethren drank blood.

43:21.165 --> 43:26.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Eastern Europe, they
discriminated against
people they thought might become
vampires,

43:26.804 --> 43:28.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
including the disabled,
atheists, and even
seventh children.

43:28.873 --> 43:31.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, we know germs exists and
vampires do
not.

43:31.209 --> 43:38.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's tempting to say it was just
a stupid
story, but the truth is that
vampires were

43:38.583 --> 43:39.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the perfect story.

43:39.984 --> 43:44.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It didn't just explain the
mystery of death.

43:44.856 --> 43:50.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even more, it explained the
chaos of life
with a spectacular tale that
empowered villagers

43:50.628 --> 43:54.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by telling them that everybody
had the capacity
to fight evil with potions,
garlic, prayers,

43:55.032 --> 43:56.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chastity, stakes, swords, and
fire.

43:56.868 --> 44:00.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have come a long way since
vampires.

44:00.571 --> 44:01.939 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Or have we?

44:01.973 --> 44:04.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even today, society is bound by
the stories
that we tell each other.

44:04.775 --> 44:08.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In an office, loud women are
bossy, but loud
men are assertive.

44:09.013 --> 44:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An outspoken white person is
authoritative,
but an outspoken black person is
threatening.

44:20.591 --> 44:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are men smarter than women, or
whites smarter
than other races?

44:29.734 --> 44:39.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is no scientific basis for
these ideas.

44:39.043 --> 44:43.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are stories that had to be
invented,
constructed, told, and believed.

44:43.781 --> 44:53.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the time we are children,
we hear stories
about the way the world ought to
work.

44:53.824 --> 44:59.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the time we are children,
we hear stories
about the way the world ought to
work.

44:59.196 --> 45:00.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who should we trust?

45:00.431 --> 45:02.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who should we fear?

45:02.300 --> 45:14.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are social narratives
passed down, like
bedtime stories, across
generations, telling

45:14.345 --> 45:21.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us how to live and what to
expect.

45:21.419 --> 45:26.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Science finally killed the folk
belief in
vampires, but how do we drive a
stake through

45:26.257 --> 45:27.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
misogyny or prejudice?

45:27.959 --> 45:31.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
History is full of men and women
who successfully
championed justice and equal
rights.

45:31.429 --> 45:33.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Empathy and equality are
powerful stories.

45:33.564 --> 45:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They need equally powerful
storytellers.

45:35.399 --> 45:43.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on the
"NewsHour" online
right now: It's a startling
image that has

45:43.307 --> 45:55.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spread quickly across the
Internet, a Syrian
man sitting in his bombed-out
bedroom in Aleppo

45:55.453 --> 45:59.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
listening to music from a record
player.

45:59.724 --> 46:12.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talked to the photographer
who captured
the moment of reverie.

46:12.169 --> 46:19.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can find that on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

46:19.910 --> 46:30.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later tonight on "Washington
Week": The White
House sparks an international
incident by

46:30.087 --> 46:41.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suggesting British intelligence
helped the
Obama administration wiretap
Trump Tower.

46:41.265 --> 46:53.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why is the president doubling
down on these
unsubstantiated allegations,
unsubstantiated
