GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON,
Author: School choice.

00:18.133 --> 00:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those two words spark a whole
host of emotions from people
across the political spectrum.

00:22.666 --> 00:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As a kid, I never heard the
words school choice uttered.

00:26.633 --> 00:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But they did indeed
shape my childhood.

00:28.633 --> 00:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You see, my mom was a single
mom, a union Democrat who worked
at the phone company during

00:35.533 --> 00:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the day and sold tupperware at
night, at least on the nights
when she wasn't studying for

00:38.133 --> 00:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her college degree.

00:40.133 --> 00:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She frequented yard sales,
grocery-shopped with double
coupons, and knew her way around

00:44.233 --> 00:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Marshalls layaway window.

00:47.100 --> 00:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she lied about our address,
so that I could attend what
she judged to be the best

00:51.866 --> 00:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
public elementary
school in our area.

00:54.900 --> 00:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In a number of states,
that is seen as a felony.

00:57.666 --> 01:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, parents across the
country regularly face jail
time and huge fines for what my

01:03.500 --> 01:06.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mom did, really.

01:06.500 --> 01:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parents are facing
prison to give their
children possibilities,
possibilities that area given

01:13.433 --> 01:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for upper-middle-class and
wealthy families, families that
can exercise their own school

01:16.900 --> 01:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
choice because they have
the means to choose what and
where is best for their kids.

01:21.733 --> 01:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a kid, it didn't occur to
me that using a baby-sitter's
address or an address where

01:26.533 --> 01:30.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
my dad used to live
before the bank took his
property back was wrong.

01:30.666 --> 01:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was what was required,
do-it-yourself school choice to
make more choices down the road

01:36.933 --> 01:38.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
possible.

01:38.733 --> 01:40.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it worked.

01:40.866 --> 01:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The good school my mom got me
into, gave me a great start
for the rest of my education.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I went to a good college.

01:47.700 --> 01:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From there, I had the privilege
of becoming a Fulbright
Scholar, and that helped lead

01:51.100 --> 01:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
me to Harvard Business School.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But along the way, I
saw just how narrow the
funnel that leads to the
nation's elite institutions

01:58.533 --> 02:00.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
truly is.

02:00.633 --> 02:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The thing that strikes me
now is that all that I have
had the privilege of learning

02:03.900 --> 02:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and doing and undertaking since
then is because I had a mom
who understood that education

02:11.333 --> 02:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the best anti-poverty
vaccination she could
give me and the best
shot at class mobility

02:15.500 --> 02:17.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
she had to offer.

02:17.566 --> 02:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For many moms and dads,
school choice is not an
issue, it's not partisan.

02:23.500 --> 02:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is about possibilities
and a chance to give kids the
springboard they need to vault

02:28.033 --> 02:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over class barriers and toward
the best future they can build.

02:31.866 --> 02:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that future is
something in which every
one of us has a stake.

02:36.233 --> 02:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
