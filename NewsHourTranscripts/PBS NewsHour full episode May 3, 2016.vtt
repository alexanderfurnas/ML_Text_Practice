JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:07.774 --> 00:11.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
The spotlight's on Indiana.
Hoosiers cast

00:11.612 --> 00:14.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a critical primary vote in the
race for the
White House.

00:15.082 --> 00:19.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Tuesday:
the national conversation on
rethinking educational

00:19.753 --> 00:22.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
standards. We sit down with
Education Secretary
John King.

00:22.823 --> 00:27.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, what do you
do when a
family member runs away from
home to fight

00:27.527 --> 00:32.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for ISIS? Mothers and brothers
of terrorist
fighters speak out.

00:32.199 --> 00:35.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIANNE BOUDREAU, Mother of
Slain Foreign
Fighter: Not only do they lose
their son or

00:35.969 --> 00:40.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their daughter to something
horrific, but
they also carry the guilt of
what their child

00:41.008 --> 00:44.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has done to others. And it's a
horrible, horrible
burden to carry.

00:44.678 --> 00:47.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:47.180 --> 00:51.485 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:51.585 --> 01:04.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's a lot
riding on
the results from Indiana's
presidential primary

01:04.197 --> 01:08.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tonight, and the tension is
higher than ever.
The top two Republican
candidates unloaded

01:08.936 --> 01:12.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on each other today, taking the
vitriol to
new levels.

01:12.339 --> 01:13.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
This man is a pathological liar.

01:15.909 --> 01:20.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ted Cruz in Indiana
this morning
unleashing a blistering attack
on Donald Trump.

01:20.447 --> 01:26.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican front-runner
cited an unsubstantiated
National Enquirer report that
linked Cruz's

01:27.054 --> 01:30.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
father, Rafael, to the man who
killed President
John F. Kennedy.

01:30.824 --> 01:33.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
His father with was Lee Harvey
Oswald prior

01:34.061 --> 01:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Oswald's being, you know,
shot. And nobody
even brings it up. I mean, they
don't even

01:39.433 --> 01:41.401 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
talk about that.

01:41.501 --> 01:45.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump also chided
Cruz over a confrontation
with the New York businessman's
supporters.

01:45.539 --> 01:49.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Well, they know
he's lying.
They have been watching him lie.
That's what

01:49.443 --> 01:51.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he does. That's why we call him
lyin' Ted.

01:51.578 --> 01:56.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Hours later, Cruz
branded Trump
utterly amoral and compared
likened him to

01:56.984 --> 01:58.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a character in the "Back to the
Future" movies.

01:58.885 --> 02:06.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: A caricature of a
braggadocios,
arrogant buffoon who builds
giant casinos

02:06.693 --> 02:16.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with giant pictures of him
everywhere he looks.
We are looking, potentially, at
the Biff Tannen

02:16.603 --> 02:18.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
presidency.

02:18.472 --> 02:22.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This very personal
war of words
went white-hot even as Indiana
voters were

02:22.809 --> 02:28.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to the polls. And while
Trump was trading
barbs with Cruz, he was taking
fire on another

02:28.949 --> 02:33.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
front, from Democratic
front-runner Hillary
Clinton. She was interviewed on
MSNBC.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
He has given no indication that
he understands

02:37.090 --> 02:40.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the gravity of the
responsibilities that go
with being commander in chief,
and that will

02:40.627 --> 02:42.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be a big part of my campaign.

02:42.562 --> 02:47.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clinton spent the day
in West Virginia
and Ohio. But Democratic rival
Bernie Sanders

02:47.734 --> 02:49.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
made a last-ditch push in
Indiana.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
These trade agreements, whether
it's NAFTA

02:52.539 --> 02:57.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or permanent normal trade
relations with China,
were a disaster for American
workers. I understood

02:57.544 --> 03:02.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that. I fought them. I was out
on picket lines
with workers in opposition to
NAFTA. Secretary

03:02.182 --> 03:08.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Clinton, as you know, has
supported every
one of these disastrous trade
agreements.

03:08.121 --> 03:12.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: After today, the
primary season
moves into the home stretch,
heading toward

03:12.659 --> 03:18.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the final big day on June 7 and
the biggest
delegate prize, California.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:21.968 --> 03:26.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We will have a
report from
on the ground in Indiana after
the news summary.

03:26.840 --> 03:31.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: Islamic
State fighters killed a U.S.
Navy SEAL in

03:31.611 --> 03:37.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Northern Iraq. The ISIS attack
near the city
of Mosul was the biggest in
months by the

03:37.884 --> 03:43.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
militants. They broke through
Kurdish militia
forces before being driven off.
U.S. officials

03:43.256 --> 03:45.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said the SEAL was there in an
advisory role.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
You had an individual who wasn't
in a combat

03:49.096 --> 03:54.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mission come under withering
attack from enemy
forces. He was in a combat
situation. He was

03:54.901 --> 04:03.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prepared to deal with it, but,
unfortunately,
under a complex attack, he was
killed. And

04:03.176 --> 04:04.911 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's tragic.

04:05.011 --> 04:08.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In all, three
Americans have
been killed in combat since the
anti-ISIS

04:08.882 --> 04:10.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
campaign began in 2014.

04:10.784 --> 04:15.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rebel rocket
fire rained
down on a hospital in Aleppo,
Syria, today,

04:15.856 --> 04:19.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killing at least four people.
The hospital
was in a government-controlled
part of the

04:19.826 --> 04:22.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city. A health official said
more than 30
people were wounded in the
bombing, many of

04:23.063 --> 04:24.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them women and children.

04:24.898 --> 04:30.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Separately, the U.N. Security
Council demanded
protection for hospitals in war
zones.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president of Doctors Without
Borders pushed
for the vote.

04:32.873 --> 04:37.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JOANNE LIU, President,
Doctors Without
Borders: We will not leave
patients behind,

04:37.310 --> 04:47.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we will not be silent.
Seeking or providing
health care must not be a death
sentence.

04:47.287 --> 04:55.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You will be judged not on your
words today,
but on your actions. Your work
has only begun.

04:55.562 --> 04:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Please make this resolution save
lives.

04:59.666 --> 05:05.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
attempts to restore
a truce all across Syria
continued in Moscow.

05:05.372 --> 05:09.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A special U.N. envoy said peace
talks can
resume if that happens.

05:09.776 --> 05:15.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Kenya, a small
miracle.
A 6-month-old baby girl has been
pulled alive

05:15.982 --> 05:21.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from a building that collapsed
four days ago
in Nairobi. Officials say she
was dehydrated,

05:21.421 --> 05:27.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but otherwise unhurt. At least
23 people died
Friday night when the
seven-story building

05:27.127 --> 05:32.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
buckled after several days of
heavy rain.
More than 90 others are still
missing. Interior

05:32.999 --> 05:35.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ministry officials say the
building had been
marked for demolition.

05:36.069 --> 05:40.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country, more
than 45,000 Detroit students
missed class

05:40.140 --> 05:45.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a second day, as state
lawmakers worked
to end a teacher sick-out. The
teachers rallied

05:45.212 --> 05:49.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
outside public school
headquarters to protest
a funding shortage. Union
officials say it

05:49.282 --> 05:51.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could leave some of them unpaid
this summer.

05:51.885 --> 05:57.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Legislative leaders insisted
today the teachers
will be paid. They're debating a
$720 million

05:57.958 --> 05:59.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
plan for the debt-ridden
schools.

05:59.826 --> 06:04.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two states chose
different
paths today on allowing
concealed guns on

06:05.065 --> 06:11.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
college campuses. In Tennessee,
a bill permitting
the practice became law, when
Republican Governor

06:11.104 --> 06:18.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bill Haslam chose not to sign it
or veto it.
But, in Georgia, Republican
Nathan Deal vetoed

06:18.245 --> 06:19.980 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a similar bill.

06:20.080 --> 06:24.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: U.S. car sales
slumped last
month, but trucks and SUVs
soared, thanks

06:24.284 --> 06:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to cheaper gas. Honda and Nissan
gained 13
percent to 14 percent, their
best April ever.

06:29.889 --> 06:35.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Wall Street had a down day,
on worries
about growth in Europe and
China. The Dow

06:35.362 --> 06:39.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jones industrial average lost
140 points to
close at 17750. The Nasdaq fell
54 points.

06:39.332 --> 06:42.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the S&amp;P 500 slipped 18.

06:42.235 --> 06:48.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the hip-hop
Broadway musical
"Hamilton" isn't done making
history yet.

06:48.141 --> 06:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The groundbreaking show garnered
a record
16 Tony nominations today. If it
wins as many

06:54.281 --> 07:00.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as 13, that would be a record,
too. The Tony
Awards for live Broadway theater
performances

07:00.120 --> 07:02.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will be handed out June 12.

07:02.122 --> 07:06.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
how Indiana's election results
could shape

07:06.226 --> 07:11.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rest of the presidential
primary; Education
Secretary John King talks about
the impact

07:11.831 --> 07:18.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new national standards are
having in the classroom;
inside the government-held areas
of Syria,

07:18.305 --> 07:21.808 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

07:21.908 --> 07:34.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now back to
Indiana and today's
crucial primary vote.

07:34.988 --> 07:38.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're joined by Brandon Smith of
Indiana Public
Broadcasting.

07:38.525 --> 07:43.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Brandon, we talked to you
last week, and
I think a lot of us thought the
Republican

07:43.496 --> 07:48.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race couldn't get any rougher,
but, apparently,
it is. What's the state of that
race right

07:48.301 --> 07:50.070 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH, Indiana Public
Broadcasting:
Well, certainly, I don't know if
we can say

07:52.305 --> 07:57.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anything new from Donald Trump's
side. Some
would call what he said
outlandish, what he's

07:57.177 --> 08:01.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
been -- this whole JFK
assassination connection
between Cruz's father.

08:01.815 --> 08:06.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, certainly, Cruz's reaction
is something
we haven't quite seen before,
and what some

08:06.219 --> 08:10.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think is a hint of frustration,
certainly,
and perhaps even some
desperation.

08:10.924 --> 08:14.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why are people
saying that?

08:14.194 --> 08:18.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Well, this is
high noon for
Ted Cruz, I mean, and he's made
it that way.

08:18.998 --> 08:23.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's made it very clear that
Indiana is the
time. It's the place to -- if
he's going to

08:23.770 --> 08:27.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make an impact in this race in
stopping Donald
Trump from the nomination, that
Indiana is

08:27.507 --> 08:29.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the place to do it.

08:29.376 --> 08:33.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He set himself up for some
pretty big stakes
here. And yet just about every
poll we have

08:33.313 --> 08:35.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
seen has him trailing.

08:35.215 --> 08:39.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is your
understanding
from your -- and from your
reporting, Brandon

08:39.619 --> 08:44.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Smith, on what is driving the
Trump vote?
Who is supporting Donald Trump
and why?

08:44.924 --> 08:46.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: A lot of new
voters.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have talked to county clerks
around the
state who say they have seen
record numbers

08:50.864 --> 08:55.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in some cases of new
registrations, brand-new
voters who haven't vote before.
So that's

08:55.668 --> 09:00.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainly part of it. It's also
people who
aren't the evangelical vote that
Ted Cruz

09:00.673 --> 09:08.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brings out, but are Republicans
and concerned
chiefly with economic issues,
how the manufacturing

09:08.615 --> 09:09.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
industry is in this state.

09:09.849 --> 09:11.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's something that Donald
Trump speaks
a lot to.

09:12.051 --> 09:16.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about on the
Cruz side?
What do you see driving his
vote?

09:17.056 --> 09:20.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Some of it is,
like we -- like
I just said, the evangelical
vote that he

09:21.094 --> 09:24.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brings out, and it's certainly
strong in some
parts of this state.

09:24.164 --> 09:30.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's also no small part of
that crowd who's
in it to stop Trump, some Kasich
supporters

09:30.303 --> 09:34.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who say, I'm here to stop Trump,
I'm voting
for Cruz. That's some of it. But
it doesn't

09:34.774 --> 09:36.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
look like it will be enough.

09:36.709 --> 09:40.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much is
organization going
to matter, do you think, when
they count the

09:40.580 --> 09:42.449 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
votes tonight?

09:42.549 --> 09:45.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: I'm not sure how
much it will
end up mattering, because the
best organization

09:45.518 --> 09:50.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is probably Ted Cruz. He
certainly spent the
most time here. He's gone all --
he's blanketed

09:50.390 --> 09:54.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the state. It's been quite the
barnstorming
tour of Indiana.

09:54.727 --> 10:00.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet he is still probably --
it looks like
he's going to lose, or at least
not get a

10:01.067 --> 10:05.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very big vote here. So, I'm not
sure how much
the organization will end up
mattering.

10:06.039 --> 10:10.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you now about
the Democrats. If you believe
the polls, that

10:10.743 --> 10:13.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one is much closer. What does it
look like
to you?

10:13.613 --> 10:18.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: That's the way
it's looking
here too. And it looks to be an
echo of 2008,

10:18.184 --> 10:22.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in which Hillary Clinton beat
then candidate
Barack Obama by a pretty narrow
margin.

10:22.822 --> 10:26.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It looks to be heading in the
same direction
here. Bernie Sanders certainly
drives out

10:26.526 --> 10:30.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of young people. Turnout
has been high
around the state so far in both
early voting

10:30.997 --> 10:34.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what we have seen at the
polls today.
So that will certainly help him,
too, if it's

10:34.834 --> 10:37.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot of young people out there
voting.

10:37.103 --> 10:41.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it looks to be a pretty
close margin,
though Hillary is expected by
people here

10:41.574 --> 10:43.343 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to win.

10:43.443 --> 10:46.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What's motivating
the Hillary
Clinton vote? What do people
like about her

10:46.679 --> 10:48.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who say they're going to vote
for her?

10:48.281 --> 10:49.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Well, it's a
couple things.

10:50.083 --> 10:54.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, I mentioned 2008. This is
in many ways
a Clinton state in that respect.
She spent

10:54.954 --> 10:59.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of time here back then,
and people remember
that. She has a lot of support
from the so-called

10:59.259 --> 11:05.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party establishment. A lot of
big-time Democratic
leaders in this state threw
their support

11:05.398 --> 11:07.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
behind Hillary Clinton.

11:07.300 --> 11:12.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of it is also those
economic issues,
but it's the idea that Hillary's
ideas, Hillary's

11:12.438 --> 11:16.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plans are perhaps a little more
achievable
than Bernie Sanders'.

11:16.209 --> 11:20.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Sanders, just
quickly,
his support, younger voters?

11:20.580 --> 11:25.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Younger voters,
people disillusioned,
a little bit of the mirror of
Donald Trump's

11:25.718 --> 11:29.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support, some people who don't
like the system
and think that Bernie will kind
of upset the

11:29.589 --> 11:31.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
apple cart for good.

11:31.424 --> 11:35.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Brandon Smith
with Indiana
Public Broadcasting, we thank
you. Good to

11:35.395 --> 11:36.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have you with us again.

11:36.796 --> 11:38.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Thanks very much.

11:38.698 --> 11:43.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can

12:02.021 --> 12:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Education
Secretary John
King has only been officially in
his position

12:13.066 --> 12:17.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about a month-and-a-half, taking
over for
Arne Duncan, who served for the
first seven

12:17.570 --> 12:20.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years of President Obama's
administration.

12:20.206 --> 12:25.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But King has inherited a very
full plate,
including the successor to No
Child Left Behind,

12:25.578 --> 12:30.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
increasing resegregation of
public schools,
and a higher education
admissions process

12:30.817 --> 12:32.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he likens to a caste system.

12:32.919 --> 12:38.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I sat down with him earlier
today as part
of our Making the Grade series
on education.

12:38.758 --> 12:42.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While the majority of the states
are implementing
Common Core, it hasn't been
without resistance.

12:42.662 --> 12:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are still hundreds of
thousands of parents
out there who are having their
children opt

12:47.600 --> 12:49.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out of some of these tests.

12:49.769 --> 12:55.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my question is, doesn't that
structurally
defeat the system if, at a
certain threshold,

12:55.241 --> 12:57.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can't get good data anymore
because people
are opting out?

12:57.810 --> 13:00.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN KING, U.S. Education
Secretary: So, the
effort to raise standards is
really about

13:00.313 --> 13:03.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ensuring that all students
graduate ready
for what's next.

13:03.916 --> 13:08.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you said, we have 40-plus
states that are
working on higher standards.
There are challenges,

13:08.254 --> 13:13.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for sure, in raising standards,
changes that
need to be made to instruction,
to classroom

13:13.393 --> 13:17.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
materials, and to assessments.
And states
are making smart adjustments
along the way.

13:18.097 --> 13:22.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think we generally have
positive momentum.
We have the highest graduation
rate we have

13:22.201 --> 13:26.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ever had as a country last year.
But it's
not surprising that there are
going to be

13:26.372 --> 13:31.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
challenges along the way, and
states are going
to need to be responsive to what
they're hearing

13:31.744 --> 13:36.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from parents and educators, make
adjustments,
while staying focused on raising
standards.

13:36.115 --> 13:40.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: No Child Left
Behind, we
all now in hindsight know that
we didn't reach

13:40.653 --> 13:45.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
100 percent proficiency by 2014.
But one of
the things that that did do for
us is give

13:45.925 --> 13:51.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us a little bit of visibility
into how specific
schools and specific subgroups
were performing.

13:51.631 --> 13:58.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, now, with the Every Student
Succeeds Act,
it seems that you're letting
possibly thousands

13:58.404 --> 14:02.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of schools who were
underperforming off the
hook by focusing on just the 5
percent that

14:02.942 --> 14:05.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are really going to get -- be
targeted the
aid.

14:05.178 --> 14:09.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KING: The structure of the
Every Student
Succeeds Act is to give states
and local districts

14:09.949 --> 14:13.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more flexibility, but within
clear civil rights
guardrails.

14:13.319 --> 14:18.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There is a very clear
requirement for states
and districts to intervene when
schools are

14:18.124 --> 14:23.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
struggling, as you say, in the
bottom 5 percent,
but also schools that have
chronically low

14:23.596 --> 14:29.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
graduation rates, schools that
have significant
achievement gaps, where
subgroups, African-American

14:29.168 --> 14:34.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students, Latino students,
English learners,
if those subgroups are
underperforming, states

14:34.407 --> 14:37.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and districts also have an
obligation to intervene.

14:37.877 --> 14:42.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president signed the law
because he believes
it builds on the civil rights
legacy of the

14:42.482 --> 14:47.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law, which was first adopted in
1965 as a
civil rights law. And so those
civil rights

14:47.887 --> 14:51.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guardrails are key, we think, to
successful
implementation.

14:51.224 --> 14:55.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It actually
takes a significant
amount of power out of this very
office and

14:55.628 --> 15:02.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gives it back to the states in
several ways.
So, you can't actually impose
any specific

15:02.668 --> 15:07.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guidelines about Common Core or
about things
that states have to do.

15:07.507 --> 15:12.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm trying to figure out,
what's the right
balance between the federal
government's involvement

15:12.345 --> 15:15.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and state governments'
administration of education?

15:15.915 --> 15:19.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KING: Well, we think, on
standards, that
that's a good example of where
we have tried

15:19.418 --> 15:21.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to strike the right balance.

15:21.387 --> 15:24.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the law requires that states
adopt standards
that will ensure that, when
students graduate

15:24.924 --> 15:28.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from high school, they're ready
for college
and careers, they're ready to do
credit-bearing

15:28.561 --> 15:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
course work in college. That's
good, because
it means every state has to have
high standards.

15:33.566 --> 15:38.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, the specific details
of those standards
are left to states. We think
that's right.

15:38.738 --> 15:43.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what we have always
thought, that states
should be the ones determining
their standards.

15:43.376 --> 15:48.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On accountability, it's clear
states and districts
have a responsibility to
intervene where schools

15:48.581 --> 15:52.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are struggling or where there
are achievement
gaps, but the exact nature of
those interventions,

15:52.919 --> 15:55.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they can design based on local
circumstances.

15:55.388 --> 15:59.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
things that people
are concerned about structurally
is that there

15:59.458 --> 16:05.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
almost seems to be a
resegregation of education
in America right now, that, in
the last three

16:05.765 --> 16:09.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, two things have changed
primarily,
that minorities now outnumber
whites in the

16:09.836 --> 16:14.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nation's public schools, and the
majority
of public school students are
poor, and that

16:14.140 --> 16:15.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they qualify for free lunches.

16:16.075 --> 16:19.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do we change this narrative
about almost
two separate education systems?

16:19.979 --> 16:22.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN KING: It's a huge problem.

16:22.748 --> 16:29.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that we have tons of
research evidence
over decades showing that
students do better

16:29.589 --> 16:36.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in diverse schools, and yet 60
years after
Brown vs. Board of Education, we
still have

16:36.629 --> 16:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
racially isolated, economically
isolated schools.

16:39.966 --> 16:43.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What's encouraging -- the
Century Foundation
just did a report on this
recently. What's

16:43.669 --> 16:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
encouraging is, you have efforts
all over
the country, locally-led
voluntary efforts,

16:48.608 --> 16:51.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to create socioeconomically
integrated schools.

16:52.078 --> 16:56.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we want to -- we want to
accelerate that
work, so we have made school
diversity a priority

16:56.482 --> 17:00.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for investing in an innovation
grant program.
The president's proposed an
initiative called

17:00.920 --> 17:06.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stronger Together, $120 million
in his 2017
budget that would support local
efforts to

17:06.859 --> 17:09.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
create socioeconomically diverse
schools.

17:09.662 --> 17:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Schools -- you can imagine an
art school that
might draw students from across
different

17:13.833 --> 17:19.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
communities, a dual-language
school where
native English speakers and
English learners

17:19.238 --> 17:21.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
would together have the
opportunity to learn
two languages.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even in terms
of higher
ed, you have said before that
there's almost

17:24.710 --> 17:29.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a caste system of colleges and
universities
in the admissions process. So,
how do we change

17:29.248 --> 17:31.183 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that?

17:31.284 --> 17:33.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KING: I think of a place
like Franklin
&amp; Marshall that's committed to
enrolling low-income

17:33.219 --> 17:37.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students, has raised their
academic standards
at the same time as they have
enrolled more

17:37.590 --> 17:41.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
low-income students, and they're
providing
the supports necessary to ensure
that those

17:41.360 --> 17:43.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
students graduate.

17:43.262 --> 17:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think there's a bully
pulpit role
for the administration to play.
But we have

17:47.366 --> 17:50.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
also got to make sure the
resources are there.
And that's why the Pell Grant
program is so

17:50.736 --> 17:55.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
important. It's why the
president has added
$1,000 to the average Pell Grant
since the

17:55.174 --> 17:56.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
administration began.

17:57.076 --> 18:01.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's why we think it's important
to let students
access Pell Grants in the
summer, because

18:01.180 --> 18:06.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that will help low-income
students stay on
track to graduation. So, there's
both a -- there's

18:06.686 --> 18:10.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both a moral responsibility that
higher ed
institutions have, and a
responsibility that

18:10.489 --> 18:16.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government has to provide the
resources to
support all of our citizens in
making it through

18:16.329 --> 18:17.997 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
higher education.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally,
unlike a lot of
education secretaries or Cabinet
members,

18:20.733 --> 18:24.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you have got a kind of a
personal connection
to education. You lost your
parents when you

18:25.071 --> 18:29.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were a very young age, and you
have said before
that it's really teachers that
saved your

18:29.508 --> 18:29.909 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Explain that.

18:31.877 --> 18:34.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KING: School really did
save my life.
My mom passed away when I was 8
in October

18:34.447 --> 18:40.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of my fourth-grade year. I lived
with my dad,
who was suffering with
undiagnosed Alzheimer's

18:40.853 --> 18:42.722 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
disease.

18:42.822 --> 18:47.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so home was this very scary
and unpredictable
place. My dad passed away when I
was 12. And

18:47.526 --> 18:50.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during that period, my life
could have gone
in a lot of directions. You
know, teachers

18:50.529 --> 18:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could have looked at me and
said, here's an
African-American Latino male
student, family

18:54.500 --> 18:59.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in crisis, going to a New York
City public
school in Brooklyn. What chance
does he have?

18:59.338 --> 19:04.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they didn't. They chose to
invest in me
and made school this place that
was engaging

19:04.777 --> 19:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and compelling and interesting,
where we read
The New York Times every day, we
did productions

19:09.715 --> 19:14.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of "Midsummer Night's Dream" and
"Alice in
Wonderland." We went to the
ballet and the

19:14.987 --> 19:16.822 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
museum.

19:16.922 --> 19:20.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
School was engaging and a place
where I could
be a kid when I couldn't be a
kid outside

19:20.760 --> 19:22.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of school.

19:22.728 --> 19:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm very clear: I'm alive
today, doing
this work today, became a
teacher and a principal

19:27.333 --> 19:33.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because the teachers I had saved
my life.
And, you know, I bring to work
every day the

19:33.572 --> 19:37.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
goal of trying to do for other
kids what my
teachers did for me.

19:37.109 --> 19:42.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Secretary
King, thanks for
joining us.

19:42.548 --> 19:48.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN KING: Thanks so much.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

19:51.791 --> 19:56.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
parents of ISIS
fighters grapple with the
warning signs they

19:57.063 --> 20:04.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
missed; a Cinderella story for a
soccer team
and a city; plus, why becoming a
grandma isn't

20:04.170 --> 20:05.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what it used to be.

20:05.704 --> 20:09.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, first, we return to the war
in Syria.

20:09.842 --> 20:14.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of the country's urban
centers have been
hammered by bombs, rockets, and
bullets. But

20:14.747 --> 20:20.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the heart of the capital,
Damascus, has been
left relatively unscathed.
Orthodox Christians

20:20.453 --> 20:26.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were even able to hold a public
Palm Sunday
celebration last week as the war
continues

20:26.258 --> 20:28.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the city's outskirts.

20:28.160 --> 20:33.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times' Declan Walsh
recently
returned from Damascus and
Syria's largest

20:33.632 --> 20:37.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
city, Aleppo, the scene of heavy
fighting
in recent weeks.

20:37.603 --> 20:40.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He joins me now from Cairo,
Egypt.

20:40.306 --> 20:49.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Declan Walsh, welcome to the
program.

20:49.348 --> 20:52.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this moment in the civil war.
What is it like?

20:52.151 --> 20:57.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DECLAN WALSH, The New York
Times: Well, it's
a country that is under tight
control from

20:57.189 --> 21:01.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bashar al-Assad in those parts
of Syria that
he still controls.

21:01.694 --> 21:05.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there are military
checkposts everywhere.
There is the image of the
president, Bashar

21:05.898 --> 21:12.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
al-Assad, everywhere you turn,
on every major
public junction. And, you know,
it's a very

21:12.238 --> 21:20.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strange place in many ways, a
place of great
contrasts. You have -- in
Damascus, just on

21:20.279 --> 21:23.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outskirts of the city, there are
many neighborhoods
that are controlled by the
rebels.

21:23.916 --> 21:28.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is sporadic fighting that
goes on all
the time there. Yet, in the city
center itself,

21:28.487 --> 21:33.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is some form, a semblance
of normal
life that's taking place. People
are going

21:33.259 --> 21:38.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about their business. There's
traffic. At
the weekends, people celebrate.
I saw many

21:38.497 --> 21:40.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
weddings take place.

21:40.366 --> 21:44.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So people seem to have
determined, as much
as they can, that they need on
get on with

21:44.937 --> 21:51.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their normal lives, even while
pretty intense
fighting in some cases is taking
place in

21:51.510 --> 21:52.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
great proximity to them.

21:52.945 --> 21:55.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How are they
managing to hold
up?

21:55.915 --> 22:00.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DECLAN WALSH: You know, there is
an international
aid presence on the ground that
is helping

22:00.920 --> 22:02.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people out somewhat.

22:02.988 --> 22:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The machinery of the state is
still functioning
to some degree. But people are
extremely strained.

22:10.629 --> 22:16.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In cities like Aleppo and Homs,
which I visited,
you have many people who are
living rough.

22:16.902 --> 22:21.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're living in shelters.
They're living
in abandoned buildings. And
they're living

22:21.540 --> 22:26.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
among the among the rubble of
buildings that
have been destroyed in
airstrikes.

22:26.512 --> 22:31.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, already, there's a housing
problem. And
there's -- people are also very
vulnerable

22:31.717 --> 22:37.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when it comes to things like
food, electricity,
water. But, again, it does
depend where you

22:37.556 --> 22:39.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are in the country.

22:39.425 --> 22:43.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And who are
people holding
responsible for their plight,
for where they

22:44.096 --> 22:45.898 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are right now?

22:45.998 --> 22:51.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DECLAN WALSH: Well, when you
speak to Syrians,
people are reticent to talk
about politics

22:51.704 --> 22:53.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in -- particularly in
government-held areas.

22:53.672 --> 22:59.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Journalists who visit, like me,
travel around
the country in the company of an
official

22:59.144 --> 23:03.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from the Ministry of
Information. So, it's
quite difficult to get people to
open up about,

23:03.716 --> 23:08.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for instance, their attitude
toward President
Bashar al-Assad or indeed to
talk about the

23:08.420 --> 23:10.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rebels in other areas.

23:10.689 --> 23:16.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what people do talk about
is, you know,
how -- they recognize how bad
their own situation

23:16.662 --> 23:22.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is. They can talk about that
with great, great
freedom. And they feel extremely
frustrated.

23:22.868 --> 23:28.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they see -- there's a great
sense of helplessness
among Syrians at this stage,
after five years

23:28.807 --> 23:30.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of conflict, about the war.

23:30.676 --> 23:34.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They see it as something that's
much bigger
even than their own country. You
know, this

23:34.413 --> 23:39.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a conflict that has so many
foreign forces
involved with it now. People
will talk to

23:40.019 --> 23:46.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you about America and Russia,
Iran, Saudi
Arabia, Turkey. These are all
the countries

23:46.325 --> 23:49.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are supporting different
sides in this
conflict.

23:49.495 --> 23:53.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they -- when you speak to
people, there's
an overwhelming sense of
helplessness, that,

23:53.265 --> 23:56.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, there is no easy
solution to this
war in sight.

23:56.802 --> 24:01.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What was so
fascinating, Declan
Walsh, about your reporting is
that, I mean,

24:01.707 --> 24:06.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ordinary people -- you talked
with a shopkeeper.
You talked with so many others
who just -- they're

24:06.912 --> 24:11.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still human beings. They still
have, you know,
normal human feelings.

24:11.984 --> 24:16.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you were even able to see a
sense of humor
that some of them have, still.

24:16.588 --> 24:18.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DECLAN WALSH: Oh, absolutely,
yes.

24:18.390 --> 24:22.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you know, I suppose
that's one of
the best defense mechanisms for
all of us

24:23.095 --> 24:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in situations of adversity. And
if you have
the strength to try and turn
something to

24:28.233 --> 24:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a joke, even to a dark joke,
it's one way
of getting through the day.

24:32.738 --> 24:38.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for those people, Syrians,
who are not
directly caught up in the
fighting on a day-to-day

24:38.210 --> 24:43.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basis, they're still living in
situations
of adversity. And they're
turning to all sorts

24:43.282 --> 24:48.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of coping mechanisms to try and
get through
that. Humor is one thing.

24:48.187 --> 24:53.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, when I was in Aleppo,
one of the
most striking things was that,
in the city

24:53.859 --> 24:59.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
center, there was intermittent
shelling. Bombs
were landing here and there. You
would be

24:59.398 --> 25:03.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
driving around in the streets,
and you would
hear an explosion 500 meters
away. There would

25:03.335 --> 25:06.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be another explosion an hour
later and maybe
a kilometer away.

25:07.005 --> 25:11.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It made a tremendous racket. And
for a newcomer
like me, you would be absolutely
alarmed,

25:11.744 --> 25:16.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wondering, you know, what's
going on or where
is this coming from? But the
people that you're

25:17.082 --> 25:21.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speaking to locally wouldn't
even flinch.
They just went on like it wasn't
happening.

25:21.920 --> 25:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you asked them why,
they said, look,
you know, we have been living
with this situation

25:26.458 --> 25:28.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so long, this is the way we deal
with it.

25:28.827 --> 25:32.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, some
remarkable reporting
from inside Syria.

25:32.965 --> 25:35.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Declan Walsh of The New York
Times, we thank
you.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DECLAN WALSH: Thank you.

25:37.770 --> 25:41.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: While we're
reporting on that
war-torn country, for months, we
have reported

25:41.540 --> 25:47.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Western-born young people who

Parents and relatives of some of
the young
European men who'd joined ISIS
and other extremist

25:52.684 --> 25:58.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups met late last week at a
conference
in Paris. Among the group were
also family

25:58.223 --> 26:03.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
members of victims of the
terrorist attacks
last fall in Paris. They
gathered to grieve,

26:04.062 --> 26:09.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to condemn terrorism and the
extremism that
drives it, and look for ways to
prevent other

26:09.601 --> 26:13.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
young people from following the
fates of their
loved ones.

26:13.972 --> 26:17.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Paris, special
correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports.

MALCOLM BRABANT: This is the
Bataclan club,
where Islamist gunmen
slaughtered 89 concert-goers

26:23.849 --> 26:25.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
last November the 13th.

26:25.751 --> 26:30.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was, briefly, a place of
pilgrimage for
a group of people inextricably
linked to the

26:30.789 --> 26:36.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
massacre through the ideology
embraced by
their relatives, even though
they didn't participate

26:36.361 --> 26:38.163 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the attack.

26:38.263 --> 26:43.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Karolina Dam, mother of
18-year-old Lukas,
a boy with learning
difficulties, converted

26:43.268 --> 26:48.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and radicalized in Denmark and
believed killed
in an airstrike on the Syrian
Turkish border.

Janne Mortensen (ph), also from

before he was killed

27:06.859 --> 27:08.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a battle with Kenyan troops.

27:08.894 --> 27:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL EVANS, Brother: It's
just such a tragic
waste of life. You know, people
out just enjoying

27:14.833 --> 27:17.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their night were cut down for
nothing. It's
so sad to be here. I don't
understand how

27:18.036 --> 27:27.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone who is my own flesh and
blood could
be -- could think like this. I
just don't

27:27.279 --> 27:29.114 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
understand.

27:29.214 --> 27:32.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Canadian
Christianne Boudreau
wants deradicalization programs
to make the

27:32.818 --> 27:39.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most of the experiences of
families like these,
by using them as educators,
helpers, and guides.

27:39.625 --> 27:44.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's campaigning in memory of
her convert
son Damian killed in fighting
near Aleppo

27:44.229 --> 27:46.064 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Syria.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIANNE BOUDREAU, Mother of
Slain Foreign
Fighter: It could easily have
been my son

27:47.966 --> 27:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that had been walking into here.
It could
have been easily me having to
deal with what

27:53.005 --> 27:57.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he had done. It's one thing when
he's over
in Syria and we don't see it.

27:57.342 --> 28:03.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, here, we're faced with it.
And the parents
that lose a loved one in this
way, in a violent

28:03.415 --> 28:09.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way, not only do they lose their
son or their
daughter to something horrific,
but they also

28:09.555 --> 28:12.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carry the guilt of what their
child has done
to others. And it's a horrible,
horrible burden

28:12.157 --> 28:13.859 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to carry.

28:13.959 --> 28:18.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GEORGE SALINES, Father of
Victim: She was
28 years old. She had the
greatest smile in

28:18.263 --> 28:20.098 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world.

28:20.198 --> 28:25.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: George Salines
is talking
about his daughter Lola, one of
those murdered

28:25.170 --> 28:30.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the Bataclan. Like others at
the conference,
he wanted it to be a turning
point in the

28:30.108 --> 28:31.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
battle against extremism.

28:31.977 --> 28:39.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE SALINES: I very much
wanted to tell
my fellow citizens that, even
though I was

28:39.585 --> 28:51.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a victim, I had no hate. I just
wanted to
prevent those events from
happening again.

28:51.563 --> 28:55.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Not all of the
relatives
participating in the conference
wanted to

28:55.567 --> 28:57.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be identified.

28:57.636 --> 29:02.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the sense of solidarity
could be instrumental
in helping more parents to go
public. Michael

29:02.541 --> 29:05.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Evans made it clear that Islam
wasn't under
attack.

29:05.577 --> 29:09.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL EVANS: No, it hasn't
altered my view
of Islam at all, because my
brother wasn't

29:09.848 --> 29:16.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
practicing Islam. He was
practicing a sick
ideology that just hides behind
Islam.

29:16.688 --> 29:21.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: According to
the Pentagon,
the number of foreign fighters
entering in

29:21.793 --> 29:27.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraq and Syria has gone down by
90 percent
from 2,000 to just 200 a month.

29:27.399 --> 29:32.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this conference in Paris has
been told
that interest in joining the
Islamic State

29:32.971 --> 29:38.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remains enormous. The latest
research shows
that Google has registered
50,000 inquirees

29:39.011 --> 29:43.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a month for people wishing to
either joined
the so-called Islamic State or
to travel to

29:43.582 --> 29:45.384 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

29:45.484 --> 29:48.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the good thing is that all
of these people
leave an electronic trace, which
means that

29:49.087 --> 29:56.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the West has a chance to counter
the allure
and the propaganda of the
extremists and to

29:56.461 --> 29:59.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
win the battle for hearts and
minds.

29:59.431 --> 30:04.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This short film dramatizing the
regret of
a wounded Islamist fighter is an
attempt to

30:04.302 --> 30:20.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
match the high production values
of Islamic
State videos, and to win the war
of ideas.

30:20.819 --> 30:25.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Adam Deen now works for the
counterradicalization
Quilliam Foundation, which
produced the film,

30:25.424 --> 30:30.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but he once belonged to one of
Britain's most
militant Islamist groups. His
own intellectual

30:30.529 --> 30:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
curiosity saved him, but he
worries that not
enough is being done to convince
vulnerable

30:35.033 --> 30:37.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young Muslims to abandon the
path of extremism.

30:37.602 --> 30:41.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM DEEN, Quilliam Foundation:
At the end
of the day a very small minority
of individuals

30:42.040 --> 30:47.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will take up arms, will travel
to ISIS. If
we have a community that is --
has become

30:47.979 --> 30:55.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- has developed a religiosity,
and identifies
themselves with the Islamic
faith, the problem

30:55.220 --> 31:01.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that the default position for
some -- for
a young Muslim is Islamism and
this type of

31:01.493 --> 31:03.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
puritanical Islam.

31:03.462 --> 31:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the danger is that, if they
don't have
counternarratives, that they
will be susceptible.

31:08.033 --> 31:15.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a large portion of Muslims,
young Muslims
that are discovering Islam,
let's say, are

31:15.273 --> 31:19.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
susceptible to this type of --
this interpretation,
this pernicious reading.

31:19.945 --> 31:25.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Norwegian Bjorn
Ihler is
committed to opposing extremism
in all its

31:25.183 --> 31:29.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forms. He returned to the island
of Utoya,
where the right wing fanatic
Anders Breivik

31:29.988 --> 31:36.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gunned down 69 young people at a
political
summer camp. Breivik shot at
Ihler, but missed.

31:36.895 --> 31:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ihler believes similar methods
can neutralize
both the ultra-right and
Islamists.

31:41.066 --> 31:47.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BJORN IHLER, Utoya Survivor: All
forms of
extremism are very similar in
many ways. Extremism

31:47.105 --> 31:51.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thrives on the same kind of
factors regardless
of what ideology is titled. And
at the end

31:51.309 --> 31:57.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the day, their ideology very
quickly becomes
just an excuse essentially for
being violent.

31:57.149 --> 32:04.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The issues we need to address
are not necessarily
the theological issues, but
rather the ideological

32:04.823 --> 32:08.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
issue of violence and how
violence is being
used for political means.

32:08.860 --> 32:12.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Ihler shares
the view of
some experts that bombing the
so-called Islamic

32:12.998 --> 32:17.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
State will lead to more
radicalization. But
former British government
Minister Pauline

32:17.302 --> 32:19.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Neville-Jones disagrees.

32:19.137 --> 32:20.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAME PAULINE NEVILLE-JONES,
Former British
Government Minister: If you use
force, of

32:20.972 --> 32:25.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
course there will be those who
think that
this is a good reason for
joining the jihad.

32:25.410 --> 32:29.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one of the things that's
very important
things about Da'esh is actually
to destroy

32:29.414 --> 32:35.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its claim to constitute a state,
to be a caliphate,
because it's a major part of
their appeal:

32:35.987 --> 32:41.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We won some territory. We are a
real state
force.

32:41.760 --> 32:45.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have actually to destroy
that, because
it's a very -- it's very
insidious. It's very

32:45.697 --> 32:47.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
powerful.

32:47.666 --> 32:51.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The battle
against ISIS may
be primarily military, but
Karolina Dam believes

32:51.503 --> 32:54.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that mothers like her can play a
vital role.

32:54.139 --> 32:59.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAROLINA DAM, Mother: For me
here, I miss
him like crazy. I really do. I
just wish he

32:59.811 --> 33:07.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was here. I would have wanted to
talk more
with him about his religion and
what he wants

33:07.519 --> 33:13.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do, and how I can be a part,
a better part
in his life, because I -- we
were very close,

33:13.358 --> 33:18.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me and my boy, but obviously not
close enough.
Otherwise, he would have told me
about this

33:19.030 --> 33:20.899 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
double life.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Paris may be
peaceful once
again, but there remain fears
that, somewhere

33:24.469 --> 33:27.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
soon in Europe, there will be
another Bataclan.

33:27.205 --> 33:35.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Paris.

33:35.280 --> 33:48.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now an
underdog story for
the ages.

33:48.593 --> 33:53.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The English soccer team
Leicester City came
into this season as overwhelming
long shots,

33:53.598 --> 33:59.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but now, after defying all the
odds, exit
as their country's overall
football champions.

33:59.504 --> 34:09.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The anticipation built, and then
players from
Leicester City erupted in
cheers, celebrating

34:10.015 --> 34:14.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the team's first league title
ever after 132
years.

34:15.053 --> 34:19.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Foxes were a 5,000-to-1
shot, but they
won when second-place Tottenham
played to

34:19.925 --> 34:26.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a tie in its game on Monday.
With that, the
party spilled over into the
streets of Leicester.

34:26.264 --> 34:32.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I have been waiting for
this for 40 years
of supporting Leicester City.
It's unbelievable.

34:32.370 --> 34:34.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we have done it.

34:35.006 --> 34:38.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I mean, the whole world
knows who we
are now. That's important. Maybe
the Americans

34:39.077 --> 34:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can learn to pronounce Leicester
properly
as well.

34:42.013 --> 34:48.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's been an
improbable
run for a team that had barely
avoided demotion

34:48.253 --> 34:53.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the English Premier League,
the country's
top circuit. Winning the title
was an even

34:53.291 --> 34:59.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
longer shot than the U.S. hockey
team's miracle
win over the Soviet Union in the
1980 Olympics.

34:59.631 --> 35:04.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Much of the team's success has
been attributed
to its journeyman manager
Claudio Ranieri.

35:05.003 --> 35:07.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he said today the credit
belongs to his
players.

35:07.405 --> 35:10.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: How have you done it,
Claudio? What
has been the secret to
Leicester's success

35:10.542 --> 35:12.344 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this season?

35:12.444 --> 35:15.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CLAUDIO RANIERI, Manager,
Leicester City:
I don't know. I don't know the
secret. I think

35:15.313 --> 35:18.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the players, their heart, their
soul, how
they played.

35:18.950 --> 35:22.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Leicester has
two games
left to play, but those are now
a formality.

35:23.088 --> 35:27.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The title also guarantees the
team a spot
in next year's All-European
Champions League

35:27.792 --> 35:29.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tournament.

35:29.728 --> 35:33.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on this unlikely season
and the people
who made it happen, we are
joined from London

35:33.264 --> 35:37.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Andi Thomas, who covers
soccer for SB Nation,
an all-sports Web site.

35:38.036 --> 35:41.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, help us understand how big a
moment this
is for this city, this town.

35:41.873 --> 35:47.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDI THOMAS, SB Nation: It's an
absolutely
massive moment for Leicester the
town and

35:47.379 --> 35:49.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for Leicester the football club.

35:49.614 --> 35:55.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is something that absolutely
nobody involved
with the club or outside the
club would have

35:55.320 --> 35:59.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expected when the season kicked
off. They'd
have been hoping for, at best, a
solid mid-table

35:59.758 --> 36:03.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
finish to avoid a relegation
struggle, like
last season.

36:03.328 --> 36:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, this will have been as
surprising
as it will have been kind of
moving.

36:07.866 --> 36:11.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And did the
momentum build
up throughout the rest of the
U.K. as this

36:12.037 --> 36:14.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
potential grew closer?

36:14.506 --> 36:20.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDI THOMAS: I think so. I think
there's a
lot to like about Leicester as a
-- from a

36:20.612 --> 36:22.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
neutral perspective.

36:23.081 --> 36:27.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's the unlikeliness of the
story. There's
the fact that Claudio Ranieri is
a very popular

36:27.552 --> 36:32.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
personality and manager in
general. And some
of the players, not all of them,
but some

36:32.624 --> 36:36.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the players are quite, quite
easy to warm
to in some ways.

36:36.161 --> 36:39.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, I think there's been a
lot of -- a
lot of outside interest, plus
just the novelty

36:39.831 --> 36:45.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of seeing someone outside the
normal clubs
in with a shot of winning the
title is something

36:46.004 --> 36:47.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to celebrate.

36:47.939 --> 36:50.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How crucial
was the manager
in all this? This is a person
who has been

36:50.675 --> 36:52.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at big league -- or big clubs
before.

36:53.078 --> 36:54.946 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ANDI THOMAS: Yes.

36:55.046 --> 37:00.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he seems to have been
exceptionally important
for the club. He came in -- he
was very much

37:01.052 --> 37:05.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a surprise appointment. There
was a lot of
skepticism about whether he --
whether he

37:05.857 --> 37:11.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the right person to struggle
against relegation,
because that's what they're
expecting to do.

37:11.162 --> 37:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, instead, yes, he seems to
have -- because
he inherited a squad that had
just survived

37:15.467 --> 37:19.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relegation last season, and he
seemed to have
carried on momentum from that
improbable escape

37:19.904 --> 37:23.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and just made everyone -- united
them as a
team and as a unit.

37:23.541 --> 37:29.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And this isn't
a club that
has big superstars that are paid
lavish sums

37:29.280 --> 37:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of money. This is a pretty
average group of
guys.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.786 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ANDI THOMAS: Yes.

37:34.886 --> 37:40.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, by the standards of
anyone outside
football, they're extremely
well-paid professionals,

37:40.291 --> 37:43.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but by the standards of the
league they're
competing in, they are very much
from the

37:43.695 --> 37:46.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind of the bottom rung in terms
of the wages.

37:46.898 --> 37:51.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Premier League has never
really been won
by anybody outside kind of the
top-wage-paying

37:51.603 --> 37:55.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clubs. So, that -- again, that's
just another
factor that makes is a surprise
victory.

37:55.173 --> 37:59.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, you know,
your oddsmakers
are not wrong that often. When
somebody decides

37:59.777 --> 38:03.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to place 5,000-to-1 odds against
the team
doing this, what happened? How
did they get

38:04.015 --> 38:05.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the math so wrong?

38:05.884 --> 38:10.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDI THOMAS: Well, I mean, the
5,000-to-1
odds, that's longer odds than
the Loch Ness

38:10.622 --> 38:13.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monster existing. That's longer
odds than
Elvis being found alive.

38:13.358 --> 38:15.160 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:15.260 --> 38:17.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDI THOMAS: It was very much a
novelty bet,
kind of, if you want to throw 10
pounds away

38:17.695 --> 38:19.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a symbolic way, that's how
you do it.

38:19.797 --> 38:24.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that -- the fact
that it became
a live bet and a possibility is
unprecedented.

38:24.269 --> 38:29.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there a
class dimension
to this? I mean, are these -- is
this a working-class

38:30.008 --> 38:35.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town, I mean, from the folks we
heard from,
vs. some of the elite clubs and
the fan base

38:35.246 --> 38:36.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that they draw?

38:37.081 --> 38:41.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDI THOMAS: Certainly, I think
it's fair
to say that, in the big clubs in
the Premier

38:41.386 --> 38:44.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
League, they market themselves
very aggressively
as global clubs.

38:44.289 --> 38:47.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Manchester United has sponsors
from all around
the world. Manchester City have
tie-ins New

38:48.026 --> 38:53.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York and Melbourne, where, in
Leicester, it
very much feels like a triumph
of the club

38:53.731 --> 38:57.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the town, in a slightly
old-fashioned
way, kind of the way English
football used

38:57.235 --> 39:00.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to be, before it became
stretched at the top
by the money of the Premier
League.

39:01.005 --> 39:05.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, there definitely is the
element that
this quite -- it's quite
refreshing, refreshingly

39:05.310 --> 39:07.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
old-fashioned aspect to it.

39:07.212 --> 39:09.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, any
of these players
going to go on and transfer to
other clubs

39:09.581 --> 39:11.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now that their stock has
improved?

39:11.482 --> 39:15.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDI THOMAS: You would expect
big clubs to
be chasing them, certainly.

39:15.520 --> 39:20.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Riyad Mahrez and N'Golo
Kante will
both -- there will be big bids
for them over

39:20.892 --> 39:24.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the summer. Whether they go or
not, I don't
know. Leicester, the chance to
go into the

39:24.329 --> 39:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Champions League, this club is
-- the players
are clearly quite keen on one
another and

39:28.800 --> 39:30.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
work very well as a team.

39:30.668 --> 39:32.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, whether they will --
hopefully, they will
-- you know, they will give it
at least one

39:32.704 --> 39:35.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shot in the Champions League
before they accept
the big offers and move on.

39:35.773 --> 39:43.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Andi Thomas from
SB Nation, thanks so much for
joining us.

39:43.514 --> 39:50.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDI THOMAS: Thank you.

39:50.955 --> 39:57.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the latest
addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

39:57.161 --> 40:03.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a very personal look at the
changing
role of grandparents and comes
from longtime

40:03.234 --> 40:08.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"60 Minutes" correspondent
Lesley Stahl, who
has full-heartedly embraced the
job in her

40:08.606 --> 40:14.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new book, "Becoming Grandma: The
Joys and
Science of the New
Grandparenting."

40:14.212 --> 40:16.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I talked with her recently.

40:16.547 --> 40:18.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, Lesley Stahl.
LESLEY STAHL, Author, "Becoming
Grandma: The
Joys and Science of the New
Grandparenting":

40:18.616 --> 40:20.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you, Judy Woodruff.

40:20.418 --> 40:24.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we have known
each other
going back to being White House
reporters

40:24.222 --> 40:25.156 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
under...

40:25.256 --> 40:25.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: The beginning of
time, Judy.

40:25.690 --> 40:27.191 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:27.292 --> 40:29.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The beginning of
time, President
Carter, President Reagan.

40:29.127 --> 40:32.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You are showing a side of
yourself that people
don't see on "60 Minutes" here.

40:33.064 --> 40:36.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: Well, that's true.
I don't go
around saying, I'm a
grandmother, although

40:36.668 --> 40:39.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I feel it. I feel it. I want to
tell everybody.

40:39.203 --> 40:44.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I will be honest
right up front,
I have serious grandmother envy.
I'm dying

40:44.575 --> 40:48.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have grandchildren. Is it
really as great
as you make it out to be?

40:48.846 --> 40:51.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: It's twice as
great as I make
it out to be.

40:52.016 --> 40:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's -- it's an extraordinary
new chapter
that opens up suddenly, and no
matter how

40:57.789 --> 41:02.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many people tell you it's the
best thing that
could ever happen to you, it's
-- you don't

41:02.794 --> 41:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- you don't understand what
they mean until
it happens to you, because it's
so full, body-full.

41:08.433 --> 41:17.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It just takes you over in such
an elation
way, elated way, that you just
can't believe

41:17.809 --> 41:21.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this new kind of emotion that
you have never
felt before.

41:21.446 --> 41:24.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's
something that you
decided to write about. I mean,
you could

41:24.215 --> 41:27.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
write about your career, about
journalism,
but it's this.

41:28.019 --> 41:30.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: This felt right.

41:30.254 --> 41:35.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reason I decided to do
it is because
I didn't understand that
emotion. What is

41:35.626 --> 41:43.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that? Do all grandmothers have
it? Turns out
they do. And what is it and how
do you explain

41:43.801 --> 41:45.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it? Where does it come from?

41:45.770 --> 41:51.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And once I started looking at
that, then all
these different avenues opened
up to me. There's

41:51.776 --> 41:57.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a whole chapter on
step-grandmothers. And
I discovered that there are
granny nannies.

41:57.615 --> 42:04.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By that, I mean women taking
care of their
grandchildren on Tuesdays and
Thursdays, Saturdays,

42:04.422 --> 42:07.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helping their kids out. I just
-- the whole
world opened up.

42:07.191 --> 42:13.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So much of the
premise of this,
Lesley, is that this is a new
era of grandparenting.

42:13.564 --> 42:19.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our -- grandmothers today are
not what our
grandparents were. And you write
about, you

42:19.270 --> 42:22.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, a lot of us have had
careers. You write
about our hair color is
different.

42:22.974 --> 42:23.775 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:23.875 --> 42:24.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: We don't play
canasta.

42:24.642 --> 42:25.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:25.376 --> 42:27.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: We go to work.

42:27.412 --> 42:34.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, baby boomers are kind
of the separate
species of human being. And one
of the things

42:34.452 --> 42:41.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about baby boomers is that we
want to be young.
Let's face it. And we're young
grandparents,

42:41.526 --> 42:46.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because we're baby boomers. And,
of course,
we determine everything as we go
through our

42:46.464 --> 42:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
history. We're such a big bulge.

42:48.833 --> 42:55.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're young. We're energetic.
We're spending
infinitely more money on our
grandchildren

42:55.406 --> 43:01.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than grandparents of old. I saw
a statistic
the other day. It's not even in
the book.

43:01.446 --> 43:05.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Grandparents today spend seven
times more
on their grandchildren than they
did just

43:05.850 --> 43:07.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
10 years ago. So...

43:07.718 --> 43:13.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Part of your
title is "The
Joys and Science of the New
Grandparenting."

43:14.091 --> 43:15.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LESLEY STAHL: Oh, yes.

43:15.426 --> 43:16.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that wishful
thinking, or
is that real?

43:16.727 --> 43:18.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LESLEY STAHL: No, no.

43:18.830 --> 43:25.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What was that feeling I had?
Well, I was stunned
to discover and delighted that
there are biological

43:25.870 --> 43:32.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
changes that go along when
you're a mother,
but grandmothers have something
similar. And

43:32.610 --> 43:38.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's real. What you're feeling
is a change
in your body. You're being
rewired to connect

43:38.149 --> 43:39.417 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to this baby.

43:39.517 --> 43:41.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's not just
because they're
cute and cuddly?

43:41.452 --> 43:45.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: Well, it's also
because they're
cute and cuddly, but they're
yours. There's

43:45.323 --> 43:47.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a real binding that goes on
there.

43:47.458 --> 43:51.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You were just
telling me that
the cover picture, it looks like
you're sitting

43:51.929 --> 43:54.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there and you're reading to your
granddaughters.

43:54.298 --> 43:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: Uh-huh. Looks that
way, right?

43:55.666 --> 43:57.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:57.535 --> 44:00.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: So, they wouldn't
cooperate.
They wouldn't both sit quietly
together at

44:00.838 --> 44:04.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same time. So, we put an
iPhone -- we
taped it to the middle of the
book, and they're

44:05.009 --> 44:05.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
watching "Frozen."

44:05.810 --> 44:07.545 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:07.645 --> 44:09.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: It's the only --
and I think
that's the only picture we got
where they

44:09.814 --> 44:11.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were both cooperating.

44:11.782 --> 44:15.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You do focus so
much in the
book, Lesley, on the positives
of grandparenting.

44:15.887 --> 44:17.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you have had a very positive
experience.

44:17.822 --> 44:19.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LESLEY STAHL: I have.

44:19.857 --> 44:21.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But we all know
there are grandparents
out there who, for whatever
reason, aren't

44:21.959 --> 44:27.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being allowed to see their
grandchildren or
who are forced to completely
raise their grandchildren

44:27.431 --> 44:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
under difficult circumstances.

44:29.534 --> 44:30.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a mixed picture, isn't it?

44:31.002 --> 44:34.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: Well, I write
about that and
discovered it, actually.

44:34.105 --> 44:39.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been asked, what's the
thing that most
surprised me? And that
grandparents are denied

44:39.477 --> 44:45.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
access to their own
grandchildren, which is
fairly prevalent, really
surprised me and

44:45.182 --> 44:52.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shocked me. just it's -- I get
-- I actually
get pained even telling you
about this, because

44:52.256 --> 44:57.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the grandmothers who admitted it
to me -- and
a lot of them are ashamed about
this -- told

44:58.095 --> 45:00.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me with tears streaming down
their faces.

45:00.498 --> 45:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a horrible thing.

45:02.333 --> 45:05.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This book,
Lesley, is -- it's
a very personal story. I mean,
it is very

45:05.903 --> 45:11.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much about your own family, your
grandchildren,
your relationship with your
mother, what kind

45:11.542 --> 45:13.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a grandmother she was.

45:13.544 --> 45:18.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You also write about your
husband, Aaron Latham,
and you openly say is dealing
with Parkinson's.

45:18.516 --> 45:21.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there's a lot you lay bare
here, isn't
there?

45:21.819 --> 45:25.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: Well, one of the
things that
-- one of the reasons I wrote
about my own

45:25.456 --> 45:31.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relationship with my mother,
which was a little
difficult, unlike mine with my
daughter, which

45:31.329 --> 45:35.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is wonderful -- but my mother
and I clashed
a lot.

45:35.333 --> 45:41.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But she was a completely
besotted grandmother.
I would look at her and say, who
is that?

45:42.039 --> 45:48.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I heard that over and over
from women
my age. "My mother is so
different with my

45:48.112 --> 45:54.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children." And that's part of
being a grandmother.
You go from being who you are to
being a mush

45:54.151 --> 45:56.153 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ball, like that.

45:56.253 --> 46:01.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people say, who is he? We
don't know ourselves.
We get so mushy. And this is
part of the reason

46:01.993 --> 46:05.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wanted to write it. We -- they
just soften
us completely.

46:05.663 --> 46:10.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You can be -- I
guess part
of the message is you can be a
different kind

46:10.501 --> 46:13.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of grandmother from the kind of
mother you
were?

46:13.270 --> 46:16.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: Totally different.
And it's
out of your control, even if you
didn't want

46:16.507 --> 46:16.941 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to be.

46:17.041 --> 46:18.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:18.943 --> 46:22.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was struck at
the end, you
urge grandparents to jump in if
they're not

46:22.580 --> 46:28.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
already involved in the lives of
their grandchildren,
and urge parents, likewise, to
let their own

46:29.053 --> 46:30.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
parents be involved.

46:30.888 --> 46:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: Well, children
today, young
parents need our help, because
they're not

46:37.128 --> 46:40.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
making much money. They're both
working. They're
suffering economically.

46:40.531 --> 46:47.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they need our help. Those
babies need
their grandparents. We are very
important

46:47.338 --> 46:53.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to their development. And we
need them, because
they make us healthier. And so
it's a win-win-win.

46:53.344 --> 46:54.979 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why not?

46:55.079 --> 46:58.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, there are
some great
stories here, Lesley Stahl, "The
Joys and

46:58.683 --> 47:01.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Science of the New
Grandparenting."

47:01.886 --> 47:03.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

47:04.055 --> 47:12.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESLEY STAHL: Thank you, Judy.

47:12.163 --> 47:20.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, the
latest in our
occasional series on poets and
what inspires

47:20.905 --> 47:22.673 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

47:22.773 --> 47:26.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, Ocean Vuong, recently
chosen for
the prestigious Whiting Award.
His new book,

47:26.911 --> 47:32.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Night Sky With Exit Wounds,"
explores the
legacy of the Vietnam War and
the power of

47:32.383 --> 47:34.085 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
oral history.

47:34.185 --> 47:35.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OCEAN VUONG, Author, "Night Sky
With Exit
Wounds": Sometimes, people say,
well, how

47:36.053 --> 47:39.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does it feel to be the first
poet? And I say,
I'm not the first poet. I come
from a long

47:39.523 --> 47:41.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
line of poets. They were not
documented.

47:41.826 --> 47:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's interesting how poems
are carried
from one culture to another. In
Vietnam, there's

47:49.233 --> 47:56.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much dependency on the body. One
needs to
have the body -- in a way, the
body is a book,

47:56.841 --> 48:02.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that one needs the body to
remember the poem,
sing the poems and pass them
along.

48:02.146 --> 48:07.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My grandmother, she was a rice
farmer. In
a sense, all Vietnamese farmers
were poets,

48:07.685 --> 48:12.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because while they were working,
they sang,
and the songs helped the rhythm
of the harvesting

48:12.490 --> 48:14.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the seeding of the fields.

48:14.592 --> 48:20.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, also, the daily news of
life, and ultimately,
when the war came, where the
bombs were falling,

48:20.698 --> 48:25.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information started to come into
the rhyming
couplets in the poems and the
songs. And this

48:25.102 --> 48:26.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is how information was passed.

48:26.904 --> 48:32.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the poem "Aubade with Burning
City," I
took Irving Berlin's "White
Christmas," the

48:32.309 --> 48:37.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lyrics, and wove it through a
scene about
the collapse of Saigon.

48:37.314 --> 48:42.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When my grandmother would tell
me about the
collapse of Saigon, she would
say, "Saigon,

48:42.319 --> 48:48.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this sounds very strange, but I
remember it
fell during the snow song." And
as a child

48:48.225 --> 48:52.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
listening to that, it was so
surreal to me.
That was the song that was used
as a coded

48:52.763 --> 48:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
message for American personnel
to evacuate.

48:55.566 --> 49:01.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you can imagine the city
falling apart
during this beautiful,
celebratory song.

49:01.539 --> 49:09.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"I'm dreaming of a white
Christmas. Outside,
a soldier spits out his
cigarette as footsteps

49:09.313 --> 49:16.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fill the square like stones
fallen from the
sky. May all your Christmases be
white as

49:17.087 --> 49:24.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the traffic guard unstraps his
holster, his
fingers running the hem of her
white dress.

49:24.795 --> 49:32.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A single candle. Their shadows,
two wicks.
A military truck speeds through
the intersection,

49:33.070 --> 49:35.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
children shrieking inside.

49:35.539 --> 49:44.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"A bicycle hurled through a
store window.
When the dust rises, a black dog
lies panting

49:44.448 --> 49:51.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the road, its hind legs
crushed into the
shine of a white Christmas."

49:51.589 --> 49:56.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When my grandmother passed away
in 2008, and
I wanted to preserve that memory
landscape

49:56.327 --> 50:01.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on paper, I was faced with where
to break
her lines. And, of course, the
oral tradition

50:02.099 --> 50:10.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't offer a page. In a way,
I was collaborating
with this -- with my grandmother
beyond her

50:10.574 --> 50:12.309 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

50:12.409 --> 50:16.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we immigrated to America,
all she had
were these songs and poems. My
mother was

50:16.981 --> 50:24.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also illiterate. She -- her
father is an American
veteran. When we arrived in
America, she went

50:24.321 --> 50:31.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right into the nail salon to
work, manual
labor. And she made it her goal
to teach me

50:32.029 --> 50:33.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
how to write.

50:33.964 --> 50:39.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the poem "The Gift" is very
interesting
because she only knew A, B, C,
three letters.

50:39.570 --> 50:41.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she would have me write
those letters
anyway.

50:41.672 --> 50:55.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"A, B, C, A, B, C, A -- the
pencil snaps,
the B bursting its belly as dark
dust blows

50:55.119 --> 51:03.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through a blue-lined sky. Don't
move, she
says, as she picks a wing bone
of graphite

51:03.661 --> 51:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the yellow carcass, slides
it back between
my fingers."

51:09.133 --> 51:17.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We look at this wall, the
interesting and
tense relationship I have with
the war is

51:17.107 --> 51:21.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, without it, I wouldn't be
here. And
if I were to turn around and
walk down this

51:21.912 --> 51:29.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
memorial and find my
grandfather's name, I
wouldn't be alive if his name
was there.

51:29.420 --> 51:34.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is -- the facts and the
truths of what
it means to be an American, is
to be involved

51:34.692 --> 51:46.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this, and that perhaps --
it's seemingly
so strange that a war in Vietnam
and an American

51:46.837 --> 51:54.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
soldier would bring cause to a
poet like me,
a Vietnamese-American poet.

51:54.778 --> 52:02.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"When they ask you where you're
from, tell
them your name was fleshed from
the toothless

52:02.286 --> 52:13.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mouth of a war woman, that you
were not born,
but crawled headfirst into the
hunger of dogs.

52:13.998 --> 52:21.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My son, tell them the body is a
blade that
sharpens by cutting."

52:21.271 --> 52:25.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of these people coming
together out of
violence, trying to do their
best to make

52:26.043 --> 52:28.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meaning out of their existence.
