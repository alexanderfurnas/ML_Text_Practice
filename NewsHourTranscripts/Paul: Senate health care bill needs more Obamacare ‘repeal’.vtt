JUDY WOODRUFF: And back to
the battle over health care.

00:03.533 --> 00:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke a short time ago with
Republican Senator Rand Paul of
Kentucky, one of the key votes

00:09.533 --> 00:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that could determine the
future of the GOP effort to
repeal and replace Obamacare.

00:14.433 --> 00:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Paul, thank you
very much for joining us.

00:16.400 --> 00:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there any doubt in your
mind, if the vote had gone ahead
today or tomorrow, that the

00:20.366 --> 00:21.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bill would have failed?

00:21.366 --> 00:23.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:23.333 --> 00:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAND PAUL (R), Kentucky:
Yes, I don't think there were
enough votes, but I think there

00:24.800 --> 00:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also just hasn't been enough
time to have a full discussion.

00:27.433 --> 00:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We just got the bill last week.

00:29.033 --> 00:31.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We just got the CBO
score on Monday.

00:31.100 --> 00:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there needs to be a little
bit more time to absorb this,
then also to discuss, what

00:37.933 --> 00:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are the changes that the
leadership might be open to
in order to get it to pass?

00:39.933 --> 00:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking
of that, you met with President
Trump at the White House

00:43.466 --> 00:45.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
earlier today.

00:45.466 --> 00:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You tweeted after your meeting,
you said: "@realDonaldTrump
is open to making the bill

00:50.933 --> 00:51.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
better.

00:51.933 --> 00:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is the Senate leadership?"

00:54.766 --> 00:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My question to you is -- and
the president is meeting now
with the rest of the Republicans

00:58.600 --> 01:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Senate -- what
changes does the president
want to see in this bill?

01:02.833 --> 01:04.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:04.533 --> 01:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RAND PAUL: Well, I don't
think it's so much him
lobbing us for changes.

01:06.933 --> 01:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's us asking him for help
in getting the changes done.

01:10.633 --> 01:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think he has the bully pulpit.

01:12.566 --> 01:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has a great deal of influence
with the Republican Party
on both the House and the

01:16.366 --> 01:18.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Senate side.

01:18.400 --> 01:22.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the bill right now
to the conservative point of
view doesn't have enough repeal.

01:24.333 --> 01:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, it looks like we're
keeping a lot of Obamacare.

01:26.266 --> 01:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even the architect of Obamacare,
Jonathan Gruber, said, hey,
hey, guys, don't worry,

01:31.100 --> 01:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we're actually
keeping Obamacare.

01:32.733 --> 01:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we actually think that
there needs to be more repeal.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's the message
I took to him.

01:37.833 --> 01:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I also took a specific list
that we're sending to Senate
leadership, and we're saying,

01:42.166 --> 01:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if you address these items,
there's a possibility we could
vote for this bill, but it's got

01:46.766 --> 01:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to look more like repeal and
less like we're keeping it.

01:49.533 --> 01:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as you
know, what the president has
said about the House version

01:53.633 --> 01:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the bill, which many people
said was tougher than the Senate
bill, he said it was mean,

01:59.800 --> 02:02.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and he wanted a bill
with more heart.

02:02.033 --> 02:04.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So where are we on this?

02:04.466 --> 02:06.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:06.533 --> 02:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAND PAUL: You know, I think
there are various ways you can
characterize both Republican

02:08.333 --> 02:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Democrat proposals.

02:10.366 --> 02:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama, I think,
wanted what was best for the
country, but I think it didn't

02:15.733 --> 02:18.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
work well.

02:18.266 --> 02:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we have the
death spiral, and I think
particularly premiums
in the individual market

02:20.133 --> 02:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are going through the roof.

02:22.133 --> 02:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think Republicans want what's
best for the country also,
but I think they're not fixing

02:25.500 --> 02:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the death spiral of Obamacare.

02:27.033 --> 02:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're going to subsidize it
with a lot of taxpayer money.

02:30.200 --> 02:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, characterizing something as
mean or generous I think goes
to people's motives, and I think

02:36.666 --> 02:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it is sort of why we have
such an angry country now.

02:37.900 --> 02:39.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We think that people
have ill motives.

02:39.633 --> 02:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think Republicans want
people to have health insurance.

02:43.066 --> 02:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We want people to be healthy.

02:44.266 --> 02:46.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So do Democrats.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just believe in a
different type of economic
system or different
types of limitations of

02:49.966 --> 02:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government or more expansive
government and how we can do it.

02:53.300 --> 02:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the
things, Senator Paul, you have
talked about wanting to do

02:56.233 --> 03:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away with is the Obamacare
tax on individuals making
over $250,000 a year.

03:03.366 --> 03:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That would be money -- that's
the money that's been used to
pay for many of the subsidies

03:08.266 --> 03:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for people with lower income.

03:09.466 --> 03:10.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:10.466 --> 03:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RAND PAUL: Right.

03:12.466 --> 03:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's a transfer,
taking money away from those
who have more to give it to

03:15.900 --> 03:18.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people who have less,
but that troubles you?

03:18.566 --> 03:20.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAND PAUL: No, we already
do quite a bit of that,
and it's call Medicaid.

03:22.966 --> 03:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem or the
fundamental flaw of
Obamacare was that they put
regulations on the insurance,

03:29.266 --> 03:32.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
about 12 regulations,
which increased the
cost of the insurance.

03:32.133 --> 03:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so President Obama wanted
to help poor, working-class
people, but he actually hurts

03:36.233 --> 03:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them by making the insurance
too expensive to want to buy.

03:39.333 --> 03:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had someone at the house
just recently was doing some
work, and he said: "Oh, my son

03:43.533 --> 03:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't have insurance,
he's paying the penalty
because it's too expensive."

03:47.666 --> 03:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, President Obama said,
oh, we want to make insurance
perfect for people, but he added

03:52.233 --> 03:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all these regulatory mandates,
made it too expensive.

03:55.666 --> 03:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Young, healthy people didn't
buy it, and the people remaining
in the insurance pool were

03:58.966 --> 04:00.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sicker and sicker.

04:00.700 --> 04:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the adverse selection and
the death spiral of Obamacare.

04:04.733 --> 04:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so really we do need
to discuss the intricacies
of what worked and what
didn't work in Obamacare.

04:11.733 --> 04:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the better way to
do this is to let individuals
have the freedom to choose

04:14.100 --> 04:16.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what kind of insurance
is best for them.

04:16.333 --> 04:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The government doesn't
always know best.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe the individual should
be allowed to choose.

04:20.366 --> 04:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, I
hear you, and I have read of
some of the other comments you

04:23.766 --> 04:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have made lately.

04:25.033 --> 04:27.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have some very
strong views on this.

04:27.133 --> 04:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you just said, you would
like to do away with this tax
on individuals earning -- high

04:32.866 --> 04:34.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
earners.

04:34.400 --> 04:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have talked about doing away
with the mandates in Obamacare.

04:37.366 --> 04:39.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You talk about health
savings accounts.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But other members of the Senate,
including other Republicans,
have very different ideas.

04:42.766 --> 04:46.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They are worried about
these Medicaid cuts
in this legislation.

04:46.366 --> 04:47.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:47.366 --> 04:48.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RAND PAUL: Right.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where
is the common ground?

04:49.366 --> 04:51.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:51.033 --> 04:53.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RAND PAUL: Well, that's
what we're going to
see, if we can find it.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the things that horrifies
me is that we would be giving
taxpayer money to very,

04:56.066 --> 04:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very wealthy corporations.

04:57.966 --> 05:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The insurance companies make
about $15 billion a year.

05:00.766 --> 05:03.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have doubled their
profit margin under Obamacare.

05:03.966 --> 05:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so now we're going to take
a lot of this and call it a
stabilization fund, but really

05:08.233 --> 05:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's a bailout of
insurance companies.

05:10.633 --> 05:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I just think that's wrong.

05:13.033 --> 05:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just can't see why
ordinary, average taxpayers
would be giving money
to very, very wealthy

05:17.333 --> 05:19.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
corporations.

05:19.400 --> 05:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An analogous situation would
be this: We all complain
that new cars cost too much.

05:23.466 --> 05:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why don't we have a new car
stabilization fund and give
$130 billion to car companies?

05:29.200 --> 05:29.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

05:29.733 --> 05:31.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAND PAUL: We could do that
in any industry, but it's
not really good economics.

05:33.866 --> 05:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What it is, is, you're simply
transferring money from the
ordinary, average taxpayers

05:38.466 --> 05:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to very wealthy corporations.

05:40.566 --> 05:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Senator,
my understanding is that plan
was put in there to take care

05:45.800 --> 05:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of some of those people at
the lower income level because
of these changes in Medicaid.

05:51.166 --> 05:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I still don't see where the
middle ground is between you,
other Republicans, and certainly

05:54.900 --> 05:55.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Democrats.

05:55.900 --> 05:58.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:58.466 --> 06:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAND PAUL: Actually, the
money in the stabilization
fund, $130 billion which
I call an insurance

06:00.833 --> 06:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bailout, is put in to try to
cure the adverse selection that
Obamacare created by making

06:06.800 --> 06:08.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
insurance too expensive.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Healthy people didn't buy it.

06:10.866 --> 06:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They tried to fix this by
forcing young people to buy it
through an individual mandate.

06:14.266 --> 06:16.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Even that didn't work.

06:16.133 --> 06:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the way the Republicans
fix it is they don't
actually fix it.

06:18.933 --> 06:21.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They subsidize it.

06:21.500 --> 06:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we have to fix what
went wrong with Obamacare,
not just recapitulate
something that's broken.

06:27.933 --> 06:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What you're
saying makes it sound like
you're still uncertain this is

06:29.300 --> 06:30.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to pass.

06:30.300 --> 06:31.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:31.300 --> 06:33.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
RAND PAUL: Yes.

I'm uncertain whether it's
going to be enough of a
repeal bill for conservatives.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we need to adhere
to our promise.

06:38.233 --> 06:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We promised people
we'd repeal it.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We talked about all the
problems of Obamacare.

06:42.033 --> 06:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We shouldn't leave half
of it in place and expect
things to be better.
