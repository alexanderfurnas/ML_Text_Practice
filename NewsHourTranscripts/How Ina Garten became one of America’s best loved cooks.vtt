HARI SREENIVASAN: Now we visit
one of the most successful,
prolific women in America,

00:04.400 --> 00:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the creative force behind
the Barefoot Contessa
cookbooks and TV shows.

00:08.933 --> 00:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William Brangham recently
went to see Ina Garten at her
home on Long Island, New York,

00:12.833 --> 00:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and has this look at
her life and career.

00:14.933 --> 00:16.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Can
I have another bite?

00:16.466 --> 00:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INA GARTEN, Chef: You can
have as much as you like.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

00:19.000 --> 00:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
This is the best job.

00:19.800 --> 00:20.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

00:20.800 --> 00:22.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: Isn't it?

00:22.033 --> 00:22.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is what I get
to do for a living.

00:22.833 --> 00:24.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Isn't it unbelievable?

00:24.066 --> 00:25.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
It's fantastic.

00:25.800 --> 00:29.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ina Garten is one of the
most famous and beloved
cooks in America today.

00:29.066 --> 00:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Better known as the
Barefoot Contessa, she
sits atop a culinary empire
built on her bestselling

00:35.666 --> 00:39.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
cookbooks, with millions
of copies sold, a
string of hit TV shows.

00:39.033 --> 00:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INA GARTEN: Just because it's
a weeknight dinner doesn't
mean it has to be boring.

00:41.900 --> 00:44.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And a
legion of devoted fans.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: This is my
little secret garden.

00:46.566 --> 00:49.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We
visited Garten at her
home and headquarters
in East Hampton, New

00:49.866 --> 00:52.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
York.

00:52.066 --> 00:55.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We talked in the huge
barn she had built next
to her House that's now
her office, test kitchen

00:56.766 --> 00:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and TV studio, all in one.

00:58.933 --> 01:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INA GARTEN: This is where
the show is shot, and this
is where we test recipes.

01:01.066 --> 01:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And every morning, I walk
across the lawn and I meet the
two people, Barbara and Lidey,

01:04.766 --> 01:06.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who work with me.

01:06.266 --> 01:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we just go, OK, what
are we going to do today?

01:07.733 --> 01:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's
the extent of your commute?

01:08.666 --> 01:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INA GARTEN: That's my commute.

01:09.333 --> 01:10.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:10.833 --> 01:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INA GARTEN: It's like 100 yards,
I think, maybe less, maybe 50.

01:12.066 --> 01:13.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Pretty amazing.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INA GARTEN: It's pretty amazing.

01:14.966 --> 01:16.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I usually just put it
right in the middle.

01:16.566 --> 01:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Garten's
career began 40 years ago.

01:18.866 --> 01:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, at first, she gave no
hint as to how she'd evolve.

01:23.666 --> 01:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the 1970s, newly married to
husband Jeffrey, Garten was a
budget analyst in Washington,

01:27.966 --> 01:29.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
D.C.,

01:29.900 --> 01:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INA GARTEN: I was
working at OMB, Office of
Management and Budget.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For
the federal government?

01:33.300 --> 01:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: Yes,
for Ford and Carter.

01:35.433 --> 01:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I worked on
nuclear energy policy.

01:37.933 --> 01:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How's that for precedent
for the food business?

01:39.733 --> 01:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It
makes no sense whatsoever.

01:40.933 --> 01:41.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:41.933 --> 01:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INA GARTEN: I ran from it.

01:43.966 --> 01:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And by the late '70s, I thought,
I have been working here for
four years, and nothing has

01:47.433 --> 01:48.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happened.

01:48.966 --> 01:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I just didn't feel like
I had any impact on anything.

01:51.666 --> 01:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I hit 30, and I thought, I
want to do what I want to do.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I thought, I want to
be in the food business.

01:57.300 --> 02:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One day, she
saw an ad for a specialty food
store for sale in the Hamptons,

02:01.400 --> 02:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the exclusive beach
destination for New Yorkers.

02:03.900 --> 02:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INA GARTEN: I went home and
I told Jeffrey about it, and
he said, pick something you

02:07.800 --> 02:09.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
love to do.

02:09.333 --> 02:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you love doing it, you
will be really good at it.

02:11.333 --> 02:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I made her a very low
offer, the woman who was selling
it, thinking, well, we will

02:15.700 --> 02:16.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come back.

02:16.700 --> 02:17.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will negotiate.

02:17.700 --> 02:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We drove back to Washington.

02:19.166 --> 02:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was in my office the next
day and the phone rang.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And she said, thank
you very much.

02:22.766 --> 02:24.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I accept your offer.

02:24.266 --> 02:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I just remember going,
oh (EXPLETIVE DELETED).

02:24.933 --> 02:26.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:26.400 --> 02:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What
have I gotten myself into?

02:27.833 --> 02:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INA GARTEN: What have I done?

02:31.566 --> 02:32.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
And that was it?

02:32.833 --> 02:34.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: That was it.

02:34.900 --> 02:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two months later, I was behind
the counter of a specialty
foods store, trying to figure

02:38.333 --> 02:40.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it out.

02:40.266 --> 02:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
store she bought was called
the Barefoot Contessa.

02:41.866 --> 02:44.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was the nickname
of the prior owner.

02:44.366 --> 02:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was 1978, and this
was Garten's very first
job in the food industry.

02:50.466 --> 02:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, had you been a cook before?

02:52.233 --> 02:53.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
INA GARTEN: No.

02:53.333 --> 02:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Not at all?

02:54.566 --> 02:55.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: I'd never
worked in a store.

02:55.533 --> 02:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I never worked in a restaurant.

02:57.233 --> 02:59.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, I cooked at
home, but that's not
really the same thing.

02:59.533 --> 03:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I taught myself how to cook
when I worked in Washington
using Julia Child's cookbooks.

03:04.266 --> 03:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And you have
had no training beyond that?

03:06.633 --> 03:07.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
INA GARTEN: No.

03:07.633 --> 03:08.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

03:08.866 --> 03:09.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
That's amazing.

03:09.666 --> 03:11.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: Thank you.

03:11.766 --> 03:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The store was
a smash, and later moved to a
bigger location in East Hampton.

03:14.800 --> 03:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
After 18 years, she sold
the store and tried her
hand at a new venture.

03:19.333 --> 03:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 1999, the Barefoot Contessa
cookbook was published, and it
quickly became a bestseller.

03:25.766 --> 03:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nine additional books have
followed, each a bestseller.

03:28.533 --> 03:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All contain her trademark
simple and accessible recipes.

03:31.833 --> 03:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INA GARTEN: I think that I
had a very clear vision when I
started writing cookbooks what

03:36.500 --> 03:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wanted it to be, and that you
would open the book, that you
would look at the photograph

03:40.200 --> 03:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and go, that looks delicious.

03:42.233 --> 03:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then you would look at the
recipe and say, I can actually
make that and I can make

03:45.933 --> 03:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it with ingredients I can
find in the grocery store.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think that's
changed at all.

03:49.966 --> 03:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Having taught
yourself how to cook, does
that inform the recipes that

03:53.833 --> 03:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
end up in your book, because
you're thinking of them not
from a professionally trained

03:57.400 --> 03:59.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mind, but someone who
did this on her own?

03:59.666 --> 04:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INA GARTEN: That's really smart.

04:01.866 --> 04:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, when I first started
writing cookbooks, I remember
thinking to myself, what makes

04:04.366 --> 04:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
me think I can write a cookbook?

04:05.833 --> 04:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are these great chefs
who are really trained.

04:08.033 --> 04:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as I started, I realized,
actually, what is my lack is
actually exactly right, because

04:15.766 --> 04:18.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I can connect with --
cooking's hard for me.

04:18.766 --> 04:19.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I never worked on...

04:19.933 --> 04:21.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Cooking is hard for you?

04:21.166 --> 04:22.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: It is
so hard for me.

04:22.666 --> 04:24.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Anybody that works
with me will tell you.

04:24.266 --> 04:26.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's so hard for me.

04:26.366 --> 04:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why my recipes
are really simple, because I
want to be able to do them.

04:32.700 --> 04:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Soon,
executives at the Food Network
came calling, and calling, and

04:39.000 --> 04:41.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
calling.

04:41.533 --> 04:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I understand you were reluctant
at first to do television?

04:43.900 --> 04:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: Reluctant
is the understatement.

04:45.266 --> 04:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Really?

04:46.733 --> 04:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INA GARTEN: I just said no
over and over and over again.

04:49.333 --> 04:50.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Why?

04:50.833 --> 04:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INA GARTEN: I just didn't
think I'd be good on TV.

04:52.300 --> 04:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just couldn't imagine
why anybody would watch it.

04:55.266 --> 04:58.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Food Network,
fortunately, kept coming
back again and again.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they said, just try it.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I thought, well, I will
just do 13 shows, and then
they will leave me alone.

05:02.866 --> 05:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And that
was how many shows later?

05:04.866 --> 05:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INA GARTEN: And, happily,
that was 15 years later.

05:06.900 --> 05:07.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:07.900 --> 05:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INA GARTEN: I'm still doing it.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to show you my
recipes and my techniques.

05:11.433 --> 05:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
Barefoot Contessa series
is now 13 seasons' strong.

05:13.733 --> 05:16.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

can cook like a pro.

WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Her latest
version, "Cook Like a Pro,"
shows tips and techniques aimed

05:20.833 --> 05:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at helping viewers become more
comfortable in the kitchen.

05:23.233 --> 05:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INA GARTEN: Everything you
need to know, from trussing
the bird to carving it.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What do
you know of your audience?

05:29.400 --> 05:31.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who is watching it?

05:31.400 --> 05:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INA GARTEN: You know, there's
this moment in time when I
really got a vision of who

05:35.266 --> 05:37.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the audience was.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I was walking up Madison
Avenue, and there was a
woman in a big fur coat.

05:38.900 --> 05:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she said, "Oh, darling,
love your cookbooks."

05:41.600 --> 05:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I thought, that's very nice.

05:42.766 --> 05:44.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Then I kept going.

05:44.833 --> 05:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About a half-a-block later, a
truck driver pulled over and
said, "Hey, baby, love your

05:47.333 --> 05:48.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
show."

05:48.333 --> 05:49.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:49.533 --> 05:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: And I
thought, that's food.

05:52.733 --> 05:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think my cookbook audience
might be slightly different
from my TV audience, but I think

05:57.066 --> 05:59.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they're people that
are interested in food,
and that's everybody.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You're doing a beautiful
job, I have to tell you.

06:01.966 --> 06:03.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
You're just saying that.

06:03.166 --> 06:04.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

06:04.900 --> 06:07.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: During
our visit, Garten showed
us a few simple recipes.

06:07.266 --> 06:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can see her demonstrate
them on our Web site.

06:09.900 --> 06:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, she says her days
are now spent testing new
recipes for her upcoming 11th

06:15.500 --> 06:16.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cookbook.

06:16.733 --> 06:18.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's due in the
fall of next year.

06:18.033 --> 06:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: I love
what I'm doing.

06:19.666 --> 06:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm really happy doing it, and
I hope I can do It forever.

06:22.933 --> 06:24.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I'm having a ball.

06:24.366 --> 06:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ina Garten,
so great to talk to you.

06:26.433 --> 06:27.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

06:27.966 --> 06:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INA GARTEN: Well, it was so much
fun to talk to you too, William.
