JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:07.507 --> 00:11.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
Senate Democrats end a nearly
15-hour filibuster

00:11.979 --> 00:17.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
early this morning in a push for
gun control,
four days after the Orlando
shooting.

00:17.784 --> 00:22.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Thursday,
we sit down with three survivors
of the Orlando

00:22.222 --> 00:26.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack to hear their stories of
that harrowing
night inside the Pulse
nightclub.

00:26.560 --> 00:31.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And with the
Olympic Games
in Brazil around the corner,
fears of Zika

00:31.899 --> 00:35.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grip both athletes and tourists
-- how residents
are reacting.

00:36.003 --> 00:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POLLYANA RABELLO, Mother of
Child with Microcephaly
(through translator): If our
country is unable

00:38.538 --> 00:43.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support its own people, who are
Brazilians,
who pay taxes, why bring others
if you can't

00:43.610 --> 00:45.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even support these people?

00:45.178 --> 00:52.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:52.452 --> 00:55.255 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:55.289 --> 01:04.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This was a day
when President
Obama joined the mourning in
Orlando, as a

01:05.032 --> 01:10.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shocking new killing shook
England. The president
traveled to Florida to console
survivors and

01:10.737 --> 01:17.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
families of the 49 murdered
Sunday at a gay
nightclub. And he met with
police and first-responders.

01:17.577 --> 01:23.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afterward, Mr. Obama and Vice
President Biden
left flowers at a makeshift
memorial, and

01:23.984 --> 01:25.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
spoke with reporters.

01:25.852 --> 01:30.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Today, once again, as has been
true too many

01:30.724 --> 01:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
times before, I held and hugged
grieving family
members and parents, and they
asked, why does

01:39.566 --> 01:50.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this keep happening? And they
pleaded that
we do more to stop the carnage.
They don't

01:50.978 --> 01:55.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care about the politics. Neither
do I.

01:55.482 --> 02:01.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But a leading
Republican caused
a stir today when he initially
charged the

02:01.688 --> 02:05.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president bears the blame for
the nightclub
killings.

02:05.158 --> 02:10.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arizona Senator John McCain told
reporters:
"Barack Obama is directly
responsible for

02:10.364 --> 02:16.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it because his decision to pull
all U.S. troops
out of Iraq led to the rise of
ISIS."

02:16.169 --> 02:21.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, McCain said he misspoke,
and didn't
mean to imply the president was
personally

02:21.541 --> 02:23.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
responsible for Orlando.

02:23.343 --> 02:27.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Britain was
stunned today
when a member of Parliament was
shot dead

02:27.080 --> 02:32.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in her own district. Labor Party
M.P. Jo Cox
had campaigned to keep Britain
in the European

02:32.919 --> 02:39.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Union. She was killed in the
small town of
Birstall, near Leeds, in
Northern England.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Griff Witte is London bureau
chief for The
Washington Post, joins us now.

02:42.863 --> 02:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Griff, for an American frame of
reference,
there might be people who think
about this

02:46.366 --> 02:51.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like the Gabby Giffords shooting
or attack
that happened a few years ago
here. Who was

02:51.805 --> 02:53.573 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Jo Cox?

02:53.607 --> 02:57.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRIFF WITTE, The Washington
Post: Jo Cox was
someone who was widely respected
on all sides

02:57.911 --> 03:02.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the political debate in
Britain. She was
someone who had been a human
rights campaigner

03:02.349 --> 03:06.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before she became a member of
Parliament.
She was elected to Parliament
last year as

03:06.186 --> 03:10.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a member of the center-left
Labor Party, and
she was seen as someone with a
really extraordinarily

03:10.991 --> 03:13.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bright future in politics.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Cameron today called her a
rising star.

03:14.995 --> 03:19.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And there were
several different
narratives that were swirling.
What happened

03:19.266 --> 03:22.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the scene around the attack?

03:22.069 --> 03:27.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRIFF WITTE: Well, what we
understand is that
Jo Cox was meeting with
constituents at a

03:27.374 --> 03:32.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
library in this small town,
which is something
that she does every Thursday
afternoon, and

03:32.379 --> 03:37.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she was walking out of the
building, and she
was approached on the sidewalk
by a 52-year-old

03:37.717 --> 03:43.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man who began stabbing her. A
passerby tried
to intervene, tried to stop the
attack, and

03:43.890 --> 03:46.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the attacker then pulled out a
gun.

03:46.626 --> 03:51.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's believed to have been
perhaps an antique
weapon. Firearms are very
tightly regulated

03:51.198 --> 03:56.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here in the U.K., and he began
to shoot her.
And shot her at least two times,
perhaps three

03:56.570 --> 03:58.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
times. And she died about an
hour later.

03:58.738 --> 04:04.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Griff Witte,
we also heard
that the shooter or the
assailant had yelled

04:04.244 --> 04:09.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Britain first." Besides being a
slogan, it's
also the name of a far-right
party. And this

04:09.382 --> 04:13.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes in the context of this
much, much larger
conversation about the Brexit
right now.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GRIFF WITTE: Right.

04:15.522 --> 04:19.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want to stress that it's
not clear that
this man has any kind of
relationship with

04:19.893 --> 04:24.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Britain First, which is an
organization that
is on the far, far right here in
the U.K.

04:24.865 --> 04:30.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It is an anti-immigrant,
anti-Muslim organization
that does very provocative
demonstrations

04:30.070 --> 04:31.805 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
across British.

04:31.838 --> 04:35.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The organization says it has no
affiliation
with the assailant here and has
condemned

04:35.909 --> 04:41.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his actions. Nonetheless,
witnesses have said
that he yelled "Britain first"
as he was engaging

04:41.915 --> 04:46.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the attack and afterward. And so
that has
led to speculation that he has
had -- he has

04:46.052 --> 04:47.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some kind of political motives.

04:47.854 --> 04:51.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Family members, however, say
that they don't
know him to be someone who had
any kind of

04:51.725 --> 04:56.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political affiliations at all or
strong political
views, but they say that he was
mentally troubled.

04:56.830 --> 05:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.
Griff Witte of
The Washington Post joining us
from London,

05:00.167 --> 05:01.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thanks so much.

05:02.002 --> 05:05.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: Search
crews in the Mediterranean have
recovered

05:05.772 --> 05:10.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the cockpit voice recorder from
the EgyptAir
plane that crashed last month.
The flight

05:10.977 --> 05:17.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disappeared between Crete and
the Egyptian
coast, killing all 66 people on
board.

05:17.150 --> 05:22.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Investigators say the voice
recorder was damaged,
but its memory unit is still
intact. They're

05:22.422 --> 05:25.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
working to see if it sheds light
on what caused
the crash.

05:25.625 --> 05:29.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: CIA Director
John Brennan
warned today that the Islamic
State group

05:29.329 --> 05:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is trying to send operatives
into the West
to carry out new attacks.
Brennan told the

05:33.867 --> 05:38.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate Intelligence Committee
that the militants
hope high-profile attacks will
compensate

05:38.038 --> 05:41.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for territory they have lost in
Iraq and Syria.

05:41.141 --> 05:45.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN, CIA Director: ISIL
has a large
cadre of Western fighters who
could potentially

05:45.312 --> 05:50.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
serve as operatives for attacks
in the West.
And the group is probably
exploring a variety

05:50.483 --> 05:55.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of means for infiltrating
operatives into
the West, including in refugee
flows, smuggling

05:55.488 --> 05:57.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
routes and legitimate methods of
travel.

05:57.724 --> 06:01.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The gunman in
the Orlando
killings claimed allegiance to
the Islamic

06:01.728 --> 06:05.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State, but Brennan said today
the CIA has
found no actual connection.

06:05.365 --> 06:11.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Swathes of
downtown Saint Louis
had no electrical power, and no
air conditioning,

06:11.137 --> 06:17.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for much of this day, as the
heat headed toward
100 degrees. The cause was an
overnight fire

06:17.077 --> 06:22.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inside a manhole. Last night,
smoke could
be seen billowing from
underground. City hall,

06:22.983 --> 06:26.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
courts and other administrative
buildings
closed for the day.

06:26.152 --> 06:30.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Philadelphia
is now the
first major American city to
adopt a tax on

06:30.557 --> 06:36.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carbonated drinks. City council
today gave
final approval to a levy of 1.5
cents per

06:36.863 --> 06:43.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ounce for sugary and diet sodas.
The beverage
industry had waged a
multimillion-dollar campaign

06:43.136 --> 06:44.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to block the measure.

06:44.904 --> 06:49.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A late-day rally
lifted Wall
Street after five days of
losses. The Dow

06:49.342 --> 06:55.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jones industrial average gained
nearly 93
points to close at 17733. The
Nasdaq rose

06:55.081 --> 06:58.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
10 points, and the S&amp;P 500 added
six.

06:59.019 --> 07:03.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And Walt
Disney opened Shanghai
Disneyland today, its first
theme park in

07:03.790 --> 07:08.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mainland China. The opening
ceremony featured
Communist Party leaders and
familiar characters.

07:08.962 --> 07:14.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials held up the park as a
symbol of
U.S.-China relations. It's
valued at $5.5

07:14.734 --> 07:16.503 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
billion.

07:16.536 --> 07:20.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a senator's
15-hour filibuster, could it
change the gun

07:20.640 --> 07:26.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
control debate?; making economic
sense of
Britain's vote to leave or stay
in the E.U.;

07:26.780 --> 07:32.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Navy's new approach to PTSD;
first-hand
accounts from survivors of the
Orlando shooting;

07:32.952 --> 07:36.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

07:36.256 --> 07:49.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The debate over
gun control
took center stage in the U.S.
Senate for nearly

07:49.069 --> 07:54.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
15 hours, as Democrats pushed
for votes on
measures they say could help
prevent another

07:54.974 --> 07:58.511 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mass shooting.

07:58.545 --> 08:04.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate Minority Leader Harry
Reid confirmed
this morning that Republicans
will allow votes

08:04.284 --> 08:10.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on gun control amendments to a
larger money
bill. But he complained it's not
at all clear

08:10.790 --> 08:12.692 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they can pass.

08:12.726 --> 08:15.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), Minority
Leader: Republicans
must join us for those measures
to pass. But

08:15.729 --> 08:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that won't happen if Republicans
continue
to take their orders -- and I
mean orders

08:20.734 --> 08:24.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- from the National Rifle
Association and
the Gun Owners of America.

08:24.704 --> 08:29.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell
had a ready answer, that
Democrats played

08:29.743 --> 08:34.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
politics yesterday while the FBI
briefed senators
on Orlando.

08:34.047 --> 08:38.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader:
Senate Republicans attended, and
asked serious

08:38.918 --> 08:45.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questions. A rather significant
group of Senate
Democrats skipped it, skipped
the briefing

08:45.125 --> 08:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
altogether, for a campaign
talk-a-thon out
here on the Senate floor, which
also prevented

08:53.466 --> 08:56.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us from going forward on the
bill.

08:56.503 --> 09:01.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Connecticut
Democrat Chris
Murphy spearheaded the
filibuster that ran

09:01.641 --> 09:08.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nearly 15 hours, until early
this morning.
He evoked the 2012 massacre at a
school in

09:09.015 --> 09:12.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Newtown, Connecticut, and a
teacher who shielded
a child.

09:12.585 --> 09:19.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D),
Connecticut: It takes
courage to look into the eye of
a shooter,

09:19.993 --> 09:28.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
instead of running, wrapping
your arms around
a 6-year-old boy and accepting
death for a

09:28.835 --> 09:39.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
little boy under your charge.
Ask yourself,
what can you do to make sure
that Orlando

09:39.179 --> 09:43.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or Sandy Hook never, ever
happens again?

09:43.349 --> 09:49.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Murphy wants a
vote on barring
gun sales to those on a terror
watch list.

09:49.989 --> 09:53.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He drew support from a number of
fellow Democrats.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Republican Pat Toomey of
Pennsylvania also
spoke up.

09:56.663 --> 09:59.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. PAT TOOMEY (R),
Pennsylvania: I'm of
the view that it's time to get
something done

09:59.165 --> 10:04.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here. What I think we need to do
here is do
everything we can to make sure
that terrorists

10:04.437 --> 10:07.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are not able to buy guns, at
least not legally.

10:07.607 --> 10:13.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we also need to have a
meaningful mechanism
for people to challenge their
status of being

10:13.146 --> 10:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that list, and that's what we
haven't put
together here.

10:16.850 --> 10:23.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A GOP alternative
calls for
not barring gun sales, but
delaying them by

10:23.056 --> 10:27.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
72 hours, for anyone on the
watch list.

10:27.360 --> 10:32.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This afternoon, the Senate's
number two Republican,
John Cornyn, said the Senate
will vote on

10:32.765 --> 10:35.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
four gun-related measures on
Monday.

10:35.568 --> 10:40.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me now is one of the
more than 20
Democratic senators who took
part in last

10:40.640 --> 10:44.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
night's filibuster, Senator Al
Franken of
Minnesota.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator, thank you for joining
us.

10:46.913 --> 10:51.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Given the implacable opposition
of virtually
every Republican in the Senate,
what do you

10:51.417 --> 10:53.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think this filibuster
accomplished?

10:53.219 --> 10:58.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. AL FRANKEN (D), Minnesota:
Well, I hope
it changed the conversation, in
light of the

10:58.858 --> 11:10.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just horrific events -- event in
Orlando,
the worst mass shooting in our
country's history.

11:10.670 --> 11:18.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chris Murphy represented Newtown
when he was
in the House of Representatives,
and said

11:18.478 --> 11:27.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how difficult it is for him to
talk to the
families of the kids who died
there in that

11:27.687 --> 11:33.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shooting and tell them that,
four years later,
nothing has happened.

11:33.526 --> 11:42.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that -- I commend
Chris Murphy
for doing this. And I think it
changed the

11:42.635 --> 11:46.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conversation. And that's why
we're having
these votes. We're going to have
these votes

11:46.806 --> 11:54.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Monday. And I think anything
that we can
do to stop one of these events
is a good thing.

11:54.847 --> 12:00.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Dianne Feinstein is putting
forward a
bill that will take people who
are on the

12:00.053 --> 12:05.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terror watch list and make it so
they're not
able to buy a gun.

12:05.825 --> 12:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Chris Murphy has offered
legislation to
close the loopholes and the
background checks

12:13.499 --> 12:19.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at gun shows and online, because
anyone who
is on a terror watch list, if
they get turned

12:19.539 --> 12:26.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down at a gun store, they can
just right now
go online or go to a gun show.

12:26.512 --> 12:31.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have got to do everything
we can to
prevent something like this
happening. We're

12:31.751 --> 12:37.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not going to get all of them,
but any one
that we can stop, we must do.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Senator,
I'm sure you
know Republicans are arguing.
They have got

12:42.028 --> 12:46.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their own arguments on every one
of these
proposals. On the terror watch
list proposal,

12:46.633 --> 12:54.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they say, well -- they still
think that, since
-- or they argue that buying a
gun is a constitutional

12:54.741 --> 12:56.509 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right.

12:56.542 --> 13:00.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even for someone who is on a
terror watch
list, maybe there's a short
delay, but you

13:00.380 --> 13:04.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still have to give that person
an opportunity
to buy a gun at some point.

13:04.183 --> 13:09.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. AL FRANKEN: Well, you know,
we can -- we
should be talking about how to
do this.

13:09.756 --> 13:15.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But talking about a three-day
delay, I don't
think makes sense. The GAO just
came out with

13:15.561 --> 13:24.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a report that says that people
on the no-fly
list, 91 percent of them were
able to buy

13:24.070 --> 13:29.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guns at gun stores. The ones
that were turned
down, they weren't denied
because they were

13:29.409 --> 13:34.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the terror watch list. They
were denied
for some other reason.

13:34.714 --> 13:42.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to make sure that people
who shouldn't
have guns do not have guns. That
is a priority.

13:42.188 --> 13:47.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, yes, if you want to
adjudicate somebody
who is wrongly on the list, that
should be

13:47.093 --> 13:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
done, but it shouldn't be done
in three days.

13:50.129 --> 13:54.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, what
makes you think
a compromise can be worked out
now, when even

13:54.834 --> 14:01.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when the Democrats were in the
majority in
the Senate, after the Newtown
school shooting,

14:01.741 --> 14:05.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were not able to enact
significant legislation
on guns?

14:05.344 --> 14:08.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. AL FRANKEN: One, we came
very close then.

14:08.648 --> 14:18.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, two, I think this terror
watch list is
a different issue. And I think
that what we

14:18.491 --> 14:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saw in this filibuster last
night and the
reaction of people to it around
the country,

14:25.098 --> 14:31.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that my Republican
colleagues who
are certainly up for reelection
-- you see

14:31.404 --> 14:38.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it with Donald Trump, whose
response to this
has been, you know, in many ways
terrible,

14:38.945 --> 14:40.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is seeing -- he's running for
president.

14:40.813 --> 14:50.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He sees that, you know, 80
percent of Republicans
are for these measures, and 80
-- some 87

14:50.356 --> 14:56.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent of the American people
are for that.
So I hope that my colleagues
understand that

14:56.896 --> 15:04.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is just the right thing to
do, and that
they will not give into the
pressure from

15:04.137 --> 15:05.838 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the NRA.

15:05.872 --> 15:09.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even if the
Senate were the
pass some language, Senator, we
have every

15:09.275 --> 15:16.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expectation that the House
wouldn't. So is
this just then an exercise in
what?

15:16.115 --> 15:22.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. AL FRANKEN: This is an
exercise in trying
to prevent these from happening.

15:22.255 --> 15:32.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what this is. And there
has been movement
on this issue because of this
horrific event.

15:32.832 --> 15:36.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I believe that's being felt
in the Senate
and in the House.

15:36.135 --> 15:41.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you do believe
next week
we may see some of -- one or
more of these

15:41.440 --> 15:43.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
proposals pass the Senate?

15:43.242 --> 15:48.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. AL FRANKEN: I hope so. I
don't know what
Senator Cornyn's proposal is. I
don't know

15:48.381 --> 15:53.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what Senator Grassley's proposal
is. But you
will notice that we are getting
proposals

15:53.252 --> 15:55.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from them now.

15:55.121 --> 16:01.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, they may have -- they may
be like we
have seen before, with poison
pills or something

16:01.661 --> 16:08.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like that. But I think the
conversation has
changed in the wake of this
horrific event.

16:08.534 --> 16:13.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Al
Franken of Minnesota,
we thank you very much.

16:13.506 --> 16:18.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. AL FRANKEN: Thank you,
Judy.

16:18.878 --> 16:28.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As we heard,
Britain was
stunned today by the killing of
a member of

16:28.821 --> 16:33.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parliament. Jo Cox was a strong
supporter
of saying the country should
stay in the European

16:33.960 --> 16:35.828 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Union.

16:35.862 --> 16:39.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In one week, Britain votes on
that very question.
Both sides in the argument
suspended their

16:39.866 --> 16:42.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
campaigns today out of respect.

16:42.668 --> 16:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before the latest, our economics
correspondent
Paul Solman was in Oxford
hearing the arguments.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tonight, the case for leaving
the E.U.

16:51.077 --> 16:55.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of his Making Sense
series, which
appears every Thursday on the
"NewsHour."

16:55.681 --> 17:02.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The Oxford Union,
perhaps the
world's most famous debating
society.

17:02.955 --> 17:08.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX SALMOND, First Minister of
Scotland:
Mr. President, I am delighted to
be here at

17:08.728 --> 17:13.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Oxford Union, the pinnacle
of university
debating in England.

17:13.733 --> 17:20.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Capping off the
spring term last
week, the year's most hotly
anticipated debate,

17:20.239 --> 17:26.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the E.U. referendum, better
known as Brexit,
British exit from the European
Union, coming

17:26.379 --> 17:28.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up for a real vote one week from
today.

17:28.481 --> 17:33.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL HOWARD, Former
Conservative Party
Leader: We have a long and
illustrious tradition

17:33.552 --> 17:39.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of democratic self-government.
We are as entitled
to rule ourselves as are the
people of the

17:39.992 --> 17:49.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States of America. This
is your birthright.
This is your heritage. This is
your future.

17:49.235 --> 17:53.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Reclaim it and vote leave.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.341 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

17:55.374 --> 18:01.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX SALMOND: Let's make the
case for immigration
as a sign of success of this
country, and

18:01.047 --> 18:05.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let's celebrate the magnificent
achievement
of those who've come.

18:05.818 --> 18:13.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: This is Mansfield,
one of Oxford's
38 colleges, where some 400 of
Oxford's 22,000

18:13.092 --> 18:15.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
students live and learn.

18:15.494 --> 18:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mansfield is known for its
nonconformity,
its openness to students from
all countries

18:20.499 --> 18:26.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and classes, not just from
upper-crust prep
schools. Small wonder its
faculty want to

18:26.539 --> 18:28.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
remain in the E.U.

18:28.407 --> 18:33.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Sometimes, I talk to my
colleagues
over lunch, and they cannot
imagine that anybody

18:33.312 --> 18:35.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would vote leave.

18:35.247 --> 18:39.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But at the entry
point to Mansfield,
Terry Greenwood, who helps run
the Porter's

18:39.085 --> 18:41.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lodge, will vote to vamoose.

18:41.187 --> 18:47.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERRY GREENWOOD, Mansfield
College: I have
no confidence in the basic
ability or competence

18:47.793 --> 18:50.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of anybody in the European
Parliament, whatever.

18:50.863 --> 18:57.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But it's going to
cost the United
Kingdom to leave the union, is
it not?

18:57.103 --> 19:03.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERRY GREENWOOD: So what? We
should be in
charge of our own country, we,
not some unelected

19:03.242 --> 19:07.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parliament. You wouldn't have
your next-door
neighbor come in and tell you
what to eat

19:07.279 --> 19:13.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at your table. Well, that's
precisely what
the European Union is telling us
to do. It's

19:13.119 --> 19:15.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
telling us how to conduct our
lives.

19:15.788 --> 19:22.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Somerville was one
of Oxford's
first colleges to admit women,
in 1879. Indira

19:22.495 --> 19:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gandhi lived and learned here.
So did Margaret
Thatcher. The faculty want to
stay in Europe,

19:30.069 --> 19:35.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but Olga Smith, a so-called
scout who helps
keep house for the current head
of college,

19:35.241 --> 19:36.909 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doesn't.

19:36.942 --> 19:40.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OLGA SMITH, Somerville College:
Well, I think
we have lost control of the
borders.

19:40.279 --> 19:46.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Do you think that
the people
who are coming in are driving
down wages?

19:46.318 --> 19:53.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OLGA SMITH: The wages and
unemployment, yes,
yes, because there's a lot more
foreign people

19:53.626 --> 19:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing all that, doing all sorts
of jobs.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID TOWNSEND, Somerville
College: I feel
that we should leave.

19:58.464 --> 20:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: David Townsend is
assistant gardener.

20:01.434 --> 20:08.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID TOWNSEND: I have always
regarded myself
as English first, then British.
I have never

20:08.541 --> 20:13.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regarded myself as European. As
an island
nation, I think it's inborn, I
think.

20:13.779 --> 20:20.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But the Brexit vote
isn't just
a class conflict, town against
gown. Consider

20:20.052 --> 20:24.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this excerpt from a feature film
gone viral
making the case for leaving.

20:24.457 --> 20:29.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: We the people are
being cajoled,
frightened, and bullied into
surrendering

20:29.462 --> 20:36.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our democracy and freedom. This
film is a
rallying cry. We must fight for
our independence,

20:36.635 --> 20:40.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the right to determine
ourselves the laws
under which we live, and for the
freedom to

20:40.973 --> 20:42.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shape our own future.

20:42.741 --> 20:47.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The politician
often compared
to Donald Trump here, former
London Mayor

20:47.213 --> 20:49.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Boris Johnson, makes the
economic case for
leaving.

20:50.015 --> 20:53.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BORIS JOHNSON, Former Mayor of
London: Why
are we sending 10 billion pounds
a year net

20:53.919 --> 20:59.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Brussels, some of which is
spent, my friends,
you know, some of which is spent
on Spanish

20:59.125 --> 21:00.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bullfighting?

21:00.960 --> 21:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And though almost
half of Oxford
students are foreign-born, a few
are pushing

21:06.999 --> 21:10.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brexit vigorously. Harrison
Edmonds is one
of their leaders.

21:10.736 --> 21:13.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARRISON EDMONDS, Student: For
Britain to
be viable in the future
economically, it has

21:13.372 --> 21:17.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be where the market is. And
the market
increasingly of the next century
is not going

21:17.543 --> 21:20.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be in Europe. It's going to
be in Asia.
It's going to be in America.
It's going to

21:20.579 --> 21:23.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be in South America. It's not
going to be
in Europe. And that's where we
need to be

21:23.449 --> 21:26.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking. We need to be looking
outside of
the European Union for those
markets.

21:26.485 --> 21:31.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Meanwhile, says
Peter Saville,
commonwealth nations like
Australia or India

21:31.891 --> 21:34.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
become second-class trading
partners.

21:34.193 --> 21:40.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER SAVILLE, Student: If trade
agreements
localize to one area, that is
effectively

21:40.466 --> 21:44.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a protection racket. They
disadvantage the
world community towards the
European one,

21:44.904 --> 21:46.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that accident of geography.

21:46.772 --> 21:51.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But this is a
protectionism racket,
not a protection racket.
Protection racket

21:51.410 --> 21:55.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is when you extort somebody
because you're
going to hurt them if they don't
do what you

21:55.381 --> 21:55.748 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
say.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.516 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:57.550 --> 22:00.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER SAVILLE: If you're a
member of the club,
and you vote to leave that club,
and that

22:00.753 --> 22:06.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
club threatens you to stay
inside, that's
not a group of friends. That is
a protection

22:06.292 --> 22:08.127 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
racket.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And in the end,
says Oliver Shore,
the E.U. will come round and
trade with the

22:11.430 --> 22:13.132 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.K. anyway.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OLIVER SHORE, Student: Can you
really see
Angela Merkel going to all the
German car

22:15.901 --> 22:19.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
manufacturers and saying, look,
you're going
to have to cut your jobs because
Britain's

22:19.438 --> 22:24.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been bad and we're going to have
to put big
tariffs up and stop you selling
cars to Britain,

22:24.176 --> 22:28.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and even though I'm a very
unpopular prime
minister in Germany at the
moment, I'm going

22:28.581 --> 22:30.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to become even more unpopular by
cutting manufacturing
jobs?

22:30.983 --> 22:34.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But the nub of the
argument,
says Sam Slater, is sovereignty.

22:34.587 --> 22:39.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM SLATER, Student: A big point
is about
British elected -- elected
representatives

22:39.391 --> 22:45.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making our own laws, not the
unelected commission
handing down laws to the kind of
elected European

22:45.397 --> 22:50.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parliament, who kind of give
them an agreement,
and then maybe it will become
law. It's rubbish.

22:50.369 --> 22:56.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Case in point, a
Scottish tax
passed a few years ago, in part
to combat

22:56.508 --> 22:58.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
alcoholism.

22:58.210 --> 23:01.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM SLATER: It was passed by the
Scottish
Parliament, which is elected by
the Scottish

23:01.447 --> 23:05.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, and they have a mandate
to pass laws,
and it was blocked. It was
blocked by the

23:05.918 --> 23:10.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
European Union because of this
technical standards
directive. What has it got to do
with the

23:10.189 --> 23:15.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other 27 member states what
Scottish people
want to do in their own country?
It's a disgrace.

23:15.427 --> 23:17.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's an utter disgrace.

23:17.263 --> 23:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, disgrace or
not, Scottish
voters turn out to be strongly
in favor of

23:21.934 --> 23:28.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remaining. And we will explore
that side of
the debate, to remain, in our
next piece.

23:28.274 --> 23:35.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Until then, reporting from
Oxford, England,
this is economics correspondent
Paul Solman.

23:35.781 --> 23:48.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to a major
change being
made by the U.S. Navy that will
affect servicemen

23:48.360 --> 23:51.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suffering from one of the unseen
wounds of
war.

23:51.730 --> 23:53.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has that.

23:53.532 --> 23:57.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan
have killed thousands of
American servicemen

23:57.469 --> 24:03.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and maimed and injured tens of
thousands more,
but some wounds are not as
easily seen or

24:03.175 --> 24:04.977 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
identified.

24:05.010 --> 24:10.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Post-traumatic stress disorder,
or PTSD afflicts
as much as one-fifth of Iraq and
Afghanistan

24:10.916 --> 24:16.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
veterans in any given year.
Compounding the
affliction, personnel who were
kicked out

24:16.355 --> 24:23.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the military because of
erratic behavior
caused by PTSD, by traumatic
brain injury,

24:23.329 --> 24:28.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called TBI, or by other mental
health conditions
often lose their benefits,
including access

24:28.967 --> 24:30.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to veterans health care.

24:30.836 --> 24:36.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that will now change for at
least one
of the services, navy personnel,
sailors and

24:36.175 --> 24:40.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marines, under a new policy
enacted by Navy
Secretary Ray Mabus.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Secretary Mabus joins us now.

24:42.281 --> 24:43.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you for joining us.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAY MABUS, Secretary of the U.S.
Navy: Glad
to be here.

24:44.983 --> 24:48.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Tell us what this new
policy is
and why you made this change.

24:48.954 --> 24:54.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAY MABUS: The policy that we
had been operating
under was, if somebody committed
misconduct,

24:54.760 --> 24:59.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the erratic behavior you were
talking about,
that took preference over
everything else

24:59.365 --> 25:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in terms of a discharge.

25:01.166 --> 25:06.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so people would get
discharged with bad
paper, with discharges that
didn't give them

25:06.672 --> 25:12.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any benefits when they left.
What we have
done with policy that I have
just signed was

25:12.911 --> 25:17.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to say, if you're being
administratively discharged
for some misconduct, we're going
to take a

25:17.950 --> 25:23.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look to see if you have got a
diagnosable
condition, to see if you have
got PTSD, to

25:23.222 --> 25:29.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see if you have got traumatic
brain injury,
and then that will factor in, so
that you

25:29.328 --> 25:34.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may still be discharged, but you
will be discharged
with benefits, with help that
we're going

25:35.000 --> 25:41.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to recognize the reason for this
erratic behavior
and give you help after you
leave the military.

25:41.206 --> 25:48.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's not just for combat
injuries, combat
wounds. It's also for things
like sexual assault

25:48.514 --> 25:51.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that is often followed by PTSD.

25:51.116 --> 25:54.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And just to be clear,
you say that
this conduct took precedence.

25:54.753 --> 25:59.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, it didn't matter
that the
misconduct may have had an
underlying cause.

25:59.691 --> 26:01.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RAY MABUS: Right.

26:01.460 --> 26:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only thing that was looked
at was the
misconduct. And the discharge
was based on

26:07.666 --> 26:16.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that misconduct without why it
was caused,
without PTSD evaluation, without
TBI evaluation.

26:17.009 --> 26:24.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the awful thing was, when
people left
under this circumstance, they
got no benefits.

26:24.850 --> 26:30.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they couldn't get into
veterans health
care. They couldn't get the
assistance they

26:30.389 --> 26:37.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
needed to deal with PTSD or to
deal with traumatic
brain injury. It was a pure
policy issue.

26:37.196 --> 26:42.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is not just for people
being discharged
now, not just for active-duty
people. If you're

26:42.367 --> 26:47.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a veteran, and you were
discharged and got
bad paper, and so you're not
getting any benefits,

26:47.806 --> 26:54.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you believe that it was
caused by in some
way or another PTSD or traumatic
brain injury,

26:54.646 --> 26:56.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come back. We will take another
look at it.

26:57.015 --> 27:04.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will take another run at the
determination
of the discharge. If it is found
by that,

27:04.957 --> 27:10.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you will be able to get your
benefits, even
if you have been discharged for
a while.

27:10.729 --> 27:13.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Any idea how many men
and women
that could affect?

27:13.765 --> 27:19.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAY MABUS: The estimates we have
got on traumatic
brain injury are 46,000 sailors,
49,000 Marines.

27:19.071 --> 27:25.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a lot of people. It's
hard to know,
in terms of why people were
discharged, why

27:25.978 --> 27:28.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- what kind of discharges they
got.

27:28.280 --> 27:33.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This sort of thing, it's hard to
know how
many are going to fit in under
that, but it's

27:33.385 --> 27:35.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
clearly not just a few people.

27:35.254 --> 27:38.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Do you think enough
is being done
for sailors and Marines to
recognize, on the

27:39.024 --> 27:45.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commanders' part, to recognize
when behavior
may be because of PTSD or
traumatic brain

27:45.130 --> 27:46.231 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
injury?

27:46.265 --> 27:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAY MABUS: I think we're making
progress on
that.

27:48.200 --> 27:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other part of this policy is
that, if
you're going to be discharged
and there's

27:52.938 --> 28:00.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a possibility you will be
discharged without
benefits, that discharge
decision was moved

28:00.512 --> 28:05.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way up in the chain of command.
It has got
to be done by an admiral or a
general, a flag

28:05.551 --> 28:11.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officer, instead of where it
used to be, which
was a unit commander, which
would be lieutenant

28:11.857 --> 28:13.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
colonel, colonel, somewhere
around in there.

28:13.659 --> 28:18.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Secretary, do you
think the
other services will follow your
lead on this?

28:18.630 --> 28:20.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAY MABUS: Well, I certainly
hope so.

28:20.465 --> 28:27.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have had some talks with
the other
services on how we implemented
this and what

28:27.205 --> 28:31.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the new policy is. And so this
is the right
thing to do.

28:31.143 --> 28:35.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Let me ask you one
more question
about an issue facing the modern
military.

28:35.847 --> 28:40.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Pentagon just recently had
their LGBT
pride event.

28:40.552 --> 28:45.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Carter said last year
that he would
-- was looking to change the
policy to allow

28:45.991 --> 28:52.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transgender people to serve in
the military.
That new policy was due five
months ago. Can

28:52.798 --> 28:56.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you give us any insight into
what the issues
are that are holding this up?

28:56.335 --> 29:00.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAY MABUS: I know that the
process is ongoing.
We have participated in the
process in terms

29:01.006 --> 29:02.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of transgender.

29:02.708 --> 29:10.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that, from Secretary
Carter's
memo, when he set this out, it's
not if, but

29:10.182 --> 29:16.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when. It's not if, but how. We
had all expected
the policy before now, but
things take a while

29:16.855 --> 29:17.389 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sometimes.

29:17.422 --> 29:18.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Very good.

29:18.557 --> 29:21.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Ray Mabus, thank you
for being with
us.

29:21.460 --> 29:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAY MABUS: Appreciate it, John.

29:28.300 --> 29:35.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

29:35.173 --> 29:40.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
U.N. official
explains why it's so hard to
solve the refugee

29:40.045 --> 29:46.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
crisis; Brazil combats
mosquitoes, and Zika,
ahead of the Summer Olympics;
and a Muslim-American

29:46.918 --> 29:49.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
breaks down stereotypes with
comedy.

29:49.755 --> 29:55.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: As families in
Orlando were preparing
to bury the first victims of the
mass shooting,

29:55.661 --> 29:59.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president spoke today of
grief beyond
description. Many in the
community are mourning

30:00.032 --> 30:05.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for sons, daughters, family and
friends who
were just in their 20s and 30s.

30:05.037 --> 30:08.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We spent much of this past day
listening to
what survivors and members of
the community

30:08.974 --> 30:10.375 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had to say.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

30:12.310 --> 30:16.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The president
and vice president's
visit today comes as the people
of Orlando

30:16.415 --> 30:20.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are finding different ways of
coping and trying
to recover from this massacre.

30:20.352 --> 30:24.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON PRICE, Greenwood Cemetery: I
think it
means a lot. It shows that the
nation is watching.

30:24.823 --> 30:31.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's the idealism at
that point,
that he's taken time, the
president has taken

30:31.930 --> 30:36.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time to let everybody know that,
hey, he feels
for them and is watching it.

30:36.134 --> 30:40.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But, for
others, especially
those who witnessed the attack
firsthand inside

30:40.505 --> 30:44.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Pulse nightclub, ceremonies
and visits
can only do so much.

30:44.710 --> 30:49.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeanette McCoy drove to the club
Saturday
night and was inside with her
friends Julian

30:49.881 --> 30:55.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amador and Yvens Carrenard when
the shooting
began. Another friend shielded
McCoy, taking

30:55.520 --> 31:00.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a gunshot to the back and
allowing her to
escape. She says her grief has
made it hard

31:00.859 --> 31:02.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to sleep.

31:02.627 --> 31:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEANETTE MCCOY, Survivor: We
lost so many
people. We lost a part of us.
People don't

31:08.133 --> 31:14.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
realize. There's people who were
dead, but
the ones that survived, we can't
hold a service

31:14.139 --> 31:15.974 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for our heads.

31:16.007 --> 31:19.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Carrenard
can't shake the
images of what he saw as he
escaped the club.

31:19.344 --> 31:22.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YVENS CARRENARD, Survivor: I
could hear people
moaning. And I could hear people
screaming

31:22.214 --> 31:26.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for help. When they came and got
us, I had
to physically walk by bodies. We
had to walk

31:26.384 --> 31:29.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the dead bodies that were
just where we
were standing.

31:29.287 --> 31:32.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: McCoy told us
today she
believes the police waited too
long to rush

31:33.024 --> 31:36.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in, which she says allowed it to
become a
hostage situation.

31:36.094 --> 31:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEANETTE MCCOY: Through all of
this that's
going on, the gunshots didn't
stop. They just

31:41.199 --> 31:46.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't stop. I'm still yelling
at the cops
and telling them it made no
sense. I said,

31:46.037 --> 31:49.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's one individual in there.
How it is that
there's hundreds of cops out
there and no

31:49.941 --> 31:51.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
one is going in?

31:51.810 --> 31:55.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But others
believe officials
did the best they could and now
is the time

31:55.247 --> 31:57.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to focus on the future.

31:57.649 --> 32:02.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Don Price is helping the city of
Orlando establish
a permanent memorial here in
Greenwood Cemetery.

32:02.821 --> 32:05.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The city is offering free burial
plots for
any of the victims.

32:05.357 --> 32:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON PRICE: A lot of these
victims are not
staying in Orlando. They're
being sent home

32:10.562 --> 32:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Puerto Rico. They're going to
Mexico. They're
going to the Dominican Republic.
They're going

32:14.699 --> 32:18.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to New Jersey. They're going all
around. Their
friends and their family base is
still here

32:18.770 --> 32:23.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Orlando. So we need a place
that the community
can come and grieve.

32:23.508 --> 32:27.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: DeAngelo Scott
was dancing
that night at Pulse, too, but he
left just

32:27.712 --> 32:32.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before the attacks began. Six of
his friends
died that night.

32:32.083 --> 32:38.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says the so-called Pulse
family, the whole
LGBT community, must come
together to heal

32:38.423 --> 32:40.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to lead by example for the
rest of the
city.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DEANGELO SCOTT, Orlando
Resident: We're going
to get fine. We're going to get
through this.

32:42.928 --> 32:47.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I was like, we don't really
have a choice.
I was like, because the Pulse
family is what

32:47.632 --> 32:50.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
built the overall Pulse family,
which is the
family we have in the community.

32:50.535 --> 32:54.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was like, so we have to make
sure that we
fix ourselves, so that the rest
of us, the

32:54.472 --> 32:57.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rest of the city, you know, can
look up to
us for support.

32:57.409 --> 33:00.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's right.
You don't
have a choice.

33:00.212 --> 33:03.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEANGELO SCOTT: Yes. Otherwise,
they win.
We can't let them win.

33:03.815 --> 33:12.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For the "PBS
NewsHour,"
I'm William Brangham.

33:12.324 --> 33:22.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: People seeking
safety in Europe
are now sailing the Western
Mediterranean,

33:22.367 --> 33:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: People seeking
safety in Europe
are now sailing the Western
Mediterranean,

33:28.173 --> 33:33.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after Turkey and the European
Union struck
a deal to stem the refugee flow.

33:33.511 --> 33:38.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The results have been deadly.
More than 1,000
people have drowned just in the
past several

33:38.550 --> 33:43.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weeks. And both here and abroad,
the debate
about their fate rages on.

33:43.355 --> 33:48.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For an update, Gwen Ifill spoke
this week
with Amin Awad. He's the
director Middle East

33:49.027 --> 33:52.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and North Africa for the U.N.
Refugee Agency,
UNHCR.

33:52.831 --> 33:56.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Mr. Awad, welcome.

33:56.034 --> 34:00.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On this program, we have seen
the terrible
stories of the hundreds of
thousands of refugees

34:00.272 --> 34:04.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming, especially from the
Mideast and Africa,
trying to get to Greece, trying
to get to

34:04.209 --> 34:06.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Turkey, trying to get into
Europe.

34:06.177 --> 34:10.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Has that problem, has it gotten
worse or gotten
better since this whole crisis
began?

34:10.815 --> 34:14.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIN AWAD, United Nations High
Commissioner
for Refugees: I think this
problem of migrants

34:14.920 --> 34:18.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and refugees and secondary
movement is persisting.

34:18.957 --> 34:23.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wouldn't say it's getting
better or it's
getting worse, simply because
the conditions

34:23.428 --> 34:29.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that people are fleeing are
getting worse.
The serious situation is not
better than it

34:29.367 --> 34:36.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was before. Cessation of
hostilities ended.
The resumption of fighting
continued. And

34:36.574 --> 34:39.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as a result, people are fleeing.

34:39.878 --> 34:46.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The poverty and impoverishment
that people
fleeing sub-Saharan Africa
continue to persist.

34:46.418 --> 34:53.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There isn't a south-north
collaboration, as
used to be before. People are
fearing -- fleeing

34:53.758 --> 35:03.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Niger, where there is conflict.
There is poverty.
And they seek opportunity, new
places, market

35:03.935 --> 35:05.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and labor and mobility.

35:05.770 --> 35:11.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of them are fleeing
conflict, coming
from East Africa, the Horn of
Africa, or the

35:11.443 --> 35:15.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
central part of Africa or the
western part
of Africa. So the root causes
for flight are

35:15.947 --> 35:20.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still there. And the world has
to come up
with more mechanisms and better
mechanisms

35:20.518 --> 35:23.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to tackle the root causes of
these conflicts
or poverty.

35:23.054 --> 35:28.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So the root causes
are still there,
but the welcome mat is not there
anymore.

35:28.660 --> 35:34.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, it's certainly not
there in Turkey,
and it's certainly not there in
Germany like

35:34.466 --> 35:38.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it once was. So how does that
affect the flow?

35:38.169 --> 35:43.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIN AWAD: People -- the flow
will persist.
People will continue to try all
they can to

35:43.775 --> 35:48.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make it to safety, to make it to
better places,
to find opportunity or
protection.

35:48.446 --> 35:57.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the welcoming mat is not
there, then there
ought to be equal investment in
the communities

35:57.756 --> 36:05.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where conflicts are and where
poverty is,
and try to stem the flow in a
more dynamic

36:05.597 --> 36:07.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and cooperative manner.

36:07.432 --> 36:11.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you also have to uphold all
international
instruments, the international
protection,

36:11.703 --> 36:17.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
international national refugee
law, the international
human rights law. We have to
rally around

36:17.976 --> 36:21.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these and similar, because
that's what makes
the world also orderly.

36:21.413 --> 36:26.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But you know that,
in this country,
we're having a big presidential
debate which

36:26.117 --> 36:30.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
circles around in part what we
should be,
how many refugees we should be
accepting.

36:30.622 --> 36:36.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in Europe, the vote, the
Brexit about
whether to exit the European
Union to some

36:36.161 --> 36:38.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
degree also centers around that.

36:38.530 --> 36:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Doesn't make your task an uphill
one?

36:41.399 --> 36:46.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIN AWAD: It does in a way,
but, on the other
hand, I think there are also
more people,

36:46.771 --> 36:54.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
be it politician or
constituencies, or outfits,
policy think tanks, politicians,
parliamentarians

36:54.646 --> 36:59.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or congressmen or senators, who
know, and
they can differentiate between
the political

36:59.684 --> 37:05.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hype and the xenophobia and the
real issues.

37:05.123 --> 37:12.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Refugees are fleeing terror.
They are fleeing
radical groups. They are fleeing
conflicts.

37:12.130 --> 37:12.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're looking for safety.

37:12.864 --> 37:13.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And yet people...

37:13.965 --> 37:16.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMIN AWAD: They couldn't be the
people to
blame.

37:16.067 --> 37:20.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, that's exactly
the point,
yet people say that refugees
themselves could

37:20.672 --> 37:22.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be spreading the terror. That's
the fear.

37:22.807 --> 37:30.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIN AWAD: Well, there isn't --
there are
no guarantees for us to really
think this

37:30.281 --> 37:35.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is really the truth, nor, if we
look at history
of refugees during the last 200
years, that

37:35.653 --> 37:39.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have been carrying attacks
against hosts.
It never happened.

37:39.958 --> 37:45.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It never happened.
In order for
this to work, you need some
financial resources.

37:45.597 --> 37:51.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many nations have pledged
financial resources
to this cause. Have they
fulfilled those promises?

37:51.703 --> 37:58.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIN AWAD: London conference,
February, good
initiative by the U.K. and by
Norway, Kuwait

37:58.810 --> 38:03.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and others, pledges were made in
good faith,
but they were not made.

38:03.047 --> 38:05.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How much money are
we talking
about?

38:05.116 --> 38:06.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMIN AWAD: We're talking about
$12 billion.

38:06.217 --> 38:07.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And how much has
been...

38:07.552 --> 38:08.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMIN AWAD: Two-point-five.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Two-point-five,
instead of 12?

38:10.355 --> 38:14.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMIN AWAD: If we are to
stabilize the world
and the protracted conflicts,
resources have

38:14.859 --> 38:16.794 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be there.

38:16.828 --> 38:23.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other problem we have is
protracted conflicts,
they have been open for long,
like never we

38:23.067 --> 38:29.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have seen before, 60 million
people displaced,
the refugees or IDPs, because of
natural disaster

38:29.207 --> 38:35.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or conflicts. A lot of
protracted situation,
the world, they could not find
solutions.

38:35.280 --> 38:39.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there ought to be a new
model, an
approach, robust, to bring the
East and the

38:39.284 --> 38:44.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
West together to make sure that
conflicts
are solved. If conflicts are not
solved, the

38:44.489 --> 38:48.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world will be an unruly place, a
dangerous
place like never before.

38:48.793 --> 38:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That's one end of --
that's the
source of the flood of migrants.

38:54.966 --> 38:58.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What about what happens on the
other end,
people who fear that their
economies will

38:58.670 --> 39:01.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be adversely affected, that
their jobs will
be taken?

39:01.673 --> 39:08.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIN AWAD: Stabilize the world.
Find solutions
to natural disaster, conflicts,
and don't

39:08.546 --> 39:10.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leave protracted situation, open
conflicts.

39:10.949 --> 39:15.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have Yemen, Libya, Syria,
South Sudan,
a few places in Central Africa.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Do you see progress
toward that?

39:17.655 --> 39:23.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIN AWAD: We haven't seen.
Frozen conflicts.
More and more people flee. This
is a threat

39:23.528 --> 39:30.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against political -- our very
stable planet.
It is a threat to international
security.

39:30.768 --> 39:33.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Frozen conflicts.

39:33.404 --> 39:37.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amin Awad, the director of the
Middle East
and North Africa Bureau of the
UNHCR, thank

39:37.909 --> 39:38.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you very much.

39:38.643 --> 39:43.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMIN AWAD: Thank you.

39:44.015 --> 39:57.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Several
athletes have decided
not to attend the summer
Olympics in Rio de

39:57.295 --> 40:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Janeiro this August. Some male
competitors
have taken the precaution of
freezing their

40:01.666 --> 40:03.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sperm in advance of going.

40:03.735 --> 40:08.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reason? Zika. Brazil has
been severely
affected by the virus, shown to
cause birth

40:08.740 --> 40:13.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
defects. There have even been
calls among
some in the international
community to move

40:13.111 --> 40:14.445 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Games.

40:14.479 --> 40:18.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But the World Health
Organization, or WHO,
now says it's safe.

40:18.182 --> 40:23.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour" producer Jon Gerberg
and NPR's
Lulu Garcia-Navarro report now
on Brazilian

40:23.254 --> 40:24.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reaction to the controversy.

40:24.856 --> 40:28.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Hey, man, what's up.

40:28.159 --> 40:33.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Paulo Cesar
Vieira, known
by his nickname Peanut, is
something of a

40:33.531 --> 40:36.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
celebrity in his favela, or
informal settlement
of Rocinha.

40:36.868 --> 40:41.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULO CESAR VIEIRA, Brazil: I
feel proud.
I am from here, but I am so
proud because,

40:41.639 --> 40:45.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since kids, I always dreamed to
see my favela
up.

40:46.010 --> 40:50.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: A community
leader and
a tour guide, he had hoped that
the coming

40:50.715 --> 41:01.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Olympics would be the next step
in improving
the lives of everyday
Brazilians. But then

41:01.125 --> 41:02.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Zika happened.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: The Zika virus and its
potentially devastating
consequences continue to spread.

41:05.730 --> 41:10.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Growing fears now among
Olympic athletes
and fans worldwide over the
looming threat

41:10.268 --> 41:12.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Zika virus.

41:12.103 --> 41:16.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Hundreds of thousands of
people traveling
to Brazil this summer for the
Olympics. We

41:16.841 --> 41:19.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
already have a pandemic on our
hands. What
could happen?

41:19.944 --> 41:25.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Brazil is
the epicenter
of the mosquito-borne Zika
virus. In advance

41:25.283 --> 41:30.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Rio Games, Olympic
organizers and local
authorities have been spraying
facilities

41:30.288 --> 41:34.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and struggling to assure the
world that it
is safe for athletes and
tourists to come

41:34.892 --> 41:36.694 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

41:36.728 --> 41:40.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A group of international media,
which included
"PBS NewsHour," was invited to
film health

41:40.064 --> 41:45.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inspectors in Rio's Jacarepagua
neighborhood
last week. Mosquito eradication
measures like

41:45.136 --> 41:50.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these have been taking place
across the city.
At the local health clinic,
doctors told us

41:50.541 --> 41:53.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Zika is a much smaller
problem right
now.

41:53.711 --> 41:58.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIVIANE DOS SANTOS, Doctor
(through translator):
In the summer months, we had
more Zika cases,

41:58.149 --> 42:03.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because we have more mosquitoes.
We had around
10 cases per week. Now we have
seen a decline.

42:03.321 --> 42:07.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Currently, we have about one
case every 15
days, very little.

42:07.358 --> 42:10.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Even though
they are
called the Summer Games, they
will be taking

42:10.828 --> 42:16.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place in South America's winter,
which is
typically cooler with fewer
mosquitoes. One

42:16.401 --> 42:20.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
local resident told us that he's
actually
worried about what other
diseases tourists

42:20.371 --> 42:25.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and athletes could bring, as
Zika was actually
discovered in the forests of
Uganda.

42:25.443 --> 42:29.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Paulo Jozze (ph) thinks that
actually
the Brazilians are the victims
here. He points

42:29.914 --> 42:37.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out that the Zika virus actually
arrived in
Brazil from outside of the
country.

42:37.255 --> 42:42.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's the Zika virus that has
overshadowed
the run-up to the Olympics here;
234 scientists

42:42.860 --> 42:46.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and global health experts
recently wrote a
letter to the World Health
Organization calling

42:46.998 --> 42:53.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the Games in Rio to be
canceled, postponed
or even moved. "An unnecessary
risk is posed

42:53.070 --> 42:58.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when 500,000 foreign tourists
from all countries
attend the Games, potentially
acquire that

42:58.976 --> 43:04.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strain, and return home to
places where it
can become endemic," it read.

43:04.115 --> 43:08.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Rio's mayor, Eduardo Paes,
insisted that
the seasonal decrease in
mosquitoes would

43:08.786 --> 43:10.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
keep the epidemic at bay.

43:10.721 --> 43:12.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDUARDO PAES, Mayor of Rio de
Janeiro: This
will not be a problem for the
Games. Obviously,

43:12.523 --> 43:17.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you're a pregnant woman, you
need to take
more care of it. But come to
Rio. This will

43:17.728 --> 43:23.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not be a problem. I'm sure that,
in one year
time, if you come back here, we
will say,

43:23.100 --> 43:25.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OK, there was no Zika during Rio
Games.

43:25.903 --> 43:30.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Olympics
spokesman Mario
Andrada echoed that sentiment,
saying the

43:30.908 --> 43:34.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Olympic venues were undergoing
daily mosquito
inspections.

43:34.245 --> 43:40.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIO ANDRADA, Rio 2016: We are
100 percent
sure that our tourists, our
athletes, our

43:40.084 --> 43:44.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guests will be safe in Rio. And
we do the
best to protect them.

43:44.622 --> 43:49.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: The WHO has
agreed and
says there is no reason to move
the Games.

43:49.360 --> 43:53.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's issued a series of
guidelines for those
coming to Rio. They include
warnings to pregnant

43:53.998 --> 43:56.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
women and sexually active men.

43:56.968 --> 44:02.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More controversially, however,
the WHO initially
advised foreign tourists to
avoid visiting

44:02.607 --> 44:08.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impoverished and overcrowded
areas in cities
and towns with no piped water or
poor sanitation.

44:08.579 --> 44:11.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE AYLWARD, World Health
Organization:
It is in the poorer,
impoverished areas where

44:11.649 --> 44:18.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're more likely to find still
water or
stagnant water that has
collected rainwater

44:18.756 --> 44:24.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or whatever is being kept. It is
really just
looking at what factors help
drive the higher

44:24.795 --> 44:30.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
mosquito density, the
probability of getting
bitten by mosquitoes. And that
will be higher

44:30.234 --> 44:32.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in those areas.

44:32.103 --> 44:35.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: But some
experts disagree.
The threat of mosquitoes
breeding in dirty,

44:36.007 --> 44:41.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stagnant water is real. But the
Aedes aegypti
mosquito, which spreads Zika and
dengue, among

44:41.279 --> 44:44.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other diseases, likes to breed
next to clean
water.

44:44.849 --> 44:49.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brazilian biologist Claudia
Codeco is with
Brazil's largest scientific
research center.

44:49.787 --> 44:55.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She also says, in Rio, rich and
poor live
side by side and mosquitoes
don't respect

44:55.226 --> 44:57.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
class boundaries.

44:57.094 --> 45:03.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLAUDIA CODECO, Biologist: We
know from many
studies that these mosquitoes,
they can breed

45:03.167 --> 45:10.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in any type of environment. So
this is not
a particular problem of poor
areas. It can

45:10.808 --> 45:14.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actually breed in any type of
environment.

45:14.712 --> 45:19.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: The concern
among some
in Brazil is that telling people
disease and

45:19.417 --> 45:25.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the favelas are connected could
prove unnecessarily
harmful to poor and struggling
communities,

45:25.623 --> 45:28.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which are already stigmatized.

45:28.559 --> 45:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Peanut, our host in Rocinha, is
among those
worried. The sprawling informal
settlement

45:35.700 --> 45:40.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is the largest in Rio de
Janeiro, home to
tens of thousands of people. And
he was hoping

45:40.738 --> 45:43.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to introduce tourists to his
favela.

45:43.074 --> 45:48.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULO CESAR VIEIRA: People in
other countries
have totally bad information
about us. You

45:48.913 --> 45:54.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, it's important we take
them and they
see the reality of favela.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: And what is
the reality?

45:56.287 --> 45:58.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAULO CESAR VIEIRA: The reality
is the people.

45:58.356 --> 46:03.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Peanut
showed us an herb
called arruda, which has a
pungent smell.

46:03.694 --> 46:07.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He buys from local vendors and
wears it to
ward off the mosquitoes.

46:07.531 --> 46:12.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With regard to his tourism
business, he says
his hopes are not high. He
blames what he

46:12.269 --> 46:14.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
calls propaganda in the
international press.

46:14.872 --> 46:20.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULO CESAR VIEIRA: I hope many
tourists come.
But I don't believe it much,
because they

46:20.277 --> 46:28.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have very strong propaganda all
over the world:
Don't come to Rio. Don't come to
Colombia.

46:28.285 --> 46:30.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Don't come this -- don't come to
South America,
because they have Zika.

46:30.955 --> 46:34.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: He says his
own message
is very different.

46:34.325 --> 46:39.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULO CESAR VIEIRA: Come to the
Olympics.
Come to the favela. And have a
good time.

I know nothing bad will happen
with you.

46:44.669 --> 46:49.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: But not
everyone is so
sure, including those who have
dealt with

46:49.874 --> 46:53.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the virus' most harmful effects.

46:53.511 --> 46:58.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pollyana Rabello's son, Luis
Felipe, was born
with Zika-related microcephaly,
a condition

46:58.549 --> 47:03.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where children are born with
small heads because
the brain is underdeveloped. She
says many

47:03.254 --> 47:07.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mothers who've had children with
congenital
Zika syndrome in Brazil have
been getting

47:07.558 --> 47:11.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
little government financial or
medical help,
despite many promises.

47:11.629 --> 47:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POLLYANA RABELLO, Mother of
Child with Microcephaly
(through translator): If our
country is unable

47:15.499 --> 47:20.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support its own people, who are
Brazilians,
who pay taxes, why bring others
if you can't

47:20.538 --> 47:22.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even support these people?

47:22.606 --> 47:27.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Zika hasn't gone away. It is
here. And if
it happened to us, it can happen
to many more

47:27.812 --> 47:33.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people. I think the Games
shouldn't happen.
I think this money they are
investing in the

47:33.050 --> 47:36.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Olympics should be invested in
the health
and well-being of the Brazilian
population.

47:36.954 --> 47:42.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: A
desperately needed
investment in the lives of the
people, who

47:42.326 --> 47:46.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will still have to grapple with
Zika when
the Olympics are just a memory.

47:46.330 --> 47:51.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lulu
Garcia-Navarro
of NPR, Rio de Janeiro.

47:51.168 --> 47:55.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tune in
tomorrow, when we
hear from local residents on the
story behind

47:55.706 --> 48:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brazil's polluted waters, where
some Olympic
competition will take place.

48:03.447 --> 48:15.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another in
our Brief
But Spectacular series, where we
ask interesting

48:15.426 --> 48:18.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people to describe their
passions.

48:18.429 --> 48:25.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Comedian Negin Farsad describes
how she uses
comedy to fight bigotry. Her
latest book,

48:25.236 --> 48:28.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"How to Make White People
Laugh," was released
earlier this month.

48:28.739 --> 48:33.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEGIN FARSAD, Comedian: I'm an
Iranian-American
Muslim lady, and, as such,
growing up, I didn't

48:33.744 --> 48:35.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really have any icons to look up
to.

48:36.013 --> 48:40.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I yearned to be Mexican because
there were
so many Mexicans in our schools,
and they

48:40.251 --> 48:45.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had issues and icons like Cesar
Chavez, and
everyone could say their names
like Aralia

48:45.656 --> 48:47.057 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Rodrigo.

48:47.091 --> 48:51.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, with me, they just --
they were
just like, Megan, Megrime?

48:51.462 --> 49:03.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I grew up in Palm Springs,
California, and
Palm Springs is a really weird
place. It's

49:03.307 --> 49:08.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
simultaneously like one of the
top five retirement
communities and also one of the
top five gay

49:08.412 --> 49:11.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cities in California. It's the
kind of place
where you will see people
dancing to Lady

49:11.916 --> 49:14.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gaga while adjusting their
catheters.

49:14.518 --> 49:19.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the main problems of
being a Muz in
today's world is that people
immediately conflate

49:19.790 --> 49:26.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that with terrorism and
violence. I'm like
5'3-and-a-half, and I dress like
a cartoon

49:26.330 --> 49:28.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
character.

49:28.199 --> 49:32.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I ended up getting a
master's degree in
African-American studies. I was
the only non-black

49:32.036 --> 49:37.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person in the department. The
purple represents
all the black students, and then
the non-purple

49:37.775 --> 49:41.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part is the me. People were sort
of like,
it's weird that -- don't you
have your own

49:41.478 --> 49:43.314 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people?

49:43.347 --> 49:46.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would be like, how could
you say that?
I will fight for
African-American rights whenever

49:46.750 --> 49:51.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and wherever. I have a DVD box
set of "A Different
World" on my backpack. I'm about
to change

49:51.922 --> 49:54.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my name to Tyler Perry Presents
Negin Farsad.

49:54.158 --> 49:58.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a certain point, I sort of
realized, you
know -- and this is well after
9/11 -- that

49:58.696 --> 50:03.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like I do have my own people.
Islamophobia
is on the rise. And there's
actually something

50:03.901 --> 50:08.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can do about it, comedy but
about stuff
that mattered and had some kind
of social

50:08.239 --> 50:10.174 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
impact.

50:10.207 --> 50:13.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wrote a musical called "The
Israeli Palestinian
Conflict: A Romantic Comedy." I
made a feature

50:13.744 --> 50:17.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
documentary comedy called "The
Muslims Are
Coming." I basically rounded up
a bunch of

50:17.982 --> 50:23.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muslim-American comedians in a
nonviolent
way, and we went around the
country to places

50:23.187 --> 50:28.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like Tennessee and Alabama and
Georgia, and
places where they love the
Muzzies. And we

50:28.659 --> 50:30.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
did these stand-up shows.

50:30.527 --> 50:34.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"How to Make White People Laugh"
is a memoir
meets social justice comedy
manifesto. I talk

50:35.032 --> 50:40.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about being Iranian. I talk
about Islamophobia.
I talk about xenophobia. I talk
about being

50:40.070 --> 50:44.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a brown lady dating online.
There are some
really earth-shattering chapters
in it, like

50:44.241 --> 50:47.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the one called "Immigrants Spit
Out More Patriotic
Babies."

50:47.645 --> 50:54.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My parents are immigrants, and
they raised,
like, an uber-dorky patriot who
had a giant

50:54.184 --> 51:00.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American flag in her bedroom all
growing up.
That's how in love with the
country I was

51:00.257 --> 51:01.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
raised to be.

51:01.992 --> 51:05.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I feel like, every time I
take the stage,
I have to announce to everybody,
hey, I'm

51:05.562 --> 51:10.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an Iranian-American Muslim
female, like all
of you, and just to calm people
down that,

51:10.334 --> 51:16.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like, I know that you know that
this is not
the normal package for a
comedian, and it's

51:16.707 --> 51:18.509 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to be OK.

51:18.542 --> 51:23.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Negin Farsad, and
this is my Brief
But Spectacular take on being an
Iranian-American

51:23.981 --> 51:25.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Muslim female comedian lady.

51:25.683 --> 51:27.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She's a winner.

51:27.818 --> 51:30.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: She's got
enough adjectives
at the end there, yes.

51:31.021 --> 51:32.790 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:32.823 --> 51:34.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Also online, a new computer
algorithm may
help stop terrorist attacks. By
charting pro-ISIS

51:44.969 --> 51:51.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
groups on social media,
scientists found it
might be possible to predict
real-life risks,

51:51.642 --> 51:53.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even without explicit messages.

51:53.177 --> 51:56.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
