GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:07.374 --> 00:12.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: old
drugs with
new prices. What's behind sudden
price hikes

00:12.546 --> 00:14.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on prescription drugs?

00:14.715 --> 00:19.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: a hidden gift for
the nation's
bridges and roads buried in this
year's massive

00:19.953 --> 00:25.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
congressional package -- how
lawmakers got
to yes after years of no.

00:25.058 --> 00:31.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, in the footsteps of our
ancestors: an
encore look at one journalist's
walk around

00:31.198 --> 00:34.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the world to uncover man's
prehistoric journey.

00:34.101 --> 00:38.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK, Fellow, National
Geographic:
Walking has shown me that the
boundaries between

00:38.038 --> 00:43.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stories are permeable, in that
one story bleeds
into another, because human life
bleeds into

00:43.543 --> 00:45.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
each other because human life
bleeds into
each other.

00:45.312 --> 00:50.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And it's Friday.
Mark Shields
and Michael Gerson analyze the
week's news.

00:50.517 --> 00:58.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All that and more on this
Christmas edition
of the "PBS NewsHour."

00:58.659 --> 01:01.595 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:01.628 --> 01:12.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Christmas Day 2015
brought fresh
appeals for an end to terror and
a new focus

01:12.639 --> 01:18.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on peace. The theme dominated
annual messages
from various world leaders,
starting at the

01:18.612 --> 01:20.314 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Vatican.

01:20.347 --> 01:27.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Cheers erupted from the
thousands in sunny
St. Peter's Square, as the pope
emerged to

01:27.187 --> 01:32.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deliver his Christmas message.
In it, he spoke
out against atrocities by
radical Islamists.

01:33.026 --> 01:37.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through
translator): My thoughts also
turn to those

01:37.331 --> 01:42.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
affected by brutal acts of
terrorism, particularly
the recent massacres which took
place in Egyptian

01:42.369 --> 01:45.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
airspace, in Beirut, Paris,
Bamako, and Tunis.

01:45.806 --> 01:51.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Francis didn't
directly name the
Islamic State group, but he did
urge world

01:51.478 --> 01:58.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders to focus on Syria, Libya
and elsewhere.
He also praised countries who've
taken in

01:58.218 --> 02:04.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugees fleeing the violence.
Some of those
refugees spent their Christmas
in a camp in

02:04.424 --> 02:09.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Calais, France, where they have
waited for
months, hoping to get to
Britain.

02:09.396 --> 02:14.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Across the channel, Queen
Elizabeth took note
of the hardships suffered by
many in her annual

02:14.568 --> 02:16.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
holiday message.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUEEN ELIZABETH II, United
Kingdom: There's
an old saying that it is better
to light a

02:18.972 --> 02:25.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candle than curse the darkness.
There are
millions of people lighting
candles of hope

02:25.779 --> 02:27.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in our world today.

02:27.714 --> 02:32.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Again this year,
American troops
spent Christmas in Afghanistan
and other far-flung

02:32.386 --> 02:34.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
outposts, including Kuwait.

02:34.187 --> 02:36.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAJ. GEN. WILLIAM HICKMAN, U.S.
Army: Many
of these soldiers have had to
deploy multiple

02:36.289 --> 02:40.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
times during the Christmas
holidays and other
holidays, so, again, we just
want to thank

02:40.293 --> 02:44.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them for their service, and
really tell them
we appreciate what they do for
our Army and

02:44.831 --> 02:46.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really for our nation.

02:46.633 --> 02:50.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: President and Mrs.
Obama also
paid tribute to the troops in
their pre-taped

02:50.470 --> 02:54.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
holiday message, and they urged
Americans
to come together as one family.

02:54.908 --> 02:58.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Caring for those on society's
margins, the

02:58.912 --> 03:06.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sick and the hungry, the poor
and the persecuted,
the stranger in need of shelter,
or simply

03:06.453 --> 03:11.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an act of kindness, that's the
spirit that
binds us together, not just as
Christians,

03:11.525 --> 03:13.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but as Americans of all faiths.

03:13.326 --> 03:18.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Obamas are
spending their
holidays in Hawaii again this
year, hiking,

03:18.465 --> 03:21.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
golfing and seeing friends.

03:21.201 --> 03:27.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a far more somber day for
tornado victims
across the South. At least 14
are now confirmed

03:27.040 --> 03:32.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dead in Wednesday's storms. The
same weather
system also brought flood
warnings in several

03:32.212 --> 03:37.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states today, and much of the
East Coast saw
record warmth again with
readings 20 degrees

03:37.617 --> 03:39.486 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
above normal.

03:39.519 --> 03:43.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Britain, the government
called a rare holiday
cabinet meeting to deal with
record flooding

03:43.423 --> 03:49.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Northern England. The British
army has
been deployed to build
barricades in Cumbria.

03:49.396 --> 03:55.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That area has already seen the
wettest December
since records began in 1910.

03:55.535 --> 04:01.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A world away, the problem is
fire. Raging
bushfires in Australia destroyed
more than

04:01.308 --> 04:06.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
50 homes southwest of Melbourne
and forced
hundreds of people to evacuate.
The fires

04:06.446 --> 04:11.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were burning near a popular
tourist attraction,
the Great Ocean Road. Witnesses
said some

04:11.952 --> 04:15.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people had to flee Christmas
celebrations
on a moment's notice.

04:15.722 --> 04:19.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK CAREY, Australia: They
were all prepared,
putting their barbecues on. They
were cooking

04:19.626 --> 04:23.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
away. And, all of a sudden, they
could see
the smoke coming over the hill.
They thought

04:23.330 --> 04:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was still four hours away,
according to
what they'd heard. And then, all
of a sudden,

04:26.766 --> 04:30.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was an hour away, and, all of
a sudden,
it was half-an-hour away. So,
they just dropped

04:30.203 --> 04:33.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everything, stopped cooking and
hopped in
their car and headed here.

04:33.340 --> 04:38.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Crews are using
water-bombing
aircraft and 60 fire engines to
battle the

04:38.979 --> 04:43.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flames. But officials say it
could take some
time to make progress.

04:43.216 --> 04:48.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tragedy struck in Nigeria last
night. An explosion
at a gas plant killed dozens of
people as

04:48.889 --> 04:54.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they lined up to buy butane gas.
One reporter
said he saw about a hundred
bodies. Officials

04:54.561 --> 05:00.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say a truck was discharging gas
at the facility
when it exploded. The blast
touched off a

05:00.066 --> 05:05.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fire that raged for hours before
it was finally
doused.

05:05.205 --> 05:09.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's another sign of
potential warming
between India and Pakistan,
after decades

05:09.843 --> 05:15.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of war and tension. Indian Prime
Minister
Narendra Modi made a surprise
visit to Pakistan

05:15.749 --> 05:21.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. He met with Pakistani
Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, and aides said
they discussed

05:21.087 --> 05:27.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the disputed Kashmir region. The
two also
met at the climate change talks
in Paris this

05:27.527 --> 05:29.396 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
month.

05:29.429 --> 05:34.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And an apology today from a
British astronaut
for an errant phone call. Tim
Peake misdialed

05:34.868 --> 05:39.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a Christmas greeting from the
International
Space Station. Later, he
tweeted: "I would

05:39.873 --> 05:45.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like to apologize to the lady I
just called,
saying, hello, is this planet
Earth? Not a

05:45.245 --> 05:47.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
prank call, just a wrong
number."

05:47.113 --> 05:53.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
why some
drug prices suddenly spike; the
man who's

05:53.753 --> 05:59.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
walking around the world; what
the highway
bill means for the nation's
roads and bridges;

05:59.726 --> 06:05.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and Michael Gerson
on this week's
news; and the hit musical about
the founding

06:05.232 --> 06:17.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
father you forgot about.

06:17.877 --> 06:23.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We now turn to a
story that continues
to worry and to anger consumers,
soaring drug

06:23.717 --> 06:28.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prices, even sometimes for new
versions of
old drugs.

06:28.088 --> 06:34.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The latest case involves a drug
that helps
treat a rare autoimmune
disorder. Until recently,

06:34.294 --> 06:40.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its manufacturer often offered
it at minimal
or no cost at all. But now
another pharmaceutical

06:40.967 --> 06:47.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
company, Catalyst, says it wants
the FDA to
approve a modified, and likely
more expensive,

06:47.474 --> 06:49.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
version of the drug.

06:49.276 --> 06:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I recorded this conversation
yesterday with
reporter Sabrina Tavernise of
The New York

06:54.214 --> 06:55.949 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Times.

06:55.982 --> 06:59.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sabrina, I'm going to start out
by asking
you to define something that
most people have

06:59.519 --> 07:02.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
never heard of. That is orphan
drugs. What
are those?

07:02.422 --> 07:06.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SABRINA TAVERNISE, The New York
Times: The
orphan drugs, this is a law that
was passed

07:06.960 --> 07:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the early 1980s to try to
stimulate development
of drugs for rare diseases.

07:12.966 --> 07:19.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it was specifically meant to
get drug
companies to come up with new
ideas and new

07:19.172 --> 07:24.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inventions for small populations
of patients
that wouldn't otherwise have
been profitable,

07:24.077 --> 07:30.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so it gave some advantages to
companies that
wanted to -- that agreed to
develop these

07:30.116 --> 07:31.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
drugs.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And so now what you
see is that
some of these companies, some
companies are

07:34.788 --> 07:40.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
repurposing some of these old
drugs that were
created under this -- with this
protection

07:40.093 --> 07:42.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
under this umbrella for profit?

07:42.095 --> 07:45.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SABRINA TAVERNISE: So,
essentially, what's
happened, Gwen, is that the --
that companies

07:45.832 --> 07:52.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are sort of scouting around in
the landscape
looking for older drugs to get
approved under

07:52.305 --> 07:57.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this law, so, essentially, not
really doing
any development work, not really
doing any

07:57.410 --> 08:03.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the hard, you know, invention
required
to come up with something new,
taking something

08:03.149 --> 08:07.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was old that was already on
the market
and getting it approved, getting
it special

08:07.087 --> 08:08.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
status under this law.

08:08.922 --> 08:12.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that gets them seven
years of market
monopoly, which is actually a
very, very long

08:12.826 --> 08:14.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
period of time for the drug
industry.

08:14.828 --> 08:19.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You wrote in The New
York Times
about a particular drug that was
designed

08:19.566 --> 08:25.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to help patients suffering from
Lambert-Eaton
myasthenic syndrome.

08:25.238 --> 08:29.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tell us about that drug and
about how that
fits into what we're talking
about here.

08:29.142 --> 08:33.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SABRINA TAVERNISE: So, the drug
-- so it's
for a neuromuscular disorder.
People who have

08:33.413 --> 08:38.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the disease have trouble
walking. Many are
confined to beds or wheelchairs.
The drug

08:38.685 --> 08:41.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is (AUDIO GAP) quite old.

08:41.421 --> 08:48.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The original work that was put
into developing
it happened in the U.K. And the
earliest traces

08:48.695 --> 08:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I could find of it were in
France and Scotland
in the 1970s.

08:52.899 --> 08:59.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, essentially, what's
happened is, the
drug has been effectively given
away for free

08:59.272 --> 09:06.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to patients since the early
1990s by sort
of an unusual drug company, a
little family-owned

09:06.346 --> 09:12.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drug company in New Jersey
called Jacobus.
That was the situation for many
years.

09:12.952 --> 09:18.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what has happened is that a
publicly traded
company, you know, a Wall
Street-traded company,

09:18.725 --> 09:25.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has sort of swept in and seen
that the drug
didn't have FDA approval and
decided to get

09:25.432 --> 09:33.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it approved under this special
law, so basically
kind of racing to approval and
essentially

09:33.139 --> 09:37.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking the drug off the market
for patients
that currently are getting it
for free, and

09:37.710 --> 09:41.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
starting to charge what most
market analysts
think will probably be about
$100,000 a year.

09:41.614 --> 09:43.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Exorbitant costs.

09:43.550 --> 09:49.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, who controls this? I know
this is the
FDA, but maybe it is also the
market. Maybe

09:49.489 --> 09:52.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these drug companies have the
right to charge
what the market will bear?

09:52.926 --> 09:55.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SABRINA TAVERNISE: So, Gwen,
this is a really
good question. And this sort of
gets to the

09:55.762 --> 09:57.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
crux of it.

09:57.697 --> 10:02.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, effectively, they do.
It's not illegal.
The FDA, when it decides how --
when it decides

10:02.302 --> 10:07.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what drugs to approve, doesn't
look at price.
That's not something that it
considers. It's

10:07.407 --> 10:09.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not -- it never has.

10:09.709 --> 10:15.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, effectively, the United
States is really
the only rich country in the
developed world

10:15.682 --> 10:19.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that doesn't have any -- where
the government
has no control over drug
pricing, none.

10:19.419 --> 10:26.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a vulnerability in
our system
that, effectively, companies
that are really,

10:26.459 --> 10:31.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really out to get very, very
high profits
for their stockholders have
taken advantage

10:31.965 --> 10:33.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, it becomes out
of the good
of the company's heart if they
want to guarantee

10:36.469 --> 10:39.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
access for people who need this
medication.

10:39.472 --> 10:44.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SABRINA TAVERNISE: So,
essentially, what the
companies have done is that they
agree that,

10:44.711 --> 10:49.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when a person is uninsured or if
the person's
insurance company won't cover
the drug, the

10:49.949 --> 10:55.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
company has what they call a
financial assistance
plan that will help essentially
apply for

10:55.755 --> 11:00.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
various subsidies, rebates. And
often the
company often kind of chips in
some money

11:00.927 --> 11:03.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to help patients pay for these
things.

11:03.396 --> 11:08.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, for the most part,
insurance companies
do pay for the drugs,
particularly under the

11:08.301 --> 11:13.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Orphan Drug Act. The populations
are fairly
small. The prices are exorbitant
but the insurance

11:13.606 --> 11:17.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
companies say, OK, well, there
are not that
many people, so we will cover
this.

11:17.477 --> 11:22.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what economists say is that
this comes
out in everybody's premiums and
in everybody's

11:22.749 --> 11:28.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care costs. The price of
having insurance
has gone up and up and up. And
why is that?

11:28.655 --> 11:33.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is part of what's going on.
It's part
of the dynamic of rising costs
in health care

11:33.493 --> 11:35.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the United States.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is there any way of
knowing how
widespread this is? I know it
shows up in

11:37.897 --> 11:42.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our premiums, but is it also
that if you put
together all these different
orphan drugs,

11:42.201 --> 11:45.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you actually end up with quite a
population
of affected people?

11:45.305 --> 11:48.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SABRINA TAVERNISE: Well, some of
the kind
of gaming of the system that
drug companies

11:49.008 --> 11:54.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been doing under this act
is, they will
take a broader disease, say,
breast cancer,

11:54.280 --> 12:01.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and slice it into narrow
definitions of smaller,
smaller kind of subsets of that
disease.

12:01.854 --> 12:06.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then they can qualify for orphan
drug status,
when, in fact, the population is
much larger.

12:06.960 --> 12:11.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another example has been a drug
that's been
approved for some other
treatment that they

12:11.097 --> 12:16.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to just sort of extend
their monopoly
on. And they under the act get
it approved

12:16.603 --> 12:21.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for some -- for a new treatment,
but, effectively,
it's the same drug. There's no
new research

12:21.808 --> 12:25.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has gone into it, no new
work, no new
invention. It's just sort of a
repackaging.

12:25.478 --> 12:28.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, these are some of the ways
that the law
has been abused.

12:28.114 --> 12:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Many, many ways to
get to the
same end, which is a profit.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sabrina Tavernise, thank you
very much.

12:34.921 --> 12:42.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SABRINA TAVERNISE: Thank you so
much.

12:42.095 --> 12:48.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It is a journey of a
lifetime.

12:48.067 --> 12:54.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Journalist Paul Salopek spent
his career covering
the news overseas and jetting
around the globe,

12:54.574 --> 13:00.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until he realized that walking
around the
world might provide deeper
insight.

13:00.246 --> 13:05.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Earlier this year, Hari
Sreenivasan traveled
to the Republic of Georgia to
take a stroll

13:05.251 --> 13:07.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Salopek.

13:07.086 --> 13:11.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was such a memorable walk
that we decided
it was worth showing it to you
again tonight.

13:11.958 --> 13:16.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK, Fellow, National
Geographic:
There is something not in your
brain, but

13:16.429 --> 13:21.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost in your backbone, about
the rhythm
of walking, this A/B, A/B. It's
the pace of

13:21.934 --> 13:23.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a heartbeat.

13:23.870 --> 13:29.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On a high
country cool morning,
Paul Salopek is out for a walk.
But his walk

13:29.409 --> 13:36.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is unlike any you or I might
take. On this
morning, he is nearing mile
4,000 of a trek

13:36.482 --> 13:42.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that began in January 2013 in
Ethiopia's Great
Rift Valley, the wellspring of
ancient humankind.

13:42.955 --> 13:47.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: This whole project
is about
two things. It's about the past
and the future.

13:47.593 --> 13:52.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the past element is
following our first
ancestors who spread out of
Africa during

13:52.098 --> 13:57.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Stone Age, so, following the
footsteps
of some very old and intrepid
pioneers.

13:57.804 --> 14:02.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He calls this
project the
Out of Eden Walk, and he will
end it some

14:02.709 --> 14:10.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time in six or seven years at
the very southern
tip of South America, after
logging 21,000

14:10.783 --> 14:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
miles. That's about 30 million
footsteps,
for those of you counting yours
every day.

14:16.789 --> 14:20.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The two-time Pulitzer
Prize-winning foreign
correspondent was used to
dropping into war

14:21.027 --> 14:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
zones and driving his way out as
fast as possible.
But so far on this trip, he's
walked through

14:27.567 --> 14:34.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of the conflict zones of
the Middle East,
now on an assignment that is his
lifetime.

14:34.474 --> 14:38.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With support from the National
Geographic
Society, the Nieman and Knight
Foundations

14:38.544 --> 14:42.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and others, he has walked across
deserts and
mountains.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.083 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, why do this?

14:44.117 --> 14:51.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: There has got to
be a space
to slow down, analyze and absorb
more meaningful

14:51.424 --> 14:55.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
information. I don't think we
need more information.
I think we need more meaning.

14:55.394 --> 15:01.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What kind of
context are
you able to get when you are
walking vs. when

15:01.901 --> 15:04.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we get there in cars and planes
and trains?

15:04.370 --> 15:09.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Walking has shown
me that the
boundaries between stories are
permeable,

15:09.142 --> 15:14.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that one story bleeds into
another, because
human life bleeds into each
other. And so

15:14.580 --> 15:18.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
walking between stories shows me
connections
that didn't -- I didn't used to
see when I

15:19.018 --> 15:20.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would parachute in.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And what are
we saying?
What is humanity telling you?

15:22.488 --> 15:26.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: The same stories
over and over
again. It's the same classic
stories of complaint,

15:26.526 --> 15:34.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of joy, of aspiration, of hope,
of hopes dashed.
And I never get tired of them.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We caught up
with him in
Southern Georgia's Caucasus
Mountains, near

15:37.737 --> 15:43.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Armenia, where the walk was
stopped late last
fall at this destroyed
Soviet-era building.

15:43.409 --> 15:48.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Last November, we
had just crossed
the Turkish border, and it was
very bad weather.

15:48.080 --> 15:53.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was snowing, it was sleeting,
very cold
both during the day and at
night. We came

15:53.452 --> 15:59.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down, and with frozen feet had
to break through
a frozen river, plunging in up
to our thighs.

15:59.358 --> 16:01.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we were very afraid of
hypothermia.

16:01.928 --> 16:06.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Salopek and
three walking
partners found this "Spotlight".
One man set

16:06.399 --> 16:09.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his gloves alight to start a
fire and stay
warm.

16:09.602 --> 16:15.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: On a November
night a year ago,
this was heaven. This was better
than a five-star

16:15.675 --> 16:17.510 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hotel.

16:17.543 --> 16:21.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Then he waited
here in Tbilisi,
the capital of Georgia, for a
lot longer than

16:21.280 --> 16:26.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he planned. He was stuck in what
he calls
a geopolitically-induced storm,
waiting for

16:26.319 --> 16:29.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visas that would determine the
rest of his
route.

16:29.088 --> 16:33.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A hundred thousand years ago,
the problems
were different here, in this
land littered

16:33.359 --> 16:35.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with volcanic boulders from
ancient eruptions.

16:35.828 --> 16:40.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SALOPEK: When our
ancestors, the first
people who walked out of Africa,
passed through

16:40.833 --> 16:47.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this region, their big obstacles
were glaciers
and big animals that would eat
them or droughts

16:47.340 --> 16:53.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or famines. Today, mine is these
ethnic fault
lines and these imaginary walls,
these imaginary

16:53.980 --> 16:59.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
glaciers called borders. And
they have knocked
me sideways, way off my intended
track.

16:59.352 --> 17:03.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Months of
back-and-forth
talks with regional governments
made it clear

17:03.656 --> 17:09.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that his original plan to walk
across Iran
and points east wouldn't work.

17:09.095 --> 17:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally, he set a route from
Georgia that
will pass through Azerbaijan, on
to Kazakstan

17:14.133 --> 17:15.935 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and beyond.

17:15.968 --> 17:19.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: This doesn't look
like much,
but this ruin on the high
plateau of Southern

17:19.705 --> 17:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Georgia is the beginning of
phase two of the
Out of Eden Walk. So, this is
the gateway

17:25.344 --> 17:29.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Orient for me. From here,
I'm leaving
the Caucasus, going on the old
silk roads

17:29.181 --> 17:31.017 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to China.

17:31.050 --> 17:35.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So at
mid-morning on October
20, Salopek set out, with the
world revealed

17:35.688 --> 17:42.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before him one step after the
other, on this
day up to a mountain pass at
more than 9,000

17:42.461 --> 17:44.263 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
feet.

17:44.297 --> 17:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Down the other side, Salopek and
his walking
partner spent the night in the
small village

17:47.633 --> 17:53.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Mamishlari, a village of
ethnic Azeris
from Azerbaijan. They were taken
in by the

17:53.606 --> 18:00.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nasibov family; 72-year-old
Ziaudoin and his
70-year-old wife, Azmat (ph),
married as teenagers.

18:00.746 --> 18:04.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is a tough farm life, on the
edge, really,
of civilization.

18:04.116 --> 18:08.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: We came around the
corner of
this mountain river and here was
this village

18:08.888 --> 18:10.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we didn't even know
existed.

18:10.756 --> 18:14.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The first reaction was
curiosity. When I finally
told him, well, actually, I have
hiked all

18:14.460 --> 18:18.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the way from Africa, that was
the surprise
moment, and there was laughter
around that

18:18.397 --> 18:24.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
table. And there was a lively
exchange about,
oh, you have got to be crazy.

18:24.070 --> 18:28.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ZIAUDOIN NASIBOV, Farmer
(through translator):
I don't think he is crazy. I
actually thought

18:28.174 --> 18:31.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was quite enlightened,
because they actually
want to walk across the world
and see what's

18:31.844 --> 18:36.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out there. You might not notice
a place, but
when you walk by on foot, you
see it, and

18:36.549 --> 18:39.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
appreciate it for what it
actually is.

18:39.051 --> 18:45.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Ziaud also has
basically joined
the walk because he showed us
the way.

18:45.358 --> 18:50.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All along his
route, Salopek
has been joined by walking
partners, who function

18:50.663 --> 18:57.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as guides, translators and
companions. In
Georgia, that partner was Dima
Bit-Suleiman.

18:57.303 --> 19:01.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is the reaction of most of
the people
you bump into when you tell them
what he's

19:01.040 --> 19:02.808 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doing?

19:02.842 --> 19:05.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIMA BIT-SULEIMAN, Guide: They
go like, yes,
yes, yes, coming from Africa. On
walk? What

19:05.778 --> 19:06.912 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do you mean?

19:06.946 --> 19:08.748 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:08.781 --> 19:11.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIMA BIT-SULEIMAN: That's like,
usually, they
kind of don't believe and they
say, why is

19:11.817 --> 19:14.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he doing it? What is he trying
to find out?

19:14.186 --> 19:18.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about
when they figure
out that he is trying to go to
the end of

19:18.190 --> 19:19.925 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world?

19:19.959 --> 19:22.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIMA BIT-SULEIMAN: And then it's
even worse.
And then they really ask, like,
what is he

19:22.228 --> 19:22.962 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
searching for?

19:22.995 --> 19:23.529 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:23.562 --> 19:25.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

19:25.297 --> 19:28.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIMA BIT-SULEIMAN: Like, why is
he doing that?
I don't think there is an easy
answer.

19:28.968 --> 19:33.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: After passing
through boggy
lowlands, where horsemen emerged
from fairy

19:33.539 --> 19:38.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tale fogs, Salopek arrived at a
village, Ipnari.

19:38.210 --> 19:47.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Largely abandoned, it revealed a
much deeper
history, nearby, a Bronze Age
wine store,

19:47.153 --> 19:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
5,000-year-old fermentation vats
sunken in
the ground.

19:49.388 --> 19:53.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: You're talking
about the beginning
of civilization. Georgians were
already drinking.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:55.628 --> 20:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: The walk has
opened up the vista
to me in both space and time,
where I can

20:00.699 --> 20:04.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see the connections between all
of these stories
and I see how history informs
everything that's

20:04.904 --> 20:08.641 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happening today.

20:08.674 --> 20:14.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Time pools in certain valleys,
and it runs
like a river through certain
canyon systems,

20:14.113 --> 20:18.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certain plains. And every step
you take could
be in a different era. And so
here we are

20:18.751 --> 20:25.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming up to another one, and I
think that
the task now is to kind of go
slowly.

20:25.491 --> 20:30.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But, for now,
his steps
were taking him toward the
village of Boslebi,

20:30.229 --> 20:35.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Georgia. And as the evening
gathered, Salopek
explained one mind-boggling
facet of this

20:35.634 --> 20:37.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
grand experiment.

20:37.870 --> 20:42.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More often than not, when he
sets out each
morning, he has little idea
where he will

20:42.775 --> 20:44.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sleep that night.

20:44.543 --> 20:47.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: We're going to
draw attention,
obviously, and just start
greeting people

20:47.880 --> 20:49.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and start striking up
conversations.

20:49.748 --> 20:55.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And it is this
exact moment,
first contact in a village, that
Salopek was

20:55.654 --> 21:00.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hesitant to have us film up
close. It's hard
making a first impression with a
camera crew

21:00.993 --> 21:02.795 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in tow.

21:02.828 --> 21:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This day, five minutes after
this scene and
after meeting two other people
in town, they

21:08.033 --> 21:10.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
both had a place to stay for the
night.

21:10.402 --> 21:13.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't plan out every step of
the way,
so to speak.

21:13.973 --> 21:17.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Yes, it's hard to
explain to
readers who think that I have
got a team back

21:17.209 --> 21:23.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the States with a big map
with blinking
lights and computers plotting
out my route.

21:23.482 --> 21:29.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would laugh if they saw how
seat-of-the-pants
this is. This is truly sort of
strolling across

21:29.221 --> 21:35.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world, and seeing how far I
get before
nightfall and then looking for
shelter. The

21:35.127 --> 21:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world is, by and large, a
hospitable place.

21:39.165 --> 21:42.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Merab, this is my friend Hari
from the United
States.

21:42.902 --> 21:43.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:43.869 --> 21:45.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Hari. Pleased
to meet you.

21:45.704 --> 21:50.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paul introduced me to his host
for the night
before I arrived, Merab
Saaladze, a retired

21:50.042 --> 21:53.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deputy governor of the local
municipality.

21:53.045 --> 21:56.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You just invited him into your
home. He's
a total stranger.

21:56.382 --> 22:00.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MERAB SAALADZE, Georgia (through
translator):
I asked him who he was, and he
said he was

22:00.519 --> 22:03.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the U.S., so I immediately
invited them
in.

22:03.055 --> 22:08.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is it common
to be this
hospitable, to take in a
stranger?

22:08.360 --> 22:11.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MERAB SAALADZE: To me, it was
the first time.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.399 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:13.432 --> 22:17.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: After tea and
a bit more
conversation, we set out for the
next waypoint,

22:17.136 --> 22:22.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ancient village of Dmanisi
about six miles
away, which we will tell you
more about in

22:22.308 --> 22:24.043 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our next story.

22:24.076 --> 22:28.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: So, basically, there is no
shortcut.
Merab said, well, yes, you have
to cross the

22:28.647 --> 22:29.048 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
river.

22:29.081 --> 22:29.548 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:29.582 --> 22:31.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SALOPEK: OK.

22:31.417 --> 22:36.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But, as we
soon found out,
even the most precise directions
need updating,

22:36.488 --> 22:44.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which we were given by a man
with hands stained
from a lifetime of gathering
walnuts.

22:44.263 --> 22:47.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that, says Salopek, is just
part of the
plan.

22:47.333 --> 22:52.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got GPS, you have got
maps, you have
got guides. You are still going
the wrong

22:52.204 --> 22:53.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
way sometimes.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SALOPEK: Yes.

22:54.873 --> 22:59.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Being found is overrated. Being
a little lost
is good, because it keeps you
alert, keeps

22:59.278 --> 23:03.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you looking around. It keeps you
scanning
the horizons about to find your
bearings,

23:03.816 --> 23:06.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and you are not sleepwalking
through the world.

23:06.218 --> 23:10.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, how many
pairs of shoes
do you think you have gone
through?

23:10.322 --> 23:16.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: This is the
fourth. Somebody
brought me these from the
States, so they're

23:16.228 --> 23:17.997 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
kind of special.

23:18.030 --> 23:24.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Do you get
tired by the
end of an average day, or has
your body gotten

23:24.036 --> 23:25.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
used to this hiking pace?

23:25.404 --> 23:27.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SALOPEK: I do.

23:27.239 --> 23:31.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It depends on my physical
condition. You know,
look, the walk has kind of
turned into my

23:31.076 --> 23:36.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life, so it's a complicated
question to answer.
It's like you -- you have good
weeks and bad

23:36.849 --> 23:37.383 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weeks.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

23:38.517 --> 23:39.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: I think I'm in
pretty good condition.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

23:40.886 --> 23:44.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: But I get tired,
and "my job"
-- in quotes -- is to write, not
just really

23:44.590 --> 23:50.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to walk. So, at the end of the
day, it takes
a special effort to sit down and
write a story.

23:50.329 --> 23:53.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My project, to walk across the
world for seven
years.

23:53.732 --> 23:57.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Those stories,
dispatches
from this ambling Eden, are
being followed

23:57.870 --> 24:01.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
online by a growing group of
digital companions.

24:01.307 --> 24:08.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Young people in particular,
students, catch
up with Salopek along the way.
The tools of

24:08.080 --> 24:13.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the trade are the heaviest thing
he carries
in his backpack: a laptop,
cameras, notebooks

24:13.852 --> 24:19.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and not more than a single
change of clothes.
He stops every 100 miles to
record a milestone,

24:20.025 --> 24:25.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a panoramic photo in this case
that includes
an exhausted "NewsHour" crew and
a wayward

24:25.497 --> 24:30.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pig, then some video, and a
brief interview
with the nearest person.

24:30.402 --> 24:37.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This one, number 29, after 2,800
air miles
traveled, came outside a truck
driver's house

24:37.509 --> 24:43.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
near a Georgian mining town. And
after a few
questions and a handshake,
Salopek is again

24:43.816 --> 24:46.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on his way, the rhythm restored.

24:46.852 --> 24:49.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What makes a human want to go
over the next
ridge?

24:49.588 --> 24:53.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Ah, the eternal
question, the
one that probably doesn't have a
rational

24:53.792 --> 24:55.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
answer through science.

24:55.861 --> 25:01.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The walk is part of that
exploration, the
impulse, not even rational to
know what's

25:01.967 --> 25:06.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the mountain. Why -- why
paddle into
the sea? We have set out again
and again,

25:06.405 --> 25:11.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and nobody came back, and yet we
still set
out. And one scientist,
geneticist said, we're

25:11.210 --> 25:13.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just crazy.

25:13.178 --> 25:18.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that magical,
wonderful craziness
is part of the joy of this
project. It's something

25:18.784 --> 25:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that also binds us together.

25:20.452 --> 25:24.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour,"
I'm Hari Sreenivasan in Southern
Georgia.

25:24.523 --> 25:30.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: After leaving
Georgia, Paul Salopek
traveled through Azerbaijan, the
10th country

25:30.562 --> 25:40.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's crossed, and will soon
continue his walk
across Central Asia on that silk
road to China.

25:40.606 --> 25:48.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's crossed, and will soon
continue his walk
across Central Asia on that silk
road to China.

25:48.914 --> 25:53.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That trip over the river and
through the woods
might go a little more smoothly
in future

25:53.786 --> 25:59.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, thanks to the big highway
bill that
became law this month. It is the
largest deal

25:59.091 --> 26:00.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of its kind in a decade.

26:00.993 --> 26:07.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as political director Lisa
Desjardins
reports, it's attracting both
cheers and concern.

26:07.099 --> 26:12.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The scope of
this highway
bill is vast, over $300 billion
that will

26:12.638 --> 26:18.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
touch roads and bridges in every
state and
most counties for half-a-decade,
a dramatic

26:18.977 --> 26:22.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
law that hits very familiar
places to Americans.

26:22.381 --> 26:25.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANS RIEMER, Montgomery County,
Maryland,
Councilman: Behind me is one of
the most congested

26:25.284 --> 26:30.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intersections in the state of
Maryland. And
we have had the designs
completed for this

26:30.155 --> 26:35.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
upgrade of this intersection for
maybe 10
years. It's shovel-ready.

26:35.360 --> 26:41.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meet Hans
Riemer, a man who
thinks about transportation a
lot. He has

26:41.133 --> 26:46.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to, as a councilman for
traffic-heavy Montgomery
County, Maryland, north of
Washington, D.C.

26:46.305 --> 26:51.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Riemer showed us this
intersection that is
a major bottleneck each morning.
The county

26:51.310 --> 26:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has had a fix ready for years,
but it has
been in limbo waiting for stable
federal funding

26:56.114 --> 27:03.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to help, because -- listen to
this fact -- since
2009, Congress has limped
through 34 short-term

27:03.789 --> 27:09.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
highway bills, and no stable
funding to back
big projects like this, until
now.

27:09.161 --> 27:13.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANS RIEMER: If the concern is,
well, the
federal government is not going
to be there

27:13.665 --> 27:19.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the other end, don't -- then
there is a
lot of pressure not to spend the
money locally.

27:19.738 --> 27:26.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, you know, a -- that
is just a
downward spiral really for
everybody. So the

27:26.178 --> 27:34.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact that bill is done at least
for a temporary
funding fix is a great step
forward.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader:
It would be the longest-term
bill to pass

27:36.855 --> 27:38.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Congress in almost two decades.

27:38.991 --> 27:43.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Senate Majority
Leader Mitch
McConnell pushed the highway
bill as a priority,

27:43.695 --> 27:49.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the mega-deal was put
together by usual
adversaries, Democrat Barbara
Boxer of California

27:49.568 --> 27:54.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Republican Jim Inhofe of
Oklahoma. They
hashed out a final agreement
with House members

27:54.706 --> 27:56.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the new speaker.

27:56.542 --> 27:58.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
We're going to have a highway
bill, which

27:58.377 --> 28:01.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will help families and workers
by rebuilding
our infrastructure and giving a
boost to our

28:01.980 --> 28:03.782 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
economy.

28:03.815 --> 28:06.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's good news
for American
drivers, for counties and for
states trying

28:06.785 --> 28:12.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to fix their roads. They will
have five years
of stable federal funding. But
critics say,

28:12.124 --> 28:16.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after that, there is a problem
because of
where the funding comes from.

28:16.128 --> 28:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When created in the 1950s, the
Highway Trust
Fund was meant to rely on the
federal gas

28:21.066 --> 28:26.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tax for funding, but with lower
gas prices
and more fuel-efficient cars,
the money coming

28:26.104 --> 28:28.407 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in has dropped.

28:28.440 --> 28:34.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite less gas tax money, this
deal increases
highway funding for the next
five years. That

28:34.246 --> 28:40.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may sound good, but it does this
in controversial
ways. One, it sells oil from
America's Strategic

28:40.819 --> 28:47.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Petroleum Reserve. That sale
won't happen
until 2023, but this law spends
the money

28:47.359 --> 28:53.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now. Another issue, it takes $53
billion from
the Federal Reserve's surplus
accounts.

28:53.198 --> 28:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAYA MACGUINEAS, President,
Committee for
a Responsible Federal Budget:
So, unfortunately,

28:55.233 --> 29:00.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
instead of financing this in an
honest, straightforward
way, we're relying on budget
gimmicks, one-time

29:00.339 --> 29:04.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
funding mechanisms, short-term
measures that
really are going to make the
problem more

29:04.676 --> 29:07.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
difficult in the longer term,
instead of fixing
it.

29:07.245 --> 29:11.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Maya MacGuineas
is the president
of the Committee for a
Responsible Federal

29:11.249 --> 29:16.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Budget. Her organization wrote
its own report,
saying highways should be
funded, but only

29:16.855 --> 29:20.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by reliable sources. Their idea?
Raise the
gas tax.

29:20.692 --> 29:25.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAYA MACGUINEAS: The reason that
makes sense
is, the biggest burden of that
tax falls on

29:25.130 --> 29:29.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the people who use the highway
system. It's
not quite a user fee, but it
acts like a user

29:29.301 --> 29:34.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fee in a lot of ways. The gas
tax hasn't been
increased in quite some time, so
one of the

29:34.272 --> 29:38.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proposals that is on the table,
and that we
think makes an awful lot of
sense, is gradually

29:38.210 --> 29:40.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
increase that gas tax.

29:40.078 --> 29:44.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Back in
Maryland, the state
gas tax just went up this
summer, specifically

29:44.650 --> 29:46.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for transportation.

29:46.418 --> 29:50.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
County Councilman Hans Riemer is
grateful
for the new federal highway law
and hopes

29:50.622 --> 29:56.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it brings changes to his
most-hated intersection,
but he is already thinking of
five years from

29:56.395 --> 29:58.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now, when the money runs out.

29:58.130 --> 30:02.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANS RIEMER: I think the most
important thing,
of course, is a sense of
stability to the

30:02.901 --> 30:09.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commitment of the federal
government to meet
transportation needs. And
whether that budget

30:09.241 --> 30:15.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
funding sources comes one way or
the other,
I am less concerned about that
than the fact

30:15.180 --> 30:16.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that the commitment is solid.

30:16.982 --> 30:21.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That concern
goes beyond
drivers to the economy. The new
law and the

30:21.820 --> 30:26.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
highway fund it increases will
support over
half-a-million jobs across the
country.

30:26.725 --> 30:32.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

30:32.898 --> 30:42.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now, for our weekly
political
analysis of this week's news, we
turn to Shields

30:42.941 --> 30:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now, for our weekly
political
analysis of this week's news, we
turn to Shields

30:50.348 --> 30:51.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Gerson.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Judy spoke with them earlier
this week.

30:53.485 --> 30:58.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The presidential
candidates
and voters are enjoying a brief
holiday break

30:58.423 --> 31:03.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the campaign season, but
just before
they left the trail, candidates
were reacting

31:03.895 --> 31:06.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the final debates of the
year.

31:06.298 --> 31:11.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in just the last few days, a
new war of
words erupted between Hillary
Clinton and

31:11.203 --> 31:13.071 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

31:13.105 --> 31:16.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that brings us to the
analysis of Shields
and Gerson. That's syndicated
columnist Mark

31:16.875 --> 31:22.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shields and Washington Post
columnist Michael
Gerson. David Brooks is away.

31:22.214 --> 31:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gentlemen, welcome to you both
at this Christmas
week.

31:26.451 --> 31:31.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's talk first about the
Democratic debate,
Mark, of last weekend. Did it
change in any

31:31.923 --> 31:34.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way the arc of this Democratic
contest?

31:34.192 --> 31:39.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Not apparently and
not obviously,
at least to me.

31:39.431 --> 31:44.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought all three candidates
had, respectively,
their best debate show --
showing so far.

31:44.202 --> 31:49.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought they did excellent
presentations,
seemed in command of the facts,
seemed comfortable.

31:49.775 --> 31:55.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But if Hillary Clinton,
according to every
survey, entered as the dominant
national leader,

31:55.347 --> 31:59.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and she emerged, therefore, as
the dominant
national leader among Democrats.

31:59.151 --> 32:03.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The one question that I don't
know is whether
in fact it affected something in
New Hampshire

32:03.922 --> 32:10.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is going to fester and
reveal itself,
or Iowa, but those are the only
two contests

32:10.328 --> 32:12.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did you see
anything in that
debate, Michael, to change where
things are?

32:14.699 --> 32:18.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: No, it did
confirm the arc,
but it's an interesting arc.

32:18.303 --> 32:23.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that Bernie Sanders is
not going to
be the nominee, but I think he's
affected

32:23.241 --> 32:27.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the debate and discussion. He's
pulled Hillary
Clinton towards the left,
towards the progressive

32:27.813 --> 32:33.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side on a number of issues.
There wasn't much
-- she is not distinguishing
herself the way

32:33.618 --> 32:42.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her husband did by going to the
middle. She's
very conventional,
conventionally -- conventionally

32:42.093 --> 32:46.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
progressive in this debate. I
think that shows
Bernie Sanders' influence.

32:46.631 --> 32:51.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, so
neither one of
you mentions Martin O'Malley. I
mean, is he

32:51.937 --> 32:53.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just left out of this?

32:53.772 --> 32:55.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I thought Martin
O'Malley was
better than Martin O'Malley has
been. I thought

32:55.807 --> 32:57.742 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he was good.

32:57.776 --> 33:02.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For whatever reason, it has
become -- I mean,
Bernie Sanders -- I agree with
Michael -- Bernie

33:02.180 --> 33:07.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders has had an influence
quite beyond
anything anybody predicted when
he came into

33:07.652 --> 33:12.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this race, I mean, over
two-and-a-quarter
million contributors. The
Clinton people are

33:12.691 --> 33:19.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now sending out direct mail
requests for money,
complaining that -- not
complaining, but comparing

33:19.297 --> 33:23.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fact that they have fewer
contributions
than Bernie, and that Bernie's
raised more

33:23.735 --> 33:25.437 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
money.

33:25.470 --> 33:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has certainly influenced and
shaped the
debate. And he is ahead in New
Hampshire.

33:28.940 --> 33:34.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would just point out, for
historical
purposes, that no president
since Dwight Eisenhower

33:34.946 --> 33:40.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been elected to the White
House who didn't
finish at least first or second
in New Hampshire,

33:40.385 --> 33:43.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not that that affects Hillary
Clinton at this
point, but it certainly affects
the Republican

33:43.955 --> 33:44.923 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
race.

33:44.956 --> 33:46.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we
appreciate the history.

33:46.491 --> 33:48.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Yes.

33:48.260 --> 33:51.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I think there were two
minor gaffes
that Hillary had, one of them on
the glitches

33:51.897 --> 33:56.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Obamacare. There are more
than glitches,
what we're seeing. The other one
is, we are

33:56.201 --> 34:01.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where we need to be on ISIS,
which even she
doesn't agree with. She supports
a no-fly

34:01.439 --> 34:03.174 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
zone.

34:03.208 --> 34:08.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both of those kind of show the
dynamics of
a third term, where you're
defending your

34:08.079 --> 34:14.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immediate predecessor. Somebody
like George
H.W. Bush did that well in 1988.
Al Gore didn't

34:14.185 --> 34:19.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do this so well in 2000 dealing
with the Clinton
record and background. And she's
going to

34:19.658 --> 34:22.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to deal with that as the
case goes forward.

34:22.894 --> 34:26.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the other
thing Hillary
said that continued to get
pickup after this

34:26.965 --> 34:35.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debate, Mark, was her comment
that ISIS is
using video of Donald Trump
speaking against

34:35.206 --> 34:39.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Muslims as a recruiting tool.

34:39.244 --> 34:44.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's come back and demanded an
apology, said
this is outrageous. Where does
this go from

34:44.249 --> 34:46.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here? I mean, we have got a war
of words going
on.

34:46.251 --> 34:50.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, you have to
come down
on Donald Trump's side, because
he's so fastidious

34:50.088 --> 34:50.422 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about facts.

34:50.455 --> 34:52.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:52.357 --> 34:55.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I mean, this is
somebody who
has apologized so frequently for
his own occasional

34:55.627 --> 34:57.595 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
misstatements.

34:57.629 --> 35:03.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where it goes, Judy, it's
something that Hillary
Clinton didn't need. Hillary
Clinton's strength,

35:03.301 --> 35:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a candidate, are that she's
experienced,
that she's strong, that she's
smart, that

35:07.973 --> 35:09.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
she's in command.

35:09.774 --> 35:15.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her weaknesses are that she is
not particularly
likable to the majority of
voters and not

35:15.847 --> 35:22.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen as honest and trustworthy.
She and Trump
have almost identical scores on
untrustworthiness,

35:22.387 --> 35:26.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if that's a word, in the most
recent Quinnipiac
national poll.

35:26.858 --> 35:33.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so she doesn't need anything
that gives
further fuel to that particular
blaze that

35:33.264 --> 35:39.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
she's not candid and
forthcoming, even though
Trump is making the case. She
did cast it

35:39.037 --> 35:42.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that she is running against
Trump, which is
to her advantage.

35:42.173 --> 35:45.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean, she
brought him up
several times during the debate.

35:45.410 --> 35:51.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, this has erupted into a
real battle
between the two of them. Trump
has gone on

35:51.383 --> 35:55.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and used, I think you would have
to call at
least earthy language in talking
about Hillary

35:55.553 --> 35:57.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton's loss in 2008.

35:57.122 --> 35:58.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Right.

35:58.990 --> 36:04.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I think that Mark is a
mensch, and that's
the limit of my Yiddish on this.
And I think

36:04.329 --> 36:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have all learned some Yiddish
we didn't
need to know here. Some of this
is the normal

36:08.299 --> 36:15.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back and forth of politics. But
Donald Trump
is an innovator in contempt, an
innovator

36:15.907 --> 36:22.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the decay of American
discourse when it
comes to knocking the disabled
or when it

36:22.547 --> 36:29.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes to comparing another
candidate to a
child molester or when it -- or
his raw misogyny.

36:29.754 --> 36:35.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is not normal. This is
getting rid of
the guide rails, the guardrails
of American

36:35.326 --> 36:41.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politics and life. And then to
complain when
they're gone and they're not
used, I mean,

36:41.433 --> 36:43.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's not credible in his case.

36:43.301 --> 36:47.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, is this --
can he basically
just say whatever he wants and
get away with

36:47.906 --> 36:52.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it? The polls out this week have
him up again
nationally.

36:52.610 --> 36:56.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, there was another poll.
There was a -- one
poll that came out this week
that showed that

36:56.781 --> 37:01.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
half of Americans said they
would be embarrassed
if he were elected president.
But, meanwhile,

37:01.386 --> 37:04.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the polls, when he's matched up
with the other
Republicans, have him out front.

37:04.856 --> 37:09.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes. No, he does.
If anything,
he has been strengthened.

37:09.327 --> 37:14.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, this is a year that has
repealed every
rule that I have known about
politics. Before

37:14.065 --> 37:20.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they vote for you, they have to
like you.
Donald Trump is not liked. In
New Hampshire,

37:20.605 --> 37:26.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have to go there. You have
to be there.
Whoever is there most often --
they expect

37:26.311 --> 37:33.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to see candidates. He's been
there less frequently
than either Scott Walker or Rick
Perry, both

37:33.084 --> 37:38.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of whom have withdrawn from the
race, and
yet he's ahead by a commanding
margin in the

37:38.356 --> 37:40.225 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
polls.

37:40.258 --> 37:45.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his language -- I mean,
Harry Truman was
roundly roasted in the
editorials of the country

37:45.130 --> 37:52.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for saying "damn." And Ike used
"hell." I
mean, and he is -- this is the
"Jersey Shore"

37:52.937 --> 37:58.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
version of reality TV politics.
I mean, it's
the mad housewives of whatever
city you want

37:58.776 --> 38:01.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to name who are being just sort
of verbally
abusive.

38:01.980 --> 38:07.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it's -- the other thing
is, all candidate
-- every presidential candidate,
it's about

38:07.285 --> 38:13.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
capturing the future. And Donald
Trump is
solely about sort of the
restoration of this

38:13.725 --> 38:17.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earlier America, where America
was dominant,
America could do whatever they
want, where

38:17.996 --> 38:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America strode the earth and
didn't have to
pay attention to anybody else,
economically,

38:22.333 --> 38:24.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or politically or militarily.

38:24.235 --> 38:27.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't know. I mean, as of
now, he's
defied gravity.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Yes.

38:29.474 --> 38:33.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it does express something
deep and disturbing
about American life. And that is
contempt

38:33.545 --> 38:38.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for institutions. We have had a
lot of institutions
come under attack. For a certain
segment of

38:38.650 --> 38:45.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the public, when Donald Trump
shows disrespect,
that's an advantage. That
actually appeals

38:45.323 --> 38:49.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to them, because they have such
disrespect
for the system itself.

38:49.561 --> 38:51.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that, I think, is dangerous
and sad.

38:51.796 --> 38:56.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there
something to be said,
meanwhile, Michael, about the
rest of the

38:56.334 --> 38:59.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican race? I mean, we do
spend a lot
of time talking about Donald
Trump. But what

38:59.237 --> 39:06.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- do we see any new shape? Ben
Carson's been
slipping in the public opinion
polls. What

39:06.144 --> 39:07.912 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do you see?

39:07.946 --> 39:11.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well, I was in
Iowa recently,
and you could feel some gains
for Cruz.

39:11.349 --> 39:17.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's solidifying movement
conservatives and
kind of religious right people
in -- and that's

39:17.422 --> 39:23.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a broader coalition, say, than
Huckabee had.
His was more narrow. I think
Cruz has a real

39:23.161 --> 39:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chance in Iowa, a very good
chance in Iowa.
You could sense that Carson is
slipping.

39:28.366 --> 39:34.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know about Trump. The
big question
is, does Donald Trump's poll
number translate

39:34.372 --> 39:44.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into caucus-goers and into
voters? Normally,
his group, blue-collar voters,
non-college-educated,

39:44.582 --> 39:50.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote the least of many groups,
OK. Will he
be able to get them out to the
polls, through

39:50.688 --> 39:53.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twitter, through other methods
that we don't
know?

39:53.358 --> 39:55.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's, I think, what
Republicans are really
wondering.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
the rest of
the Republican...

39:57.762 --> 39:59.631 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

39:59.664 --> 40:01.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I mean, I
think the Cruz
surge has been documented.
There's no question

40:01.466 --> 40:02.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about it, Judy.

40:02.433 --> 40:04.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how do you
explain it?

40:04.235 --> 40:07.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think that
there are
three groups that he's really
done well with,

40:07.472 --> 40:12.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Tea Party conservatives --
he has obviously
run up the score there -- among
religious

40:12.644 --> 40:17.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and cultural conservatives,
especially evangelicals,
who had been leaning very
strongly to Ben

40:17.382 --> 40:21.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carson, and have appealed away
from Dr. Carson,
and, third, with the very
conservatives.

40:21.753 --> 40:28.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while that will serve him
well in Iowa
and presumably in the South and
Southeastern

40:28.059 --> 40:34.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states on March 1, it's not much
help in New
Hampshire. Pat Robertson and
Mike Huckabee

40:34.299 --> 40:39.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Rick Santorum all did very
well in Iowa,
two firsts and a second among
them, and all

40:39.470 --> 40:45.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foundered in New Hampshire,
which I believe
-- you can check this out, Judy
-- is 46th

40:45.310 --> 40:47.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in church attendance.

40:47.178 --> 40:53.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All those beautiful -- all those
beautiful
congregationalist churches,
those white churches

40:53.551 --> 40:58.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the town green make great
paintings, but
they're pretty empty on Sundays.

40:58.723 --> 41:00.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There are a lot
of churches
in New Hampshire.

41:00.224 --> 41:01.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: There are
beautiful churches.

41:01.426 --> 41:02.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I have been there
enough to
notice them.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I'm writing this down. And
I'm going to
check it out.

41:04.595 --> 41:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: I think another
big question
is, who can solidify the
Republican establishment

41:08.666 --> 41:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vote? It's about four people
now.

41:11.369 --> 41:16.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was some expectation that
Rubio had
some traction here. But Chris
Christie could

41:16.240 --> 41:25.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do very well in New Hampshire
and complicate
Rubio's plans here. And Governor
Bush is still

41:25.717 --> 41:27.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
significantly back.

41:27.585 --> 41:33.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that is the open question.
Will that lane
be filled by a strong candidate
that can contend

41:33.157 --> 41:34.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for this nomination?

41:34.926 --> 41:37.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And, in this
atmosphere, is
there is a lane? Is it a viable
lane, where

41:37.628 --> 41:45.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have got so much insurgent
anti-establishment
support already wind up with --
with Cruz

41:45.737 --> 41:47.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Trump and Ben Carson?

41:47.839 --> 41:50.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last question.

41:50.274 --> 41:56.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is Christmas. And so I have
to ask you
two, what gift would you give
this -- Michael,

41:56.247 --> 42:01.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's been an up and down year
for President
Obama. What gift would you give
to the president?

42:01.052 --> 42:02.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what gift would you give to
the Republicans?

42:02.787 --> 42:04.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, Mark, you get your own
chance.

42:04.155 --> 42:06.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, let's talk about the
president. What
would you give him?

42:06.124 --> 42:10.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well, I don't
think any Democrat
deserves anything in their
stocking this year,

42:10.361 --> 42:12.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because they already got Donald
Trump.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:14.899 --> 42:19.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: That is
Christmas gift, birthday
gift, Valentine's Day. I think
anything more

42:19.036 --> 42:19.904 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would be greedy.

42:19.937 --> 42:21.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, for the
president?

42:21.272 --> 42:22.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Grecian Formula.

42:22.774 --> 42:24.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:24.509 --> 42:28.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I mean, the
president -- the
president, who is not unvain, I
would say,

42:28.546 --> 42:34.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about -- and certainly careful
about his appearance
and everything else, mentions
more than once

42:34.152 --> 42:36.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his graying hair.

42:36.087 --> 42:40.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it obviously bothers him.
So, let's -- at
least if we can't give him 60
percent favorable

42:40.458 --> 42:43.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
job rating, we could give him
black hair again.

42:43.161 --> 42:45.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We love gray hair
on this program.

42:45.196 --> 42:47.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All right, the Republicans, what
gift, Michael,
for them?

42:47.565 --> 42:52.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well, you
wouldn't normally
want this, but I think a lump of
coal, because

42:52.036 --> 42:53.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Republicans love coal, right?

42:53.438 --> 42:53.971 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:54.005 --> 42:55.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Very good.

42:55.239 --> 42:56.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: And it would
drive Al Gore
crazy, so...

42:57.008 --> 42:58.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Very good.

42:58.776 --> 42:59.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:59.644 --> 43:01.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That was good. I
can't...

43:01.045 --> 43:02.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're going to
have a hard
time topping that one.

43:02.280 --> 43:03.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I am going to have
a hard time
topping it.

43:03.281 --> 43:05.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:05.183 --> 43:08.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I would say the
recorded speeches
of Abraham Lincoln, just to
remind them from

43:08.519 --> 43:09.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
whence they came.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Better gift,
yes.

43:11.289 --> 43:14.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ah, OK. Coal.
Abraham Lincoln.

43:14.058 --> 43:16.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I didn't record
the speech.
They weren't recorded, but I'm
sure we could

43:16.661 --> 43:18.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get somebody to record -- maybe
Morgan Freeman.

43:18.463 --> 43:20.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we wish
both of you a
merry Christmas...

43:20.765 --> 43:21.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you.

43:21.466 --> 43:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Merry Christmas.

43:22.433 --> 43:23.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... and the best
of holidays.

43:23.601 --> 43:30.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thank you, both. And we will see
you in the
new year.

43:30.942 --> 43:42.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Next: What happens
when you take
a look at America before and
after the Revolutionary

43:42.720 --> 43:47.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
War, you throw in a little
hip-hop, a little
dance, and a little attitude?
Just the biggest

43:47.892 --> 43:51.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
box office draw on Broadway.
That's what.

43:51.162 --> 43:58.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has this encore
look at the
musical "Hamilton" and the man
behind it.

43:58.603 --> 44:11.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's the coolest
American history
you're likely to get, and the
hottest ticket

44:11.048 --> 44:17.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Broadway. "Hamilton," a kind
of hip-hop
musical, tells of Alexander
Hamilton, immigrant,

44:17.355 --> 44:23.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ambitious young rebel, aide to
George Washington,
a founding father who arguably
never got the

44:23.694 --> 44:25.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
recognition he deserved.

44:25.496 --> 44:29.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA,
Playwright/Actor: I'm
actually working on a hip-hop
album. It's

44:29.033 --> 44:33.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a concept album about the life
of someone
who I thinks embodies hip-hop,
Treasury Secretary

44:33.471 --> 44:34.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Alexander Hamilton.

44:34.739 --> 44:35.406 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:35.439 --> 44:37.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: You laugh.

44:37.341 --> 44:41.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Hamilton"'s
creator and star,
Lin-Manuel Miranda, performed an
early version

44:41.212 --> 44:55.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of one of the play's songs at
the White House
in 2009.

44:55.426 --> 44:57.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(SINGING)

44:57.228 --> 45:04.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: When we talked
recently, he
told me how Hamilton's life came
to be about

45:04.201 --> 45:05.970 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so much more.

45:06.003 --> 45:09.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: The joy of
discovery of,
oh, if I tell Hamilton's story,
I actually

45:09.040 --> 45:13.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tell the story of the forming of
our country,
that was a joyous experience.

45:13.210 --> 45:18.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, honestly, that's
the secret sauce
in the score. I was learning
this stuff as

45:18.583 --> 45:22.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was researching it to write
the show. I
knew the brought outlines that
everyone knows.

45:22.486 --> 45:26.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was on the $10 and he died in
a duel. That's
pretty much anyone knows about
him.

45:26.357 --> 45:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But were you
thinking from
the beginning that this larger
story was what

45:29.994 --> 45:31.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would emerge?

45:31.929 --> 45:37.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: I knew that
reading -- reading
Ron Chernow's biography of his
life was like

45:37.101 --> 45:43.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Dickens novel, such humble
beginnings to
such incredible heights, and
such incredible

45:43.708 --> 45:47.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incident throughout, that, you
know, I always
tell people I feel like I'm a
mosquito that

45:47.578 --> 45:52.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hit an artery. Like, there's so
much here.
How am I going to get it all?

45:52.149 --> 45:53.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Story-wise,
there's so much
there, yes.

45:53.384 --> 45:55.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: Absolutely.

45:55.252 --> 45:58.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I'm always on the hunt for
when I'm writing
a song are details, and really
attacking every

45:58.889 --> 46:07.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moment in the most original way
and theatrically
compelling way possible. So, our
mantra is,

46:07.365 --> 46:09.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the political always has to be
personal.

46:09.600 --> 46:13.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if you're going to write a
song about the
compromise that led to Hamilton
trading his

46:13.671 --> 46:18.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote for the debt plan for the
capital of
the U.S. being down here in the
newly formed

46:18.409 --> 46:23.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
D.C., well, that's easy to say
in a sentence,
but let's tell it from the
perspective of

46:23.514 --> 46:28.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aaron Burr, who wasn't in the
room, and desperately
wants to be in that room.

46:28.886 --> 46:39.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, suddenly, we can get away
with anything,
because we have got dramatic
tension.

46:39.363 --> 46:46.237 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(SINGING)

46:46.270 --> 46:53.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Miranda, now 35
and the son
of Puerto Rican immigrants, is
an actor, composer

46:53.077 --> 46:56.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Miranda, now 35
and the son
of Puerto Rican immigrants, is
an actor, composer

47:11.696 --> 47:17.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and playwright. He first made
his name with
"In the Heights," an exuberant
musical of

47:17.435 --> 47:23.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
life in New York's Latin
American community,
the kind of life he knew.

47:23.641 --> 47:30.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Hamilton" is set several
hundred years earlier,
but Miranda found a similar
connection.

47:30.748 --> 47:34.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: I would
argue that Hamilton
feels twice as autobiographical
than the

47:34.819 --> 47:35.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I would I would argue
"Hamilton" feels
twice as autobiographical as "In
the Heights"

47:35.252 --> 47:35.786 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
does.

47:35.820 --> 47:37.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?

47:37.655 --> 47:40.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: Yes,
absolutely, especially
-- I actually think we kind of
double down

47:40.157 --> 47:44.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on the themes of "In the
Heights," and sort
of blow them up to a grand
scope. We're not

47:44.862 --> 47:48.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to tell the story of an
immigrant neighborhood.
We're going to tell the story of
the first

47:48.199 --> 47:52.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American immigrant and the
formation of our
country.

47:52.336 --> 47:58.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, in that sense, it felt
intensely personal.
It's not the story of people who
have been

47:58.409 --> 48:02.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here for generations, but what
it feels like
to land here and make your way.

48:02.113 --> 48:05.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And the language,
the rhythms
of hip-hop?

48:05.049 --> 48:09.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: It's the
best form for
Hamilton.

48:09.053 --> 48:14.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you extrapolate from
him, it's a
wonderful language for our
revolution. We

48:14.625 --> 48:19.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need a revolutionary language to
describe
a revolution. And this was...

48:19.363 --> 48:21.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You mean hundreds
of years
later?

48:21.232 --> 48:24.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: We're
separated by an
ocean from Britain, so this
wasn't a fist-fight.

48:24.602 --> 48:27.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was a war of ideas, in a
sense.

48:27.738 --> 48:33.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we needed not only great
fighters,
but great thinkers to navigate
us from rebellion

48:33.444 --> 48:37.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the forging of a new nation.
And so hip-hop
is uniquely suited to that,
because we get

48:37.648 --> 48:39.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more language per measure than
any other musical
form.

48:39.984 --> 48:47.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What about the
casting of the
founding fathers as Latino, as
black? Is that

48:47.057 --> 48:49.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an important part of this to
you?

48:49.293 --> 48:51.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: I think so.

48:51.061 --> 48:54.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think one of our overarching
goals with
this show is -- with any show --
is, you want

48:54.932 --> 49:01.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to eliminate any distance
between your audience
and your story. And so let's not
pretend this

49:01.705 --> 49:06.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a textbook. Let's make the
founders of
our country look like what our
country looks

49:06.877 --> 49:08.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like now. This is what our...

49:08.579 --> 49:10.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, it's not a
costume epic
with a distance.

49:10.881 --> 49:13.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: Correct.
Correct. And
this is what our country looks
like now. It

49:13.484 --> 49:16.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looks like, you know, we are --
we are every
shade and every color.

49:16.921 --> 49:21.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it also comes organically
out of the music.
This is hip-hop and R&amp;B music.
These are the

49:21.525 --> 49:24.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
best people to sing this type of
music.

49:24.195 --> 49:30.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: These days,
Miranda is himself
a new kind of rock star vetted
all over.

49:30.935 --> 49:36.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We joined him in Washington as
he received
an Ingenuity Award from the
Smithsonian Institution,

49:36.340 --> 49:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and gave a talk to an adoring
audience. I
asked him about the use of the
word ingenuity

49:42.246 --> 49:47.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to describe his work, and that
brought on
a characteristic riff on how he
develops his

49:47.651 --> 49:49.520 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own word play.

49:49.553 --> 49:52.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: I remember
there is a
lyric in our show where
Lafayette says "ingenuitive

49:52.523 --> 49:54.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and fluent in French."

49:54.425 --> 49:58.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I remember having a fight --
not having
a fight, but having a debate
with my collaborators,

49:58.762 --> 50:03.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because one of them was like,
well, that's
not a word, ingenuitive. And I
was like, I

50:03.100 --> 50:04.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
think it is.

50:04.935 --> 50:08.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we were split 2-2
whether ingenuitive
was a word. And we looked it up.
And it is

50:08.205 --> 50:14.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an archaic conjugation of
ingenuity. And I
was right. And I don't know why
I knew that

50:14.778 --> 50:16.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
word, so -- and other people
didn't, but...

50:16.947 --> 50:18.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, therefore,
you use it.

50:18.682 --> 50:20.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: And,
therefore, we use
it. Yes.

50:20.050 --> 50:21.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you can make
up words if
you want, can't you?

50:22.019 --> 50:24.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: Well,
Shakespeare did
it. And it worked out pretty
great for him.

50:24.822 --> 50:26.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:26.724 --> 50:31.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, writing
musicals, entertaining
musicals, telling stories, and
now filling

50:31.829 --> 50:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in large gaps in American
history. Is there
a hierarchy of that for you?
What's most important

50:36.467 --> 50:38.302 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for you?

50:38.335 --> 50:41.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: The most
important thing
for me, honestly, is meeting
those expectations

50:41.605 --> 50:43.374 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every night.

50:43.407 --> 50:46.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we're not film actors
in that show.
It's not like you get it once on
camera in

50:46.877 --> 50:52.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the can and we're done. We're
shots. And we
have to make the experience
happen for the

50:52.049 --> 50:55.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
audience that I'm going to see
tonight after
I get on the plane, for the same
audience

50:55.886 --> 50:58.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that -- you know, for a
difference audience
that I saw last night.

50:58.255 --> 51:02.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I saw where you
said you think
to yourself, what's the thing
that's not in

51:02.092 --> 51:04.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the world that should be in the
world?

51:04.895 --> 51:05.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's a big idea, right?

51:05.462 --> 51:06.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: Yes.

51:06.997 --> 51:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I mean, do you
feel that? Like,
what's missing in our world?

51:08.999 --> 51:10.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: Absolutely.

51:10.801 --> 51:15.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean -- and it goes back to I
hope that
what I can contribute is
something that hasn't

51:15.339 --> 51:18.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been seen before. You know, "In
the Heights"
very much, came out of me
wanting a career

51:18.809 --> 51:23.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in musical theater, but there's
only about
three great roles for Latino men
in musical

51:23.047 --> 51:23.547 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
theater.

51:23.580 --> 51:25.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

51:25.382 --> 51:27.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: You're
Bernardo, you're
Paul in "A Chorus Line" or, if
you can really

51:27.718 --> 51:30.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sing, you're Man of La Mancha. I
can't sing
well enough to be the Man of La
Mancha.

51:30.321 --> 51:32.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So you did two
out of three.

51:32.089 --> 51:37.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: So, I wrote
-- I wrote
something that had so many parts
for Latinos

51:37.194 --> 51:41.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because I knew there was a void
there. I knew
it because I was going into that
world, and

51:41.231 --> 51:42.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I was scared.

51:42.866 --> 51:46.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But it's also a
big idea to
think that you can fill a
vacuum.

51:46.203 --> 51:49.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: I think
that's what we
do about artists. It's, what the
thing that

51:49.673 --> 51:51.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
only I can contribute?

51:51.675 --> 51:56.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not about the confidence to
like, hello,
world, here's this idea that
never existed.

51:56.747 --> 52:02.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's, this is my brain, and
unless I express
it, it's only going to stay in
my brain. It's

52:02.353 --> 52:08.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more about personal expression
than imposing
your will on the world. It's
more about, you

52:08.459 --> 52:12.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, if I don't get this idea
out of my head
and on to paper, it dies with
me.

52:12.963 --> 52:17.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Lin-Manuel Miranda,
thanks so much.

52:17.201 --> 52:25.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: Thank you.

52:25.376 --> 52:33.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

bring you
a special "NewsHour" Shares,
something that

52:33.083 --> 52:36.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

might be of
interest to you too.

52:36.787 --> 52:42.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Santa has been doing a lot
more than delivering
presents today, and it's been
hard work. Take

52:42.226 --> 52:50.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a look.

now: There
are some beautiful pictures of
tonight's Christmas

53:18.896 --> 53:24.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moon. It is the first full moon
on a Christmas
night in nearly four decades,
and it won't

53:24.835 --> 53:29.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happen again until the year
2034. We have
collected images that some of
you have been

53:29.940 --> 53:36.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking and uploading online from
around the
world, and they are truly
stunning. Take a

53:36.180 --> 53:37.514 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
look.

53:37.548 --> 53:40.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can find all that and more

merry Christmas.
