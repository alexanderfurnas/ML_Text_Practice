JUDY WOODRUFF: This is an
important week for the fate of
a bill designed to replace and

00:04.333 --> 00:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
potentially overhaul the
health care law often
referred to as Obamacare.

00:11.933 --> 00:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican senators are
trying to finish drafting
key portions of their own
bill affecting coverage

00:14.766 --> 00:17.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and costs.

00:17.300 --> 00:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Democrats say the entire
battle over repealing the
law is quite different
from standard operating

00:22.466 --> 00:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
procedure, and not nearly
transparent enough.

00:25.733 --> 00:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins looks at how
it's playing out in the Senate.

00:28.866 --> 00:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right now
the debate over health care is
red hot in Congress, but only

00:33.533 --> 00:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behind closed doors, as
Republicans privately try
to craft a Senate bill.

00:40.533 --> 00:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is something Democrats,
like Senator Claire McCaskill
last week, have been raising

00:43.133 --> 00:44.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
publicly.

00:44.133 --> 00:46.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:46.166 --> 00:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D),
Missouri: We have no idea
what's being proposed.

00:48.766 --> 00:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a group of guys in
a backroom somewhere that
are making these decisions.

00:53.733 --> 00:55.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There were no
hearings in the House.

00:55.733 --> 01:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, listen, this is hard
to take, because I know we
made mistakes on the Affordable

01:01.266 --> 01:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Health Care Act, Mr. Secretary.

01:03.366 --> 01:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of the criticisms
we got over and over again,
that the vote was partisan.

01:07.400 --> 01:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, you couldn't have a more
partisan exercise than what
you're engaged in right now.

01:14.400 --> 01:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not even going to have a
hearing on a bill that impacts
one-sixth of our economy.

01:20.533 --> 01:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: McCaskill wants
something called regular order.

01:22.466 --> 01:23.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What is that?

01:23.733 --> 01:25.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, it used to be
the normal process.

01:25.766 --> 01:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A bill goes through committee
hearings, where experts and
those affected by an issue ring

01:29.733 --> 01:31.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

01:31.700 --> 01:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then senators on the
committee can vote to change
the bill with amendments.

01:34.533 --> 01:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, when a bill gets to
the Senate floor, regular order
means another chance to change

01:39.000 --> 01:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it with amendment
votes there too.

01:41.733 --> 01:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2009, with the Affordable
Care Act, two Senate committees
held three months of hearings

01:47.933 --> 01:50.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and went through weeks
of voting on amendments.

01:50.066 --> 01:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More recently, Senate Leader
Mitch McConnell said he wanted
regular order when Republicans

01:53.866 --> 01:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
took over in 2015.

01:54.866 --> 01:56.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:56.966 --> 01:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: We need to open up,
open up the legislative process

01:59.400 --> 02:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a way that allows more
amendments from both sides.

02:02.133 --> 02:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But that's
not how Republicans so far have
planned this health care debate.

02:06.900 --> 02:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, in regular order,
bills go through committees
and amendment votes.

02:11.100 --> 02:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, this time
around, Senate Republicans
have indicated they
may send their health

02:15.400 --> 02:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care bill straight to the
Senate floor with little,
maybe no chance to amend it.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they have held no
hearings on the bill so far.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Leading this process is
Republican Senate Finance
Chairman Orrin Hatch.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:28.700 --> 02:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ORRIN HATCH (R), Utah: Well,
I don't know that there's
going to be another hearing,

02:29.966 --> 02:32.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but we have invited
you to participate.

02:32.033 --> 02:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Who stressed
to McCaskill that he wants
Democratic ideas, if not more

02:35.933 --> 02:38.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hearings and votes.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that differs from Hatch
in 2009, when Republicans were
the minority, and he thought

02:43.366 --> 02:44.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democrats were moving
too fast on health care.

02:44.933 --> 02:46.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ORRIN HATCH: We at
least ought to take the
time to do this right.

02:48.666 --> 02:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In the end,
it took Democrats 14 months to
pass their health care bill in

02:51.800 --> 02:54.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
2009 and 2010.

02:54.233 --> 02:56.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's why this
moment is critical.

02:56.133 --> 02:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Senate will make or
break health care reform.

02:58.833 --> 03:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Senate leaders, including
Hatch, have said they want
to pass a full health care

03:02.266 --> 03:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bill by the end of this month.

03:04.733 --> 03:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's just nine or 10
legislative days away.

03:07.933 --> 03:10.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
