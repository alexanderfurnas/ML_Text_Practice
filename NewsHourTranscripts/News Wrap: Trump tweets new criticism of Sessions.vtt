Israeli Embassy guard in Amman

one stabbed him.

00:33.166 --> 00:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

to question the guard, but
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin

Netanyahu insisted he has
diplomatic immunity and

end the incident and to bring
our people back to Israel.

00:52.633 --> 00:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

carrying government employees.

01:19.133 --> 01:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

continue a drug crackdown that's

01:44.433 --> 01:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
claimed thousands of lives.

01:46.433 --> 01:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a state of the union address,
he called the victims beasts
and vultures and he vowed

01:51.766 --> 01:53.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he'd go to prison
first before giving in.

01:53.866 --> 01:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE, Philippine
President: The fight will not
stop until those who deal in

02:00.900 --> 02:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it understand that they have
to cease, they have to stop,
because the alternative are

02:09.733 --> 02:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
either jail or hell.

02:12.866 --> 02:17.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As Duterte
spoke, thousands of
left-wing protesters
marched in opposition.

02:19.966 --> 02:24.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

president broke with
his own political party
today, vetoing two

02:32.400 --> 02:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bills aimed at curbing the
independence of judges.

02:34.933 --> 02:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The legislation had triggered
mass demonstrations.

02:38.166 --> 02:41.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Diana Magnay of
Independent Television
News filed this report.

02:41.566 --> 02:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DIANA MAGNAY: For days
and long into each
night, they protested
in cities across Poland

02:48.566 --> 02:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against judicial reforms they
felt might snuff out what's
left of liberal democracy here.

02:55.200 --> 02:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not a phrase the ruling
Law and Justice Party had much
track with, certainly not party

02:59.500 --> 03:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
chairman Jaroslaw Kaczynski.

03:01.566 --> 03:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the man he cherry-picked
for president last year, Andrzej
Duda, just broke with party

03:07.566 --> 03:09.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ranks.

03:09.666 --> 03:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDRZEJ DUDA, President of
Poland (through translator):
Poland badly needs reform of

03:11.933 --> 03:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the judiciary and I fully
support this reform.

03:15.066 --> 03:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I support a smart reform,
which would guarantee an
effective functioning of the

03:18.733 --> 03:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
judiciary and improve the
sense of justice in Poland.

03:21.600 --> 03:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIANA MAGNAY: Cue an emergency
meeting of the ruling party.

03:25.200 --> 03:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No comments from the press,
but expect the president, who
until now has signed pretty

03:29.466 --> 03:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much everything that's crossed
his desk, to put his stamp on
any new piece of legislation,

03:36.300 --> 03:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
likely some kind of compromise,
on reforms his party says
they have a mandate for.

03:39.700 --> 03:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMINIK TARCZYNSKI, Member
of Polish Parliament: So
far, the judges in Poland
had no responsibility

03:44.600 --> 03:46.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at all.

03:46.733 --> 03:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We as members of Parliament
can be, I don't know, put on
trial or lose our mandate or

03:51.733 --> 03:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just people revolt
and decide our future.

03:54.133 --> 03:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we wanted to have very
equal rights for everyone, for
member of the Parliament, for

04:01.033 --> 04:03.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the judge, and from
the man on the street.

04:03.066 --> 04:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANA MAGNAY: Some on the street
today felt their president
hadn't gone far enough, blocking

04:07.066 --> 04:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two pieces of legislation,
but not a third, which grants
sweeping powers to the justice

04:13.633 --> 04:16.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
minister, including the
right to appoint the
heads of lower courts.

04:16.200 --> 04:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This evening, another
demonstration outside
the presidential palace
by those whose notions

04:22.966 --> 04:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of law and justice are
entirely different from
Kaczynski and his ruling party.

04:25.933 --> 04:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That report
from Diana Magnay of
Independent Television News.

04:30.633 --> 04:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The parents of a critically
ill baby in Britain
have dropped their legal
bid to keep him alive.

04:37.600 --> 04:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They'd been trying to move
11-month-old Charlie Gard to the
U.S. for experimental treatment,

04:42.300 --> 04:44.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but British doctors
argued it wouldn't work.

04:44.333 --> 04:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the father, Chris Gard,
said they have made their
decision after new tests showed

04:49.033 --> 04:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the child's muscle damage
is now irreversible.

04:51.300 --> 04:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS GARD, Father: We will
have to live with the what-ifs
which will haunt us for the rest

04:55.700 --> 04:57.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of our lives.

04:57.766 --> 05:02.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Despite the way our
beautiful son has been
spoken about sometimes,
as if he is not worthy

05:04.000 --> 05:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a chance of life, our son
is an absolute warrior, and
we could not be prouder of him

05:10.200 --> 05:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and we will miss him terribly.

05:12.766 --> 05:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The case
has garnered international
attention, with both
President Trump and the

05:17.700 --> 05:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pope offering support
to the family.

05:19.800 --> 05:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, President
Trump called for Senate
Republicans to begin debate on

05:24.366 --> 05:26.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a health care bill.

05:26.333 --> 05:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party leaders say they will try
advancing a measure tomorrow,
but it's not clear which

05:32.800 --> 05:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one: a version that repeals
and replaces Obamacare
or a repeal-only bill.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president said -- quote
-- "There's been enough talk.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now is the time for action."

05:41.600 --> 05:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial average lost
nearly 67 points to close at

05:47.066 --> 05:48.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
21513.

05:48.566 --> 05:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 23 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 slipped two.
