THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:59.726 --> 01:00.827
THE UNITED NATIONS WARNED TODAY

01:00.827 --> 01:01.995
THAT THE WORLD MUST GET MOST OF

01:01.995 --> 01:03.163
ITS ENERGY FROM RENEWABLE

01:03.163 --> 01:06.566
SOURCES BY 2050 OR INCREASE THE

01:06.566 --> 01:07.801
LIKELIHOOD OF WHAT IT CALLED

01:07.801 --> 01:09.069
SEVERE, PERVASIVE AND

01:09.069 --> 01:10.671
IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.272
A REPORT PRODUCED BY HUNDREDS OF

01:12.272 --> 01:14.374
SCIENTISTS AROUND THE WORLD SAID

01:14.374 --> 01:15.642
INACTION ULTIMATELY WOULD PROVE

01:15.642 --> 01:17.411
MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

01:17.411 --> 01:19.980
SWITCHING OVER TO RENEWABLES.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.348
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY

01:51.011 --> 01:52.980
OFFICIALS SAY THE SUNNI

01:52.980 --> 01:54.281
EXTREMISTS LINED UP AND EXECUTED

01:54.281 --> 01:55.182
AT LEAST 50 PEOPLE TODAY IN A

01:55.182 --> 01:57.918
VILLAGE WEST OF BAGHDAD.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.453
OFFICIALS SAID THE VICTIMS

01:59.453 --> 02:03.323
REPORTEDLY INCLUDING SIX WOMEN

02:03.323 --> 02:04.024

02:04.024 --> 02:05.292
ASSEMBLED, THEN SHOT ONE BY ONE

02:05.292 --> 02:06.526
IN PUBLIC.

02:06.526 --> 02:07.694
IT WAS THE THIRD INCIDENT OF ITS

02:07.694 --> 02:08.862
KIND IN THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS.

02:08.862 --> 02:09.963
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT AS MANY AS

02:09.963 --> 02:12.332
320 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED.

02:12.332 --> 02:13.700
THERE WERE ALSO FATAL BOMBINGS

02:13.700 --> 02:19.139

02:19.139 --> 02:20.240

02:20.240 --> 02:21.341
AFTERMATH OF A CAR BOMBING THAT

PILGRIMS.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.214
IN THE WEST BANK TODAY, NEW

02:27.214 --> 02:28.215
CLASHES BETWEEN PALESTINIANS AND

02:28.215 --> 02:29.316
ISRAELI SECURITY FORCES

02:29.316 --> 02:30.417
FOLLOWING ISRAEL'S DECISION

02:30.417 --> 02:31.852
EARLIER IN THE WEEK TO LIMIT

02:31.852 --> 02:33.153
ACCESS TO A SACRED RELIGIOUS

02:33.153 --> 02:35.188
SITE IN JERUSALEM.

02:35.188 --> 02:37.157
MUSLIMS KNOW IT AS THE NOBLE

02:37.157 --> 02:38.392
SANCTUARY, THE PLACE THE PROPHET

02:38.392 --> 02:39.926
MOHAMMAD IS SAID TO HAVE

02:39.926 --> 02:41.161
ASCENDED TO HEAVEN.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.062
THE AREA IS KNOWN BY JEWS AS THE

02:42.062 --> 02:43.930
TEMPLE MOUNT.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.165
IT'S WHERE TWO ANCIENT TEMPLES

02:45.165 --> 02:46.400
ONCE STOOD AND IS CONSIDERED THE

02:46.400 --> 02:47.801
HOLIEST SITE IN JUDAISM.

02:47.801 --> 02:48.769
TODAY, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER

02:48.769 --> 02:50.203
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU ISSUED THIS

02:50.203 --> 02:52.172
STATEMENT:

02:52.172 --> 02:53.173
>> (translated): IT IS VERY

02:53.173 --> 02:55.175
EASY TO IGNITE A RELIGIOUS FIRE

02:55.175 --> 02:56.543
BUT MUCH HARDER TO EXTINGUISH

02:56.543 --> 02:57.811
IT, THESE MESSAGES HAVE BEEN

02:57.811 --> 03:00.047
RELAYED IN THE SHARPEST WAY

03:00.047 --> 03:01.548
POSSIBLE TO MAHMOUD ABBAS AND

03:01.548 --> 03:03.150
ALL ELEMENTS.

03:03.150 --> 03:05.352
WHAT IS NEEDED NOW IS CALM.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.653
>> Sreenivasan: VIOLENCE IN

03:06.653 --> 03:07.821
ANOTHER PART OF THE WORLD TODAY.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.022
A GROUP LINKED TO THE TALIBAN

03:09.022 --> 03:10.023
HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR A

03:10.023 --> 03:11.191
SUICIDE CAR BOMBING THAT KILLED

03:11.191 --> 03:12.192
AT LEAST 45 PEOPLE AND WOUNDED

03:12.192 --> 03:13.460
AT LEAST 70 MORE NEAR A MILITARY

03:13.460 --> 03:16.096
CHECKPOINT IN PAKISTAN.

03:16.096 --> 03:19.533
THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED JUST 500

03:19.533 --> 03:21.668
YARDS FROM PAKISTAN'S WAGAGH

03:21.668 --> 03:24.638
BORDER WITH INDIA, RIGHT AFTER A

03:24.638 --> 03:26.873
DAILY CEREMONY WHEN BOTH SIDES

03:26.873 --> 03:27.974
LOWER THEIR FLAGS

03:27.974 --> 03:29.076
SIMULTANEOUSLY, AN EVENT OFTEN

03:29.076 --> 03:29.810
WITNESSED BY HUNDREDS OF

03:29.810 --> 03:31.378
TOURISTS.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.746
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY

03:32.746 --> 03:34.047
FOUR YEARS, THE AVERAGE PRICE OF

03:34.047 --> 03:35.082
A GALLON OF REGULAR GAS IN THIS

03:35.082 --> 03:36.216
COUNTRY HAS SLIPPED BELOW THREE

03:36.216 --> 03:37.217
DOLLARS A GALLON.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.718
THIS, ACCORDING TO AAA.

03:38.718 --> 03:39.853
SOME EXPERTS BELIEVE GAS PRICES

03:39.853 --> 03:41.021
COULD GO EVEN LOWER.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.456
IT MEANS MILLIONS OF AMERICANS

03:42.456 --> 03:43.323
WILL HAVE MORE TO SPEND AS THE

03:43.323 --> 03:44.424
HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON

03:44.424 --> 03:45.625
APPROACHES.

03:45.625 --> 03:46.660
A KENYAN MAN AND A KENYAN WOMAN

03:46.660 --> 03:47.727
WERE THE TOP FINISHERS IN THE

03:47.727 --> 03:49.429
NEW YORK CITY MARATHON TODAY.

03:49.429 --> 03:50.630

03:55.635 --> 03:57.237
25 MINUTES.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.039
AND FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A

03:59.039 --> 04:00.440

04:00.440 --> 04:02.576
WON THE WOMEN'S WHEELCHAIR

04:02.576 --> 04:04.044
DIVISION.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.212
SHE ALSO WON THE MARATHONS THIS

04:05.212 --> 04:07.614
YEAR AND LAST IN BOSTON, LONDON

04:07.614 --> 04:09.549
AND CHICAGO, COMPLETING BACK-TO-

04:09.549 --> 04:10.984

04:10.984 --> 04:12.419
SHE WAS BORN WITH SPINA BIFIDA

04:12.419 --> 04:13.553
AND PARALYZED FROM THE WAIST

04:13.553 --> 04:14.888
DOWN.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.256
WHEN SHE WAS SIX, SHE WAS

04:16.256 --> 04:17.257
ADOPTED FROM A RUSSIAN ORPHANAGE

04:17.257 --> 04:18.258
BY AN AMERICAN FAMILY.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.326
MORE THAN 50,000 PARTICIPATED IN

04:19.326 --> 04:20.760
TODAY'S RACE IN COLD AND WINDY

04:20.760 --> 04:32.539
CONDITIONS.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.307
MUCH OF THE ANALYSIS AFTER THE

04:34.307 --> 04:35.408
2012 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

04:35.408 --> 04:36.743
FOCUSED ON HOW THE OBAMA

04:36.743 --> 04:38.478
CAMPAIGN HAD MADE BETTER USE OF

04:38.478 --> 04:39.846
TECHNOLOGY THAN THE ROMNEY

04:39.846 --> 04:41.381
CAMPAIGN TO GET ITS SUPPORTERS

04:41.381 --> 04:42.549
TO THE POLLS.

04:42.549 --> 04:43.717
TONIGHT, WE LOOK AT WHAT BOTH

04:43.717 --> 04:44.818
MAJOR PARTIES ARE DOING THIS

04:44.818 --> 04:45.886
TIME AROUND IN THE DAYS LEADING

04:45.886 --> 04:46.953
UP TO TUESDAY'S MID-TERM

04:46.953 --> 04:47.988
ELECTIONS.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.389
ASHLEY PARKER CO-AUTHORED AN

04:49.389 --> 04:50.690
ARTICLE THIS WEEKEND IN THE "NEW

04:50.690 --> 04:51.791
YORK TIMES" AND JOINS US NOW

04:51.791 --> 04:53.026
FROM WASHINGTON.

04:53.026 --> 04:53.927
SO THERE SEEMS TO BE

04:53.927 --> 04:55.162
ADVANTAGE GOES BETWEEN ONE PARTY

04:55.162 --> 04:56.563
TO ANOTHER PARTY GIVEN WHICH

04:56.563 --> 04:57.998
ELECTION CYCLE AND THERE'S A

04:57.998 --> 05:01.234
GAME OF CATCH-UP THAT HAPPENS.

05:01.234 --> 05:04.204
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY AND THIS

05:04.204 --> 05:06.139
TIME REPUBLICANS ARE DEFINITELY

05:06.139 --> 05:08.775
PLAYING CATCH-UP.

05:08.775 --> 05:11.778
THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN GAVE

05:11.778 --> 05:13.847
REPUBLICANS CATCH-UP IN 2008 AND

05:13.847 --> 05:15.015
2012.

05:15.015 --> 05:18.051
THE ROMNEY TEAM DIDN'T MAKE AS

05:18.051 --> 05:20.320
MUCH OF THEIR DIGITAL TEAM,

05:20.320 --> 05:21.688
THEY'RE ACTUALLY TAKING A LOT OF

05:21.688 --> 05:23.023
PAGES NOT SURPRISINGLY THE OBAMA

05:23.023 --> 05:25.025
PLAY BOOK.

05:25.025 --> 05:29.329
>> SO GIVE US AN EXAMPLE OF HOW

05:29.329 --> 05:31.031
DIGITAL ADVERTISING CAN BE

05:31.031 --> 05:32.032
TARGETED VERSUS A TELEVISION

05:32.032 --> 05:32.899
SPOT.

05:32.899 --> 05:33.833
>> SURE.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.268
WELL ON TELEVISION YOU PLACE

05:35.268 --> 05:38.238
YOUR ADS ON A TV SHOW DURING THE

05:38.238 --> 05:39.072
COMMERCIAL BREAK.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.875
SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU PLACE ADS

05:41.875 --> 05:44.511
ON ABC SCANDAL BECAUSE YOU WANT

05:44.511 --> 05:47.480
TO REACH FEMALE VIEWERS YOU GET

05:47.480 --> 05:49.883
FEMALE VIEWERS AND YOU MAYBE GET

05:49.883 --> 05:51.818
MALE VIEWERS, OR MALE VIEWERS

05:51.818 --> 05:54.454
WHO ARE FORCED TO WATCH THE SHOW

05:54.454 --> 05:58.091
WITH THEIR GIRLFRIENDS BUT WITH

05:58.091 --> 06:01.561
THIS WAY YOU CAN FOCUS ON A

06:01.561 --> 06:02.662
DEVICE, IT FOLLOWS THEM WHEN

06:02.662 --> 06:04.264
THEY ARE THERE.

06:04.264 --> 06:05.799
WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR

06:05.799 --> 06:07.601
PHONE WHEN THEY'RE WAKING UP YOU

06:07.601 --> 06:10.670
CAN SERVE THEM AN AD, NOT ONLY

06:10.670 --> 06:13.039
THE AT HOME BUT IF YOU ARE

06:13.039 --> 06:15.075
SERVING THEM AN AD ON THEIR

06:15.075 --> 06:18.979
TABLET YOU CAN TARGET THEM WHEN

06:18.979 --> 06:20.747
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY TO WORK, ON

06:20.747 --> 06:23.583
THEIR WAY HOME, IN THE KITCHEN

06:23.583 --> 06:26.886
COOKING DINNER WHEN THEY'RE AT

06:26.886 --> 06:27.721
HOME.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.090
>> DUE TO FACEBOOK ARE THEY

06:30.090 --> 06:32.292
SELLING THE PREFERENCES WE ARE

06:32.292 --> 06:33.660
EXHIBITING AND TELLING THEM

06:33.660 --> 06:34.694
ABOUT?

06:34.694 --> 06:36.563
>> YES, THEY ABSOLUTELY ARE.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.665
FACEBOOK FOR INSTANCE OFFERS A

06:38.665 --> 06:42.769
MENU OF OPTIONS, A CAMPAIGN

06:42.769 --> 06:45.372
COULD TARGET FEMALE USERS OF

06:45.372 --> 06:47.774
FACEBOOK OR CERTAIN ZIP CODE ON

06:47.774 --> 06:50.877
FACEBOOK OR USERS WHO LIKE

06:50.877 --> 06:56.082
CERTAIN FACEBOOK PAGES, RACHEL

06:56.082 --> 06:59.619
MADDOW, OR EUROPE LIFT ITS FILE,

06:59.619 --> 07:01.755
TARGET TO GET OUT AND VOTE AND

07:01.755 --> 07:03.957
THEY CAN LITERALLY SERVE ADS TO

07:03.957 --> 07:05.458
ALL THOSE EXACT PEOPLE WHO ARE

07:05.458 --> 07:06.559
USERS OF FACEBOOK.

07:06.559 --> 07:08.028
>> OKAY, SO HOW MUCH MONEY ARE

07:08.028 --> 07:09.496
WE TALKING ABOUT CAMPAIGN

07:09.496 --> 07:10.797
SPENDING IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF

07:10.797 --> 07:11.698
THINGS?

07:11.698 --> 07:13.300
IS MORE OF IT SHIFTING TO

07:13.300 --> 07:14.901
DIGITAL TO TARGETING LIKE THIS?

07:14.901 --> 07:18.204
>> YEAH, SO YOU KNOW, EACH CYCLE

07:18.204 --> 07:20.540
IS SEEING A LARGER PORTION OF

07:20.540 --> 07:23.310
THE OVERALL BUDGET GOING TO

07:23.310 --> 07:24.911
DIGITAL, FOR INSTANCE, SOME

07:24.911 --> 07:27.080
GROUPS THAT ENSURE DIGITAL GETS

07:27.080 --> 07:30.016
A FAIR SHAKE, 15 OR 20% OF IT

07:30.016 --> 07:32.152
GOES TO A DIGITAL BUY BUT

07:32.152 --> 07:33.153
COMPARED TO TELEVISION IT'S

07:33.153 --> 07:35.121
STILL A VERY SMALL PORTION.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.157
SO IT'S INCREASING RAPIDLY BUT

07:37.157 --> 07:40.360
TELEVISION IS SORT OF THE 800

07:40.360 --> 07:41.728
POUND GORILLA.

07:41.728 --> 07:44.631
>> ASHLEY PARKER, THANKS SO

07:44.631 --> 07:45.965

13:26.606 --> 13:27.940
IT IS A VERY SCARY TIME.

AND AT THAT TIME, I WANT TO COME

15:35.401 --> 15:36.702
THEY SANG SONGS TOGETHER, AND

15:36.702 --> 15:38.671
AFTERWARD, IN THE BEDROOM THEY

15:38.671 --> 15:39.772
SHARED, PAM HANDED BEN THE

15:39.772 --> 15:40.506
MEDICATION THAT WOULD END HIS

15:40.506 --> 15:43.142
LIFE.

15:43.142 --> 15:44.243
HE TOOK IT WITHOUT HESITATING.

15:44.243 --> 15:45.711
>> EARLY ON WHEN I GOT TOGETHER

15:45.711 --> 15:47.079
WITH MY HUSBAND AND WE WERE

15:47.079 --> 15:48.181
FIRST TOGETHER, WE'D BE LAYING

15:48.181 --> 15:50.349
IN BED TOGETHER AND HE WAS

15:50.349 --> 15:52.251
THINKING, HE'D GO LIKE THIS WITH

15:52.251 --> 15:53.186
HIS HANDS.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.120
HIS HANDS WERE ALWAYS MOVING.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.221
IT'S KIND OF LIKE, IT'S WHEN HE

15:55.221 --> 15:56.222
WAS THINKING KIND OF THING AND

15:56.222 --> 15:57.590
EVERYTHING.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.758
BUT WHAT I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN IS

15:58.758 --> 16:00.960
HIS HANDS WERE LIKE THIS ON HIS

16:00.960 --> 16:02.895
CHEST, AND I HELD MY HANDS ON

16:02.895 --> 16:06.566
TOP OF HIS.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.301
BUT HIS HANDS NEVER WENT LIKE

16:08.301 --> 16:10.670
THAT AND THEY JUST STAYED,

16:10.670 --> 16:17.677
BECAUSE HE WAS JUST AT PEACE.

16:17.677 --> 16:18.978
AND HIS LAST WORDS WERE, "THANK

16:18.978 --> 16:21.714
YOU."

16:21.714 --> 16:27.220
AND HE DIED IN TWO HOURS.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.321
>> Reporter: BEN WALD WAS 75-

16:28.321 --> 16:31.991
YEARS-OLD.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.059
SO WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM

16:33.059 --> 16:35.795
OREGON'S EXPERIENCE?

16:35.795 --> 16:43.502
KATRINA HEDBERG OF THE STATE

16:43.502 --> 16:44.470
HEALTH AUTHORITY, WHO'S NEUTRAL

16:44.470 --> 16:45.538
ON THE ISSUE, TRACKS STATISTICS

16:45.538 --> 16:46.439
ON OREGON'S DEATH WITH DIGNITY

16:46.439 --> 16:47.840
LAW.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.275
>> INITIALLY THERE WERE A NUMBER

16:49.275 --> 16:50.476
OF CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE HAD

16:50.476 --> 16:51.644
AROUND WOULD THIS BE

16:51.644 --> 16:52.678
DISPROPORTIONATELY USED BY

16:52.678 --> 16:53.846
PEOPLE WHO WERE DISENFRANCHISED,

16:53.846 --> 16:54.714
SO UNEDUCATED OR PEOPLE WHO

16:54.714 --> 16:55.982
MIGHT HAVE HAD DISABILITIES OR

16:55.982 --> 16:57.516
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.

16:57.516 --> 16:58.951
AND WE'VE REALLY FOUND THAT THE

16:58.951 --> 17:00.486
PEOPLE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING ARE

17:00.486 --> 17:03.556
PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT TO

17:03.556 --> 17:04.891
CONTROL THE TIMING AND MANNER

17:04.891 --> 17:07.793
SURROUNDING THEIR DEATH.

17:07.793 --> 17:09.328
>> Reporter: STILL, DR. TOFFLER

17:09.328 --> 17:10.863
SAYS THOSE FINAL MONTHS AND DAYS

17:10.863 --> 17:12.231
SHOULD NEVER BE CUT SHORT, AS HE

17:12.231 --> 17:13.332
LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE WITH HIS

17:13.332 --> 17:15.735
OWN WIFE.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.737
>> WE WERE MARRIED FOR 40 YEARS.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.005
AND IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS I

17:19.005 --> 17:20.106
THINK WE HAD THE BEST YEARS OF

17:20.106 --> 17:21.207
OUR LIFE, WHEN SHE ACTUALLY HAD

17:21.207 --> 17:24.744
A TERMINAL DIAGNOSIS.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.512
AND I WOULDN'T TRADE THOSE FIVE

17:26.512 --> 17:27.914
YEARS FOR ANYTHING.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.248
>> Reporter: AS FOR PAM, SHE'S

17:29.248 --> 17:30.516
NOW VOLUNTEERING FOR COMPASSION

17:30.516 --> 17:31.951
AND CHOICES, GUIDING OTHER

17:31.951 --> 17:33.252
FAMILIES THROUGH A PROCESS SHE

17:33.252 --> 17:35.254
NOW KNOWS FIRSTHAND.

17:35.254 --> 17:38.858
>> NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT

17:38.858 --> 17:40.359
DYING AND DEATH.

17:40.359 --> 17:41.994
BUT ONCE WE GET INTO THAT, IT

17:41.994 --> 17:44.530
REALLY BECOMES AN ACT OF LOVE.

17:44.530 --> 17:50.036
IT REALLY DOES.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.170
>> Sreenivasan: FOR MORE OF OUR

17:51.170 --> 17:52.238
COVERAGE ABOUT THE DEBATE

17:52.238 --> 17:54.807
SURROUNDING ASSISTED SUICIDE IN

17:54.807 --> 17:55.808
THE U.S. AND FOR A DEEPER LOOK

18:18.164 --> 18:19.098
ARTS, AND THE WORKS OF ONE OF

18:19.098 --> 18:20.166
AMERICA'S MOST CELEBRATED

18:20.166 --> 18:21.100
ARTISTS, ALEXANDER CALDER.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.301
WBGH'S ARTS EDITOR JARED BOWEN

18:22.301 --> 18:23.602
SAT DOWN RECENTLY WITH THE CHIEF

18:23.602 --> 18:25.171
CURATOR OF THE PEABODY ESSEX

18:25.171 --> 18:26.405
MUSEUM NEAR BOSTON TO DISCUSS

18:26.405 --> 18:33.679
THE MAN AND HIS CREATIONS.

18:33.679 --> 18:37.583
THE EXHIBIT RUNS TILL JANUARY.

18:37.583 --> 18:38.918
>> THE NOTION THAT YOU COULD

18:38.918 --> 18:40.119
STAND IN FRONT OF SOMETHING AND

18:40.119 --> 18:41.320
WAIT TO SEE IF IT MOVES, HOW IT

18:41.320 --> 18:42.021
MOVES, AUTOMATICALLY SLOWS YOU

18:42.021 --> 18:43.255
DOWN.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.590
IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO TAKE A LOT

18:44.590 --> 18:49.829
OF TIME TO LOOK CAREFULLY.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.430
>> Reporter: BY WORKING IN

18:51.430 --> 18:52.698
MOVEMENT, CALDER NEAR SINGLE-

18:52.698 --> 18:54.200
HANDEDLY CHANGED THE DEFINITION

18:54.200 --> 18:55.434
OF SCULPTURE-REJECTING TRADITION

18:55.434 --> 18:56.736
AND THOSE CARVED MASSES FOR

18:56.736 --> 18:58.471
WHICH HIS OWN PROMINENT FAMILY

18:58.471 --> 19:00.606
OF SCULPTORS WAS KNOWN.

19:00.606 --> 19:02.408
>> CALDER IS ONE OF THESE PEOPLE

19:02.408 --> 19:03.109
WHO WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT

19:03.109 --> 19:04.410
THE RIGHT TIME.

19:04.410 --> 19:05.978
>> Reporter: LYNDA ROSCOE

19:05.978 --> 19:07.146
HARTIGAN HAS OVERSEEN THIS

19:07.146 --> 19:08.247
INSTALLATION OF CALDER'S WORK AT

19:08.247 --> 19:10.916
THE PEABODY ESSEX MUSEUM.

19:10.916 --> 19:12.651
IT TRACES HIS CAREER BEGINNING

19:12.651 --> 19:15.354
WITH HIS SEARCH FOR THE NEW

19:15.354 --> 19:16.889
WHICH TOOK HIM TO PARIS.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.657
THROUGHOUT THE 1920S AND 30S HE

19:18.657 --> 19:20.026
IMMERSED HIMSELF IN THAT CITY'S

19:20.026 --> 19:28.868
AVANT-GARDE GROUP.

19:28.868 --> 19:29.935
>> ALL THIS FERMENT WAS

19:29.935 --> 19:30.903
HAPPENING.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.071
YOU KNOW, HOW DO YOU WRITE

19:32.071 --> 19:33.239
DIFFERENTLY, HOW DO YOU CREATIVE

19:33.239 --> 19:34.206
DIFFERENT KINDS OF MUSIC, HOW DO

19:34.206 --> 19:35.374
YOU CREATIVE A NEW KIND OF ART.

19:35.374 --> 19:36.475
HE REALLY KNEW HOW TO CONNECT

19:36.475 --> 19:37.476
WITH PEOPLE AND REALLY GOT

19:37.476 --> 19:38.644
INVOLVED WITH ARTISTS LIKE

19:38.644 --> 19:40.413
MARCEL DUCHAMP AND MONDRIAN.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.681
>> Reporter: THAT LED TO

19:42.681 --> 19:44.316
CALDER'S LIFELONG FASCINATION

19:44.316 --> 19:45.751
WITH MOVEMENT AND FORM-WHAT MANY

19:45.751 --> 19:46.786
AN OBSERVER HAS DEEMED HIS OWN

19:46.786 --> 19:47.653
BALLETS.

19:47.653 --> 19:48.687
>> WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW A

19:48.687 --> 19:49.655
DANCER MOVES, SO MUCH OF IT IS

19:49.655 --> 19:50.689
ABOUT BALANCE.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.258
ALSO, I THINK WHEN YOU GO

19:52.258 --> 19:53.559
THROUGH THIS EXHIBITION YOU

19:53.559 --> 19:55.227
BEGIN TO SEE THAT THERE ARE

19:55.227 --> 19:56.495
CONVERSATIONS, THERE ARE

19:56.495 --> 19:57.730
PARTNERSHIPS AMONG SOME OF THE

19:57.730 --> 19:59.765
WORKS AND SO, YOU COULD SAY THAT

19:59.765 --> 20:02.668
IT'S LIKE CHOREOGRAPHY.

20:02.668 --> 20:03.903
YOU COULD ALSO SAY IT'S

20:03.903 --> 20:05.438
THEATRICAL BECAUSE ITS

20:05.438 --> 20:07.106
PERFORMATIVE.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.908
>> Reporter: IT CERTAINLY HELPED

20:08.908 --> 20:10.409
THAT THE MATHEMATICALLY-MINDED

20:10.409 --> 20:11.677
CALDER BROUGHT A HEFTY

20:11.677 --> 20:13.579
ENGINEERING PROWESS TO HIS

20:13.579 --> 20:15.347
CONNECTICUT STUDIO WHERE HE MADE

20:15.347 --> 20:16.982
ALL OF HIS OWN PIECES USING

20:16.982 --> 20:18.584
SIMPLE HAND TOOLS.

20:18.584 --> 20:19.952
>> HE HAD A DEGREE IN MECHANICAL

20:19.952 --> 20:23.489
ENGINEERING.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.691
WHERE YOU WOULD ATTACH WEIGHT OR

20:25.691 --> 20:30.696
RELEASE WEIGHT, HOW FAR YOU CAN

20:30.696 --> 20:35.534
EXTEND BEFORE IT GOES WOPPY-

20:35.534 --> 20:36.902
JAWED IN A WAY THAT YOU DON'T

20:36.902 --> 20:38.104
WANT.

20:38.104 --> 20:39.371
SOPHISTICATED YET SIMPLE AND

20:39.371 --> 20:40.706
BASIC PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICS.

20:40.706 --> 20:41.907
>> Reporter: ALONG WITH A VERY

20:41.907 --> 20:43.008
LIMITED COLOR PALETTE.

20:43.008 --> 20:44.076
CALDER LOVED BLACK AND WHITE,

20:44.076 --> 20:45.711
HARTIGAN SAYS FOR IT'S IMPACT

20:45.711 --> 20:46.712
AND CONTRAST.

20:46.712 --> 20:48.147
ALTHOUGH THE SHOW IS PUNCTUATED

20:48.147 --> 20:49.248
WITH COLOR.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.516
>> RED IS THE COLOR HE FELT

20:50.516 --> 20:52.384
COULD REALLY STAND UP TO THE

20:52.384 --> 20:54.820
BLACK AND WHITE.

20:54.820 --> 20:55.955
YELLOW AND BLUE, THE OTHER TWO

20:55.955 --> 20:57.790
PRIMARIES, BECOME THE COLORS HE

20:57.790 --> 21:02.461
THOUGHT HAD GOOD ACCENT POINTS.

21:02.461 --> 21:04.430
APPARENTLY, ABSOLUTELY DETESTED

21:04.430 --> 21:06.332
THE COLOR GREEN.

21:06.332 --> 21:07.466
>> Reporter: THROUGHOUT HIS

21:07.466 --> 21:09.735
LIFETIME, CALDER REMAINED A

21:09.735 --> 21:11.871
HUGELY POPULAR ARTIST.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.506
HE BEGAN MAKING LARGE-SCALE

21:13.506 --> 21:15.040
PUBLIC ART-INTERACTING WITH

21:15.040 --> 21:16.642
AUDIENCES JUST AS HIS MOBILES

21:16.642 --> 21:18.410
AND STABILES HAD, BUT IN A GRAND

21:18.410 --> 21:19.512
WAY.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.247
>> HE REALLY FELT LIKE HE COULD

21:21.247 --> 21:23.082
MAKE LARGE OUTDOOR SCULPTURE

21:23.082 --> 21:24.750
THAT COULD ENGAGE PEOPLE'S

21:24.750 --> 21:26.318
APPRECIATION OF SPACE AND

21:26.318 --> 21:28.120
ARCHITECTURE, THAT THAT COULD

21:28.120 --> 21:31.257
ENHANCE THEIR LIVES.

21:31.257 --> 21:33.959
>> Reporter: CALDER DIED IN

21:33.959 --> 21:35.394
1976.

21:35.394 --> 21:37.029
HIS WORK HAS BEEN MUCH DEBATED

21:37.029 --> 21:38.464
IN THE INTERVENING YEARS WITH

21:38.464 --> 21:39.798
CRITICS TARGETING HIM PERHAPS

21:39.798 --> 21:42.034
BECAUSE OF HIS POPULARITY.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.903
BUT HARTIGAN SAYS NEARLY 40

21:43.903 --> 21:45.104
YEARS AFTER CALDER'S DEATH,

21:45.104 --> 21:46.772
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT HE

21:46.772 --> 21:47.907
REMAINS ONE OF THE 20TH

21:47.907 --> 21:49.508
CENTURY'S MOST PROFOUND

21:49.508 --> 21:50.676
CREATORS.

21:50.676 --> 21:52.811
>> THE REASON FOR HIS POPULARITY

21:52.811 --> 21:54.780
IS ALSO THE REASON FOR HIS

21:54.780 --> 21:56.549
ACTUAL SUCCESS AS AN ARTIST

21:56.549 --> 21:57.983
BECAUSE HE WAS SO COMMITTED TO

21:57.983 --> 21:59.018
CHANGE.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.519
I MEAN, YOU CANNOT ENGAGE WITH

22:00.519 --> 22:02.188
SPACE NOW WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING

22:02.188 --> 22:04.323
WITH WHAT HE'S HELPED US

22:04.323 --> 22:23.442
INTERACT WITH AS SCULPTURE.

22:23.442 --> 22:25.211
>> Sreenivasan: THIS WEEK MARKED

22:25.211 --> 22:27.146
THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF

22:27.146 --> 22:28.047
HURRICANE SANDY.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.448
AND HERE IN NEW YORK CITY THE

22:29.448 --> 22:30.382
RECOVERY HAS BEEN VERY UNEVEN

22:30.382 --> 22:31.650
IT'S SOMETHING THAT PHOTOGRAPHER

22:31.650 --> 22:32.851
NATHAN KENSINGER HAS DOCUMENTED

22:32.851 --> 22:34.220
IN A SERIES OF PHOTO ESSAYS FOR

22:34.220 --> 22:37.356
THE WEBSITE CURBED.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.657
IN THIS WATERFRONT COMMUNITY IN

22:38.657 --> 22:40.326
SOUTHERN QUEENS, FLOODING CAUSED

22:40.326 --> 22:42.962
A FIRE THAT BURNED MORE THAN 100

22:42.962 --> 22:43.963
HOMES.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.364
>> AND IT WAS KIND OF A

22:45.364 --> 22:46.632
WASTELAND, IT HAD REALLY JUST

22:46.632 --> 22:48.033
BURNED OUT A HUGE SECTION OF

22:48.033 --> 22:49.235
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD ALL AROUND

22:49.235 --> 22:50.269
YOU, YOU WERE SURROUNDED JUST BY

22:50.269 --> 22:51.370
THE SMOKING REMAINS OF THESE

22:51.370 --> 22:52.905
HOMES THAT HAD BEEN COMPLETELY

22:52.905 --> 22:57.977
DESTROYED BY THE STORM.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.845
>> Sreenivasan: THIS IS WHAT IT

22:59.845 --> 23:02.147
LOOKED LIKE A YEAR AGO.

23:02.147 --> 23:04.450
AND THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

23:04.450 --> 23:05.117
TODAY.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.051
>> IT WAS A SHOCK TO SEE HOW

23:06.051 --> 23:07.052
MUCH THEY HAD REBUILT, IT WAS

23:07.052 --> 23:07.920
PRETTY AMAZING TO SEE.

23:07.920 --> 23:08.954
IT HAD GONE FROM BEING

23:08.954 --> 23:10.055
COMPLETELY BURN OUT AND NOTHING

23:10.055 --> 23:11.156
THERE TO ROW UPON ROW OF HOUSES.

23:11.156 --> 23:12.091
>> Sreenivasan: BUT SEVERAL

23:12.091 --> 23:13.158
OTHER SHORE COMMUNITIES HERE IN

23:13.158 --> 23:14.093
STATEN ISLAND HAVE GONE IN THE

23:14.093 --> 23:15.294
OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

23:15.294 --> 23:16.895
RIGHT AFTER THE STORM, KENSINGER

23:16.895 --> 23:18.430
MET JEAN LAURIE.

23:18.430 --> 23:19.698
>> HER HOUSE HAD BEEN VERY

23:19.698 --> 23:22.534
DAMAGED BY THE STORM, BUT SHE

23:22.534 --> 23:23.902
HAD SET UP OUT FRONT OF HER HOME

23:23.902 --> 23:24.870
THIS WHOLE STATION TO HELP GIVE

23:24.870 --> 23:25.904
PEOPLE FOOD AND WATER AND WARM

23:25.904 --> 23:27.506
CLOTHES.

23:27.506 --> 23:28.307
SHE REALLY WANTED TO BRING HER

23:28.307 --> 23:30.075
NEIGHBORHOOD BACK, EVEN THOUGH

23:30.075 --> 23:31.410
SANDY HAD JUST HAPPENED.
