JUDY WOODRUFF: Fifty percent
of health care spending in
the U.S. can be traced to just

00:04.066 --> 00:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
5 percent of the population.

00:06.133 --> 00:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are the sickest and often
poorest Americans who spend much
of their time cycling in and

00:11.900 --> 00:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out of costly emergency care.

00:14.133 --> 00:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While congressional leaders
square off toward a vote next
week on the future of the health

00:18.633 --> 00:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care law, there are pilot
projects on the ground that
are focused on how to improve

00:24.966 --> 00:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
treating this group of patients
and also to save money.

00:27.333 --> 00:30.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's even the case
in remote areas.

00:30.633 --> 00:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent
Jackie Judd has our report
from Kalispell, Montana.

00:35.100 --> 00:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Not so long ago,
Sheran Greene and her beloved
dog were living in a car in

00:42.200 --> 00:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
downtown Kalispell, Montana,
and routinely heading to the
local emergency room because

00:47.966 --> 00:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of chronic lung disease and the
need for an electrical outlet.

00:51.500 --> 00:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAN GREENE, Patient: I
was there like clockwork
every day, sometimes
being treated, sometimes

00:58.533 --> 01:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
having to charge up my oxygen
machine, which I used, because
I had no electricity, sometimes

01:05.533 --> 01:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just getting out of the cold.

01:07.733 --> 01:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: It is this cycle
of patients going in and out
of the hospital, at great

01:14.733 --> 01:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cost, with not much benefit,
that the group around this
table is trying to break.

01:17.833 --> 01:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: How can we avoid some
of these emergency room visits
that really are not necessary?

01:24.666 --> 01:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: A pilot program
funded by the federal government
and a foundation began

01:29.233 --> 01:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
late last year in Kalispell,
Billings and Helena.

01:31.566 --> 01:32.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: How are you?

01:32.633 --> 01:34.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Tired.

01:34.633 --> 01:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Health care players
already in the community now
team up in a very deliberate

01:38.600 --> 01:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way to identify high-needs
patients and to go well
beyond the traditional
bounds of medical

01:45.333 --> 01:47.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

01:47.366 --> 01:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LARA SHADWICK, Mountain-Pacific
Quality Health: Do you think
you can find housing that'll

01:48.333 --> 01:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
take your Section 8 voucher?

01:49.033 --> 01:50.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Oh, yes.

01:50.566 --> 01:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Lara Shadwick
directs the Montana program.

01:53.133 --> 01:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LARA SHADWICK: Some of the
themes really rest on social
determinants of health, lack of

01:57.866 --> 02:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
transportation, housing
insecurity, food insecurity,
economics, finances.

02:04.933 --> 02:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Those are really some
of the drivers that
are the commonalities
for these patients.

02:07.766 --> 02:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: The Kalispell
care team runs lean.

02:11.600 --> 02:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are community
health workers, like Jane
Emmert, who are trained
to manage non-medical

02:18.566 --> 02:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issues works, and the head
of the team, registered
nurse Lesly Starling.

02:21.833 --> 02:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Together, they aim to reset the
paths these patients are on.

02:26.166 --> 02:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LESLY STARLING, Kalispell
Regional Healthcare:
They're so sick.

02:27.666 --> 02:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have gotten so used
to the way that they live.

02:30.333 --> 02:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do feel like that patients get
very used to their environment,
and they get very used

02:36.066 --> 02:37.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to their choices.

02:37.300 --> 02:39.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They get very used
to their lifestyle.

02:39.400 --> 02:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not -- it's almost
like they build up an immunity
to what their life looks like.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: David Dixon was
once a member of an emergency
medical team and a fishing

02:49.900 --> 02:51.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and hunting guide.

02:51.933 --> 02:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since a disabling motorcycle
accident, he struggles with
chronic pain and nausea, overuse

02:57.800 --> 03:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of medications and episodes
of depression and anxiety.

03:02.266 --> 03:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In a 14-month period, Dixon
went to the E.R. 42 times.

03:06.666 --> 03:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID DIXON, Patient: I just
want to have a better life.

03:11.233 --> 03:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to be able to wake
up in the morning and
have a halfway decent day.

03:16.233 --> 03:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would like to be able to make
plans for tomorrow morning.

03:19.933 --> 03:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: In just a few
weeks, the team has helped
Dixon to reconnect with a pain

03:26.900 --> 03:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specialist and link him up to
a pharmacist to sort out the
many medications he is on.

03:32.366 --> 03:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Are you taking that
one also pretty regularly?

03:35.066 --> 03:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID DIXON: There's so many
medicines I'm taking, that I
don't know which ones are really

03:39.633 --> 03:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
helping and which ones
aren't at this point.

03:41.633 --> 03:43.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: OK.

03:43.700 --> 03:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Dixon, like so
many high-needs patients,
has mental health issues.

03:46.533 --> 03:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Specialists in Kalispell are
in short supply, so Starling
typically gets advice from an

03:53.000 --> 03:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
expert some distance away about
how best to work with patients.

03:57.233 --> 04:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: It sounds like you have
been using a lot of those, some
of the motivational interviewing

04:00.666 --> 04:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
skills that we have been
talking about, finding
what kind of barriers
there are for him, finding

04:06.700 --> 04:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what his goals are.

04:08.833 --> 04:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Sometimes, a
patient's need is as basic
as a roof over one's head.

04:15.333 --> 04:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The team found Sheran Greene
an affordable apartment, which
is no easy task in Kalispell.

04:21.600 --> 04:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Starling acts as a liaison to
Greene's primary care doctor.

04:26.266 --> 04:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And other community workers
literally deliver Greene to
Dr. Jonathan Anderson's door.

04:31.233 --> 04:32.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

04:32.633 --> 04:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JONATHAN ANDERSON,
Greene's Physician: Good.

04:33.900 --> 04:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SHERAN GREENE: So,
do I have a heart?

04:34.433 --> 04:35.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JONATHAN ANDERSON:
It's still beating.

04:37.133 --> 04:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's allowing people into
her life, is what she's doing.

04:40.333 --> 04:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Before, it was basically the
E.R. and the hospital, and then
she'd come in for follow-up

04:44.733 --> 04:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
visits here, and then she'd
bounce around and come back.

04:47.733 --> 04:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now she's allowing people from
the community to come in, and
allow them to help, either

04:52.666 --> 04:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
help her move things, allow
them to kind of check in on
her and make sure she's doing

04:57.000 --> 04:59.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all right.

04:59.100 --> 05:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: When Greene was
homeless, in one six-month
period, her Medicare charges

05:02.833 --> 05:05.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were $100,000.

05:05.400 --> 05:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Since November, hospital
charges are less than $6,000.

05:10.100 --> 05:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By the time this pilot
program ends, the hope is over
$2 million will be saved.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Programs like these first
came to urban areas.

05:20.066 --> 05:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rolling one out in a vast rural
state like Montana is a very
different kind of experiment,

05:26.466 --> 05:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with very unique challenges,
starting with simple geography.

05:29.966 --> 05:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE EMMERT, Director, ASSIST:
Sometimes, we're going on
mountainous roads that are

05:33.766 --> 05:35.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
icy and treacherous.

05:35.766 --> 05:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, they're narrow
dirt roads that you aren't
sure that you want to go down.

05:41.333 --> 05:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: To get to a patient
can be a 60-mile round trip.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So Emmert frequently heads
out on her own to their homes,
as she did on this day, to

05:51.966 --> 05:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visit 25-year-old Mackenzie
Kramer, who is slowly
recovering from major surgery.

06:00.600 --> 06:05.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE EMMERT: So, if you try to
do any of this, and it's tough
for you, just know what we'd

06:06.433 --> 06:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be glad to help you fill it out.

06:08.500 --> 06:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Emmert is there to
help him manage the paperwork
for disability, and to put him

06:14.133 --> 06:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in touch with Starling, who
can check up on many more
patients if she stays behind in

06:19.200 --> 06:20.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her Kalispell office.

06:20.433 --> 06:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LESLY STARLING: How
has the pain been?

06:23.333 --> 06:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: It's been manageable.

06:25.766 --> 06:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's getting better, I think.

06:27.933 --> 06:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: The team also
gently pushes Kramer to think
about his future once his health

06:34.200 --> 06:35.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stabilizes.

06:35.733 --> 06:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE EMMERT: He's got to have
something to look forward to.

06:37.833 --> 06:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that's why we're looking into
possibilities with college, or
a job, that he could reclaim

06:43.700 --> 06:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the life of a 25-year-old again.

06:45.733 --> 06:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Part of the goal is to help
you connect to things you
might not have already.

06:51.666 --> 06:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Somebody that knows
where to go, how to do it.

06:53.166 --> 06:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: You have a
whole team of people, right?

06:55.333 --> 06:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Well, I have a
whole team of people.

06:57.433 --> 07:01.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JACKIE JUDD: Progress
with these patients can
come in fits and starts.

07:01.600 --> 07:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Less than 24 hours after a home
visit filled with encouragement
to manage his illnesses

07:07.966 --> 07:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
differently, David Dixon
takes himself back to the E.R.

07:11.700 --> 07:13.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: What happened?

07:13.700 --> 07:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID DIXON: I woke up nauseous
and vomiting, and took my
medicines and couldn't keep my

07:19.166 --> 07:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
medicines down, so I went for
a trip to the hospital again.

07:23.200 --> 07:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Dixon's team
wasn't surprised that he went
to the hospital, his visit a

07:30.233 --> 07:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reminder of how fragile these
patients are and how much work
it takes to break the cycle.

07:36.133 --> 07:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID DIXON: It's taken
years to get me where I am.

07:38.933 --> 07:41.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're starting
to understand it.

07:41.066 --> 07:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're starting to get programs
together that fill in the gaps
in the medical profession,

07:46.933 --> 07:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where I had problems before.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't know everything.

07:50.200 --> 07:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not a magic wand, but
at least they're trying.

07:53.500 --> 07:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: The pilot program
has another year to prove
these intensive interventions

08:00.433 --> 08:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can succeed, and, if so,
whether there is the funding
and the will to make them a new

08:05.633 --> 08:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
standard of care for the most
challenging people to treat.

08:11.900 --> 08:15.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "NewsHour,"
this is Jackie Judd
in Kalispell, Montana.

08:17.200 --> 08:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two quick
notes about Jackie's story.

08:20.800 --> 08:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is not yet clear
whether the moves by the
president and Republicans
to replace the Affordable

08:25.533 --> 08:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Care Act will affect the funding
of programs like this one.
