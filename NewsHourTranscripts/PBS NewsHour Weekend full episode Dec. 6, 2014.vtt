00:49.116 --> 00:50.617
KILLED IN A FAILED RESCUE

00:50.617 --> 00:52.019
ATTEMPT IN YEMEN.

00:52.019 --> 00:53.420
33-YEAR-OLD PHOTOJOURNALIST LUKE

00:53.420 --> 00:55.155
SOMERS HAD BEEN HELD BY AL QAEDA

00:55.155 --> 00:56.657
MILITANTS FOR NEARLY A YEAR.

00:56.657 --> 00:57.758
THE GROUP RECENTLY ISSUED A

00:57.758 --> 00:59.793
VIDEOTAPE, THREATENING HIS LIFE.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.128
SOMERS WAS FATALLY SHOT BY HIS

01:01.128 --> 01:02.796
CAPTORS LAST NIGHT WHEN U.S.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.131
SPECIAL FORCES LAUNCHED THE RAID

01:04.131 --> 01:05.465
ON A VILLAGE IN THE SOUTHERN

01:05.465 --> 01:07.034
PROVINCE OF SHABWA.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.769
HE DIED FROM THOSE WOUNDS.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.237
ONE LOCAL TRIBAL LEADER SAID

01:10.237 --> 01:11.872
COMMANDOS LANDED IN HELICOPTERS,

01:11.872 --> 01:13.640
DEPLOYED CONCUSSION GRENADES AND

01:13.640 --> 01:15.809
STORMED FOUR DIFFERENT HOUSES.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.678
A SOUTH AFRICAN CAPTIVE WAS ALSO

01:17.678 --> 01:19.313
KILLED IN THE SIEGE.

01:19.313 --> 01:20.714

SOMER'S FAMILY.

01:31.858 --> 01:33.060
JOINING ME NOW VIA SKYPE FROM

01:33.060 --> 01:34.194
BAHRAIN IS "NEW YORK TIMES"

01:34.194 --> 01:35.562
REPORTER ERIC SCHMITT.

01:35.562 --> 01:37.297
SO, ERIC, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT

01:37.297 --> 01:40.200
THE DETAILS OF THIS OPERATION?

01:40.200 --> 01:41.234
>> WELL, OVERNIGHT FRIDAY,

01:41.234 --> 01:43.136
EARLY MORNING IN YEMEN, ABOUT

01:43.136 --> 01:44.705
THREE DOZEN SPECIAL OPERATIONS

01:44.705 --> 01:47.140
FORCES, INCLUDING NAVY SEAL

01:47.140 --> 01:49.376
TEAM 6, SWEPT INTO A SMALL

01:49.376 --> 01:51.912
VILLAGE IN SOUTHERN YEMEN WITH

01:51.912 --> 01:53.246
THE OBJECT OF TRYING TO FREE

01:53.246 --> 01:54.948
LUKE SOMERS, THE AMERICAN

01:54.948 --> 01:56.049
PHOTOJOURNALIST WHO WAS HELD

01:56.049 --> 01:57.584
HOSTAGE THERE.

01:57.584 --> 01:58.986
THEY CAME IN ON OSPREY

01:58.986 --> 02:01.888
HELICOPTER, OSPREY AIRCRAFT, AND

02:01.888 --> 02:03.824
APPROACHED ON FOOT TO A WALLED

02:03.824 --> 02:05.092
COMPOUND AND GOT TO WITHIN 100

02:05.092 --> 02:06.927
YARDS OF THE COMPOUND WHEN

02:06.927 --> 02:09.696
SOMEHOW THEY WERE DETECTED BY

02:09.696 --> 02:11.598
THE ARMED GUNMEN INSIDE WHO WERE

02:11.598 --> 02:13.333
HOLDING THE HOSTAGES.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.634
A GUN BATTLE BROKE OUT.

02:14.634 --> 02:17.637
AND BEFORE THE COMMANDOS COULD

02:17.637 --> 02:19.840
GET INSIDE THE COMPOUND, BOTH

02:19.840 --> 02:23.510
HOSTAGES HAD BEEN SHOT AS THE

02:23.510 --> 02:25.979
MILITANTS FLED.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.648
THE COMMANDOS HURRIED TO GET

02:28.648 --> 02:30.017
BOTH HOSTAGES-- LUKE SOMERS AND

02:30.017 --> 02:32.085
A SOUTH AFRICAN-- ABOARD THE

02:32.085 --> 02:34.054
AIRCRAFT AND OUT TO THE NAVY

02:34.054 --> 02:35.956
SHIP WHICH HAD LAUNCHED THE

02:35.956 --> 02:36.556
MISSION.

02:36.556 --> 02:37.991
UNFORTUNATELY, ONE OF THE

02:37.991 --> 02:39.726
HOSTAGES DIED EN ROUTE.

02:39.726 --> 02:40.660
THE OTHER DIED ON THE SHIP

02:40.660 --> 02:41.495
ITSELF.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.362
>> Sreenivasan: AND THIS

02:42.362 --> 02:43.563
WASN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE

02:43.563 --> 02:44.931
TRIED TO RESCUE MR. SOMERS,

02:44.931 --> 02:46.833
RIGHT?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.902
>> NO, JUST A LITTLE LESS THAN

02:48.902 --> 02:50.771
TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN ANOTHER

02:50.771 --> 02:52.472
SPECIAL OPERATIONS TEAM ALSO

02:52.472 --> 02:54.574
CONDUCTED A RAID ON WHAT THEY

02:54.574 --> 02:57.377
BELIEVED TO BE A SITE HOLDING

02:57.377 --> 02:58.979
HOSTAGES, AND THEY DID RESCUE

02:58.979 --> 03:00.847
ABOUT EIGHT OTHER HOSTAGES,

03:00.847 --> 03:02.282
INCLUDING SEVERAL YEMENIS, BUT

03:02.282 --> 03:04.351
MR. SOMERS HAD BEEN MOVED WITH

03:04.351 --> 03:06.186
THREE OR FOUR OTHER WESTERNERS.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.187
AND SO THIS WAS A FOLLOW-UP

03:07.187 --> 03:09.089
EFFORT TO TRY AND RESCUE THEM

03:09.089 --> 03:11.525
BEFORE A DEADLINE IMPOSED BY THE

03:11.525 --> 03:12.692
AL QAEDA AFFILIATE IN YEMEN

03:12.692 --> 03:14.194
EXPIRED ON SATURDAY.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.062
>> Sreenivasan: WERE THERE ANY

03:15.062 --> 03:16.730
OTHER INJURIES, ANY MEMBERS OF

03:16.730 --> 03:18.131
THE U.S. SPECIAL FORCES THAT

03:18.131 --> 03:19.499
WERE INJURED OR CIVILIANS ON

03:19.499 --> 03:21.368
THE GROUND OR THE PEOPLE WHO

03:21.368 --> 03:23.970
WERE HOLDING HIM HOSTAGE?

03:23.970 --> 03:25.605
>> THERE HAVE BEEN SOME MEDIA

03:25.605 --> 03:27.240
REPORTS OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES,

03:27.240 --> 03:28.141
BUT I HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO

03:28.141 --> 03:29.576
CONFIRM THAT.

03:29.576 --> 03:30.444
THERE WERE NO MILITARY

03:30.444 --> 03:32.979
CASUALTIES AS PART OF THIS TEAM.

03:32.979 --> 03:34.214
IT'S A DANGEROUS PART, A REMOTE

03:34.214 --> 03:35.849
PART OF SOUTHERN YEMEN, OF

03:35.849 --> 03:38.151
COURSE, THAT THE AL QAEDA

03:38.151 --> 03:41.088
AFFILIATE THERE HAS CONTROLLED

03:41.088 --> 03:42.722
FOR SOME TIME NOW, SO THIS IS A

03:42.722 --> 03:43.890
VERY DANGEROUS, HIGH-RISK

03:43.890 --> 03:44.791
MISSION.

03:44.791 --> 03:45.759
>> Sreenivasan: AND THIS IS A

03:45.759 --> 03:48.195
JOINT OPERATION BETWEEN U.S.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.463
FORCES AND YEMENI FORCES.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.730
HOW HAS THAT BEEN GOING OVER THE

03:50.730 --> 03:52.766
PAST YEAR OR TWO YEARS AS THESE

03:52.766 --> 03:53.633
GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO

03:53.633 --> 03:55.769
WORK TOGETHER?

03:55.769 --> 03:56.636
>> WELL, THE GOVERNMENT IN

03:56.636 --> 03:57.804
YEMEN, UNDER PRESIDENT HADI,

03:57.804 --> 04:00.073
HAS BEEN A VERY EFFECTIVE

04:00.073 --> 04:01.508
PARTNER IN THE COUNTERTERRORISM

04:01.508 --> 04:02.642
FIELD.

04:02.642 --> 04:04.177
THE U.S. HAS HAD TRAINERS INSIDE

04:04.177 --> 04:05.579
OF YEMEN, TRAINING SOME OF THEIR

04:05.579 --> 04:07.280
COUNTERTERRORISM AND SPECIAL

04:07.280 --> 04:08.815
OPERATIONS FORCES, AND THERE

04:08.815 --> 04:10.584
WERE A FEW YEMENI COUNTER-

04:10.584 --> 04:12.452
TERRORISM SPECIALISTS ONBOARD

04:12.452 --> 04:13.320
THIS MISSION, BUT IT WAS

04:13.320 --> 04:15.589
PRIMARILY A U.S. OPERATION TO

04:15.589 --> 04:17.224
RESCUE THE AMERICAN AND ANYBODY

04:17.224 --> 04:18.558
ELSE THEY COULD FIND IN THIS

04:18.558 --> 04:19.593
COMPOUND.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.128
>> Sreenivasan: EVERYONE IN

04:21.128 --> 04:22.863
THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZES AND

04:22.863 --> 04:25.432
REMEMBERS IN 2011 THE SUCCESSFUL

04:25.432 --> 04:27.434
OPERATION TO KILL OSAMA BIN

04:27.434 --> 04:28.802
LADEN, TO CAPTURE OR KILL OSAMA

04:28.802 --> 04:31.004
BIN LADEN, BUT SINCE THEN, AT

04:31.004 --> 04:32.506
LEAST IN THE RECENT PAST, THERE

04:32.506 --> 04:33.773
HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF FAILURES

04:33.773 --> 04:34.875
AS WELL, HIGHLIGHTING HOW

04:34.875 --> 04:36.176
DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS THESE

04:36.176 --> 04:37.010
ARE.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.345
>> EXACTLY.

04:38.345 --> 04:41.381
IT UNDERSCORES THE FRAGILITY OF

04:41.381 --> 04:42.916
THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THESE

04:42.916 --> 04:44.985
SPECIAL OPERATIONS OFFICERS

04:44.985 --> 04:47.320
HAVE TO USE WHEN THEY GO IN.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.289
IN THIS CASE, THEY WERE UNDER

04:49.289 --> 04:50.690
SOME TIME PRESSURES.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.159
THEY KNEW THE HOSTAGES WERE

04:52.159 --> 04:53.393
THREATENED WITH DEATH BY THE

04:53.393 --> 04:54.594
END OF SATURDAY-- OR AT LEAST

04:54.594 --> 04:56.129
THE AMERICAN HOSTAGE WAS.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.430
BECAUSE OF THE PREVIOUS RAID

04:57.430 --> 04:59.399
JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,

04:59.399 --> 05:00.667
THE MILITANTS KNEW THAT THE

05:00.667 --> 05:03.370
AMERICANS MIGHT BE COMING AGAIN.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.638
AND SO THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE

05:04.638 --> 05:06.540
WAS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT

05:06.540 --> 05:07.474
TO ACHIEVE IN A MISSION LIKE

05:07.474 --> 05:08.074
THIS.

05:08.074 --> 05:09.543
AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT, IT

05:09.543 --> 05:11.044
DOES UNDERSCORE THE LIMITATIONS

05:11.044 --> 05:12.212
OF MILITARY FORCE IN TRYING TO

05:12.212 --> 05:14.347
RESCUE CAPTURED CITIZENS LIKE

05:14.347 --> 05:15.148
MR. SOMERS.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.049
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, ERIC

05:16.049 --> 05:17.083
SCHMITT OF THE "NEW YORK TIMES"

05:17.083 --> 05:18.852
REPORTING FOR US FROM BAHRAIN

05:18.852 --> 05:20.020
VIA SKYPE.

05:20.020 --> 05:20.754
THANKS SO MUCH.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.155
>> THANK YOU.

05:22.155 --> 05:22.956
>> Sreenivasan: EARLIER TODAY, I

05:22.956 --> 05:24.391
SPOKE WITH THE NEWSHOUR'S TIK

05:24.391 --> 05:25.759
ROOT, WHO WORKED WITH LUKE

05:25.759 --> 05:27.060
SOMERS IN YEMEN.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.228
>> WHEN HE WAS KIDNAPPED IN

05:28.228 --> 05:31.131
SEPTEMBER 2013, IT REALLY HIT

05:31.131 --> 05:32.199
HOME WITH A LOT OF US.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.401
HE WAS KIDNAPPED FROM IN FRONT

05:34.401 --> 05:35.435
OF A SUPERMARKET THAT WE ALL

05:35.435 --> 05:37.771
SHOPPED AT AT A TIME OF DAY WHEN

05:37.771 --> 05:39.005
WE WOULD HAVE... COULD HAVE GONE

05:39.005 --> 05:40.207
THERE.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.474
AND HE WAS DOING NOTHING OUT OF

05:41.474 --> 05:42.275
THE ORDINARY.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.044
I THINK WE... WE WERE VERY MUCH

05:44.044 --> 05:45.512
AWARE THAT, YOU KNOW, IT COULD

05:45.512 --> 05:47.080
HAVE BEEN ANY ONE OF US.

05:47.080 --> 05:47.781
>> Sreenivasan: TO SEE MY

05:47.781 --> 05:49.082
ENTIRE CONVERSATION WITH TIK

05:49.082 --> 05:51.651
ROOT, VISIT newshour.pbs.org.

05:51.651 --> 05:52.786
MEANWHILE, A RAID IN NORTH-

05:52.786 --> 05:54.187
WESTERN PAKISTAN REPORTEDLY

05:54.187 --> 05:56.122
SUCCEEDED IN KILLING A SENIOR AL

05:56.122 --> 05:57.090
QAEDA MILITANT.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.592
PAKISTAN SAYS ITS TROOPS KILLED

05:58.592 --> 06:00.827
ADNAN EL SHUKRIJUMAH NEAR THE

06:00.827 --> 06:02.829
AFGHAN BORDER THIS MORNING.

06:02.829 --> 06:03.964
THE F.B.I. SUSPECTED HIM OF

06:03.964 --> 06:05.365
BEING ONE OF THE LEADERS OF "AL

06:05.365 --> 06:06.967
QAEDA'S EXTERNAL OPERATIONS

06:06.967 --> 06:07.801
PROGRAM."

06:07.801 --> 06:08.835
HE WAS ACCUSED OF PLOTTING TO

06:08.835 --> 06:10.470
BOMB TRAINS IN NEW YORK AND

06:10.470 --> 06:11.972
LONDON IN 2009.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.006
PAKISTAN SAYS TWO OTHER

06:13.006 --> 06:14.274
MILITANTS WERE ALSO KILLED IN

06:14.274 --> 06:15.976
THE RAID, AS WAS A PAKISTANI

06:15.976 --> 06:16.876
SOLDIER.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.478
OUTGOING DEFENSE SECRETARY CHUCK

06:18.478 --> 06:19.779
HAGEL SAYS THE U.S. WILL KEEP A

06:19.779 --> 06:21.481
LARGER FORCE IN AFGHANISTAN THAN

06:21.481 --> 06:23.116
IT ORIGINALLY PLANNED.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.451
HAGEL ANNOUNCED IN KABUL TODAY

06:24.451 --> 06:26.920
THAT UP TO 10,800 TROOPS WILL

06:26.920 --> 06:28.221
REMAIN IN AFGHANISTAN AT THE

06:28.221 --> 06:29.589
BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR.

06:29.589 --> 06:30.924
THAT'S 1,000 MORE TROOPS THAN

06:30.924 --> 06:32.392
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT INITIALLY

06:32.392 --> 06:33.193
ANNOUNCED.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.160
KABUL'S SEEN AN UPTICK IN

06:34.160 --> 06:35.328
TALIBAN ATTACKS OVER THE LAST

06:35.328 --> 06:35.895
FEW WEEKS.

06:35.895 --> 06:36.997
SECRETARY HAGEL SAYS THE

06:36.997 --> 06:38.398
VIOLENCE WAS PREDICTABLE SINCE

06:38.398 --> 06:40.033
MILITANTS ARE TRYING TO DISRUPT

06:40.033 --> 06:41.868
AFGHANISTAN'S NEW GOVERNMENT,

06:41.868 --> 06:43.436
LED BY PRESIDENT GHANI.

06:43.436 --> 06:44.571
AND IN THE PHILIPPINES, MORE

06:44.571 --> 06:46.740
THAN 650,000 PEOPLE EVACUATED

06:46.740 --> 06:48.508
FROM COASTAL VILLAGES JUST AS

06:48.508 --> 06:50.710
TYPHOON HAGUPIT MADE LANDFALL

06:50.710 --> 06:51.845
THIS MORNING.

06:51.845 --> 06:52.812
THE STORM WEAKENED BEFORE

06:52.812 --> 06:53.780
HITTING THE EASTERN COAST, BUT

06:53.780 --> 06:56.283
GUSTS WERE STILL PEAKING AT 120

06:56.283 --> 06:57.417
MILES PER HOUR.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.485
THE TYPHOON HAS KNOCKED OUT

06:58.485 --> 06:59.719
POWER, DOWNED TREES AND

06:59.719 --> 07:01.421
CANCELLED MORE THAN 150 FLIGHTS

07:01.421 --> 07:02.355
SINCE YESTERDAY.

07:02.355 --> 07:03.757
AND A GRIM STATISTIC IN THE

07:03.757 --> 07:05.492
FIGHT AGAINST EBOLA IN WEST

07:05.492 --> 07:07.160
AFRICA-- THE VIRUS HAS CLAIMED

07:07.160 --> 07:08.895
THE LIVES OF TWO MORE DOCTORS IN

07:08.895 --> 07:10.063
SIERRA LEONE.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.031
THAT BRINGS THE TOTAL TO AT

07:11.031 --> 07:12.532
LEAST NINE DOCTORS KILLED IN

07:12.532 --> 07:13.700
THAT COUNTRY SINCE THE OUTBREAK

07:13.700 --> 07:14.467
BEGAN.

07:14.467 --> 07:15.435
THE NUMBER IS SIGNIFICANT

07:15.435 --> 07:16.836
BECAUSE, OF THE THREE MOST

07:16.836 --> 07:18.872
AFFECTED COUNTRIES, SIERRA LEONE

07:18.872 --> 07:20.273
HAS THE HIGHEST HEALTHCARE

07:20.273 --> 07:21.775
WORKER FATALITY RATE.

07:21.775 --> 07:22.709
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION

07:22.709 --> 07:24.844
REPORTS AT LEAST 77% OF

07:24.844 --> 07:25.879
HEALTHCARE WORKERS WHO

07:25.879 --> 07:27.847
CONTRACTED EBOLA IN SIERRA LEONE

07:27.847 --> 07:28.982
HAVE DIED.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.651
ACROSS ALL OF WEST AFRICA, 607

07:31.651 --> 07:33.019
HEALTH CARE WORKERS HAVE BEEN

07:33.019 --> 07:35.955
INFECTED, AND 341 HAVE DIED

07:35.955 --> 07:37.757
SINCE THE OUTBREAK BEGAN IN

07:37.757 --> 07:38.958
MARCH.

07:38.958 --> 07:39.826
HERE IN NEW YORK, POLICE ARE

07:39.826 --> 07:41.628
BRACING FOR A FOURTH NIGHT OF

07:41.628 --> 07:42.962
PROTESTS SINCE THE GRAND JURY

07:42.962 --> 07:44.364
ANNOUNCED IT WOULD NOT INDICT

07:44.364 --> 07:45.799
THE OFFICER WHO KILLED ERIC

07:45.799 --> 07:46.533
GARNER.

07:46.533 --> 07:47.600
MOST OF THE PROTESTS HAVE BEEN

07:47.600 --> 07:49.035
PEACEFUL, BUT THE N.Y.P.D. DID

07:49.035 --> 07:50.270
ARREST ABOUT 20 PEOPLE LAST

07:50.270 --> 07:51.738
NIGHT FOR BEING DISORDERLY AND

07:51.738 --> 07:52.906
BLOCKING TRAFFIC.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.207
MEANTIME, MORE PROTESTS ARE

07:54.207 --> 07:55.608
EXPECTED FOLLOWING TODAY'S

07:55.608 --> 07:57.310
FUNERAL FOR ANOTHER PERSON

07:57.310 --> 07:58.578
KILLED BY POLICE.

07:58.578 --> 08:00.480
AN OFFICER SHOT AN UNARMED BLACK

08:00.480 --> 08:02.248
MAN NAMED AKAI GURLEY IN A

08:02.248 --> 08:03.983
BROOKLYN HOUSING COMPLEX LAST

08:03.983 --> 08:04.617
MONTH.

08:04.617 --> 08:05.852
POLICE CHIEF BILL BRATTON SAYS

08:05.852 --> 08:07.387
THE OFFICER ACCIDENTALLY

08:07.387 --> 08:08.855
DISCHARGED HIS GUN.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.056
THE BROOKLYN D.A. IS CONVENING A

08:10.056 --> 08:11.691
GRAND JURY IN THE CASE.

08:11.691 --> 08:13.059
ON THE WEST COAST, EXPERTS SAY

08:13.059 --> 08:14.694
CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF

08:14.694 --> 08:16.763
THE MOST SEVERE THREE-YEAR

08:16.763 --> 08:19.899
DROUGHT IN THE LAST 1,200 YEARS.

08:19.899 --> 08:20.800
RESEARCHERS REPORT IN THE

08:20.800 --> 08:22.635
"AMERICAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION

08:22.635 --> 08:24.170
JOURNAL" THAT WHILE OTHER THREE-

08:24.170 --> 08:25.905
YEAR PERIODS HAVE BEEN DRY, THE

08:25.905 --> 08:27.640
CURRENT DROUGHT IS WORSE BECAUSE

08:27.640 --> 08:29.075
OF THE COMBINATION OF UNUSUALLY

08:29.075 --> 08:31.144
LOW RAINFALL AND RECORD-HIGH

08:31.144 --> 08:32.112
TEMPERATURES.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.480
ALSO IN CALIFORNIA TONIGHT, SO-

08:33.480 --> 08:34.981
CALLED "WILDLIFE KILLING

08:34.981 --> 08:36.983
CONTESTS" HAVE BEEN BANNED.

08:36.983 --> 08:38.151
THE CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME

08:38.151 --> 08:39.018
COMMISSION APPROVED THE

08:39.018 --> 08:40.653
UNPRECEDENTED BAN ON HUNTING

08:40.653 --> 08:42.088
DERBIES THIS WEEK.

08:42.088 --> 08:43.223
NOW, HUNTERS CAN NO LONGER

08:43.223 --> 08:44.357
COMPETE TO KILL THE MOST

08:44.357 --> 08:46.059
COYOTES, FOXES, BOBCATS,

08:46.059 --> 08:47.727
RACCOONS OR BADGERS TO WIN

08:47.727 --> 08:48.428
PRIZES.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.263
A CONSERVATIONIST GROUP PUSHED

08:50.263 --> 08:51.898
FOR THE BAN AFTER FINDING SOME

08:51.898 --> 08:53.166
PROTECTED SPECIES WERE GETTING

08:53.166 --> 08:55.168
KILLED IN THE CONTESTS.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.003
CALIFORNIA IS THE FIRST STATE TO

08:57.003 --> 08:58.905
IMPOSE SUCH A BAN.

09:08.748 --> 09:09.749
>> Sreenivasan: THE NATION HAS

09:09.749 --> 09:10.950
BEEN FOCUSED ON STATEN ISLAND,

09:10.950 --> 09:12.419
FERGUSON AND CLEVELAND IN THE

09:12.419 --> 09:13.686
LAST FEW WEEKS AS CITIZENS AND

09:13.686 --> 09:15.989
LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSESS HOW THEY

09:15.989 --> 09:17.490
HAVE AND HOW THEY SHOULD DEAL

09:17.490 --> 09:18.625
WITH ONE ANOTHER.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.593
THIS AS A NEW INVESTIGATION BY

09:20.593 --> 09:21.661
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL"

09:21.661 --> 09:23.029
REVEALS THAT ACCOUNTING FOR

09:23.029 --> 09:24.731
KILLINGS BY POLICE MAY BE

09:24.731 --> 09:26.466
GROSSLY UNDERESTIMATED.

09:26.466 --> 09:27.300
"WALL STREET JOURNAL" REPORTER

09:27.300 --> 09:28.668
ROB BARRY JOINS US NOW.

09:28.668 --> 09:29.736
SO, HOW DID YOU DO YOUR

09:29.736 --> 09:31.504
REPORTING AND WHAT DID YOU FIND?

09:31.504 --> 09:32.439
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.007
WHAT WE DID WAS WE ASKED ABOUT

09:34.007 --> 09:35.775
105 DEPARTMENTS TO GIVE US THE

09:35.775 --> 09:37.043
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

09:37.043 --> 09:39.145
KILLED OVER A FIVE- OR SIX-YEAR

09:39.145 --> 09:41.481
PERIOD, AND WE COMPARED THOSE

09:41.481 --> 09:42.182
NUMBERS TO WHAT HAD BEEN

09:42.182 --> 09:43.950
REPORTED TO THE F.B.I.

09:43.950 --> 09:46.252
AND WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS A

09:46.252 --> 09:47.187
LOT OF STUFF THAT WASN'T IN THE

09:47.187 --> 09:48.588
F.B.I.'S INFORMATION.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.389
>> Sreenivasan: YOU SAID THAT AT

09:49.389 --> 09:51.691
LEAST 550 POLICE KILLINGS

09:51.691 --> 09:54.127
BETWEEN 2007 AND 2012 NEVER MADE

09:54.127 --> 09:55.395
IT ON TO THE BOOKS?

09:55.395 --> 09:56.663
>> YEAH, AND THAT'S ONLY AMONG

09:56.663 --> 09:59.599
THE TOP 105, 110 LARGEST

09:59.599 --> 10:00.533
AGENCIES IN THE COUNTRY.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.235
SO THERE ARE 18,000

10:02.235 --> 10:03.503
JURISDICTIONS, SO, YOU KNOW,

10:03.503 --> 10:05.505
THAT'S JUST A SMALL ESTIMATE OF

10:05.505 --> 10:06.439
THE TOTAL.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.240
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY, SO, FOR

10:07.240 --> 10:09.976
EXAMPLE, SOME JURISDICTIONS

10:09.976 --> 10:11.044
COULD CALL SOMETHING A

10:11.044 --> 10:13.046
JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE VERSUS AN

10:13.046 --> 10:14.280
UNJUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE,

10:14.280 --> 10:15.582
DISCREPANCIES IN DEFINITIONS?

10:15.582 --> 10:16.149
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:16.149 --> 10:16.950
>> IT WAS A WIDE RANGE OF

10:16.950 --> 10:17.517
THINGS.

10:17.517 --> 10:18.384
THAT WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE

10:18.384 --> 10:19.219
ISSUES.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.153
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE IS

10:20.153 --> 10:21.521
WHAT ARE ESSENTIALLY CRIME

10:21.521 --> 10:24.090
REPORTS, AND AGENCIES WHO ARE

10:24.090 --> 10:26.025
FORCED TO REPORT INFORMATION

10:26.025 --> 10:27.427
ABOUT UNFORTUNATE EVENTS WHERE

10:27.427 --> 10:28.862
OFFICERS TAKE SOMEONE'S LIFE,

10:28.862 --> 10:29.596
THEY DON'T REALLY WANT TO

10:29.596 --> 10:32.398
INCLUDE THAT IN A CRIME REPORT.

10:32.398 --> 10:33.900
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT A CRIME IN

10:33.900 --> 10:34.434
THEIR EYES.

10:34.434 --> 10:35.835
IT WAS A JUSTIFIABLE EVENT.

10:35.835 --> 10:37.570
SO THERE WAS SOME CONCERN BY

10:37.570 --> 10:39.772
SOME AGENCIES ABOUT THAT ISSUE.

10:39.772 --> 10:40.840
THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF OTHER

10:40.840 --> 10:41.875
ISSUES INVOLVED.

10:41.875 --> 10:42.876
YOU HAD TECHNICAL ISSUES.

10:42.876 --> 10:43.943
SO YOU HAD DEPARTMENTS WHICH,

10:43.943 --> 10:45.311
YOU KNOW, AT LEAST THEY TOLD US

10:45.311 --> 10:46.379
THEY THOUGHT THAT THESE THINGS

10:46.379 --> 10:47.313
WERE BEING REPORTED.

10:47.313 --> 10:47.947
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE

10:47.947 --> 10:49.549
PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM.

10:49.549 --> 10:50.917
BUT WHEN THEY WENT AND LOOKED

10:50.917 --> 10:53.186
INTO THIS, WHEN WE SAID, "HEY,

10:53.186 --> 10:53.953
HERE ARE THE NUMBERS YOU

10:53.953 --> 10:55.755
REPORTED," MAYBE THERE WOULD BE

10:55.755 --> 10:57.357
ONE AND THEY TOLD US TEN.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.224
THEY LOOKED INTO IT AND SAID IT

10:58.224 --> 11:00.326
TURNS OUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN KEYING

11:00.326 --> 11:01.461
IT IN CORRECTLY.

11:01.461 --> 11:02.428
SO, THAT WAS ANOTHER ISSUE.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.731
I THINK THE LARGEST ISSUE WAS

11:04.731 --> 11:06.099
THAT THREE OF THE BIGGEST STATES

11:06.099 --> 11:07.867
IN THE COUNTRY-- NEW YORK,

11:07.867 --> 11:10.403
FLORIDA AND ILLINOIS-- HAVE

11:10.403 --> 11:12.105
ALMOST NOTHING REPORTED, AND

11:12.105 --> 11:13.206
THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE WAY THIS

11:13.206 --> 11:14.574
PROCESS WORKS.

11:14.574 --> 11:15.742
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN AN

11:15.742 --> 11:17.243
AGENCY WANTS TO SEND THIS

11:17.243 --> 11:18.978
INFORMATION TO THE F.B.I., THEY

11:18.978 --> 11:21.180
PASS IT THROUGH A STATE AGENCY

11:21.180 --> 11:21.981
FIRST.

11:21.981 --> 11:23.983
AND IN ALL THREE OF THOSE

11:23.983 --> 11:26.686
STATES' CASES, THERE ARE ISSUES,

11:26.686 --> 11:28.154
VARYING ISSUES WITH THE WAY THE

11:28.154 --> 11:29.856
STATES THEN TURN AND AROUND PASS

11:29.856 --> 11:30.890
UP TO THE F.B.I., SUCH THAT

11:30.890 --> 11:33.092
THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT

11:33.092 --> 11:34.594
JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDES FROM ANY

11:34.594 --> 11:35.428
OF THOSE STATES.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.563
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT YOU'RE

11:36.563 --> 11:37.430
ALSO SAYING HERE IS NOT

11:37.430 --> 11:38.798
EVERYBODY HAS TO REPORT.

11:38.798 --> 11:39.866
>> IT'S VOLUNTARILY.

11:39.866 --> 11:40.500
EXACTLY.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.601
AND WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH

11:41.601 --> 11:43.036
18,000 LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

11:43.036 --> 11:45.004
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, YOU KNOW, A

11:45.004 --> 11:47.073
LOT OF THEM SMALL.

11:47.073 --> 11:47.941
A LOT OF THESE AGENCIES ONLY

11:47.941 --> 11:49.742
HAVE, YOU KNOW, FIVE, TEN

11:49.742 --> 11:51.544
OFFICERS AT THEM.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.812
YOU KNOW, THESE EVENTS ARE VERY

11:52.812 --> 11:54.147
RARE.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.315
REPORTING THEM IS JUST NOT BUILT

11:55.315 --> 11:56.482
INTO THEIR PROCESS IN MANY

11:56.482 --> 11:57.216
CASES.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.017
>> Sreenivasan: SO WE'VE GOT

11:58.017 --> 11:58.918
DIFFERING DEFINITIONS.

11:58.918 --> 12:00.453
WE'VE GOT 18,000 JURISDICTIONS.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.088
IT'S ALL VOLUNTARY, AND I'M

12:02.088 --> 12:03.256
ASSUMING SOME OF THESE

12:03.256 --> 12:04.424
DEPARTMENTS ARE PRETTY SENSITIVE

12:04.424 --> 12:05.592
ABOUT THIS INFORMATION IN THE

12:05.592 --> 12:06.326
FIRST PLACE.

12:06.326 --> 12:06.993
>> YEAH, OF COURSE.

12:06.993 --> 12:09.262
I MEAN, EACH OF THESE THINGS ARE

12:09.262 --> 12:10.430
INFLAMMATORY OR POTENTIALLY

12:10.430 --> 12:12.498
INFLAMMATORY EVENTS, SO THERE

12:12.498 --> 12:14.167
WERE CONCERNS-- A LOT OF

12:14.167 --> 12:15.568
DEPARTMENTS ASKED ME, WHEN WE

12:15.568 --> 12:16.636
WENT TO THEM AND SAID, "WILL YOU

12:16.636 --> 12:18.004
PROVIDE US WITH THE NUMBER OF

12:18.004 --> 12:19.572
INCIDENTS YOU HAD," QUITE A FEW

12:19.572 --> 12:22.041
DEPARTMENTS ANSWERED FIRST

12:22.041 --> 12:23.242
SAYING, "WHY?

12:23.242 --> 12:24.077
YES, WE'LL GIVE IT TO YOU, BUT

12:24.077 --> 12:25.345
JUST TELL US WHY YOU WANT THIS."

12:25.345 --> 12:26.546
THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT

12:26.546 --> 12:28.681
IT BEING USED FOR COMPARISONS.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.316
WHEN WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING

12:30.316 --> 12:31.784
ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW I

12:31.784 --> 12:32.952
THINK YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT

12:32.952 --> 12:33.686
CONCERN.

12:33.686 --> 12:34.487
>> Sreenivasan: YOUR REPORTING

12:34.487 --> 12:35.622
IS NOT SAYING ALL COPS ARE BAD.

12:35.622 --> 12:36.623
YOU'RE JUST POINTING OUT THERE'S

12:36.623 --> 12:38.725
A DISCREPANCY IN HOW WE'RE

12:38.725 --> 12:39.692
REPORTING THE INFORMATION.

12:39.692 --> 12:42.895
IF THERE ARE GAPS IN THE DATA

12:42.895 --> 12:45.331
SET, HOW TO WE MAKE ANY POLICY

12:45.331 --> 12:47.800
BASED ON FAULTY NUMBERS?

12:47.800 --> 12:49.002
>> THAT'S A GREAT POINT, AND

12:49.002 --> 12:50.069
THAT'S WHY WE WERE LOOKING AT

12:50.069 --> 12:50.870
THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.171
WE WANTED TO GET A BENCHMARK.

12:52.171 --> 12:53.539
WE WANTED TO KNOW HOW OFTEN

12:53.539 --> 12:54.540
DOES THIS HAPPEN AND WHO DOES IT

12:54.540 --> 12:55.408
HAPPEN TO?

12:55.408 --> 12:58.177
WHEN WE TRIED TO DO THAT USING

12:58.177 --> 12:59.512
THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND

12:59.512 --> 13:00.546
TOOK IT TO EXPERTS, EVERYONE

13:00.546 --> 13:02.348
SAID, "WELL, YOU CAN'T REALLY DO

13:02.348 --> 13:04.784
THAT," AND WE SAID OKAY.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.252
AND THAT RAISED THE QUESTION OF

13:06.252 --> 13:07.620
WHY NOT?

13:07.620 --> 13:09.255
IN TERMS OF SOLUTIONS, AS TO

13:09.255 --> 13:11.924
WHAT WE WOULD DO FROM HERE, IT'S

13:11.924 --> 13:12.992
A COMPLICATED PROBLEM, AND WE

13:12.992 --> 13:14.227
DISCUSSED MOST OF THE REASONS

13:14.227 --> 13:15.161
WHY.

13:15.161 --> 13:17.930
SOME-- SOME OF THE PEOPLE

13:17.930 --> 13:20.366
INVOLVED IN THIS ARE WORKING NOW

13:20.366 --> 13:22.301
TOWARDS COMING UP WITH

13:22.301 --> 13:24.137
INCENTIVES, FINANCIAL INCENTIVES

13:24.137 --> 13:25.038
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR

13:25.038 --> 13:26.339
SOME SORT OF MANDATORY PROCESS

13:26.339 --> 13:27.473
THAT WOULD REQUIRE THESE THINGS

13:27.473 --> 13:28.107
TO BE REPORTED.

13:28.107 --> 13:30.009
BUT FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO

13:30.009 --> 13:30.977
TELL AT THIS POINT THERE'S

13:30.977 --> 13:32.478
NOTHING CONCRETE ON THE WAY.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.379
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, ROB

13:53.700 --> 13:55.201

13:59.038 --> 13:59.939
AND AS YOU'LL SEE IN THIS

13:59.939 --> 14:02.508
UPDATED STORY, UNTANGLING ALL OF

14:02.508 --> 14:03.776
THAT VALUABLE ELECTRONIC

14:06.045 --> 14:07.280
BECOMING INCREASINGLY

14:07.280 --> 14:09.415
COMPLICATED.

14:09.415 --> 14:10.083

14:18.291 --> 14:19.592
I'VE JUST LAID OUT MORE THAN A

14:19.592 --> 14:21.060
HALF DOZEN ACCOUNTS THAT MANY OF

14:21.060 --> 14:23.129

14:24.864 --> 14:25.898
THESE ACCOUNTS DON'T DIE WITH

US.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.000
THE PASSWORDS TO EACH OF THEM

14:28.000 --> 14:29.736
ARE OFTEN TIMES LOCKED AWAY WITH

14:29.736 --> 14:32.338
ONLY ONE PERSON, THE DECEASED.

14:32.338 --> 14:34.040
WHICH MEANS THAT VALUABLE ONLINE

14:34.040 --> 14:36.442
ASSETS COULD BE LOST FOREVER OR

14:36.442 --> 14:38.211
BE FOUND BY THOSE LOOKING TO

14:38.211 --> 14:39.378
EXPLOIT THEM.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.351
TWO YEARS AGO, HE GOT THE WORST

14:46.586 --> 14:47.487
>> I WAS IN THE PHILIPPINES

14:54.927 --> 14:55.862
YOU HAVE A BAD FEELING.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.130
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A GOOD CALL.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.464
>> Reporter: GLENN'S 73-YEAR-OLD

14:58.464 --> 15:00.266
MOTHER, LEE, HAD DIED.

15:00.266 --> 15:02.368
AS HER FIDUCIARY AND AS A 25-

15:02.368 --> 15:03.903
YEAR VETERAN OF THE TECH WORLD,

15:03.903 --> 15:05.638
IT FELL TO HIM TO MANAGE HER

ONLINE ACCOUNTS.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.574
>> I KNEW MY MOM, BEING A COOL

15:08.574 --> 15:09.909
GRANDMA, WAS ON TWITTER.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.077
SO, I KNEW SHE WAS ON TWITTER

15:11.077 --> 15:11.911
AND I KNEW SHE HAD A YAHOO

15:11.911 --> 15:13.713
ACCOUNT, SO WE HAD A BASELINE TO

15:13.713 --> 15:15.848
START, BUT THAT'S ALL WE KNEW.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.150
>> Reporter: AFTER 20 HOURS OF

15:17.150 --> 15:19.218
SEARCHING, GLENN FOUND 13

15:19.218 --> 15:20.586
DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS BELONGING TO

HIS MOTHER, INCLUDING EMAIL,

SOCIAL MEDIA AND SHOPPING

15:24.190 --> 15:25.024
ACCOUNTS.

15:25.024 --> 15:26.359

>> Reporter: SOME HAD REAL

15:33.733 --> 15:34.467
VALUE.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.401
>> SO, AFTER GOING THROUGH ALL

15:35.401 --> 15:36.869
THE AIRLINES, WE GOT TO UNITED,

15:36.869 --> 15:39.238
AND UNITED DID INDEED HAVE MY

15:39.238 --> 15:40.873
MOM AS A CUSTOMER.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.708
AND THERE WAS 54,000 MILES THAT

MEANS WELL, BUT IF ONE MORE

15:51.617 --> 15:53.219
PERSON TELLS YOU THEY'RE SORRY,

15:53.219 --> 15:55.354
IT'S LIKE, "OKAY, I JUST NEED TO

15:55.354 --> 15:56.489
KNOW, DID SHE HAVE AN ACCOUNT OR

15:56.489 --> 15:57.156

16:00.760 --> 16:02.595
STILL TOUGH TO FIND ALL THOSE

16:02.595 --> 16:03.396
ACCOUNTS.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.664
>> SO, THE AVERAGE PERSON,

16:04.664 --> 16:06.065
ESPECIALLY IF THE AVERAGE PERSON

16:06.065 --> 16:08.467
IS DOING IT IN THEIR 60s, IT'S A

16:08.467 --> 16:10.102
VERY, VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS.

THEIR DECEASED LOVED ONES'

16:20.847 --> 16:22.114
DIGITAL ASSETS.

16:22.114 --> 16:23.649
IT USES A PERSON'S BASIC

16:23.649 --> 16:25.051
INFORMATION, LIKE AN EMAIL

16:25.051 --> 16:26.786

16:41.367 --> 16:43.102
INVENTORY OF ALL THINGS DIGITAL,

16:43.102 --> 16:44.370
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE

16:44.370 --> 16:45.872
PROVIDE TO THE FAMILY, IS WE

16:45.872 --> 16:47.974
PROVIDE THEM AT A HIGH LEVEL A

16:47.974 --> 16:49.375
DIGITAL ASSET INVENTORY.

16:49.375 --> 16:50.176
SO, YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH IT AND

17:34.620 --> 17:35.821
EVEN BE SURE ABOUT THE BANK.

17:35.821 --> 17:36.889

17:36.889 --> 17:39.091
MAIN PROBLEM IS ONE OF ACCESS.

17:39.091 --> 17:40.326
IN MANY CASES, WE HAVE MADE IT

VIRTUALLY ILLEGAL FOR ANYONE

17:42.395 --> 17:45.097
ELSE TO USE OUR ONLINE ACCOUNTS.

17:45.097 --> 17:46.032

17:47.767 --> 17:50.036
PRINT OF THE ONLINE WORLD.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.437
ONCE THE "I AGREE" BUTTON IS

19:54.360 --> 19:55.828
AND THAT USED TO MEAN OPENING UP

19:55.828 --> 19:57.430
THE MAILBOX, OPENING UP THE FILE

19:57.430 --> 19:58.831
CABINET, RIFLING THROUGH THE

19:58.831 --> 19:59.665
DESK.

19:59.665 --> 20:01.967
OUR ACT IS DESIGNED TO CONTINUE

20:01.967 --> 20:04.303
THAT AND FACILITATE THAT, GIVEN

20:04.303 --> 20:05.371
THE DIFFERENT NATURE OF THE

20:05.371 --> 20:06.372
DIGITAL ASSETS.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.073
>> Reporter: THE BILL WAS

20:07.073 --> 20:08.174
REVIEWED AND ENACTED BY THE

20:08.174 --> 20:10.342
UNIFORM LAW COMMISSION THIS PAST

20:10.342 --> 20:11.243
JULY.

20:11.243 --> 20:12.311
BUT IT'S STILL UP TO INDIVIDUAL

20:12.311 --> 20:14.080
STATE LEGISLATURES TO PROPOSE IT

20:14.080 --> 20:15.948
AND PASS IT AS LAW.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.283
AS OF NOW, ONLY ONE STATE,

20:17.283 --> 20:19.251
DELAWARE, HAS SIGNED THE ACT

20:19.251 --> 20:20.186
INTO LAW.

20:20.186 --> 20:21.620
EVEN SO, THE NEW LAW HAS FACED

20:21.620 --> 20:22.988
OPPOSITION.

20:22.988 --> 20:23.823
THE GENERAL COUNSEL OF A

20:23.823 --> 20:25.724
WASHINGTON, D.C.-BASED GROUP

20:25.724 --> 20:27.393
CALLED THE STATE PRIVACY AND

20:27.393 --> 20:28.928
SECURITY COALITION, WHICH

20:28.928 --> 20:29.929
REPRESENTS THE INTERESTS OF

20:29.929 --> 20:31.597
GOOGLE, YAHOO AND FACEBOOK,

20:31.597 --> 20:33.099
AMONG OTHERS, HAS COME OUT

20:33.099 --> 20:35.701
AGAINST THE BILL SAYING, "THIS

20:35.701 --> 20:37.570
LAW TAKES NO ACCOUNT OF

20:37.570 --> 20:39.004
MINIMIZING INTRUSIONS INTO THE

20:39.004 --> 20:41.273
PRIVACY OF THIRD PARTIES WHO

20:41.273 --> 20:42.842
COMMUNICATED WITH THE DECEASED.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.443
THIS WOULD INCLUDE HIGHLY

20:44.443 --> 20:46.045
CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS TO

20:46.045 --> 20:47.880
DECEDENTS FROM THIRD PARTIES WHO

20:47.880 --> 20:49.315
ARE STILL ALIVE, WHO WOULD BE

20:49.315 --> 20:51.517
VERY SURPRISED THAT AN EXECUTOR

20:51.517 --> 20:52.451
IS REVIEWING THE

20:52.451 --> 20:53.819
COMMUNICATIONS."

20:53.819 --> 20:55.254
BUT, DESPITE THE PUSHBACK,

20:55.254 --> 20:56.755
SUZANNE WALSH IS HOPEFUL THAT

20:56.755 --> 20:58.090
HER COMMITTEE'S WORK WILL BE

20:58.090 --> 20:59.291
RECOGNIZED IN MORE STATE

20:59.291 --> 21:00.559
LEGISLATURES.

21:00.559 --> 21:02.461
>> WIDESPREAD ENACTMENT IS OUR

21:02.461 --> 21:03.129
GOAL.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.363
THAT'S OUR PRIMARY GOAL.

21:04.363 --> 21:05.631
CERTAINLY WE HOPE AND EXPECT

21:05.631 --> 21:07.600
THAT IT WON'T TAKE MORE THAN A

21:07.600 --> 21:09.335
YEAR OR TWO FOR MOST OF THE

21:09.335 --> 21:11.003
STATES TO ADOPT THIS PRODUCT.

21:11.003 --> 21:11.770
>> Reporter: FOR NOW, THERE ARE

21:11.770 --> 21:13.239
STEPS THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE

21:13.239 --> 21:14.840
TO MAKE THE PROCESS OF DIGITAL

21:14.840 --> 21:16.976
ESTATE MANAGEMENT EASIER ON NEXT

21:16.976 --> 21:17.843
OF KIN.

21:17.843 --> 21:20.212
FIRST, CREATE AN INVENTORY LIST

21:20.212 --> 21:21.847
OF ALL YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNTS AND

21:21.847 --> 21:24.016
PASSWORDS FOR YOUR FIDUCIARY.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.417
STIPULATE WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR

21:25.417 --> 21:27.553
EMAIL ACCOUNTS IN A WILL, AND

21:27.553 --> 21:29.221
READ THE TERMS OF SERVICE

21:29.221 --> 21:30.322
AGREEMENTS SO YOU CAN

21:30.322 --> 21:32.424
UNDERSTAND HOW OR EVEN IF

21:32.424 --> 21:34.260
ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNTS CAN BE

21:34.260 --> 21:35.928
GRANTED TO SOMEONE ELSE.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.863
BUT GLENN WILLIAMSON SAYS, NO

21:37.863 --> 21:39.765
MATTER WHAT STEPS YOU TAKE OR

21:39.765 --> 21:41.367
WHAT LAWS ARE EVENTUALLY PASSED,

21:41.367 --> 21:43.068
MANAGING A DIGITAL ESTATE FOR A

21:43.068 --> 21:45.404
LOVED ONE WILL ALWAYS BE A LONG,

21:45.404 --> 21:47.907
ARDUOUS AND PAINFUL PROCESS.

21:49.808 --> 21:50.676
>> Sreenivasan: TO LEARN HOW TO

21:50.676 --> 21:51.844
BETTER MANAGE YOUR OWN DIGITAL

21:51.844 --> 21:55.080
ESTATE, VISIT newshour.pbs.org.

21:56.615 --> 21:57.416
>> Sreenivasan: FINALLY

21:57.416 --> 21:58.684
TONIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHO

21:58.684 --> 22:00.252
WAS SUFFERING FROM A SORE THROAT

22:00.252 --> 22:01.420
FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS,

22:01.420 --> 22:03.289
HAD A CT SCAN AT WALTER REED

22:03.289 --> 22:05.057
MILITARY HOSPITAL TODAY.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.859
THE CT SCAN CAME BACK NORMAL.

22:06.859 --> 22:07.993
DOCTORS SAY HIS SYMPTOMS ARE

22:07.993 --> 22:09.795
RELATED TO ACID REFLUX, A

22:09.795 --> 22:11.063
CONDITION THAT AFFECTS ONE IN

22:11.063 --> 22:12.431
FIVE U.S. ADULTS.

22:12.431 --> 22:14.266
NEW RESEARCH SHOWS GIRAFFES ARE

22:14.266 --> 22:15.334
SLOWLY HEADING TOWARD

22:15.334 --> 22:16.168
EXTINCTION.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.937
POACHING AND HUMAN POPULATION

22:17.937 --> 22:19.405
GROWTH HAVE REPORTEDLY REDUCED

22:19.405 --> 22:21.140
THE AFRICAN GIRAFFE POPULATION

22:21.140 --> 22:24.310
BY 40% OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS.

22:24.310 --> 22:25.277
THAT'S IT FOR THIS EDITION OF

22:25.277 --> 22:26.312
PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

22:26.312 --> 22:27.613
I'M HARI SREENIVASAN.

22:27.613 --> 22:29.048
THANKS FOR WATCHING.
