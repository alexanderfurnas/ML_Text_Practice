WHAT KERRY TODAY SAID-- AND HE'S

02:41.461 --> 02:43.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF VIEW IT DOESN'T NEED TO END

02:43.630 --> 02:45.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

GOING BEYOND SEPTEMBER.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT

03:09.389 --> 03:11.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IN OCTOBER, AID DONORS

03:11.458 --> 03:12.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE GOING TO MEET IN BELGIUM AND

03:12.893 --> 03:14.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECIDE HOW MUCH AID TO GIVE TO

GOING TO WANT TO GIVE MONEY IF

03:17.631 --> 03:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT ISN'T CLEAR AN ESTABLISHED

03:19.366 --> 03:21.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN LIVES HAVE

04:10.584 --> 04:11.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FOR NORTH CAROLINA?

09:17.390 --> 09:18.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THEM ALL WEEK.

09:19.492 --> 09:20.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

IMPACT?

SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF

GOING TO NORTH CAROLINA, WHICH

09:34.140 --> 09:35.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS SOMETHING THAT TRANSLATED TO,

09:35.942 --> 09:37.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, THE THOUSANDS,

09:37.110 --> 09:38.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

YOU'RE STAYING IN A HOTEL,

09:42.749 --> 09:44.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

OR WHATEVER.

09:49.088 --> 09:49.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, YEAH, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

09:49.889 --> 09:52.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS A RIPPLE EFFECT WHEN, YOU

09:52.125 --> 09:53.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW, THESE BOYCOTTS OR

09:53.193 --> 09:54.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECISIONS NOT TO GO TO NORTH

09:54.127 --> 09:56.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

10:01.167 --> 10:02.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR IT TO BE MOVED, A FORMER

10:02.469 --> 10:04.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAYER AND NOW A COMMENTATOR.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND PAYPAL PULLED THE OPENING OF

10:06.739 --> 10:09.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A 400-PERSON FACILITY IN THE

STATE.

10:10.877 --> 10:11.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, THAT WAS A REALLY

10:11.678 --> 10:13.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNIFICANT ONE BECAUSE, ALSO,

10:13.379 --> 10:15.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE THING THAT EVERY STATE IS

10:15.949 --> 10:17.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO DO IS TRYING TO WOO

10:17.116 --> 10:18.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TECH COMPANIES LIKE PAYPAL TO

10:18.718 --> 10:19.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR STATE.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, IF THESE TECH COMPANIES IN

10:21.387 --> 10:22.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULAR MAKE A BIG STAND ON

10:22.689 --> 10:23.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

10:23.723 --> 10:24.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD REALLY DISCOURAGE

10:24.757 --> 10:28.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNORS FROM PASSING THESE

10:28.328 --> 10:29.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIMILAR LAWS.

10:29.295 --> 10:35.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE SEEN DEMOCRATS PUT OUT

THEIR HANDS AND SAY, "HEY,

10:36.302 --> 10:37.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAYPAL, COME HERE," THE

DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF MONTANA

10:40.006 --> 10:41.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CAROLINA.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT IS ALSO

10:46.379 --> 10:47.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTING IS IT SEEMS TO PIT

10:47.580 --> 10:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TWO DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE

10:48.414 --> 10:49.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN PARTY, THE BUSINESS

10:49.682 --> 10:51.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIDE VERSUS THE SOCIAL

10:51.317 --> 10:53.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSERVATIVE SIDE.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS IS AN ONGOING FIGHT

10:55.955 --> 10:57.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE WINGS ARE GOING TO

10:59.826 --> 11:02.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTINUE TO CLASS ON WHAT THE

11:02.028 --> 11:03.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN PARTY SHOULD

11:03.329 --> 11:04.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRIORITIZE.

11:04.697 --> 11:05.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THESE ARE COMING INTO DIRECT

11:05.932 --> 11:08.434 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFLICT, AND THAT'S REALLY A

11:08.434 --> 11:10.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEM FOR A LOT OF REPUBLICANS

11:10.470 --> 11:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THE SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES

11:12.171 --> 11:14.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEND TO PROVIDE SORT OF GRASS

11:14.007 --> 11:15.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROOTS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

11:15.241 --> 11:16.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S

11:16.109 --> 11:18.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST RELIABLE VOTERS.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS,

11:19.279 --> 11:20.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUITE FRANKLY, WHERE MOST OF THE

11:20.179 --> 11:21.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONEY FUNDING THE REPUBLICAN

11:21.447 --> 11:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTY COMES FROM.

11:22.782 --> 11:23.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S THEIR BIGGEST SOURCE

11:23.650 --> 11:24.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF MONEY SO THEY CAN AIR TV ADS

11:24.951 --> 11:25.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHATNOT.

11:25.985 --> 11:27.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT REALLY IS A SITUATION IF

11:27.253 --> 11:28.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN POLITICIAN,

11:28.755 --> 11:29.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU DON'T WANT TO ANGER EITHER

11:29.923 --> 11:31.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THESE GROUPS.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO FAR IN THIS FIGHT, THE

11:32.959 --> 11:34.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS WINNING

11:34.494 --> 11:35.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO HAVE

11:35.528 --> 11:37.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ECONOMIC LEVERAGE AND YOU

11:37.297 --> 11:38.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE SEEN IT USED IN NORTH

11:38.331 --> 11:39.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAROLINA AND YOU SAW IT USED

11:39.699 --> 11:41.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY WELL IN INDIANA, WHICH HAD

11:41.834 --> 11:43.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A SIMILAR CONTROVERSY LAST YEAR.

11:43.469 --> 11:44.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: DOES THIS

11:44.137 --> 11:45.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRICKLE UP, AT LEAST ON A

11:45.972 --> 11:46.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONAL SCALE, EITHER IN THE

11:46.906 --> 11:48.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OR OTHER,

11:48.775 --> 11:50.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LET'S SAY, GUBERNATORIAL

11:50.410 --> 11:52.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY?

11:52.512 --> 11:53.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO, IN THE PRESIDENTIAL

11:53.313 --> 11:54.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION, SO FAR, IT HASN'T

11:54.113 --> 11:56.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY IMPACTED THE G.O.P.

11:56.082 --> 11:57.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRIMARY ALL THAT MUCH.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SAID, AT THIS POINT, A

11:58.885 --> 12:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAJORITY OF AMERICANS DO SUPPORT

12:00.553 --> 12:02.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GAY RIGHTS, AND IT HURTS THE

12:02.722 --> 12:04.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMAGE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN

12:04.223 --> 12:05.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERAL.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT, YOU

12:06.559 --> 12:08.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW, DON'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU

12:08.061 --> 12:09.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE HILLARY CLINTON REALLY GOING

12:09.862 --> 12:10.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT OF HER WAY TO SPEAK OUT

12:10.930 --> 12:12.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST LAWS LIKE THIS IF SHE

12:12.231 --> 12:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECOMES THE GENERAL ELECTION

12:13.066 --> 12:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOMINEE.
