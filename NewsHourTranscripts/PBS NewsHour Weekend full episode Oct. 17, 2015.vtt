TOBACCO EVER WAS.

THOSE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE

01:17.577 --> 01:19.379
ACCEPTED MORE ASYLUM SEEKERS

01:19.379 --> 01:21.515

QUOTED TODAY AS SAYING, "NOBODY

01:24.785 --> 01:26.920

01:30.924 --> 01:32.659

01:32.659 --> 01:34.594
HOW DANGEROUS THE JOURNEY IS.

02:12.265 --> 02:13.967
THE UNREST OF RECENT WEEKS BEGAN

02:13.967 --> 02:15.369
BECAUSE OF RUMORS THAT ISRAEL

02:15.369 --> 02:16.636
MIGHT LIMIT ACCESS TO THE AL

AQSA MOSQUE IN JERUSALEM'S OLD

THIS WEEK.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.431
RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER DMITRY

02:44.431 --> 02:45.799
MEDVEDEV SAID TODAY RUSSIA'S

02:45.799 --> 02:47.267
CAMPAIGN IN SYRIA IS NOT

02:47.267 --> 02:48.602
DESIGNED TO PROP UP PRESIDENT

02:48.602 --> 02:50.404
ASSAD, BUT TO DEFEAT ISLAMIC

02:50.404 --> 02:51.772
STATE MILITANTS.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.240
THE FAMILY OF A NIGERIAN COLLEGE

03:00.680 --> 03:01.615
HIS DEATH.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.150
A JURY RETURNED "NOT GUILTY"

03:03.150 --> 03:04.251
VERDICTS YESTERDAY ON

03:04.251 --> 03:05.519
MANSLAUGHTER CHARGES BROUGHT IN

03:05.519 --> 03:07.320

03:07.320 --> 03:09.156
DIED ALONE IN HIS CELL SHACKLED

03:09.156 --> 03:10.090
TO A CHAIR.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.059
THE DEPUTIES HAD USED A TASER ON

03:12.059 --> 03:14.361
AJIBADE MULTIPLE TIMES WHILE HE

03:14.361 --> 03:16.329
WAS RESTRAINED AND THEN LEFT HIM

03:16.329 --> 03:17.497
UNATTENDED.

03:17.497 --> 03:18.698
HE HAD FOUGHT WITH DEPUTIES

03:18.698 --> 03:20.000
AFTER BEING ARRESTED ON A

03:20.000 --> 03:21.468
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHARGE.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.003
AJIBADE'S FAMILY SAYS HE

03:23.003 --> 03:25.272
SUFFERED FROM BIPOLAR DISORDER.

03:25.272 --> 03:27.274
A COUSIN SAID: "THE SAME SYSTEM

03:27.274 --> 03:29.109
THAT FAILED MATHEW WOULD NOT BE

03:29.109 --> 03:30.277
THE SYSTEM THAT GOT HIM

03:30.277 --> 03:31.278
JUSTICE."

03:31.278 --> 03:32.979
ONE FORMER DEPUTY WAS CONVICTED

03:32.979 --> 03:34.981
OF CRUELTY TO AN INMATE.

03:34.981 --> 03:36.450
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION INTENDS

03:36.450 --> 03:38.452
TO BLOCK FUTURE PLANS TO DRILL

03:38.452 --> 03:40.787
FOR OIL IN THE ARCTIC WATERS OFF

03:40.787 --> 03:41.855
ALASKA.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.323
THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT SAYS IT

03:43.323 --> 03:45.392
IS CANCELING FUTURE AUCTIONS FOR

03:45.392 --> 03:47.160
OFFSHORE DRILLING RIGHTS FOR THE

03:47.160 --> 03:48.762
NEXT TWO YEARS, AND NOT

03:48.762 --> 03:50.797
EXTENDING ANY CURRENT LEASES TO

03:50.797 --> 03:52.632
DRILL OFF ALASKA'S NORTHERN

03:52.632 --> 03:53.467
COAST.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.035
THE ANNOUNCEMENT COMES JUST A

03:55.035 --> 03:56.670
FEW WEEKS AFTER ROYAL DUTCH

03:56.670 --> 03:58.338
SHELL, THE ONLY MAJOR ENERGY

03:58.338 --> 03:59.806
COMPANY ACTIVELY EXPLORING THE

03:59.806 --> 04:01.975
AREA, HALTED ITS OPERATIONS

04:01.975 --> 04:04.578
AFTER SPENDING $7 BILLION AND

04:04.578 --> 04:06.880
FINDING RELATIVELY LITTLE OIL.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.815
THE CONSERVATION GROUP OCEANA

04:08.815 --> 04:10.750
SAID THE ADMINISTRATION'S

04:10.750 --> 04:12.219
DECISION IS CONSISTENT WITH"

04:12.219 --> 04:13.420
GOOD PUBLIC POLICY AND ECONOMIC

04:13.420 --> 04:14.788
REALITIES."

04:14.788 --> 04:16.556
U.S. AIRWAYS IS NO MORE.

04:16.556 --> 04:18.158
THE AIRLINE'S LAST FLIGHT LANDED

04:18.158 --> 04:19.693
IN PHILADELPHIA EARLY THIS

04:19.693 --> 04:20.927
MORNING, A RED EYE COMING FROM

04:20.927 --> 04:22.696
SAN FRANCISCO WITH 187

04:22.696 --> 04:24.097
PASSENGERS ON BOARD.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.266
IT WAS FLIGHT NUMBER 1939, THE

04:26.266 --> 04:27.567
SAME YEAR THE AIRLINE WAS

04:27.567 --> 04:28.368
FOUNDED.

04:28.368 --> 04:29.769
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST AIRLINE,

04:29.769 --> 04:31.771
AMERICAN, BOUGHT U.S. AIRWAYS.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.573
THE MERGER ANNOUNCED TWO YEARS

04:33.573 --> 04:36.343
AGO IS NOW COMPLETE.

04:46.486 --> 04:47.554
>> Sreenivasan: PRESIDENT OBAMA

04:47.554 --> 04:48.555
ANNOUNCED THIS WEEK THAT

04:48.555 --> 04:49.823
AMERICAN TROOPS WILL NOT FULLY

04:49.823 --> 04:51.591
WITHDRAW FROM AFGHANISTAN, AS HE

04:51.591 --> 04:52.626
HAD PLANNED, BY THE END OF HIS

04:52.626 --> 04:53.493
PRESIDENCY.

04:53.493 --> 04:55.462
INSTEAD, 10,000 U.S. TROOPS WILL

04:55.462 --> 04:57.297
REMAIN DEPLOYED FOR ANOTHER YEAR

04:57.297 --> 04:58.932
TO HELP AFGHANISTAN QUELL THE

04:58.932 --> 05:01.101
RESURGENT TALIBAN AND ALSO TO

05:01.101 --> 05:02.235
KEEP TRAINING AFGHANISTAN'S

05:02.235 --> 05:04.070
POLICE FORCE TO EXPAND AND STAND

05:04.070 --> 05:05.071
ON ITS OWN.

05:05.071 --> 05:05.939
JOINING ME IN THE STUDIO TO

05:05.939 --> 05:07.374
DISCUSS THIS IS AUSTIN LONG, A

05:07.374 --> 05:08.408
PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL AND

05:08.408 --> 05:09.876
PUBLIC AFFAIRS FOCUSING ON

05:09.876 --> 05:11.211
SECURITY POLICY AT COLUMBIA

05:11.211 --> 05:12.479
UNIVERSITY HERE IN NEW YORK.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.780
SO, WE SPOKE A COUPLE OF DAYS

05:13.780 --> 05:15.582
AGO ON THE BROADCAST ABOUT THE

05:15.582 --> 05:17.817
MILITARY DECISION AND ASSISTANCE

05:17.817 --> 05:19.085
TO THE AFGHAN MILITARY, BUT THE

05:19.085 --> 05:20.720
POLICE FORCE HAS ALSO BEEN PART

05:20.720 --> 05:21.621
OF THE STRATEGY.

05:21.621 --> 05:23.490
WHERE IS THAT?

05:23.490 --> 05:24.824
WAS THAT A SUCCESS OR FAILURE

05:24.824 --> 05:26.326
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS?

05:26.326 --> 05:27.594
>> SO THE AFGHAN POLICE FORCE IS

05:27.594 --> 05:29.596
JUST ONE COMPONENT OF THE AFGHAN

05:29.596 --> 05:30.630
SECURITY FORCES.

05:30.630 --> 05:31.531
THERE IS ALSO AN ARMY.

05:31.531 --> 05:32.332
THERE IS ALSO AN INTELLIGENCE

05:32.332 --> 05:33.300
SERVICE.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.134
THE POLICE HAVE MORE OR LESS

05:34.134 --> 05:36.803
BEEN THE LAGGING SECURITY FORCE.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.271
THEY'VE BEEN THE LEAST DEVELOPED

05:38.271 --> 05:40.807
OVER TIME, AND SO THEY'VE BEEN

05:40.807 --> 05:43.310
AN INTEGRAL PART OF SECURITY IN

05:43.310 --> 05:44.311
AFGHANISTAN, BUT THEY HAVEN'T

05:44.311 --> 05:45.512
BEEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE

05:45.512 --> 05:46.680
>> Sreenivasan: SO SOME OF THE

05:46.680 --> 05:48.148
AREAS, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL

05:48.148 --> 05:50.917
AFGHANISTAN, HAVE A PRETTY TENSE

05:50.917 --> 05:52.452
RELATIONSHIP WITH ANY AUTHORITY,

05:52.452 --> 05:53.286
WHETHER IT'S THE AFGHAN

05:53.286 --> 05:54.354
GOVERNMENT, WHETHER IT'S THE

05:54.354 --> 05:55.722
U.S. GOVERNMENT OR THE TALIBAN,

05:55.722 --> 05:56.656
RIGHT?

05:56.656 --> 05:58.391
>> SO, THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

05:58.391 --> 06:00.093
AND ONE OF THE BIG ANSWERS TO

06:00.093 --> 06:01.695
THIS IN THEOR WAS TO CREATE

06:01.695 --> 06:03.096
LOCAL POLICE FORCE.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.064
SO THERE'S AN AFGHAN NATIONAL

06:04.064 --> 06:05.465
POLICE FORCE THAT COVERS THE

06:05.465 --> 06:06.967
ENTIRE COUNTRY AT THE FEDERAL

06:06.967 --> 06:08.134
LEVEL.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.302
BEGINNING IN 2009, THE UNITED

06:09.302 --> 06:10.870
STATES BEGAN PRESSING A PLAN TO

06:10.870 --> 06:13.306
BUILD LOCAL POLICE FORCES THAT

06:13.306 --> 06:14.407
WOULD OPERATE MORE OR LESS AT

06:14.407 --> 06:15.809
THE VILLAGE OR DISTRICT LEVEL,

06:15.809 --> 06:18.678
VERY LOCAL FORCES THAT WOULD IN

06:18.678 --> 06:19.980
THEORY HAVE A BIG INCENTIVE TO

06:19.980 --> 06:21.381
DEFEND THEIR HOME TERRITORY AND

06:21.381 --> 06:22.983
WOULDN'T BE EXPECTED TO GO FIGHT

06:22.983 --> 06:24.451
ANYWHERE ELSE IN AFGHANISTAN

06:24.451 --> 06:25.218
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHY DIDN'T

06:25.218 --> 06:26.253
THAT WORK?

06:26.253 --> 06:27.153
>> WELL, THERE ARE SEVERAL

06:27.153 --> 06:28.488
REASONS WHY THIS PROGRAM HAS

06:28.488 --> 06:29.456
BEEN A PROBLEM.

06:29.456 --> 06:30.390
THE FIRST IS THE AFGHAN

06:30.390 --> 06:31.491
GOVERNMENT WAS INITIALLY VERY

06:31.491 --> 06:32.726
RELUCTANT TO DO IT.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.160
PRESIDENT KARZAI SAW THESE

06:34.160 --> 06:35.428
FORCES AS ESSENTIALLY

06:35.428 --> 06:38.198
RESUSCITATED MILITIA AND MILITIA

06:38.198 --> 06:39.633
IS A DIRTY WORD IN AFGHANISTAN

06:39.633 --> 06:43.203
AFTER THE 1980S AND 1990s.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.739
SO THAT WAS ONE REASON.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.374
A BIGGER REASON, I THINK, IS

06:47.374 --> 06:49.142
ONCE THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT

06:49.142 --> 06:50.610
BOUGHT OFF IN 2010 AND THIS

06:50.610 --> 06:51.611
BECAME A FORMAL PART OF THE

06:51.611 --> 06:53.313
AFGHAN POLICE, CALLED THE AFGHAN

06:53.313 --> 06:55.649
LOCAL POLICE, THERE WAS A BIG

06:55.649 --> 06:57.350
PUSH TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM VERY

06:57.350 --> 06:57.984
QUICKLY.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.853
THESE UNITS WERE SEEN AS THE KEY

06:59.853 --> 07:01.488
TO PROVIDING SECURITY IN THESE

07:01.488 --> 07:02.689
REMOTE VILLAGES WHICH, AS YOU

07:02.689 --> 07:03.757
SAY, MAY HAVE A VERY TENSE

07:03.757 --> 07:05.125
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

07:05.125 --> 07:06.059
GOVERNMENT.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.461
THE PROBLEM WAS IN THE PUSH TO

07:08.461 --> 07:10.497
RAPIDLY EXPAND THIS PROGRAM IN

07:10.497 --> 07:13.466
2011 AND 2012, I WOULD ARGUE IT

07:13.466 --> 07:14.434
GREW TOO QUICKLY.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.802
YOU DIDN'T HAVE SUFFICIENT

07:15.802 --> 07:17.570
VETTING OF THE INDIVIDUALS TO

07:17.570 --> 07:18.405
MAKE SURE THEY WEREN'T GOING TO

07:18.405 --> 07:19.673
COMMIT THE KIND OF ABUSES THAT

07:19.673 --> 07:20.807
PRESIDENT KARZAI WAS WORRIED

07:20.807 --> 07:21.741
ABOUT.

07:21.741 --> 07:23.643
IN SOME CASES YOU HAD LOCAL

07:23.643 --> 07:25.211
POLICE OR INDIVIDUALS THAT

07:25.211 --> 07:26.379
CLAIMED TO BE LOCAL POLICE THAT

07:26.379 --> 07:27.714
WERE NOT FROM THE LOCAL AREA.

07:27.714 --> 07:28.648
THEY ESSENTIALLY COME IN FROM

07:28.648 --> 07:30.016
THE OUTSIDE.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.051
SO THERE WERE A LOT OF ISSUES,

07:31.051 --> 07:33.820
I'D SAY, OVER THE PERIOD 2011 TO

07:33.820 --> 07:35.288
'12 AND '13

07:35.288 --> 07:35.955
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT HAPPENS

07:35.955 --> 07:36.890
NEXT?

07:36.890 --> 07:38.925
ALONG SIDE THE U.S. FORCES THAT

07:38.925 --> 07:40.393
REMAIN ON THE GROUND, DO THEY

07:40.393 --> 07:41.594
PLAY A ROLE IN TRAINING OF THE

07:41.594 --> 07:43.396
AFGHAN POLICE AS WELL?

07:43.396 --> 07:44.397
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY

07:44.397 --> 07:45.732
DIFFICULT FOR THESE KIND OF

07:45.732 --> 07:47.467
LOCAL PROGRAMS FOR THE U.S.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.937
SERVICEMEN TO PEAPT JUST BECAUSE

07:50.937 --> 07:52.305
THEY TEND TO BE VERY FAR FROM

07:52.305 --> 07:54.841
THE BASES THAT THE U.S. IS AT

07:54.841 --> 07:55.442
NOW.

07:55.442 --> 07:58.244
SO IN 2010, THE U.S. HAD SMALL

07:58.244 --> 07:59.412
BASES SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE

07:59.412 --> 08:00.613
COUNTRY, IN ADDITION TO VERY

08:00.613 --> 08:01.614
LARGE BASES.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.083
NOW WE'VE MORE OR LESS COME DOWN

08:03.083 --> 08:04.617
TO THE BIG BASES SO IT'S

08:04.617 --> 08:05.985
DIFFICULT TO GET OUT AND DO

08:05.985 --> 08:06.920
TRAINING IN THESE REMOTE

08:06.920 --> 08:07.654
VILLAGES.

08:07.654 --> 08:08.521
I THINK THIS WILL BE A VERY

08:08.521 --> 08:10.090
AFGHAN-LED PROGRAM

08:10.090 --> 08:10.924
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

08:10.924 --> 08:11.658
AUSTIN LONG FROM COLUMBIA

08:11.658 --> 08:12.559
UNIVERSITY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH

08:12.559 --> 08:13.159
FOR JOINING US.

08:13.159 --> 08:13.827
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

08:13.827 --> 08:15.662
HAVING ME.

08:26.039 --> 08:26.940
>> Sreenivasan: THE MILITANT

08:26.940 --> 08:27.974
GROUP KNOWN AS THE ISLAMIC

08:27.974 --> 08:29.376
STATE, OR ISIS, CONTROLS HUGE

08:29.376 --> 08:31.277
AMOUNTS OF TERRITORY IN IRAQ AND

08:31.277 --> 08:32.212
SYRIA.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.813
AND ISIS FINANCES MUCH OF ITS

08:33.813 --> 08:35.415
MILITARY OPERATIONS FROM

08:35.415 --> 08:36.716
SIPHONING AND SELLING THE

08:36.716 --> 08:38.618
GREATEST COMMODITY IN IRAQ AND

08:38.618 --> 08:40.120
SYRIA: OIL.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.855
SOME ESTIMATES PUT PROCEEDS FROM

08:41.855 --> 08:44.491
THE ISIS THEFT AT $1.5 MILLION A

08:44.491 --> 08:45.558
DAY."

08:45.558 --> 08:46.760
FINANCIAL TIMES" REPORTER ERIKA

08:46.760 --> 08:48.361
SOLOMON HAS WRITTEN ABOUT THIS,

08:48.361 --> 08:49.362
AND SHE JOINS ME NOW, FROM

08:49.362 --> 08:50.363
CHICAGO.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.032
SO, ERIKA, HOW IS IT POSSIBLE

08:53.032 --> 08:54.901
THAT THEY HAVE THIS KIND OF AN

08:54.901 --> 08:57.771
INDUSTRY OF OIL IN THE MIDDLE OF

08:57.771 --> 08:59.172
THE WAR WHERE DIFFERENT

08:59.172 --> 09:00.774
COUNTRIES ARE ATTACKING THEM?

09:00.774 --> 09:02.008
>> WELL, THAT'S THE VERY

09:02.008 --> 09:03.109
INTERESTING PART BECAUSE

09:03.109 --> 09:04.444
ACTUALLY, ATTACKING OIL FIELDS

09:04.444 --> 09:06.246
IS QUITE DIFFICULT.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.280
YOU CAN'T JUST BOMB AN OIL

09:07.280 --> 09:07.947
FIELD.

09:07.947 --> 09:08.882
IT COULD CAUSE A NATURAL

09:08.882 --> 09:09.916
DISASTER AND IT COULD

09:09.916 --> 09:12.218
POTENTIALLY HURT THAT COUNTRY'S

09:12.218 --> 09:14.354
FUTURE IN TERMS OF USING ITS

09:14.354 --> 09:15.121
OIL.

09:15.121 --> 09:16.923
SO THE COALITION CAN ONLY REALLY

09:16.923 --> 09:19.826
GO AFTER REFINING PROCESSES OR

09:19.826 --> 09:21.795
EVERYTHING AFTER THE EXTRACTION.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.096
AND ISIS HAS USED THAT TO ITS

09:23.096 --> 09:24.130
ADVANTAGE.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.465
BASICALLY, IT'S TAKEN OVER OIL

09:25.465 --> 09:28.168
FIELDS AND HAS USED EMPLOYEES

09:28.168 --> 09:29.302
WHO ALREADY WERE WORKING AT

09:29.302 --> 09:30.837
THOSE FIELDS TO CONTINUE

09:30.837 --> 09:32.105
PRODUCTION.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.306
AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT

09:33.306 --> 09:34.340
SYRIA HAS BEEN IN A WAR FOR

09:34.340 --> 09:35.642
ABOUT FIVE YEARS SO, PEOPLE IN

09:35.642 --> 09:37.477
THIS REGION, WHEN THE GOVERNMENT

09:37.477 --> 09:39.245
LOST CONTROL, HAD BEEN DOING

09:39.245 --> 09:40.480
THIS FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.048
WHAT ISIS DID WAS JUST TAKE OVER

09:42.048 --> 09:44.017
PRODUCTION THAT WAS ALREADY

09:44.017 --> 09:45.285
ONGOING AND IMPROVE IT

09:45.285 --> 09:46.753
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY SO WHO DO

09:46.753 --> 09:48.188
THEY SELL THIS OIL TO?

09:48.188 --> 09:49.956
ISIS SELLS THIS OIL TO EVERYONE

09:49.956 --> 09:50.723
THERE.

09:50.723 --> 09:52.725
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT THE

09:52.725 --> 09:56.930
OIL PROBABLY GOES TO TURKEY.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.065
BUT WE FOUND MOST OF THE OIL IS

09:59.065 --> 10:00.533
BEING BOUGHT BY THE PEOPLE ISIS

10:00.533 --> 10:01.768
CONTROLS, OR EVEN THEIR

10:01.768 --> 10:02.802
NEIGHBORS WHO ARE TECHNICALLY AT

10:02.802 --> 10:04.204
WITH THEM.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.405
THE MOST STRIKING EXAMPLES WOULD

10:05.405 --> 10:06.973
BE AREAS TO THE NORTHWEST

10:06.973 --> 10:09.008
CONTROLLED BY THE SYRIAN OPTION,

10:09.008 --> 10:11.277
WHICH IS AT WAR WITH ISIS.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.779
THEY FIGHT ISIS AT THE SAME TIME

10:12.779 --> 10:13.880
THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO BUY

10:13.880 --> 10:15.181
THEIR FUEL BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO

10:15.181 --> 10:16.182
OTHER OPTION

10:16.182 --> 10:17.016
>> Sreenivasan: SO THE

10:17.016 --> 10:18.084
HOSPITALS ARE ALL POWERED BY

10:18.084 --> 10:20.720
GENERATORS USING OIL FROM ISIS.

10:20.720 --> 10:21.788
>> YEAH, THAT'S THE REALLY

10:21.788 --> 10:22.789
SHOCKING PART.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.791
AT SOME POINT, ISIS HAS BLOCKED

10:24.791 --> 10:26.860
FUEL MOVING TO REBEL AREAS TO

10:26.860 --> 10:28.828
MAKE THIS POINT, AND A FEW

10:28.828 --> 10:30.163
MONTHS AGO WHAT HAPPENED IS WE

10:30.163 --> 10:32.098
SAW HOSPITALS THAT DIDN'T HAVE

10:32.098 --> 10:33.132
ANY FUEL.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.634
THEY COULDN'T POWER SOME OF

10:34.634 --> 10:35.969
THEIR OPERATIONS ROOMS AND

10:35.969 --> 10:37.370
PEOPLE ACTUALLY DIED BECAUSE

10:37.370 --> 10:39.339
THEY DIDN'T CENTER FUEL IS THERE

10:39.339 --> 10:40.340
WHY IS THIS SO DIFFICULT TO

10:40.340 --> 10:41.207
STOP?

10:41.207 --> 10:42.342
YOU SAID IT'S HARD TO BOMB OIL

10:42.342 --> 10:44.210
FIELDS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

10:44.210 --> 10:45.211
REPERCUSSIONS.

10:45.211 --> 10:46.412
WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO STOP

10:46.412 --> 10:49.649
THE PIPELINE OF OIL GETTING FOR

10:49.649 --> 10:51.284
ONE PLACE IN SYRIA OR IRAQ TO

10:51.284 --> 10:52.218
ANOTHER?

10:52.218 --> 10:52.952
>> THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF

10:52.952 --> 10:54.120
OPINION AMONG THE INTERNATIONAL

10:54.120 --> 10:55.388
COALITION ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE

10:55.388 --> 10:56.189
THIS.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.690
IN REPORTING THE STORY, I WENT

10:57.690 --> 10:59.926
TO PLACES ON THE BORDER BETWEEN

10:59.926 --> 11:02.028
SYRIA AND IRAQ WHERE KURDISH

11:02.028 --> 11:03.363
PESHMERGA FORCES ARE FIGHTING

11:03.363 --> 11:05.465
ISIS WITH SUPPORT FROM COALITION

11:05.465 --> 11:06.466
AIR FORCES.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.768
THEY WOULD LIKE IT BOMB ROUTES

11:08.768 --> 11:10.270
WHERE YOU CAN SEE TRUCKS GOING

11:10.270 --> 11:12.372
BY WITH OIL, BUT THEIR COALITION

11:12.372 --> 11:14.007
PARTNERS IT'S AMERICANS SAY WE

11:14.007 --> 11:14.807
DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

11:14.807 --> 11:16.276
WE DON'T WANT TO TURN WHAT ARE

11:16.276 --> 11:18.411
ESSENTIALLY CIVILIAN TRADERS

11:18.411 --> 11:19.846
AGAINST US BECAUSE WHAT ISIS HAS

11:19.846 --> 11:22.048
DONE IS ALLOW LOCALS TO BUY

11:22.048 --> 11:22.715
THEIR FUEL.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.017
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY CONTROL THE

11:24.017 --> 11:25.385
ENTIRE SYSTEM.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.853
THEY ONLY CONTROL THE EXTRACT

11:26.853 --> 11:28.821
AND SELL CRUDE OIL.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.623
LOCALS ARE THE ONES WHO REFINE

11:30.623 --> 11:32.292
IT AND STILL IT ON AND THEY'RE

11:32.292 --> 11:33.993
BENEFITING FROM IT BECAUSE THEY

11:33.993 --> 11:34.928
DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY OTHER

11:34.928 --> 11:36.229
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES RIGHT

11:36.229 --> 11:36.829
NOW.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.464
AND THAT'S YET COALITION HAS

11:38.464 --> 11:39.699
REALLY STRUGGLED TO FIND AN

11:39.699 --> 11:41.935
EFFECTIVE WAY TO FIGHT OIL

11:41.935 --> 11:43.803
INDUSTRY IN SYRIA

11:43.803 --> 11:44.504
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

12:02.889 --> 12:04.290
>> Sreenivasan: FOR DECADES,

12:04.290 --> 12:05.592
HEMP HAS BEEN TABOO IN THE

12:05.592 --> 12:06.526
UNITED STATES.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.461
FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITED FARMERS

12:08.461 --> 12:09.829
FROM GROWING IT, BECAUSE HEMP

12:09.829 --> 12:11.497
COMES FROM THE CANNABIS PLANT,

12:11.497 --> 12:13.132
THE SAME PLANT SPECIES AS

12:13.132 --> 12:14.033
MARIJUANA.

12:14.033 --> 12:15.535
BUT THE HEMP BAN IS STARTING TO

12:16.603 --> 12:18.204

12:24.077 --> 12:25.878
FOREFRONT OF THIS AGRICULTURAL

12:25.878 --> 12:27.080
EXPERIMENT.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.314
AND, AT A TIME WHEN TOBACCO

12:28.314 --> 12:30.183
FARMING IS IN DECLINE, SOME

12:30.183 --> 12:31.851
FARMERS SEE THEIR FUTURE IN

12:47.300 --> 12:48.601
THEY STARTED IN VIRGINIA NEARLY

12:48.601 --> 12:50.203
TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO THEN

12:50.203 --> 12:52.171
MIGRATED IN THE MID-1800s TO THE

ROLLING HILLS OF CENTRAL

12:55.908 --> 12:57.210
ONE WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.478
WE GREW UP IN IT AND I GUESS WE

12:58.478 --> 12:59.579
ALWAYS WILL AS LONG AS IT'S

12:59.579 --> 13:00.880
AVAILABLE TO US.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.249
KENTUCKY TOBACCO FARMER IS NOT

13:03.249 --> 13:05.385
AS LUCRATIVE AS IT ONCE WAS.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.552
THANKS TO ANTI-SMOKING CAMPAIGNS

13:06.552 --> 13:08.154
AND HIGH TAXES ON CIGARETTES,

13:08.154 --> 13:09.689
DOMESTIC DEMAND IS DOWN AND

13:09.689 --> 13:11.090
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PRICE

13:11.090 --> 13:12.925

13:13.893 --> 13:15.695
GROSSED NEARLY $1 BILLION A YEAR

13:15.695 --> 13:18.131
ARE NO MORE, FORCING BRIAN, AND

13:18.131 --> 13:19.565
FARMERS LIKE HIM, TO IMAGINE A

13:19.565 --> 13:21.167
FUTURE WITHOUT TOBACCO AND

13:21.167 --> 13:23.036
DIVERSIFY THEIR FARMS.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.570
HIS MOVE TO CATTLE PAID OFF WITH

13:24.570 --> 13:26.439
RISING BEEF PRICES, BUT BRIAN'S

13:26.439 --> 13:28.007
MOST RECENT BET IS CANNABIS

13:28.007 --> 13:30.576
SATIVA, ALSO KNOWN AS HEMP.

13:30.576 --> 13:32.478
BUT THERE IS A CATCH.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.546
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, HEMP

13:33.546 --> 13:35.682
IS JUST AS ILLEGAL AS MARIJUANA.

IN KENTUCKY.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.493

13:47.493 --> 13:49.095
HEMP ARE CANNABIS PLANTS, AND TO

13:49.095 --> 13:50.396
THE NAKED EYE THEY LOOK AND

13:50.396 --> 13:51.731
SMELL THE SAME.

13:51.731 --> 13:52.932
THE MAIN DIFFERENCE COMES DOWN

13:52.932 --> 13:53.766
TO THE AMOUNT OF

13:53.766 --> 13:55.368
TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL, COMMONLY

13:55.368 --> 13:57.470
REFERRED TO AS T.H.C., THE

13:57.470 --> 13:58.838
PSYCHOACTIVE CHEMICAL IN THE

13:58.838 --> 13:59.906
CANNABIS PLANT.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.441
HEMP HAS A T.H.C. LEVEL BELOW

14:01.441 --> 14:03.009
.3% PERCENT, ESSENTIALLY MAKING

14:03.009 --> 14:04.510
IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HIGH ON THE

14:13.453 --> 14:15.688
MAKE A LOT OF PRODUCTS FROM

14:15.688 --> 14:17.490
PLASTIC AND WOOD, TOMORROW THOSE

14:17.490 --> 14:19.058
PRODUCTS WILL BE MADE FROM

14:19.058 --> 14:20.226
INDUSTRIAL HEMP.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.395
THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE

14:22.395 --> 14:23.329
THOUGHT OF HEMP, THEY THOUGHT OF

14:23.329 --> 14:24.230
MARIJUANA.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.570

14:30.570 --> 14:31.471
KENTUCKY'S STATE POLICE

14:31.471 --> 14:33.239
COMMISSIONER WASN'T CONVINCED.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.013

14:42.315 --> 14:43.916
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US WITH

14:43.916 --> 14:45.384
AERIAL SURVEILLANCE, WHICH IS

14:45.384 --> 14:46.486
HOW WE CUT MOST OF OUR

14:55.561 --> 14:57.196
IN THE FIELD TO THE NAKED EYE.

14:57.196 --> 14:58.297
BUT THE BIG ISSUE THAT WE HAVE

14:58.297 --> 15:01.033
IS WHAT IS TO PREVENT AN

15:01.033 --> 15:02.568
UNSCRUPULOUS FARMER, MAYBE WITH

15:02.568 --> 15:04.237

DIVERSE USAGE OF THE PLANT.

15:15.481 --> 15:17.450
THE FIBER CAN BE USED IN ROPE,

ABOUT $500 MILLION A YEAR.

15:39.305 --> 15:41.240
AFTER COMER TOOK OFFICE IN 2012,

15:41.240 --> 15:42.708
HE PUSHED THE STATE LEGISLATURE

15:42.708 --> 15:44.811
TO PASS A LAW THAT SET THE BASIC

15:44.811 --> 15:46.245
FRAMEWORK FOR A KENTUCKY HEMP

15:46.245 --> 15:47.413
INDUSTRY.

15:47.413 --> 15:48.381
BUT GETTING HEMP SEEDS IN THE

15:48.381 --> 15:49.649
GROUND REQUIRED THE FEDERAL

15:49.649 --> 15:50.616
GOVERNMENT.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.851
SO, THE STATE TURNED TO ONE OF

16:07.733 --> 16:09.001
IN THE SENATE VERSION OF THE

16:09.001 --> 16:10.837

16:18.344 --> 16:20.079
AFTER IT PASSED, McCONNELL

16:20.079 --> 16:21.314
ISSUED A STATEMENT APPLAUDING

16:21.314 --> 16:22.582
WHAT THIS MIGHT MEAN FOR

16:22.582 --> 16:24.250

16:37.930 --> 16:39.198
WASN'T THAT SIMPLE.

SO ARE WILLING TO MAKE THOSE

INVESTMENTS.

GOING BACKWARDS.

20:29.695 --> 20:30.963
I THINK IT WOULD BE A HARD SELL,

I MEAN, IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

20:39.338 --> 20:40.272
SCALING UP, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED

20:40.272 --> 20:41.240
A LOT MORE HEMP.

BUT EVEN WITH THE CURRENT

20:57.957 --> 21:00.059

MODERN DAY NAPLES, IS FAMOUS FOR

22:40.859 --> 22:43.095
BEING FROZEN IN TIME, PRESERVED

22:43.095 --> 22:45.397
AS IT WAS WHEN THE VOLCANO MOUNT

KNOWN ABOUT THEM.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.288
SO, LAST MONTH, RESEARCHERS

23:09.288 --> 23:11.423
BROUGHT IN A CAT SCAN MACHINE,

23:11.423 --> 23:12.658
LIKE ONE YOU MIGHT FIND IN A

23:25.237 --> 23:26.805
FROM SUFFOCATION, AS PREVIOUSLY

THOUGHT, BUT FROM THE FALLING

23:28.407 --> 23:29.441
BUILDINGS.

23:29.441 --> 23:30.276

LOT OF BROKEN SKULLS.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.462
THE ABSENCE OF CAVITIES IN THE

23:50.462 --> 23:51.196
TEETH.

23:51.196 --> 23:52.564

23:52.564 --> 23:54.366
IT IS NOT COMPLETELY SURPRISING

23:54.366 --> 23:55.334
BECAUSE WE KNOW ABOUT THE

ASTRONAUT SCOTT KELLY HAS SET AN

24:19.625 --> 24:21.427
AMERICAN RECORD FOR LIVING IN

24:24.963 --> 24:28.000
BRINGING HIS GRAND TOTAL TO 384

24:28.000 --> 24:29.234
DAYS OVER FOUR DIFFERENT

24:29.234 --> 24:29.902
MISSIONS.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.437
THAT TOTAL PASSES THE RECORD

24:31.437 --> 24:32.905
PREVIOUSLY HELD BY ASTRONAUT

24:32.905 --> 24:33.706
MIKE FINK.

24:33.706 --> 24:35.274
