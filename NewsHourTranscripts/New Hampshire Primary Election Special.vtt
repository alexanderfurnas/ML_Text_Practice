GWEN IFILL: Good evening, and
welcome to this
special "PBS NewsHour" coverage
of the New

00:10.611 --> 00:11.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hampshire primary.

00:11.578 --> 00:12.412 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:14.448 --> 00:18.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They finished second in Iowa,
but, tonight,
Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump
have claimed

00:19.052 --> 00:24.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
victory in New Hampshire.
Democrat Sanders
scored a resounding win over
Hillary Clinton.

00:24.625 --> 00:31.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It guarantees him a majority of
the 24 delegates
at stake. And Republican Trump
won big in

00:31.164 --> 00:37.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a crowded field, with John
Kasich finishing
second. Trump will take at least
nine of that

00:37.437 --> 00:39.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
state's 23 GOP delegates.

00:39.940 --> 00:45.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the battle for third place on
the Republican
side, Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush and
Marco Rubio continued

00:45.679 --> 00:48.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a tight race late into the
night.

00:48.515 --> 00:53.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As results came into focus, the
candidates
came out to claim victory and
offer concessions.

00:53.520 --> 00:59.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Donald Trump was
triumphant as
he appeared before a crowd of
supporters in

00:59.760 --> 01:01.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Manchester.

01:01.628 --> 01:03.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We want to thank the people of
New Hampshire,

01:03.997 --> 01:04.564 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

01:04.665 --> 01:05.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:05.933 --> 01:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Do we love the
people of New
Hampshire?

01:07.301 --> 01:09.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:09.102 --> 01:13.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You know, I said
it. And I said
it even a year ago. I think, I'm
going to

01:13.206 --> 01:19.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do really well there, because
I'm here a lot.
And it's so beautiful. And I
love it so much.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I love the people.

01:21.782 --> 01:26.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I said I actually think they
like me a
lot. And then, all of a sudden,
we started

01:26.186 --> 01:30.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting numbers in. And everyone
said, how
come they like Trump so much?
But I have so

01:31.091 --> 01:35.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many friends up here. And they
are special,
special people.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, New Hampshire, I want to
thank you. We
love you.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:40.434 --> 01:42.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to be
back a lot.
We're not going to forget you.
You started

01:42.636 --> 01:44.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it. Remember, you started it.

01:44.805 --> 01:50.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Meanwhile, Bernie
Sanders revved
up a jubilant crowd of his
supporters in Concord.

01:50.277 --> 01:54.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
And let me take this opportunity
to thank

01:54.948 --> 02:04.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the many, many thousands of
volunteers here
in the Granite State who worked
so tirelessly.

02:04.891 --> 02:07.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:08.028 --> 02:16.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Our
volunteers worked
night and day, made phone calls,
and knocked

02:16.703 --> 02:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on a heck of a lot of doors.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:20.374 --> 02:29.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: And we won
because of
your energy. Thank you all so
much.

02:29.216 --> 02:31.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:31.318 --> 02:41.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: I want to
thank Julia
Barnes and our great campaign
staff.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:43.263 --> 02:51.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Together,
we have sent
a message that will echo from
Wall Street

02:51.471 --> 02:55.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Washington, from Maine to
California.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:57.911 --> 03:07.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: And that is
that the
government of our great country
belongs to

03:07.754 --> 03:17.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of the people, and not just
a handful
of wealthy campaign contributors
and their

03:17.964 --> 03:19.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
super PACs.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:21.001 --> 03:23.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And now we go to our
political
director, Lisa Desjardins, who
is reporting

03:23.303 --> 03:25.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for us tonight in Manchester,
New Hampshire.

03:25.939 --> 03:30.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa, you have had your ear to
the ground,
talking to voters, talking to
candidates.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What have you learned in the
past several
days while you have been in New
Hampshire

03:33.380 --> 03:36.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that explains what we saw happen
tonight?

03:36.683 --> 03:41.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Dramatic
results for those
of us watching, I think, from
outside of New

03:41.488 --> 03:44.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Hampshire, maybe not as
dramatic, Gwen, for
voters here.

03:44.825 --> 03:48.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Going to the polls this morning,
the names
I heard from voters were the
same names that

03:48.595 --> 03:50.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are doing well tonight.

03:50.497 --> 03:54.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's start with Donald Trump.
Voters who
told me that they were
supporting Donald Trump

03:54.668 --> 03:59.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told me that they were doing it
despite fact
that they think he might be
someone who is

03:59.606 --> 04:04.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offensive. They think that this
country needs
someone who is going to be a
strong leader

04:05.078 --> 04:09.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and who -- maybe who will offend
people, especially
offend, in their words,
America's enemies.

04:09.916 --> 04:15.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the strong leader label
also might
apply in way to Bernie Sanders.
When I talked

04:15.288 --> 04:19.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Democrats who voted for
Bernie Sanders
today -- and there were many,
many of them,

04:19.392 --> 04:24.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the results are showing --
they said they
like that he has been genuine
and he has pushed

04:24.698 --> 04:30.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for his ideas, even when they
were remarkably
unpopular, to today, when
they're gaining

04:30.537 --> 04:32.405 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
traction.

04:32.506 --> 04:36.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They see that a kind of
strength. Those voters
who chose not to go for Hillary
Clinton said

04:36.143 --> 04:40.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they felt that she is someone
who is trying
too hard to say what the people
want to hear,

04:41.014 --> 04:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vs. strong leader type is what
they see in
Bernie Sanders.

04:44.518 --> 04:48.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not to oversimplify things, but
I think that
was a very real theme for voters
here in New

04:48.622 --> 04:50.357 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hampshire today.

04:50.457 --> 04:53.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa, were
you able to
tell what it is that people want
the strong

04:53.260 --> 05:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leader to do? What is the source
of the unhappiness,
the frustration, the anger? Were
you able

05:00.433 --> 05:02.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to figure -- pick that up from
people?

05:02.936 --> 05:06.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes, it is
absolutely the
economy, Judy and Gwen.

05:07.040 --> 05:11.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here in New Hampshire, incomes
are far above
average in the -- of the
country, unemployment

05:11.912 --> 05:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
levels are low, but yet many
voters here don't
feel like things are getting
better. And even

05:16.917 --> 05:21.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more so, they are worried about
their children's
future. They're worried about
student loan

05:21.555 --> 05:23.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debt, which is very high in this
state.

05:23.890 --> 05:28.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they don't see anything
changing to help
that situation. They think new
ideas are the

05:28.562 --> 05:32.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only way for things to go -- get
on a better
course for them. And they say
they weren't

05:33.099 --> 05:35.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hearing new ideas from other
candidates.

05:35.402 --> 05:40.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, all of this said, it should
be remarked
that John Kasich also had a big
night. He

05:40.774 --> 05:44.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won, I think, with voters who
are looking
for a more stable, proven
leader, someone

05:45.011 --> 05:47.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who also they related to
personally.

05:47.247 --> 05:52.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went out, shook hands in this
state, sat
by firesides, quite literally.
And I think

05:52.352 --> 05:56.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that made a difference here for
him. I also
think it's really going to be
interesting

05:56.623 --> 06:02.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to watch the Marco Rubio-Jeb
Bush race with
-- for number three with Ted
Cruz.

06:02.629 --> 06:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just came from Marco Rubio's
concession
speech. Fascinatingly enough,
right off the

06:06.866 --> 06:11.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
top, he said: This was my fault.
It was my
poor performance in the debate
that led to

06:12.005 --> 06:13.807 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he apologized to his
followers. He said
it won't happen again. It was a
very interesting

06:16.676 --> 06:21.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moment for Marco Rubio, a sign
that he is
going to try and reverse course
or kind of

06:21.648 --> 06:23.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get back on track after New
Hampshire.

06:23.516 --> 06:26.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That's what I want
to ask you
about a little bit, Lisa,
because Marco Rubio

06:26.853 --> 06:30.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
did an unusual thing in
admitting that it
was his fault.

06:30.257 --> 06:34.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we also see lot of other
candidates who
didn't necessarily benefit, like
Chris Christie,

06:34.227 --> 06:40.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who was a weapon against Marco
Rubio the other
night. Do we know who might go
home after

06:40.934 --> 06:42.702 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight?

06:42.802 --> 06:46.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, we know
that Chris
Christie is taking at least a
little bit of

06:46.139 --> 06:50.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time off the trail to sort of
recoup and take
another look at his campaign.

06:51.011 --> 06:54.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were some false reports
that he was
announcing a suspension earlier
tonight. But,

06:54.948 --> 06:57.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
instead, what is actually
happening, we're
told, is that he is just taking
some time

06:57.984 --> 07:03.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take a look. I do think he's
got he -- he's
got to really take a hard look
at what's ahead,

07:03.156 --> 07:05.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
especially going into South
Carolina.

07:05.125 --> 07:09.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We haven't talked about Ben
Carson or Carly
Fiorina very much. They're at
the very bottom

07:09.162 --> 07:14.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the New Hampshire pack. And I
think, as
far as staffing, money, and
momentum go, those

07:14.534 --> 07:19.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two candidates have to really
make some difficult
choices probably in the next few
weeks ahead.

07:19.306 --> 07:21.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

07:21.308 --> 07:26.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, Lisa, thank you so much
for your contributions
tonight and all week long in New
Hampshire.

07:26.179 --> 07:29.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's been
amazing to be here.

07:29.215 --> 07:34.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we're
joined by Amy
Walter of The Cook Political
Report.

07:34.454 --> 07:38.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Amy, you have been poring
over those exit
polls, interviews with voters as
they left

07:38.191 --> 07:42.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the polling places in New
Hampshire. What
are you seeing that you could
add to what

07:42.896 --> 07:45.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa's talking -- hearing from
voters on the
ground?

07:45.765 --> 07:48.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well,
it's very interesting, because
what we're

07:48.868 --> 07:53.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seeing from the exit polls, it
lines up in
some ways, the idea that Trump
is going to

07:53.606 --> 07:55.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be the candidate that is going
to shake things
up.

07:55.709 --> 08:01.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it doesn't mean that the
majority of Republicans
in the state feel that that's
what they would

08:01.581 --> 08:05.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like to see going forward. In
fact, when you
asked the question if Trump won
the nomination,

08:05.885 --> 08:11.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would you be satisfied with him
as the nominee,
voters, Republicans voters were
evenly divided;

08:11.191 --> 08:14.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
49 percent said, 48 percent said
no.

08:14.294 --> 08:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he won a -- want to give him
his due.
He won a big victory tonight,
but he's still

08:21.368 --> 08:23.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a very polarizing figure among
Republicans.

08:23.336 --> 08:28.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, is it fair to
say that neither
Republicans who voted
overwhelmingly for Donald

08:28.508 --> 08:33.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Trump tonight and -- or
Democrats who voted
overwhelmingly for Bernie
Sanders tonight

08:33.847 --> 08:35.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
give a fig about electability?

08:35.115 --> 08:36.916 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

08:37.016 --> 08:42.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It is -- that is a
heart over
the head, I think, is one theme
in this election

08:42.522 --> 08:44.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in New Hampshire tonight.

08:44.557 --> 08:48.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, when I looked at what
Democrats were
saying, for those who said that
the most important

08:48.495 --> 08:51.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue to them was who can win in
November
and who has the most experience,
Hillary Clinton

08:51.998 --> 08:55.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was winning those voters with
81, 82 percent.

08:55.301 --> 09:00.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you asked them -- or
when those voters
said it was honest -- who was
honest and trustworthy,

09:00.974 --> 09:06.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who they thought was the most
relatable, who
understood them, Bernie Sanders
wins by big,

09:06.913 --> 09:08.748 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
big, big margins.

09:08.848 --> 09:12.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem for Hillary Clinton
is that her
message of electability, while
she's winning

09:12.352 --> 09:15.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it, wasn't seen as important as
sort of the
heart issues.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

09:17.424 --> 09:20.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right. Sixty
percent of
voters wanted to see somebody
who they could

09:21.094 --> 09:23.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relate to and who they saw as
honest and trustworthy.

09:23.696 --> 09:26.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what is the
message Hillary
Clinton can take from here?

09:26.332 --> 09:28.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Well, that...

09:28.268 --> 09:30.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She told -- she
told the crowd
tonight: We're going to go vote
after vote,

09:30.703 --> 09:31.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
state after state.

09:31.971 --> 09:34.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what is the message she
carries from New
Hampshire?

09:34.174 --> 09:38.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, this is going
to be her
challenge going forward is how
she balances

09:38.344 --> 09:40.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that heart and that head.

09:40.213 --> 09:44.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talked about this the other
night, that
the best candidates are the ones
who campaign

09:44.717 --> 09:49.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in poetry and then govern in
prose. She seems
stuck on prose and hasn't really
found much

09:49.622 --> 09:56.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poetry. So, finding a way to get
that gap
smaller.

09:56.396 --> 10:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when she is talking about
the firewall
of these next few states that
she's going

10:00.467 --> 10:06.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to now after New Hampshire,
especially South
Carolina, that are more diverse
-- these are

10:06.372 --> 10:11.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overwhelmingly white states --
she's hoping
that her success with minority
voters will

10:11.277 --> 10:13.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
help put her over the top in
those states.

10:13.580 --> 10:18.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't know. But she's got
to be able
to -- now that she's lost in New
Hampshire,

10:18.318 --> 10:19.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
does she still have that...

10:19.419 --> 10:21.154 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

10:21.254 --> 10:22.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, that's the
thing. Every
piece of conventional wisdom
this year has

10:22.388 --> 10:23.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gone out the window.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Exactly. Exactly.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, do firewalls
even exist anymore?

10:25.425 --> 10:27.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you start -- when you
hear a campaign
start talking about firewalls,
then you know

10:29.329 --> 10:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a problem, right? When the
campaign -- that
is usually -- the issue is the
message and

10:33.666 --> 10:36.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the messenger are usually the
bigger problem.

10:36.703 --> 10:44.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Bernie Sanders, his message
is resonating.
Again, we haven't seen it
resonate outside

10:44.577 --> 10:49.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two small states that are pretty
homogeneous.
Let's see how it -- once we get
into states

10:49.849 --> 10:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are a little more diverse
and bigger
if that is still going to work.

10:53.253 --> 10:57.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's clearly struck a chord.
And I think
the problems that we're seeing
for Hillary

10:57.457 --> 11:01.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton raised in New Hampshire,
raised in
Iowa are going to continue to
dog her.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And fascinating,
the difficulty
she's had with women voters. She
made this

11:04.964 --> 11:11.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a central feature of her
campaign this time,
unlike in 2008. And yet Bernie
Sanders won

11:11.905 --> 11:14.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with women. And she had very
tough time with
women in Iowa.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: He won with women
narrowly.

11:16.576 --> 11:22.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here is the other takeaway.
He won among
men by over 30 points. That is
remarkable.

11:22.315 --> 11:26.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we spent a whole lot of time
talking about,
will women rally around her? We
kind of ignored

11:26.886 --> 11:27.453 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the fact that...

11:27.554 --> 11:28.388 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

11:28.488 --> 11:30.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There could be a
backlash.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right, or
that she's not
finding a way to connect with
men in the way

11:32.692 --> 11:34.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that she needs to.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I don't want to
underplay Donald
Trump's victory tonight. He
exceeded expectations,

11:37.664 --> 11:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2-1, I think, over John Kasich,
who came in
number two.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, absolutely.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: He even seemed a
little bit surprised
and muted by it tonight.

11:45.004 --> 11:45.872 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

11:45.972 --> 11:47.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, what does he do
next?

11:47.907 --> 11:49.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, he goes to
South Carolina.
And I think this gives him a
great, big boost.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's in a great position in
South Carolina.

11:52.512 --> 11:58.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was already running ahead in
that state.
And he also benefits from the
fact that that

11:58.818 --> 12:02.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
establishment that was supposed
to coalesce
behind one candidate in New
Hampshire still

12:02.956 --> 12:08.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looks like a muddled mess. So,
we go into
South Carolina with a Rubio, a
Christie, a

12:08.394 --> 12:10.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Kasich battling for that.

12:10.363 --> 12:15.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cruz, I think, will do well in
South Carolina.
And right now, that is going to
be the big

12:15.468 --> 12:22.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing to look for, is Cruz vs.
Trump in South
Carolina. Do they go at it so
hard that it

12:22.208 --> 12:24.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allows a third candidate to come
up and win?

12:24.577 --> 12:25.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Fascinating.

12:25.678 --> 12:26.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fascinating, so
many questions.

12:26.879 --> 12:27.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Amy Walter, thank you.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Thank you.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we're going
to do some
digging now into facts and
figures that aren't

12:32.285 --> 12:35.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
results from New Hampshire, but
let's look
anyway -- Hari Sreenivasan.

12:35.989 --> 12:40.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Our data team
looked at
what the numbers say about New
Hampshire going

12:40.293 --> 12:44.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into tonight's primary results.
How does the
Granite State compare to the
rest of the country,

12:44.197 --> 12:49.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, on social media, what are
New Hampshirites
saying about this year's
presidential election?

12:49.202 --> 12:53.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Compared to Iowa and most of the
country,
New Hampshire is whiter and more
wealthy,

12:53.740 --> 12:58.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
according to the Census Bureau;
94 percent
of the voting-age population is
white, vs.

12:59.012 --> 13:07.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
66 percent of the U.S. And the
median household
income is $66,532. That's
$12,000 more than

13:07.420 --> 13:09.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the amount you find nationwide.

13:09.355 --> 13:14.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, there are fewer people
in poverty
in New Hampshire as well. The
national poverty

13:14.127 --> 13:18.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rate is nearly 14 percent,
almost twice as
high as what's found in New
Hampshire, slightly

13:18.998 --> 13:24.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than 8 percent. And they're
more politically
active. Among New Hampshire
residents age

13:24.504 --> 13:29.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
18 or older, the census says
nearly three
out of four are registered to
vote, compared

13:29.609 --> 13:31.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to about two out of three
Americans.

13:31.911 --> 13:36.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's on the minds of New
Hampshire voters
as this year's election gains
momentum? Just

13:36.215 --> 13:40.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like in Iowa last week, Facebook
users in
this small New England state
have more to

13:40.186 --> 13:45.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say about Donald Trump than any
other presidential
contender, Republican or
Democrat. Next, there's

13:45.692 --> 13:51.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz, who won last week's
Iowa GOP caucus,
and then Marco Rubio and Jeb
Bush.

13:51.164 --> 13:56.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The presidential race's two
Democrats, Hillary
Clinton and Bernie Sanders,
follow Trump in

13:56.202 --> 13:58.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
generating interest on Facebook
there.

13:59.072 --> 14:03.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regarding issues that most
concern New Hampshire
voters, conversation on Facebook
may offer

14:03.743 --> 14:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some clues. Campaign finance is
the most important
topic among Facebook users in
New Hampshire

14:09.716 --> 14:14.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leading up to today's primary
vote. Next,
New Hampshirites are talking
about taxes,

14:14.454 --> 14:18.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the economy, Wall Street, and
same-sex marriage.

14:18.291 --> 14:21.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when New Hampshirites want
to learn more
about this year's candidates,
what are they

14:21.494 --> 14:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Googling? According to the
search engine's
News Lab, interest in Rubio
peaked after his

14:27.166 --> 14:33.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debate performance Saturday, and
top-trending
questions among New Hampshire
residents include,

14:33.139 --> 14:36.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is Marco Rubio Catholic and is
Ben Carson
pro-choice?

14:36.242 --> 14:41.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an effort to influence the
hearts and minds,
campaign and special interest
groups are buying

14:41.781 --> 14:47.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lots of ads in New Hampshire.
The Boston Globe
reported that, since December,
more ads have

14:47.520 --> 14:52.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aired in New Hampshire both for
and against
Jeb Bush than anyone else.
Interestingly,

14:52.592 --> 14:55.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ted Cruz was featured in the
fewest ads.

14:55.962 --> 14:59.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight's vote in New England
will show if
those ad dollars make the
difference.

14:59.198 --> 15:02.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The candidates all
took turns
coming to the podium tonight,
some to claim

15:03.069 --> 15:05.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
victory, some to concede
mistakes.

15:05.171 --> 15:10.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ohio's Republican governor, John
Kasich, staked
the future of his campaign on
New Hampshire,

15:10.409 --> 15:14.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and his surprise second-place
finish gives
him room to move on.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He addressed his supporters a
short time ago
in Concord.

15:16.916 --> 15:20.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
We're all made to be part of
healing of this

15:20.486 --> 15:22.321 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

15:22.421 --> 15:29.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we would just slow down
and, by the
way, heal the divisions within
our own families,

15:29.295 --> 15:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be willing to listen to the
person that lives
next door, when you're in such a
hurry to

15:33.833 --> 15:39.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get out of the driveway or such
a hurry to
get out of the shopping center,
just slow

15:39.705 --> 15:44.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down. Look them in the eye. Give
them a hug.

15:44.844 --> 15:50.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You see, it doesn't take
government. It takes
our hearts, our hearts to change
America.

15:50.183 --> 15:56.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in this campaign, I have
become convinced
even more about what it takes to
win a political

15:56.756 --> 16:02.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign and what it takes for
somebody to
be a leader. It's not just
what's up here

16:02.762 --> 16:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the head. It's also what's
deep in here
in the heart.

16:07.366 --> 16:12.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the people of New Hampshire
have taught
me a lesson. And from this day
forward, I'm

16:12.438 --> 16:17.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to go slower and spend my
time listening
and healing and helping and
bringing people

16:17.810 --> 16:20.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
together to fix our great
country.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

16:22.648 --> 16:26.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Over on the
Democratic side,
Hillary Clinton's second-place
victory didn't

16:26.853 --> 16:32.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drive as much enthusiasm, but
she vowed to
supporters in Hooksett it is a
long road to

16:32.525 --> 16:33.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the nomination.

16:34.026 --> 16:34.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Thank you all.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I just want to begin...

16:36.963 --> 16:40.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CROWD: Hillary! Hillary!
Hillary! Hillary!
Hillary! Hillary!

16:40.266 --> 16:45.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Thank
you all very,
very much. My goodness.

16:45.438 --> 16:56.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know what we'd have done
tonight if
we'd actually won. This is a
pretty exciting

16:56.649 --> 16:57.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
event.

16:57.583 --> 17:00.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm very grateful to all of
you.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

17:02.722 --> 17:04.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I want
to begin by
congratulating Senator Sanders
on his victory

17:04.724 --> 17:08.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tonight. And I want to thank
each and every
one of you.

17:08.828 --> 17:13.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I want to say, I still love
New Hampshire.
And I always will.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

17:15.201 --> 17:20.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: And
here's what we're
going to do.

17:20.806 --> 17:28.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we take this campaign to the
entire country.
We're going to fight for every
vote in every

17:28.114 --> 17:34.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state. We're going to fight for
real solutions
that make a real difference in
people's lives.

17:34.553 --> 17:39.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And now to the
analysis of Shields
and Brooks. That is syndicated
columnist Mark

17:39.592 --> 17:43.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shields, and New York Times
columnist David
Brooks, who tonight is in
Manchester, New

17:44.063 --> 17:45.898 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hampshire.

17:45.998 --> 17:49.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields, we just heard
Hillary Clinton
trying to put the best possible
face on what

17:49.468 --> 17:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could not have been a good
evening.

17:50.937 --> 17:54.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: She did. And she
had a very
enthusiastic crowd there.

17:54.307 --> 18:01.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And -- but the problem is, she
got 39 percent
eight years ago and beat Barack
Obama. She

18:01.580 --> 18:09.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got 39 percent tonight and got
her clock cleaned
by Bernie Sanders. And this
wasn't to happen

18:09.121 --> 18:17.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
six months ago, three months
ago. And it really
-- the coronation that we
anticipated a year

18:17.330 --> 18:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago of the -- Bush and the
Clintons has certainly
been interrupted.

18:21.133 --> 18:28.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David, from
New Hampshire,
what are the Democrats to do
with a Democratic

18:28.140 --> 18:32.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
socialist as their
standard-bearer, at least
at this point?

18:32.211 --> 18:37.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, to get under
40 percent
for Hillary Clinton, that's bad.
To lose every

18:37.583 --> 18:43.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
single demographic except
households making
over $200,000 a year, that's
bad.

18:43.723 --> 18:49.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's got to sort of retool.
And, tonight,
she adopted some of that Sanders
rhetoric.

18:49.929 --> 18:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not sure she can be better
at being Bernie
Sanders than he can be.

18:54.233 --> 18:58.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think she's got to go some
other way. Let's
face it. What we learned tonight
is, this

18:58.471 --> 19:03.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is a country with an
underwhelming economy
and a population that doesn't
believe the

19:03.142 --> 19:06.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political system is at all
functional, and
wants transformational change.

19:06.846 --> 19:12.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if you're running for
office, you better
touch those hard, broken spots
in the American

19:12.151 --> 19:17.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
psyche. And Sanders and Trump
are doing it.
Clinton seems pragmatic, but she
is just not

19:17.690 --> 19:20.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
touching those spots quite as
directly and
quite as vibrantly.

19:20.659 --> 19:24.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Mark, what does
going another
way mean for Hillary Clinton?

19:24.230 --> 19:29.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think
David is right.
You can't run against Bernie
Sanders as you're

19:30.069 --> 19:34.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going be tougher on Wall Street
or you're
going to be tougher on economic
interests.

19:34.940 --> 19:37.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have got to draw
differences.

19:37.443 --> 19:43.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What strikes me, Gwen, more than
anything
else is the similarity of the
victories between

19:43.516 --> 19:51.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Trump and Bernie Sanders
tonight. Both of
them ran as outsiders, critical
of the establishment,

19:52.024 --> 19:56.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against the conventional wisdom
of a country
that trade pacts and treaties
are good. They're

19:56.929 --> 19:58.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
both against them.

19:58.764 --> 20:04.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They both emphasize their
opposition to the
U.S. invasion and occupation of
Iraq. They

20:04.170 --> 20:10.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
both are against money
traditionally raised
in politics and its sources. And
both are

20:10.576 --> 20:14.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
critical of Wall Street,
obviously Bernie
Sanders a lot more so.

20:14.346 --> 20:21.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is really an electorate
that is so dissatisfied,
so alienated and so angry at the
political

20:21.487 --> 20:25.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system that they feel has failed
them. It's
not just Democrats or
Republicans. It's across

20:25.624 --> 20:27.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the board.

20:27.493 --> 20:31.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think both Trump and
Sanders were the
beneficiaries of that. And they
touched into

20:31.464 --> 20:36.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that. I don't know -- Hillary
Clinton's got
to make her case differently. I
don't think

20:36.669 --> 20:41.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's going to involve somehow
leveling Bernie
Sanders. I mean, they tried to
do that today

20:41.507 --> 20:46.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by trying to associate him with
Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee
fund-raising,

20:46.378 --> 20:48.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which involved some money from
Wall Street.

20:48.547 --> 20:53.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're not going to tarnish him
on that. He
is believable as the outsider
and the bomb-thrower

20:53.452 --> 20:55.287 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that he's been.

20:55.387 --> 21:00.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David, is
there some hope
for Hillary Clinton, or worry,
conversely,

21:00.126 --> 21:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Donald Trump and Bernie
Sanders that the
territory to come is not going
to be as friendly

21:06.966 --> 21:11.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to them as New Hampshire and
Iowa have been?

21:11.704 --> 21:15.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, we shouldn't
overestimate
any one night.

21:15.641 --> 21:19.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take New Hampshire, we think
it's epic-changing.
And we take an event in Iowa, we
think it's

21:19.745 --> 21:22.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
epic-changing. But there are
going to be a
bunch of epic-changing events
over of the

21:22.815 --> 21:24.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
next three or four months.

21:24.683 --> 21:29.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the big challenge for
Sanders is, can
he win minority votes,
African-Americans,

21:29.789 --> 21:34.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Latino votes? He's getting
crushed right now.
Can he take some of this
momentum and at least

21:34.827 --> 21:39.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
introduce himself to those
voters and, with
some of the his policies, the
minimum wage

21:39.431 --> 21:43.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at $15 or something like that,
can he win
chunk of those voters over?
That's the big

21:43.502 --> 21:45.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
question on the Democratic side.

21:45.371 --> 21:48.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask you both
about John
Kasich tonight, who came in
second on the

21:48.474 --> 21:50.209 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republican side.

21:50.309 --> 21:55.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part of the case he made in his
-- David,
he made in his speech tonight
was, listen,

21:56.015 --> 22:00.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
maybe I represent the kinder,
gentler face
of the Republican Party.

22:00.152 --> 22:05.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't see that on either
party, that
that's what anyone is longing
for.

22:05.991 --> 22:09.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I admired it,
though. He
had to take a shot.

22:09.628 --> 22:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Listen, Kasich did super well
here, but he
has no organization in South
Carolina. He

22:14.567 --> 22:19.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
has no money. He has no
organization anywhere
else or really a potential path
to the nomination

22:19.205 --> 22:21.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
until maybe he gets to the
Midwestern states.

22:21.473 --> 22:25.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he had to take his shot. And
his shot
is running as anti-Trump. I
totally get the

22:26.078 --> 22:27.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
logic. I think it's a smart
thing to do.

22:28.080 --> 22:33.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I happened to be at the Rubio
rally here tonight.
And he did a smart thing. He
said: This wasn't

22:33.419 --> 22:37.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about you people who are working
for me. This
defeat -- and it was a defeat --
was on me.

22:38.090 --> 22:40.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I messed up in the debate. It
will never happen
again.

22:41.093 --> 22:46.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He was -- and it was an
effective owning of
this defeat. And so, as this
thing goes on,

22:46.532 --> 22:50.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the people who react well to
success and to
failure will do well. I thought
both Kasich

22:51.036 --> 22:56.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Rubio handled their own
situation quite
well. And so they took -- they
took the best

22:56.175 --> 22:57.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shot that's available to them.

22:57.476 --> 22:58.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Mark?

22:58.410 --> 23:00.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I agree.

23:00.312 --> 23:06.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Rubio manned up. I have
never seen
a candidate do that, say: It was
me, my fault,

23:06.652 --> 23:10.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that -- maybe I misunderstood
it, but he took
full responsibility.

23:10.756 --> 23:16.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, to some degree, I think
that may be an
antidote to the narrative that
it was: I repeat

23:16.462 --> 23:18.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
myself. Excuse me. I repeat
myself.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Repetition is the first law of
learning.

23:20.833 --> 23:26.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think John Kasich has made a
strong case
for himself as a vice
presidential candidate.

23:26.939 --> 23:31.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I don't think he has the
resources right now
to compete with Donald Trump.

23:32.077 --> 23:38.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump's victory really is
exceptional.
I mean, after Iowa, this man,
who predicated

23:38.651 --> 23:44.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his whole campaign on I'm a
winner, everybody
else is a loser, lost. And he
buckled. He

23:44.857 --> 23:51.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was unsure of himself. He was
publicly chastened.
He blamed Ted Cruz's campaign's
tactics for

23:52.097 --> 23:53.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his defeat.

23:53.932 --> 23:58.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he nearly seemed unsure. And
he really
got his footing back. And this
is an important,

23:58.637 --> 24:04.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important victory. He is now the
clear and
established front-runner for the
Republican

24:04.576 --> 24:05.577 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nomination.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was striking
tonight, David.

24:07.513 --> 24:11.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard Donald Trump say he was
going to
be the greatest president God's
ever created.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's no shortage of
self-regard.

24:13.786 --> 24:17.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, that's a real
humble brag.

(LAUGHTER)

24:19.291 --> 24:23.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. No, he really
is dominant
right now. Mark's right.

24:23.896 --> 24:27.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I still don't think he's going
to get the
nomination. But I have trouble
seeing how

24:27.299 --> 24:33.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's not going to happen. He
just is -- has
become a force of nature.

24:33.806 --> 24:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the question for Donald
Trump is, where's
the ceiling? A, can he make
himself broadly

24:40.012 --> 24:44.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
acceptable to all parts of the
party? And,
B, is there an alternative? Is
anybody going

24:44.817 --> 24:47.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to rise up and become the rival?

24:47.586 --> 24:52.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will it ever be a one-on-one
race, Trump vs.
someone else? Right now, it
looks like Cruz

24:52.591 --> 24:57.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the most likely of those
possible alternatives.
Among the mainstream
conservatives, maybe

24:57.896 --> 25:00.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is no alternative. Maybe
there is no
viable unifying force.

25:00.799 --> 25:06.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it is
fascinating. And,
boy, do we have lot to talk
about and look

25:06.438 --> 25:08.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at over the next days.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark Shields, David Brooks,
thank you both.

25:11.143 --> 25:17.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, again, we turn
the results
tonight in the year's first
presidential primary.

25:17.716 --> 25:22.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrat Bernie Sanders claimed
a big win
in New Hampshire over Hillary
Clinton, after

25:22.187 --> 25:27.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she had barely edged him out in
Iowa. Donald
Trump walked away with the
Republican race,

25:27.993 --> 25:31.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
far outpacing John Kasich in
second place.

25:31.597 --> 25:37.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush and Marco
Rubio were tightly
bunched in a fight for third
place in the

25:37.302 --> 25:42.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOP field. But Chris Christie
could do no
better than sixth place. He said
he's going

25:42.474 --> 25:45.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
home to New Jersey to ponder his
future course.

25:45.544 --> 25:50.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we ask you to
tune in on
Thursday, because Gwen and I
will moderate

25:50.516 --> 25:55.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Democratic presidential
debate, in partnership
with Facebook. And that's from
the University

25:55.821 --> 26:00.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. That
will start Thursday
at 9:00 p.m. Eastern.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Can't wait.

26:02.428 --> 26:06.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's all for our special
coverage of
the Iowa caucuses (sic) here on
the "PBS NewsHour."

26:06.832 --> 26:07.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

26:15.007 --> 26:41.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
