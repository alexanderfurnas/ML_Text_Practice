11:50.944 --> 11:52.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

11:52.312 --> 11:53.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CYCLISTS ON OUR STREETS, WE'VE

11:53.513 --> 11:56.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEN A ONE-THIRD REDUCTION IN

11:56.549 --> 11:59.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CYCLIST INJURIES AND FATALITIES,

11:59.052 --> 12:00.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHILE WE'VE SEEN A QUADRUPLING

12:00.653 --> 12:03.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF PEOPLE BIKING AROUND.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

12:05.458 --> 12:06.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIKE, THE BIKE SHARE PROGRAM

12:06.859 --> 12:08.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUNDED IN PART BY CITIBANK AND

12:08.928 --> 12:10.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASTERCARD THAT'S BEEN USED MORE

12:10.496 --> 12:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN 26 MILLION TIMES SINCE

12:12.932 --> 12:14.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAUNCHING THREE YEARS AGO.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CITI FOUNDATION IS ONE OF

12:16.169 --> 12:17.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNDERWRITERS OF THIS

YORK CITY IN 60 YEARS AND

12:22.442 --> 12:24.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO COST TO TAXPAYERS.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK IT'S A MODEL,

12:26.045 --> 12:27.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULARLY IN AN ERA WHERE WE

12:27.313 --> 12:28.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FEDERAL

12:28.181 --> 12:29.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

12:29.282 --> 12:30.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

>> Sreenivasan: SADIK-KHAN

12:32.085 --> 12:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYS THE HUGE NUMBER OF RIDERS

12:33.519 --> 12:35.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY MAKES BIKING SAFER.

12:40.326 --> 12:40.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT?

>> Sreenivasan: RIGHT.

12:41.628 --> 12:42.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

12:42.695 --> 12:44.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LONG WAY TO CALM DOWN THE

STREETS.

12:44.998 --> 12:45.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: NEW YORK CITY

12:45.698 --> 12:47.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STREETS NOW HAVE 400 MILES OF

30 MILES SEPARATED FROM VEHICLE

12:57.310 --> 12:59.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT

13:15.028 --> 13:17.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CREATES THAT INITIAL RESISTANCE

13:17.897 --> 13:19.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO CHANGE?

13:19.165 --> 13:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE GET PRETTY COMFORTABLE

13:20.233 --> 13:23.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH HOW A SPACE LOOKS AND HOW A

13:23.803 --> 13:25.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPACE IS USED, UNTIL THEY TRY

13:25.772 --> 13:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING ELSE, RIGHT?

13:26.639 --> 13:27.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION,

13:27.807 --> 13:28.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE REALLY

13:28.808 --> 13:30.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACHED TO THE STATUS QUO.

13:30.576 --> 13:32.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHEN YOU CHANGE THE STATUS

13:32.412 --> 13:34.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUO, WE FIND THE STATUS QUO

13:34.514 --> 13:36.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUSHES BACK HARD, RIGHT?

13:36.616 --> 13:37.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND PEOPLE HAVE EXPECTATIONS

13:37.684 --> 13:39.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT OUR STREETS ARE FOR CARS.

13:39.986 --> 13:40.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY

13:40.787 --> 13:42.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER EXPECTATIONS THAT THEY CAN

13:42.088 --> 13:43.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE ANYTHING ELSE.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO, THAT WAS ONE OF THE

13:45.558 --> 13:46.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INNOVATIONS THAT WE DID IN NEW
