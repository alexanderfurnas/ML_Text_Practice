JUDY WOODRUFF: The Nobel Peace
Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo died
yesterday in China of liver

00:05.433 --> 00:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cancer after years behind
bars for his efforts to
democratize his homeland.

00:12.833 --> 00:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Liu's work and his
plight brought him global
attention, work that enraged
the Chinese government.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His death brought an
outpouring of tributes.

00:20.433 --> 00:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham has this look
at Liu Xiaobo's life and legacy.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: From Hong
Kong to Sydney and around the
world, there have been vigils

00:31.233 --> 00:33.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
overnight and today.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Kamm runs a human rights
organization based in San
Francisco that advocates for

00:37.700 --> 00:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
political prisoners in China.

00:39.333 --> 00:42.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN KAMM, The Dui
Hua Foundation: A
great loss for China.

00:42.100 --> 00:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Someone who was committed to
nonviolent change is gone.

00:49.266 --> 00:51.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's a great
loss for the world.

00:51.366 --> 00:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: He'd been
released from prison on medical
leave only a few weeks earlier,

00:55.333 --> 00:57.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but supporters say he
was denied proper care.

WU'ER KAIXI, Exiled
Chinese dissident:
The Chinese government
brutally killed my teacher

01:02.333 --> 01:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and one of the most
genuine and conscientious
Chinese in the world.

01:06.233 --> 01:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would like to ask the world,
world leaders and people around
the world, which side are

01:13.300 --> 01:15.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you on?

01:15.200 --> 01:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President
Trump praised Liu in a
statement yesterday, calling him

01:17.433 --> 01:21.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a poet, scholar, and
courageous advocate.

01:21.400 --> 01:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China's government flatly
denies Liu was mistreated,
and, today, a spokesman
condemned the international

01:27.000 --> 01:29.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
criticisms.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GENG SHUANG, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesperson
(through translator):
Those statements are

01:31.100 --> 01:35.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
interference to China's
judicial sovereignty
and domestic affairs.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Liu Xiaobo is a criminal who was
put on trial by China's laws.

01:38.700 --> 01:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For decades,
Liu was one of the Chinese
government's most outspoken

01:42.933 --> 01:45.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
critics.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He rose to prominence during the
1989 Tiananmen Square protests,
returning from the U.S. to

01:50.166 --> 01:52.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
support the original
student demonstrators.

01:52.466 --> 01:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After troops opened fire killing
hundreds, perhaps thousands,
Liu helped negotiate safe

01:57.466 --> 02:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
passage for the survivors.

02:00.100 --> 02:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He remained in China
despite detention and
constant surveillance and
continued his political

02:05.466 --> 02:08.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
advocacy.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2008, he helped author
Charter 08, a manifesto
demanding political
and civil reform, and

02:13.000 --> 02:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he was sentenced to 11 years
in prison for subversion.

02:15.333 --> 02:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN KAMM: Ten thousand
people signed that petition.

02:19.233 --> 02:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is the only one to have
been sentenced to prison.

02:23.733 --> 02:26.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I think he
sacrificed there, too.

02:26.366 --> 02:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But the
case gained international
attention, and, in 2010,
over China's vehement

02:32.633 --> 02:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
objections, Liu was awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize.

02:35.900 --> 02:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stuck in prison, Liu was unable
to attend the Nobel ceremony,
so a chair was left empty

02:41.366 --> 02:43.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Oslo.

02:43.433 --> 02:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a statement he had
written for his trial was
used as his Nobel lecture.

02:46.166 --> 02:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Hatred can rot a person's
wisdom and conscience," it said.

02:50.500 --> 02:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, Beijing's hard line on
Liu makes clear that the reforms
he sought for decades appear

02:56.400 --> 02:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
increasingly out of reach.

02:58.366 --> 03:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KAMM: There's a
major party meeting
coming up in a few months.

03:01.700 --> 03:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government and its president
and Chairman Xi Jinping will
be inclined to be very, very

03:08.733 --> 03:10.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tough.

03:10.700 --> 03:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In terms of changing
China's political system,
I don't see it, I'm afraid.

03:16.533 --> 03:19.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
focus turns now to
Liu's wife, Liu Xia.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She remains under house arrest.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And calls for her release,
including from the
secretary of state, have
so far gone unheeded.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm William Brangham.
