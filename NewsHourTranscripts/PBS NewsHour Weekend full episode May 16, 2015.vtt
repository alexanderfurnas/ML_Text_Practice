00:13.747 --> 00:16.216
COMMANDOS ON THE GROUND IN SYRIA

00:16.216 --> 00:18.518

00:18.518 --> 00:19.887
UNITED STATES LOSES ONE KEY

00:19.887 --> 00:21.655
WEAPON IN THE WAR ON DRUGS;

00:21.655 --> 00:23.523
AND, IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT,

00:23.523 --> 00:24.825
IS IT SAFE TO CONTROL THE SPREAD

00:24.825 --> 00:26.326
OF DISEASE WITH GENETICALLY-

00:26.326 --> 00:28.028
MODIFIED MOSQUITOES?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.763
>> THE DANGER OF THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:29.763 --> 00:31.298
IS EXCEPTIONALLY LOW.

00:31.298 --> 00:33.300
>> I DON'T WANT MY KIDS TO BE

00:33.300 --> 00:34.434
LABORATORY RATS.

00:34.434 --> 00:35.636

NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.072

00:39.072 --> 00:40.807
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:40.807 --> 00:42.276
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.277
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.144
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:44.144 --> 00:45.579
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH NEWS IN

00:45.579 --> 00:46.847
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.649
LATE LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA

00:48.649 --> 00:50.584
AUTHORIZED A RARE AND SUCCESSFUL

00:50.584 --> 00:53.153
GROUND RAID INTO EASTERN SYRIA.

00:53.153 --> 00:54.488
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS U.S.

00:54.488 --> 00:55.622
COMMANDOS KILLED A SENIOR

00:55.622 --> 00:56.890
ISLAMIC STATE LEADER, CAPTURED

00:56.890 --> 00:59.092
HIS WIFE AND CONFISCATED ISIS

00:59.092 --> 01:01.028
COMPUTER DATA IN AL-AMR.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.596
OFFICIALS SAY ISIS SENIOR LEADER

01:02.596 --> 01:04.298
ABU SAYYAF WAS INVOLVED IN

01:04.298 --> 01:06.166
MILITARY OPERATIONS AND OVERSAW

01:06.166 --> 01:08.201
ILLICIT OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS,

01:08.201 --> 01:09.937
FUNDING TERRORIST ATTACKS.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.471
HIS WIFE, UMM SAYYAF, IS ALSO

01:11.471 --> 01:12.906
ACCUSED OF PLAYING AN IMPORTANT

01:12.906 --> 01:14.508
ROLE IN TERRORIST ATTACKS AND

01:14.508 --> 01:16.543
MAY HAVE HELPED ENSLAVE A WOMAN

01:16.543 --> 01:18.578
WHO WAS RESCUED IN LAST NIGHT'S

01:18.578 --> 01:19.346
RAID.

01:19.346 --> 01:20.614
SAYYAF'S WIFE IS BEING DETAINED

01:20.614 --> 01:21.715
IN IRAQ.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.083
IN A STATEMENT, U.S. DEFENSE

01:23.083 --> 01:24.785
SECRETARY ASHTON CARTER CALLED

01:24.785 --> 01:26.987
THE RAID A "SIGNIFICANT BLOW TO

01:26.987 --> 01:28.655
ISIL" AND ADDED:

01:36.163 --> 01:37.597
THE GROUND RAID COMES JUST AS

01:37.597 --> 01:39.166
THE U.S. AND ITS ALLIES

01:39.166 --> 01:41.134
CONDUCTED SIX AIR STRIKES IN

01:41.134 --> 01:44.237
SYRIA AND 15 MORE IN IRAQ, ALL

01:44.237 --> 01:45.572
TARGETING ISLAMIC STATE

01:45.572 --> 01:46.273
FIGHTERS.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.574
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IRAQI

01:47.574 --> 01:48.742
GOVERNMENT FORCES SUFFERED A

01:48.742 --> 01:51.278
SERIOUS SETBACK, LOSING CONTROL

01:51.278 --> 01:52.312
OF RAMADI.

01:52.312 --> 01:53.914
ISLAMIC STATE MILITANTS TOOK

01:53.914 --> 01:55.515
OVER THE CITY FRIDAY AFTER A

01:55.515 --> 01:57.718
WAVE OF SUICIDE BOMBINGS.

01:57.718 --> 01:58.485
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JOHN

01:58.485 --> 01:59.619
BOEHNER SAID THAT WHILE HE'S

01:59.619 --> 02:01.288
ENCOURAGED BY TODAY'S NEWS, HE

02:01.288 --> 02:03.223
REMAINS "GRAVELY CONCERNED BY

02:03.223 --> 02:05.225
ISIL'S ASSAULT ON RAMADI THAT

02:05.225 --> 02:06.526
THREATENS THE STABILITY AND

02:06.526 --> 02:08.729
SOVEREIGNTY OF IRAQ, WHICH IS

02:08.729 --> 02:10.697
VITAL TO AMERICA'S INTERESTS."

02:10.697 --> 02:11.732
FOR SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THE

02:11.732 --> 02:12.733
RAID, I'M JOINED BY DOUG

02:12.733 --> 02:14.267
OLLIVANT IN WASHINGTON D.C.

02:14.267 --> 02:15.535
HE WAS THE DIRECTOR FOR IRAQ IN

02:15.535 --> 02:16.803
THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL IN

02:16.803 --> 02:17.671
THE BUSH AND OBAMA

02:17.671 --> 02:18.438
ADMINISTRATIONS.

02:18.438 --> 02:19.439
HE IS A SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY

02:19.439 --> 02:20.474
FELLOW AT THE NEW AMERICA

02:20.474 --> 02:21.875
FOUNDATION AND A PARTNER AT

02:21.875 --> 02:23.343
MANTID INTERNATIONAL.

02:23.343 --> 02:24.478
SO, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS

02:24.478 --> 02:25.445
INDIVIDUAL?

02:25.445 --> 02:26.513
WHY WAS HE SUCH A HIGH-VALUE

02:26.513 --> 02:27.547
TARGET?

02:27.547 --> 02:28.148
>> THERE ARE MANY THINGS WE

02:28.148 --> 02:28.949
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS

02:28.949 --> 02:29.583
INDIVIDUAL.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.251
NOW, PRESUMABLY, THE U.S.

02:31.251 --> 02:32.919
INTELLIGENCE KNOWS THE FUNCTION

02:32.919 --> 02:33.720
THAT HE IS PERFORMING IN THE

02:33.720 --> 02:34.688
ORGANIZATION.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.956
HE'S EVIDENTLY VERY TIED INTO

02:35.956 --> 02:38.191
FINANCING, OIL SALES, AND THE

02:38.191 --> 02:38.759
LIKE.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.293
BUT EXACTLY WHO HE IS, WE'RE NOT

02:40.293 --> 02:41.495
SURE.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.630
ABU SAYYAF, HIS NICKNAME MEANING

02:43.630 --> 02:44.865
"FATHER OF SAYYAF."

02:44.865 --> 02:46.533
WE DON'T KNOW WHO SAYYAF IS.

02:46.533 --> 02:47.534
PRESUMABLY HIS SON BUT WE DON'T

02:47.534 --> 02:49.102
KNOW HOW OLD OR WHAT HE DOES.

02:49.102 --> 02:50.537
WE SEEM CONFUSED WHERE HE COMES

02:50.537 --> 02:51.738
FROM.

02:51.738 --> 02:52.973
THE ADMINISTRAION SEEMS TO THINK

02:52.973 --> 02:54.775
HE'S A TUNISIAN, BUT WE HAVE HAD

02:54.775 --> 02:55.842
REPORTS OUT OF THE REGION SAYING

02:55.842 --> 02:58.345
HE'S FROM MOSUL AND BEFORE THAT

02:58.345 --> 02:59.613
FROM SAUDI ARABIA.

02:59.613 --> 03:00.547
>> Sreenivasan: ONE OF THE

03:00.547 --> 03:01.815
INTERESTING THINGS I FOUND IS

03:01.815 --> 03:04.051
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HEARD

03:04.051 --> 03:06.420
ABOUT U.S. TROOPS ON THE GROUND

03:06.420 --> 03:08.688
IN SYRIA, AND THEY WERE LAUNCHED

03:08.688 --> 03:10.090
FROM IRAQ.

03:10.090 --> 03:10.857
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

03:10.857 --> 03:11.825
SO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT

03:11.825 --> 03:14.061
WE KNOW OF THAT U.S. SPECIAL

03:14.061 --> 03:16.463
FORCES HAVE GONE INTO SYRIA WITH

03:16.463 --> 03:17.998
THE INTENT OF KILLING OR

03:17.998 --> 03:19.699
CAPTURING ENEMY COMBATANTS.

03:19.699 --> 03:20.934
WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS THE

03:20.934 --> 03:22.803
ATTEMPTED RAID TO RESCUE

03:22.803 --> 03:24.304
HOSTAGES, SUCH AS JAMES FOLEY

03:24.304 --> 03:25.138
BEFORE.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.073
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE

03:26.073 --> 03:27.441
GONE FORWARD TO CONDUCT COMBAT

03:27.441 --> 03:28.642
AND TRY TO KILL AND CAPTURE

03:28.642 --> 03:29.443
PEOPLE.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.912
AND IT WAS LAUNCHED FROM IRAQ.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.381
IN THE PAST, IRAQ HAS BEEN VERY

03:34.381 --> 03:35.715
CIRCUMSPECT ABOUT ALLOWING

03:35.715 --> 03:37.417
ATTACKS TO BE LAUNCHED OUTSIDE

03:37.417 --> 03:38.618
ITS BORDERS INTO ANOTHER

03:38.618 --> 03:39.486
COUNTRY.

03:39.486 --> 03:40.921
EVIDENTLY, THE EXISTENCE OF THE

03:40.921 --> 03:42.355
ISLAMIC STATE HAS CHANGED THEIR

03:42.355 --> 03:43.390
MIND ON THAT POINT.

03:43.390 --> 03:43.924
>> Sreenivasan: CRITICS OF

03:43.924 --> 03:45.358
THE ADMINISTRATION POINT OUT IS

03:45.358 --> 03:47.327
THIS NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT THIS

03:47.327 --> 03:48.995
NEWS IS HAPPENING AROUND THE

03:48.995 --> 03:51.331
SAME TIME THAT RAMADI, A CITY IN

03:51.331 --> 03:52.833
IRAQ, IS FALLING TO ISIS

03:52.833 --> 03:53.567
FIGHTERS?

03:53.567 --> 03:54.901
>> IT'S CERTAINLY CONVENIENT FOR

03:54.901 --> 03:55.836
THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE NEWS

03:55.836 --> 03:57.604
IS TURNING TO THIS RAID RATHER

03:57.604 --> 04:00.107
THAN THE VERY REAL DANGERS IN

04:00.107 --> 04:00.340
RAMADI.

04:00.340 --> 04:01.842
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE NEWS THIS

04:01.842 --> 04:03.276
MORNING SEEMS TO BE THAT RAMADI

04:03.276 --> 04:06.446
IS JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

04:06.446 --> 04:07.481
SOME BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN

04:07.481 --> 04:08.348
RECOVERED IN THE CITY.

04:08.348 --> 04:09.749
REINFORCEMENTS ARE FLOWING FROM

04:09.749 --> 04:11.618
BAGHDAD, SO THERE'S A VERY REAL

04:11.618 --> 04:13.053
CONTEST IN RAMADI, AND WE NEED

04:13.053 --> 04:14.154
TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, AND THE

04:14.154 --> 04:15.655
ISLAMIC STATE CLEARLY HAD SOME

04:15.655 --> 04:17.791
GOOD DAYS THE PAST DAY OR TWO

04:17.791 --> 04:19.559
BUT WE'LL ALSO SEE HOW RAMADI

04:19.559 --> 04:20.327
ENDS UP.

04:20.327 --> 04:21.027
>> Sreenivasan: THERE IS

04:21.027 --> 04:22.629
ALSO THIS STORY LINE ON PALMYRA,

04:22.629 --> 04:27.100
ANOTHER IMPORTANT SITE

04:27.100 --> 04:31.538
CULTURALLY THAT IS THREATENED BY

04:31.538 --> 04:34.574
ISIS' ADVANCE.

04:34.574 --> 04:35.942
>> A VERY BEAUTIFUL SET OF ROMAN

04:35.942 --> 04:36.510
RUINS.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.278
I BELIEVE IT'S A UNESCO HERITAGE

04:38.278 --> 04:40.981
SITE, AND IT'S BEING VERY MUCH

04:40.981 --> 04:43.783
THREATENED BY ISIL AS WELL.

04:43.783 --> 04:44.951
THIS IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE

04:44.951 --> 04:46.620
WE'RE SEEING CONFLICT BETWEEN

04:46.620 --> 04:50.190
THE SYRIAN REGIME, THE ASSAD

04:50.190 --> 04:51.525
REGIME, AND ISIL DIRECTLY.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.893
MANY PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT

04:52.893 --> 04:54.227
THERE ARE MANY PLACE WHERE THE

04:54.227 --> 04:55.662
TWO DON'T FIGHT EACH OTHER.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.264
WELL, THERE IS A CASE WHERE THEY

04:57.264 --> 04:58.298
ARE, AND PERHAPS WE'RE SEEING

04:58.298 --> 05:00.734
THE DYNAMICS BETWEEN THE ASSAD

05:00.734 --> 05:02.802
REGIME AND ISIL CHANGING AS

05:02.802 --> 05:05.005
THEY'RE NOW IN COMBAT ON THIS

05:05.005 --> 05:06.072
FRONT.

05:06.072 --> 05:07.174
>> Sreenivasan: IN THIS LARGER

05:07.174 --> 05:09.209
NARRATIVE, HOW IMPORTANT IS THE

05:09.209 --> 05:11.111
KILLING OF ANY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL

05:11.111 --> 05:12.279
IN THE LEADERSHIP RANKS?

05:12.279 --> 05:13.446
>> LOOK, THE KILLING OF ANY

05:13.446 --> 05:15.782
SINGLE INDIVIDUAL NEVER REALLY

05:15.782 --> 05:19.186
MATTERS IN ANY ORGANIZATION.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.086
WE'VE-- WE'VE HEARD HIM

05:20.086 --> 05:21.855
DESCRIBED AS THE CHIEF FINANCIAL

05:21.855 --> 05:25.892
OFFICER OF ISIL IN SYRIA.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.060
IF YOU TAKE OUT THE CHIEF

05:27.060 --> 05:28.228
FINANCIAL OFFICER OF ANY

05:28.228 --> 05:29.930
CORPORATION IN AMERICA, HIS

05:29.930 --> 05:31.932
JUNIOR, ONE OF HIS UNDERLINGS

05:31.932 --> 05:33.833
WILL STEP UP, TAKE HIS PLACE,

05:33.833 --> 05:35.068
STEP INTO THAT ROLE.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.169
THE ISLAMIC STATE IS GOING TO DO

05:36.169 --> 05:38.038
SOMETHING VERY, VERY SIMILAR.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.839
THAT SAID, IT NEVER HURTS TO

05:39.839 --> 05:43.210
TAKE OUT A SENIOR LEADER AND

05:43.210 --> 05:43.510
IMPORTANTLY THE INTELLIGENCE

05:43.510 --> 05:44.844
THAT WAS GATHERED FROM THIS

05:44.844 --> 05:46.746
RAID, THE THINGS THAT HIS WIFE

05:46.746 --> 05:49.749
KNOWS, THE DATA, THE LAPTOPS,

05:49.749 --> 05:51.885
THE THUMB DRIVES-- ALL THIS

05:51.885 --> 05:53.019
INTELLIGENCE THAT'S GATHERED IN

05:53.019 --> 05:55.322
THE RAID MAY BE VERY IMPORTANT.

05:55.322 --> 05:55.422
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

05:55.422 --> 05:56.723
DOUGLAS OLLIVANT, JOINING US

05:56.723 --> 05:58.091
FROM WASHINGTON, THANKS SO MUCH.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.492
>> THANK YOU, HARI.

05:59.859 --> 06:00.860
>> Sreenivasan: INVESTIGATORS IN

06:00.860 --> 06:02.362
THE DEADLY AMTRAK TRAIN

06:02.362 --> 06:03.830
DERAILMENT IN PHILADELPHIA HAVE

06:03.830 --> 06:05.699
CALLED IN F.B.I. EXPERTS TO

06:05.699 --> 06:07.300
FIGURE OUT WHETHER SOMETHING

06:07.300 --> 06:08.768
STRUCK THE LEFT SIDE OF THE

06:08.768 --> 06:10.103
TRAIN'S WINDSHIELD BEFORE THE

06:10.103 --> 06:11.004
ACCIDENT.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.372
INVESTIGATORS REPORTEDLY FOUND

06:12.372 --> 06:13.940
AN UNEXPLAINED, FIST-SIZED

06:13.940 --> 06:16.076
INDENTATION IN THE GLASS.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.444
THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION

06:17.444 --> 06:18.778
SAFETY BOARD SAYS THERE'S WORD

06:18.778 --> 06:19.913
ANOTHER REGIONAL TRAIN MIGHT

06:19.913 --> 06:21.114
HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY SOME KIND OF

06:21.114 --> 06:22.515
PROJECTILE, TOO.

06:22.515 --> 06:23.917
INVESTIGATORS HAVE ALSO

06:23.917 --> 06:25.218
QUESTIONED THE DERAILED TRAIN'S

06:25.218 --> 06:26.753
ENGINEER, BUT HE TOLD THEM HE

06:26.753 --> 06:27.754
DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING THAT

06:27.754 --> 06:29.155
HAPPENED AFTER HE LEFT NORTH

06:29.155 --> 06:31.091
PHILADELPHIA ON TUESDAY.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.993
THE BODIES OF THE EIGHT VICTIMS

06:32.993 --> 06:34.127
HAVE BEEN RECOVERED.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.695
MORE THAN 200 OTHERS ARE

06:35.695 --> 06:37.797
RECUPERATING FROM INJURIES.

06:37.797 --> 06:39.199
IN EGYPT, A COURT HAS SENTENCED

06:39.199 --> 06:40.900
OUSTED PRESIDENT MOHAMMED MORSI

06:40.900 --> 06:41.901
TO DEATH.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.770
MORSI AND MORE THAN 100 OTHER

06:43.770 --> 06:45.005
DEFENDANTS WERE CONVICTED OF

06:45.005 --> 06:47.240
ESCAPING DURING A MASS JAILBREAK

06:47.240 --> 06:48.642
IN 2011.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.176
MORSI SUPPOSEDLY COLLUDED WITH

06:50.176 --> 06:51.878
FOREIGNERS TO FREE ISLAMIC

06:51.878 --> 06:52.712
MILITANTS.

06:52.712 --> 06:54.547
HE'S CURRENTLY SERVING A 20-YEAR

06:54.547 --> 06:56.116
PRISON TERM FOR ARRESTING AND

13:51.731 --> 13:53.966
DIDN'T HARM ANYONE.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.401
WITH THAT IN MIND, THE FIVE

13:55.401 --> 13:56.436
ELECTED MOSQUITO CONTROL

13:56.436 --> 13:58.604
OFFICIALS IN THE KEYS DECIDED TO

13:58.604 --> 14:00.973
PURSUE THEIR OWN G.M. MOSQUITO

14:00.973 --> 14:03.009
EXPERIMENT IN THE SMALL ISLAND

14:03.009 --> 14:05.378
NEIGHBORHOOD OF KEY HAVEN.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.013
AND OXITEC AGREED TO CONDUCT THE

14:07.013 --> 14:09.282
TRIAL FOR FREE, A TRIAL THAT HAS

14:09.282 --> 14:10.917
YET TO BEGIN.

14:10.917 --> 14:11.851
INITIALLY, FLORIDA KEYS

14:11.851 --> 14:14.153
BUSINESSPERSON MILA DE MIER SAYS

14:14.153 --> 14:16.522
THAT ALL SOUNDED GREAT TO HER.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.724
>> I SAY, "WOW, THIS IS

14:17.724 --> 14:18.491
FANTASTIC!

14:18.491 --> 14:19.826
THIS IS A REALLY, REALLY GREAT

14:19.826 --> 14:21.027
IDEA.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.161
BE ABLE TO FIGHT MOSQUITOES WITH

14:22.161 --> 14:23.696
ANOTHER MOSQUITOES?

14:23.696 --> 14:25.498
WHAT A GREAT CONCEPT!"

14:25.498 --> 14:26.499
AND, OBVIOUSLY, I DON'T LIKE

14:26.499 --> 14:27.967
MOSQUITOES BITING MY KIDS OR MY

14:27.967 --> 14:29.302
DOGS.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.336
>> Reporter: BUT DE MIER SAYS

14:30.336 --> 14:31.804
THE MORE SHE CONSIDERED IT, SHE

14:31.804 --> 14:34.006
FELT THE SCIENCE WAS TOO NEW,

14:34.006 --> 14:35.475
AND NOT ENOUGH WAS KNOWN FOR HER

14:35.475 --> 14:37.243
TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH G.M.

14:37.243 --> 14:38.945
MOSQUITOES IN HER COMMUNITY,

14:38.945 --> 14:40.747
DESPITE OXITEC'S SAFETY

14:40.747 --> 14:42.148
ASSURANCES.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.249
DE MIER STARTED AN ONLINE

14:43.249 --> 14:44.784
PETITION AGAINST THE MOSQUITO

14:44.784 --> 14:47.353
TRIAL THAT'S GATHERED 150,000

14:47.353 --> 14:48.621
SIGNATURES FROM AROUND THE

14:48.621 --> 14:49.455
WORLD.

14:49.455 --> 14:51.257
>> I DO NOT WANT MY KIDS TO BE

14:51.257 --> 14:52.658
LABORATORY RATS.

14:52.658 --> 14:53.960
I DON'T WANT MY KIDS TO BE

14:53.960 --> 14:55.261
GUINEA PIGS.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.496
WHY?

14:56.496 --> 14:58.131
BECAUSE THIS IS A BRAND NEW

14:58.131 --> 14:59.565
TECHNOLOGY.

14:59.565 --> 15:00.666
YOU GET THESE MOSQUITOES, YOU

15:00.666 --> 15:02.368
RELEASE ONCE AND FOR ALL, AND

15:02.368 --> 15:04.470
THEN LET'S EXPERIMENT TO SEE

15:04.470 --> 15:05.471
WHAT HAPPENS.

15:05.471 --> 15:06.239
>> Reporter: UNIVERSITY OF

15:06.239 --> 15:08.107
FLORIDA PROFESSOR PHIL LOUNIBOS

15:08.107 --> 15:09.542
HAS STUDIED MOSQUITOES AND THE

15:09.542 --> 15:12.011
DISEASES THEY CARRY FOR OVER 40

15:12.011 --> 15:13.045
YEARS.

15:13.045 --> 15:14.046
HE'S NOT INVOLVED WITH THE

15:14.046 --> 15:15.815
PROPOSED G.M. EXPERIMENT IN THE

15:15.815 --> 15:16.783
KEYS.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.117
>> WE BELIEVE, THOSE OF US WHO

15:18.117 --> 15:21.120
HAVE WORKED WITH MOSQUITOES,

15:21.120 --> 15:24.590
THAT THE PROBABILITY OF

15:24.590 --> 15:28.561
SOMETHING GOING WRONG IS NOT

15:28.561 --> 15:29.562
VERY HIGH.

15:29.562 --> 15:30.096
>> Reporter: LOUNIBOS IS

15:30.096 --> 15:31.230
CONVINCED THE TRIAL WOULD BE

15:31.230 --> 15:33.399
SAFE, BUT HE QUESTIONS ITS

15:33.399 --> 15:34.901
EFFECTIVENESS.

15:34.901 --> 15:36.235
HE SAYS OTHER MOSQUITO SPECIES

15:36.235 --> 15:38.271
CAN CARRY DENGUE, AND THE LOCAL

15:38.271 --> 15:40.406
BUGS COULD EVOLVE TO OUTSMART

15:40.406 --> 15:42.775
THE GENETICALLY MODIFIED MALES.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.644
>> IN THE ABSENCE OF DENGUE, THE

15:44.644 --> 15:46.813
ABSENCE OF A REALLY SIGNIFICANT

15:46.813 --> 15:48.548
THREAT OF DENGUE, I SEE THE

15:48.548 --> 15:54.287
OXITEC IMPLEMENTATION IN THE

15:54.287 --> 15:57.190
KEYS IN THE CONTEXT OF STRONG

15:57.190 --> 16:00.693
PUBLIC OPPOSITION TO BE

16:00.693 --> 16:01.861
INAPPROPRIATE.

16:01.861 --> 16:02.762
>> Reporter: GLOBALLY, DENGUE

16:02.762 --> 16:04.964
HAS SURGED 30-FOLD IN THE PAST

16:04.964 --> 16:06.666
50 YEARS, AND INCREASED TRAVEL

16:06.666 --> 16:08.634
FROM ENDEMIC AREAS ALONG WITH

16:08.634 --> 16:10.603
WARMER TEMPERATURES MEANS THE

16:10.603 --> 16:12.138
THREAT IS SPREADING.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.639
I ASKED DE MIER WHAT MIGHT

16:13.639 --> 16:15.274
HAPPEN IF SHE BLOCKS THE TRIAL

16:15.274 --> 16:16.943
AND THERE'S ANOTHER, MORE

16:16.943 --> 16:18.578
SERIOUS DENGUE OUTBREAK IN THE

16:18.578 --> 16:19.612
KEYS.

16:19.612 --> 16:20.513
DO YOU WORRY THAT SOMEONE WOULD

16:20.513 --> 16:22.381
CALL YOU UP AND SAY, "MILA, YOU

16:22.381 --> 16:23.983
STOOD IN THE WAY.

16:23.983 --> 16:24.817
YOU DID THIS"?

16:24.817 --> 16:25.618
DO YOU... DO YOU WORRY ABOUT

16:25.618 --> 16:26.319
THAT?

16:26.319 --> 16:27.053
>> NO.

16:27.053 --> 16:28.521
>> Reporter: WHY?

16:28.521 --> 16:29.488
>> NO, BECAUSE, TO BE HONEST

16:29.488 --> 16:32.592
WITH YOU, I THINK THE... THAT

16:32.592 --> 16:34.560
PEOPLE HAVE TO AGREE.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.263
AND AT THIS POINT, AGAIN, WE ARE

16:37.263 --> 16:39.899
FREE OF DENGUE FOR FIVE YEARS.

16:39.899 --> 16:42.235
WE ARE, I THINK, AS A CITIZEN,

16:42.235 --> 16:44.637
AS A MOTHER AND A TAXPAYER, I

16:44.637 --> 16:46.105
THINK THESE ARE MY RIGHTS, AND

16:46.105 --> 16:47.874
THE WHOLE COMMUNITY'S RIGHT TO

16:47.874 --> 16:48.708
CHOOSE.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.076
DO WE WANT TO BE PART OF THESE

16:50.076 --> 16:50.910
TESTS OR NO?

16:50.910 --> 16:51.777
>> Reporter: DID YOU EVER THINK,

16:51.777 --> 16:53.279
"MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST GO OUT AND

16:53.279 --> 16:55.314
GET EVERYBODY IN KEY HAVEN TO

16:55.314 --> 16:56.782
JUST SIGN A PIECE OF PAPER THAT

16:56.782 --> 16:58.317
SAYS 'I'M OKAY WITH THIS'"?

16:58.317 --> 16:58.918
>> EVERY PERSON?

16:58.918 --> 16:59.986
NO.

16:59.986 --> 17:00.920
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN

17:00.920 --> 17:02.421
GET 100% OF PEOPLE TO AGREE TO

17:02.421 --> 17:04.056
ANYTHING.

17:04.056 --> 17:05.825
THAT'S, YOU KNOW, PUTTING IN A

17:05.825 --> 17:07.360
ROAD, PUTTING A BRIDGE.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.794
YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE WHO'S GOING

17:08.794 --> 17:11.864
TO DISAGREE WITH IT.

17:11.864 --> 17:12.732
>> Reporter: THE F.D.A.'S CENTER

17:12.732 --> 17:14.667
FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE, WHICH

17:14.667 --> 17:16.102
APPROVES ANY GENETIC

17:16.102 --> 17:18.004
MODIFICATIONS TO ANIMALS, WILL

17:18.004 --> 17:20.006
HAVE THE FINAL SAY OVER WHETHER

17:20.006 --> 17:22.141
OR NOT THE OXITEC MOSQUITO TRIAL

17:22.141 --> 17:24.577
IN THE FLORIDA KEYS PROCEEDS.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.145
AN F.D.A. SPOKESPERSON TOLD US

17:26.145 --> 17:28.681
THERE'S NO TIMELINE FOR WHEN

17:28.681 --> 17:30.349
THAT MIGHT HAPPEN.

17:32.318 --> 17:33.286
>> Sreenivasan: FOR A CLOSER

17:33.286 --> 17:34.553
LOOK AT HOW SCIENTISTS ARE

17:34.553 --> 17:35.688
GENETICALLY MODIFYING

17:35.688 --> 17:37.590
MOSQUITOES, WATCH THE VIDEO ON

17:37.590 --> 17:38.758
OUR FACEBOOK PAGE AT

17:38.758 --> 17:41.193
www.facebook/com/newshour.

17:42.828 --> 17:43.829
>> Sreenivasan: FOR 15 YEARS,

17:43.829 --> 17:45.631
THE U.S.' WAR ON DRUGS IN

17:45.631 --> 17:47.533
COLOMBIA HAS RELIED ON CROP

17:47.533 --> 17:49.201
DUSTING TO KILL THE PLANTS USED

17:49.201 --> 17:50.569
TO PRODUCE COCAINE.

17:50.569 --> 17:51.771
BUT THIS WEEK, COLUMBIA'S

17:51.771 --> 17:53.072
GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED IT'S

17:53.072 --> 17:54.607
PHASING OUT THE U.S.-LED

17:54.607 --> 17:55.274
PROGRAM.

17:55.274 --> 17:56.142
SO, HOW WILL THIS SHIFT IN

17:56.142 --> 17:57.376
POLICY AFFECT THE RELATIONSHIP

17:57.376 --> 17:58.344
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES?

17:58.344 --> 17:59.412
JOINING ME VIA SKYPE FROM

17:59.412 --> 18:00.446
BOGOTA, COLOMBIA, IS JUAN

18:00.446 --> 18:01.814
FORERO, THE SOUTH AMERICAN

18:01.814 --> 18:02.882
BUREAU CHIEF FOR THE "WALL

18:02.882 --> 18:03.449
STREET JOURNAL."

18:03.449 --> 18:04.684
SO GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF

18:04.684 --> 18:05.384
BACKGROUND FOR PEOPLE JUST

18:05.384 --> 18:06.552
WAKING UP TO THIS STORY.

18:06.552 --> 18:08.220
WHAT IS THE PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN

18:08.220 --> 18:09.522
DOING AND WHY HAS IT BEEN SO

18:09.522 --> 18:10.256
IMPORTANT?

18:10.256 --> 18:12.391
>> IT WAS 15 YEARS AGO WHAT WAS

18:12.391 --> 18:14.026
CALLED "PLAN COLOMBIA" WHICH WAS

18:14.026 --> 18:18.331
A U.S. FUNDED PROGRAM BEGAN AND

18:18.331 --> 18:19.899
IT BASICALLY ENTAILED USING CROP

18:19.899 --> 18:22.101
DUSTERS TO HIT COCA.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.203
THIS WAS A VERY CONTROVERSIAL

18:24.203 --> 18:25.204
PROGRAM WHEN IT BEGAN.

18:25.204 --> 18:26.505
THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM,

18:26.505 --> 18:27.440
BUT THIS WAS APPROVED IN THE

18:27.440 --> 18:29.342
BILL CLINTON ADMINISTRATION AND

18:29.342 --> 18:30.609
IT WAS 15 YEARS AGO, IT WAS IN

18:30.609 --> 18:32.445
DECEMBER OF 2000, WHEN CROP

18:32.445 --> 18:35.114
DUSTERS HIT INDUSTRIALIZED

18:35.114 --> 18:37.850
FIELDS OF COCA ACROSS COLOMBIA.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.052
>> Sreenivasan: SO, THE CHEMICAL

18:40.052 --> 18:42.955
BEING USED TO KEEP THE COCA DOWN

18:42.955 --> 18:45.157
COULD POSSIBLY CAUSE CANCER.

18:45.157 --> 18:46.092
IS THAT RIGHT?

18:46.092 --> 18:46.726
>> EXACTLY.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.661
THERE IS A RESEARCH ARM OF THE

18:48.661 --> 18:50.129
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION WHICH

18:50.129 --> 18:53.766
SAID IT COULD POSSIBLY CAUSE

18:53.766 --> 18:54.834
CANCER IN HUMANS.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.937
SO THAT CAUSED QUITE A

18:57.937 --> 18:59.205
CONTROVERSY HERE IN COLOMBIA,

18:59.205 --> 18:59.905
ALTHOUGH THERE HAD BEEN

18:59.905 --> 19:01.607
CRITICISM ABOUT FUMIGATION FOR

19:01.607 --> 19:03.209
MANY, MANY YEARS.

19:03.209 --> 19:04.110
I THINK PART OF THE ISSUE

19:04.110 --> 19:05.711
THOUGH, PART OF THE REASON, THE

19:05.711 --> 19:08.214
BIG PART OF THE REASON WHY

19:08.214 --> 19:09.181
THIS IS FINALLY COMING TO A

19:09.181 --> 19:11.150
CLOSE IS BECAUSE OF POLITICAL

19:11.150 --> 19:11.784
REASONS.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.019
IN OTHER WORDS, THIS THING JUST

19:13.019 --> 19:14.453
SERVED ITS CYCLE.

19:14.453 --> 19:17.757
IT DID WHAT IT HAD TO DO IN THE

19:17.757 --> 19:18.858
MINDS OF SOME, AND NOW IT'S TIME

19:18.858 --> 19:20.393
TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT'S

19:20.393 --> 19:21.394
BECAUSE OF NEW POLITICAL

19:21.394 --> 19:22.695
REALITIES IN COLOMBIA.

19:22.695 --> 19:23.729
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHAT ARE

19:23.729 --> 19:25.598
THE ALTERNATIVES HERE TO

19:25.598 --> 19:26.365
SPRAYING?

19:26.365 --> 19:27.800
PEOPLE WHO COULD MANUALLY

19:27.800 --> 19:29.101
ERADICATE ALL THESE CROPS,

19:29.101 --> 19:31.537
SOME OF THOSE SOLDIERS HAVE DIED

19:31.537 --> 19:32.438
BECAUSE THEY STEPPED ON LAND

19:32.438 --> 19:33.372
MINES.

19:33.372 --> 19:34.440
>> LOOK, IT'S PRETTY HORRIFIC.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.542
YOU HAVE HAD ABOUT 200 DEATHS

19:36.542 --> 19:38.544
OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS, AND MOST

19:38.544 --> 19:40.079
OF THOSE ARE SOLDIERS.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.380
SOME OF THOSE ARE CIVILIANS

19:41.380 --> 19:42.882
PAID TO ERADICATE.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.551
AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE LAND

19:45.551 --> 19:48.687
MINES IN THOSE FIELD.

19:48.687 --> 19:52.024
THAT'S BASICALLY ALMOST STOPPED

19:52.024 --> 19:53.559
MANUAL ERADICATION.

19:53.559 --> 19:56.429
BUT REALLY THE ANSWER TO

19:56.429 --> 19:58.831
RESOLVING THE COCA ISSUE IS

19:58.831 --> 20:00.599
BRINGING THE STATE INTO SOME OF

20:00.599 --> 20:01.767
THESE REGIONS.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.069
COLOMBIA IS A VERY LARGE

20:03.069 --> 20:03.636
COUNTRY.

20:03.636 --> 20:04.670
IT'S ABOUT TWICE THE SIZE OF

20:04.670 --> 20:05.471
FRANCE.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.206
AND YOU HAVE ALL THESE FAR-FLUNG

20:07.206 --> 20:08.474
REGIONS THAT REALLY AREN'T PART

20:08.474 --> 20:09.842
OF THE STATE.

20:09.842 --> 20:10.810
THE STATE NEEDS TO BRING IN

20:10.810 --> 20:13.245
ROADS AND HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS.

20:13.245 --> 20:15.481
THERE REALLY ARE TWO COLOMBIAS.

20:15.481 --> 20:16.816
YOU NEED TO BRING IN THE STATE

20:16.816 --> 20:18.984
AND ALMOST EVERYBODY ACTUALLY

20:18.984 --> 20:21.087
PRO FUMIGATION, ANTI-FUMIGATION,

20:21.087 --> 20:23.622
IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THAT.

20:23.622 --> 20:24.423
>> Sreenivasan: AND WHAT

20:24.423 --> 20:25.825
HAPPENS TO THE FARMERS THAT SEEM

20:25.825 --> 20:27.193
TO BE CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE HERE?

20:27.193 --> 20:27.860
ON THE ONE HAND YOU'VE GOT

20:27.860 --> 20:29.028
GOVERNMENT SAYING DON'T GROW

20:29.028 --> 20:29.662
COCA.

20:29.662 --> 20:30.396
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE THE

20:30.396 --> 20:31.697
REBELS WHO SOMETIMES MAKE THEIR

20:31.697 --> 20:33.299
MONEY OFF OF THE COCAINE

20:33.299 --> 20:34.834
INDUSTRY.

20:34.834 --> 20:35.568
>> YEAH, EXACTLY.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.237
THE OTHER DAY I WAS TALKING TO A

20:38.237 --> 20:39.405
LOT OF THESE FARMERS AND I KNOW

20:39.405 --> 20:40.639
THEM BECAUSE I HAD BEEN THERE A

20:40.639 --> 20:42.041
FEW MONTHS BEFORE IN A

20:42.041 --> 20:43.676
PARTICULAR AREA WHERE I'M SEEING

20:43.676 --> 20:45.277
MORE COCA, AND SOME OF THESE

20:45.277 --> 20:46.412
FARMERS ARE SAYING, LOOK, THE

20:46.412 --> 20:47.746
GUERILLAS ARE TELLING US TO GROW

20:47.746 --> 20:49.482
COCA AND WHEN THE GUERRILLAS ARE

20:49.482 --> 20:50.916
TELLING TO YOU GROW COCA, THAT'S

20:50.916 --> 20:52.518
PRESSURE TACTICS.

20:52.518 --> 20:55.554
THEY DEFINITELY ARE CAUGHT IN

20:55.554 --> 20:57.189
THE MIDDLE, IF THEY GROW THEY

20:57.189 --> 20:59.725
HAVE THE SPRAY PLANES COME OR

20:59.725 --> 21:01.560
ERADICATORS COME AND IF THEY

21:01.560 --> 21:02.995
DON'T GROW THEY COULD BE IN A

21:02.995 --> 21:04.897
BIND WITH THE PEOPLE WHO COUNT

21:04.897 --> 21:06.632
ON THAT COCA FOR MONEY.

21:06.632 --> 21:07.366
>> Sreenivasan: SO, WHAT IS THAT

21:07.366 --> 21:09.135
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE U.S.

21:09.135 --> 21:10.836
AND COLOMBIA LIKE IN THE CONTEXT

21:10.836 --> 21:12.004
OF THIS, AND YOU ALSO SAID

21:12.004 --> 21:13.405
THERE ARE NEW POLITICAL

21:13.405 --> 21:14.807
REALITIES ON THE GROUND?

21:14.807 --> 21:16.142
>> I THINK OVER THIS THEY

21:16.142 --> 21:17.343
CLASHED BECAUSE I THINK THE

21:17.343 --> 21:19.411
COUNTER-DRUG OFFICIALS IN THE

21:19.411 --> 21:22.381
U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE VERY MUCH

21:22.381 --> 21:23.516
WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORTIVE OF

21:23.516 --> 21:25.584
FUMIGATION, SO THEY DIDN'T WANT

21:25.584 --> 21:27.052
IT TO END.

21:27.052 --> 21:28.888
BUT THE POLITICAL REALITIES ARE

21:28.888 --> 21:29.955
DIFFERENT IN COLOMBIA.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.657
WHEN THIS PROGRAM BEGAN,

21:31.657 --> 21:33.893
COLOMBIA WAS IN A REALLY, REALLY

21:33.893 --> 21:34.527
TOUGH STATE.

21:34.527 --> 21:35.828
CERTAINLY, THE COLOMBIA THAT YOU

21:35.828 --> 21:37.563
HAVE TODAY 15 YEARS LATER IS A

21:37.563 --> 21:38.697
DIFFERENT COUNTRY.

21:38.697 --> 21:40.032
IT'S VERY DYNAMIC, A GROWING

21:40.032 --> 21:41.033
ECONOMY.

21:41.033 --> 21:41.967
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS

21:41.967 --> 21:43.369
THAT ARE HAPPENING HERE.

21:43.369 --> 21:44.603
AND RIGHT NOW, ONE OF THE BIG

21:44.603 --> 21:45.838
THINGS THAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT

21:45.838 --> 21:47.306
THE GOVERNMENT IS IN THE MIDST

21:47.306 --> 21:48.340
OF PEACE TALKS WITH THE

21:48.340 --> 21:49.141
GUERILLAS.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.809
THAT WOULD END A VERY LONG

21:50.809 --> 21:51.777
CONFLICT.

21:51.777 --> 21:52.711
AND THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF

21:52.711 --> 21:55.147
VIEW IS FUMIGATION IS REALLY A

21:55.147 --> 21:57.716
KIND OF MILITARISTIC APPROACH IN

21:57.716 --> 21:59.351
REGIONS THAT ARE NOW PEACEFUL.

21:59.351 --> 22:00.953
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS WIN

22:00.953 --> 22:02.321
HEARTS AND MINDS AND YOU DON'T

22:02.321 --> 22:04.290
DO THAT BY FUMIGATING THEM, BY

22:04.290 --> 22:06.058
DROPPING DEFOLIANT ON TOP OF

22:06.058 --> 22:07.026
THESE PEOPLE.

22:07.026 --> 22:07.826
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

22:07.826 --> 22:08.661
JUAN FORERO,THE SOUTH AMERICAN

22:08.661 --> 22:09.662
BUREAU CHIEF OF THE "WALL STREET

22:09.662 --> 22:10.696
JOURNAL" JOINING US VIA SKYPE

22:10.696 --> 22:12.097
FROM BOGOTA, COLOMBIA, THANKS SO

22:12.097 --> 22:12.831
MUCH.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.366
>> THANK YOU, IT WAS A PLEASURE.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.670
>>THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND,

22:17.670 --> 22:18.904
SATURDAY.

22:22.474 --> 22:23.409
>> Sreenivasan: THE U.S. IS IN

22:23.409 --> 22:24.843
THE GRIP OF THE WORST BIRD FLU

22:24.843 --> 22:25.844
EPIDEMIC IN THE NATION'S

22:25.844 --> 22:26.579
HISTORY.

22:26.579 --> 22:27.379
THE OUTBREAK IS CREATING A

22:27.379 --> 22:28.981
CRISIS FOR FARMERS: HOW TO

22:28.981 --> 22:30.816
SAFELY DESTROY INFECTED BIRDS

22:30.816 --> 22:32.117
AND HOW TO KEEP EGG PRICES FROM

22:32.117 --> 22:34.453
SKYROCKETING IN THE PROCESS.

22:34.453 --> 22:35.721
EARLIER, I SPOKE WITH ASSOCIATED

22:35.721 --> 22:37.122
PRESS REPORTER DAVID PITT VIA

22:37.122 --> 22:38.857
SKYPE FROM DES MOINES, IOWA.

22:38.857 --> 22:39.792
DAVID, JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS

22:39.792 --> 22:40.793
AGO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW

22:40.793 --> 22:42.294
BAD THIS WAS, BUT IT HASN'T

22:42.294 --> 22:43.329
GOTTEN ANY BETTER.

22:43.329 --> 22:44.597
>> RIGHT, IT DOES STILL SEEM TO

22:44.597 --> 22:45.331
BE SPREADING.

22:45.331 --> 22:47.132
THE HARDEST HIT STATES ARE

22:47.132 --> 22:49.435
MINNESOTA, WHERE MOST-- YOU

22:49.435 --> 22:50.302
KNOW, A LOT OF THE TURKEYS IN

22:50.302 --> 22:51.503
THE UNITED STATES ARE RAISED,

22:51.503 --> 22:52.972
AND IOWA, THE LEADING

22:52.972 --> 22:54.506
EGG-PRODUCING STATE.

22:54.506 --> 22:56.809
SO BOTH STATES HAVE SEEN

22:56.809 --> 22:58.310
INCREASED CASES IN THE LAST FEW

22:58.310 --> 23:00.312
DAYS.

23:00.312 --> 23:01.580
SO WE ARE SEEING IT SPREAD,

23:01.580 --> 23:03.282
STILL, AND THE PRIORITY, I

23:03.282 --> 23:05.317
THINK, FOR THOSE WHO STUDY THIS

23:05.317 --> 23:06.885
PROBLEM IS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

23:06.885 --> 23:08.420
HOW TO KEEP IT FROM SPREADING

23:08.420 --> 23:10.389
AND HOW IT IS SPREADING, AND

23:10.389 --> 23:12.024
THEN STOP IT, IF POSSIBLE.

23:12.024 --> 23:12.825
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ARE THE

23:12.825 --> 23:14.159
THE MARKET EFFECTS NOW?

23:14.159 --> 23:15.461
THIS HAS JUST GONE ON LONG

23:15.461 --> 23:15.894
ENOUGH.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.930
ARE WE SEEING PRICES INCREASE?

23:17.930 --> 23:18.964
>> WE ARE.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.532
THE LAST STORY I DID A FEW DAYS

23:20.532 --> 23:23.035
AGO REFLECTED CARTON EGG PRICES

23:23.035 --> 23:25.437
GOING UP ABOUT 17% OR SO IN THE

23:25.437 --> 23:26.972
MIDWEST.

23:26.972 --> 23:28.274
THE BIGGEST IMPACT SO FAR HAS

23:28.274 --> 23:30.009
BEEN EGGS USED FOR INGREDIENTS

23:30.009 --> 23:31.377
IN THINGS LIKE MAYONNAISE AND

23:31.377 --> 23:32.611
CAKE MIXES AND THOSE KINDS OF

23:32.611 --> 23:33.412
THINGS.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.947
THAT MARKET HAS SEEN A LITTLE

23:34.947 --> 23:37.583
OVER 60% INCREASE.

23:37.583 --> 23:38.050
>> Sreenivasan: GIVE ME SOME

23:38.050 --> 23:38.684
PERSPECTIVE.

23:38.684 --> 23:40.452
WHEN WE SAY THE LARGEST OF AVIAN

23:40.452 --> 23:41.854
FLU OUTBREAK IN THE COUNTRY'S

23:41.854 --> 23:44.156
HISTORY, HOW BAD IS THIS?

23:44.156 --> 23:46.258
>> IN IOWA WE HAVE ABOUT 26

23:46.258 --> 23:47.493
MILLION BIRDS.

23:47.559 --> 23:49.728
23 MILLION OF THOSE ARE THE TYPE

23:49.728 --> 23:51.730
THAT LAY EGGS.

23:51.730 --> 23:53.365
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY HAS ABOUT 300

23:53.365 --> 23:55.701
MILLION CHICKENS LAYING EGGS.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.803
IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE

23:57.803 --> 24:00.372
TOTAL BUT IT IS GETTING TO THE

24:00.372 --> 24:01.774
POINT WHERE WE ARE SEEING AN

24:01.774 --> 24:02.708
IMPACT ON THE MARKET AND

24:02.708 --> 24:04.243
AVAILABILITY OF THE PRODUCT.

24:04.243 --> 24:04.910
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

24:04.910 --> 24:05.811
DAVID PITT OF THE ASSOCIATED
