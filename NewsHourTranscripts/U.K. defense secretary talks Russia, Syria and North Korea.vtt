JUDY WOODRUFF: As part
of the G20 summit this
weekend, President
Trump will meet with the

00:04.400 --> 00:07.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
United Kingdom's prime
minister, Theresa May.

00:07.800 --> 00:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will have much to discuss,
from the fight against ISIS,
to the role of NATO, and how

00:12.566 --> 00:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their broader agendas differ
from those of European allies.

00:16.100 --> 00:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A short time ago, I spoke
with the U.K.'s defense
secretary, Sir Michael Fallon.

00:23.100 --> 00:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I began by asking him about
the differing accounts of what
Mr. Trump said to President

00:26.233 --> 00:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Putin about Russian meddling
in last year's U.S. election.

00:29.833 --> 00:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON, U.K.
Defense Secretary: It
was an important meeting.

00:32.333 --> 00:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was right that they should
meet reasonably early on.

00:35.600 --> 00:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's right that they should get
along, because there's quite a
bit to talk to Russia about.

00:39.433 --> 00:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You had said
earlier that the U.S. should
go into that meeting warily.

00:43.733 --> 00:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Does it sound to you as
if that's what happened?

00:46.200 --> 00:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, we
have to engage with Russia.

00:48.566 --> 00:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That can't be business as usual
with Russia while the Crimea
remains annexed, while Ukraine

00:55.466 --> 00:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is being interfered with.

00:57.166 --> 00:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It can't be business as usual.

00:59.233 --> 01:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we think it important to
have a dialogue with Russia to
try and de-escalate any tensions

01:06.266 --> 01:09.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that there are and to
ensure that where Russia
does have influence in
the world -- and Syria

01:10.866 --> 01:14.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is one example -- that
we can bring Russia's
influence to bear.

01:14.566 --> 01:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you work
very closely obviously with
the intelligence community.

01:18.500 --> 01:23.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We know that President
Trump has challenged the
intelligence community
-- the U.S. intelligence

01:24.933 --> 01:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
community's reporting on Russian
interference in the election.

01:29.466 --> 01:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What effect might that have
on Russia and its continuing
efforts to interfere here in

01:34.166 --> 01:36.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the U.S. and in Europe?

01:36.266 --> 01:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, we
know Russia intervened in
some elections in Europe.

01:39.366 --> 01:43.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That, we do know, in
the Dutch referendum,
in the French elections.

01:43.533 --> 01:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's been an attempted coup
in Montenegro that Russia was
suspected of being involved

01:49.033 --> 01:51.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

01:51.133 --> 01:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we know there's been
this pattern of behavior
by Russia in recent years.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But I'm not able to
comment on what happened
here in your election.

01:58.800 --> 02:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But to the
extent President Trump is
challenging the work of the U.S.

02:06.133 --> 02:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community, does that
have an effect on
intelligence work abroad,
internationally, cooperation

02:11.533 --> 02:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
between the U.S. and
allies like the U.K.?

02:14.533 --> 02:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well,
there's no closer cooperation
on intelligence than
between us and the United

02:19.233 --> 02:21.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

02:21.566 --> 02:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our services work extremely
closely together, both
in monitoring what
Russia is doing, but

02:25.966 --> 02:27.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
also against terrorism.

02:27.233 --> 02:28.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So it's a very close
relationship to us.

02:28.866 --> 02:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's very important to us.

02:30.133 --> 02:32.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let
me turn to Syria.

02:32.900 --> 02:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're told the two
presidents did discuss Syria.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, after their
meeting, it was reported that
they have agreed on a cease-fire

02:39.566 --> 02:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for a section of
southwestern Syria.

02:42.866 --> 02:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you know about that?

02:45.033 --> 02:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well
any cease-fire has got
to be good news in the
civil war that's gone

02:48.833 --> 02:50.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on are for so long now.

02:50.966 --> 02:55.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But there's been many
cease-fires before that
have turned out not to
be cease-fires at all.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have seen up in Aleppo
in the north of Syria, we have
seen Russia allowing Syria

03:00.266 --> 03:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go on bombing its
own civilians, bombing
hospitals after a cease-fire
has been declared.

03:07.266 --> 03:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, this one is welcome, but
it has got to be enforced, it's
got to be an actual cease-fire.

03:12.466 --> 03:13.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
what do you look for?

03:13.433 --> 03:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's the evidence of that?

03:16.333 --> 03:20.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You want to see when it
takes effect and what
the ground rules are?

03:20.266 --> 03:22.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL FALLON: Yes.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to see it applied to
those on the ground, so that
we can get humanitarian aid

03:24.500 --> 03:28.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
into those towns and
villages that have been
cut off in the fighting.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can get aid through.

03:30.300 --> 03:33.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we need to be
absolutely sure that it
really is a cease-fire.

03:33.533 --> 03:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let's hope this one sticks
and brings some peace to that
part of Syria down in the

03:39.266 --> 03:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
southwestern corner.

03:41.333 --> 03:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Can a cease-fire
make a difference, though, when
the two sides disagree about

03:44.266 --> 03:46.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whether President Assad
should stay in power?

03:46.766 --> 03:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The U.S. has said that
it wants him removed.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Russians are still
saying they want him to stay.

03:51.466 --> 03:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, we
don't see any long-term
future for Assad in Syria.

03:55.366 --> 03:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a man who has attacked
his own people, who has
barrel-bombed his own people.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's used chemical weapons
against his own people.

04:02.066 --> 04:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't think he can be part of
the long-term future of Syria.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what we do want to see
happening is the - - is all
those parties that are prepared

04:10.966 --> 04:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to work to a more democratic
Syria working together now to
bring about a new settlement.

04:18.066 --> 04:21.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we're encouraging
the Russia-sponsored
process in Astana and
the other negotiations

04:23.833 --> 04:27.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that are going in Geneva
to bring those together
and see if everybody
can get around the table

04:27.266 --> 04:29.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now and plot a different
future for Syria.

04:29.866 --> 04:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But can there be
progress of any kind, whether
it's a cease-fire or some

04:34.500 --> 04:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other sort of step forward
together, when the two sides
still disagree over Mr. Assad

04:41.666 --> 04:43.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and his future?

04:43.100 --> 04:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well,
there is disagreement, yes.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't think he can be part of
the long-term future of Syria.

04:48.400 --> 04:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we do want to see the
political process get under way
that will lead Syria to a more

04:55.433 --> 04:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plural kind of government that
is genuinely representative
of all the different groupings

04:59.200 --> 05:01.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Syria.

05:01.366 --> 05:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
about another troubled part of
the world, and that is North

05:04.000 --> 05:06.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

05:06.033 --> 05:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that you and U.S.
Defense Secretary James
Mattis discussed that.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What can you tell us?

05:12.466 --> 05:14.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well,
it's a problem not just
for the United States.

05:14.200 --> 05:18.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Obviously, the United
States is coming within
range of these missiles.

05:18.700 --> 05:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what the North Koreans
have done is something illegal.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's something provocative.

05:23.133 --> 05:25.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's unacceptable.

05:25.366 --> 05:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have now got to respond
as an international community,
not just the United States.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not right the United
States has to bear this
problem on its own.

05:34.333 --> 05:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got to work much harder
now through the United Nations
to see whether the sanctions

05:41.133 --> 05:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that have already been applied
are working properly, to
consider additional sanctions,

05:46.266 --> 05:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, thirdly, to bring more
pressure to bear on China to
get the kind of changes that we

05:50.700 --> 05:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
need in that regime.

05:52.733 --> 05:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as you
know, President Trump has been
tweeting a lot about this.

05:56.433 --> 06:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said the other day words to
the effect it looks like that
what the Chinese did hasn't

06:02.833 --> 06:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had any effect, they're still
trading with North Korea.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are these kinds of
comments helpful?

06:07.700 --> 06:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, we all
have to, I think, step back now
and see and look very carefully

06:13.833 --> 06:15.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at what has worked and
what has not worked.

06:15.033 --> 06:17.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have had seven United
Nations resolution.

06:17.766 --> 06:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clearly, a nuclear program of
this kind can't have been put
together without access to the

06:25.200 --> 06:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raw materials, the
components involved, and
indeed to the finance
that you need to construct

06:30.133 --> 06:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them, to put it all together.

06:32.233 --> 06:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, clearly, the sanctions may
have been breached, and we need
to look at them, see where those

06:35.800 --> 06:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gaps are in the sanctions,
and whether a new resolution
can impose a tougher regime on

06:42.700 --> 06:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea or indeed on any
other companies and individuals,
Chinese or otherwise, who

06:48.433 --> 06:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
may have been helping them.

06:50.366 --> 06:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there
agreement between the U.S.,
U.K. and other nations with the

06:55.300 --> 06:57.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
same interests on what
should come next with
regard to North Korea?

06:57.900 --> 07:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, there is
agreement that, first of all, we
have to work this diplomatically

07:04.766 --> 07:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and economically through
sanctions, that we have to raise
the price of what the North

07:10.500 --> 07:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Koreans are doing to deter
them from carrying out
further tests in future.

07:14.433 --> 07:16.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's agreement
amongst us on that.

07:16.500 --> 07:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're all working hard on
that at the United Nations in
New York to move that agreement

07:22.366 --> 07:24.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forward.

07:24.433 --> 07:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With all due
respect, though, there have
been sanctions in place.

07:26.433 --> 07:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: There has been
sanctions, and some clearly
have not been enforced.

07:28.900 --> 07:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we need to look at that.

07:30.933 --> 07:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we need to look and
see whether a new, tougher
resolution is required.

07:34.200 --> 07:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will be looking at that
in the European Union framework
as well over in Europe to

07:40.633 --> 07:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see who may have been trading
with North Korea and so on.

07:42.733 --> 07:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Russians
and the Chinese have proposed
that the North Koreans freeze

07:47.700 --> 07:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their missile program, their
nuclear program, in exchange
for which the South Koreans and

07:54.700 --> 07:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States would stop
or pull back on these joint
military exercises and remove

08:01.500 --> 08:04.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the THAAD missile
defense system.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that any sort of
a realistic proposal?

08:06.966 --> 08:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: No, because
it's a false comparison.

08:09.733 --> 08:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Military exercises or missile
defense, these are legitimate
things for nations to have

08:15.833 --> 08:17.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and to do.

08:17.066 --> 08:19.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What North Korea is
doing is illegal.

08:19.833 --> 08:24.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's completely illegal
under the treaties,
under international law.

08:24.433 --> 08:26.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a breach of United
Nations resolutions.

08:26.533 --> 08:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you can't compare it with
military exercises in the South.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One other thing
I do want to ask you about,
that is, President Trump's

08:33.566 --> 08:34.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
theme yesterday.

08:34.766 --> 08:39.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He spoke to the Polish
people in Warsaw.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he spoke about the threat
to Western civilization.

08:43.033 --> 08:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He talked about it being
at a risk of decline.

08:45.266 --> 08:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he asked if the West
has the will to survive.

08:48.733 --> 08:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this the sort of language
that you think is going to bring
the Western allies together

08:54.866 --> 08:56.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in their fight
against extremism?

08:56.733 --> 09:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: We do have
values in common in the West.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we do need to speak
up for those values
and to remember them.

09:04.333 --> 09:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're being attacked in the
West, not because those values
have failed, but because we have

09:11.300 --> 09:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been successful and we
have spread some of those
values around the world.

09:12.866 --> 09:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that was an important
message yesterday.

09:14.900 --> 09:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was coupled, of course,
with a reminder that the United
States stands behind Article

09:21.700 --> 09:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
5 of the NATO treaty
that believes in the
collective defense of NATO.

09:24.966 --> 09:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If one of us is attacked,
then the others must
come to its help.

09:28.466 --> 09:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sir Michael
Fallon, Britain's defense
secretary, thank you very much.

09:32.733 --> 09:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Thank you.
