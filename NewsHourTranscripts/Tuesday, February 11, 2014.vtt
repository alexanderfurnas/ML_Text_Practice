CONCERNING.                     
IT IS SOMETHING THAT WAS        
FOCUSED.                        

32:36.223 --> 32:39.268
IT IS SOMETHING THAT WAS        
FOCUSED.                        
I THINK IT WAS TARGETED, IT WAS 

32:39.270 --> 32:40.194
FOCUSED.                        
I THINK IT WAS TARGETED, IT WAS 
WELL PLANNED OUT.               

32:40.197 --> 32:42.348
I THINK IT WAS TARGETED, IT WAS 
WELL PLANNED OUT.               
SO IT WASN'T JUST A COUPLE OF   

32:42.350 --> 32:44.268
WELL PLANNED OUT.               
SO IT WASN'T JUST A COUPLE OF   
GUYS DECIDING TO GO OFF AND     

32:44.270 --> 32:45.891
SO IT WASN'T JUST A COUPLE OF   
GUYS DECIDING TO GO OFF AND     
SHOOT A COUPLE ROUNDS AT A      

32:45.893 --> 32:46.289
GUYS DECIDING TO GO OFF AND     
SHOOT A COUPLE ROUNDS AT A      
SUBSTATION.                     

32:46.291 --> 32:47.315
SHOOT A COUPLE ROUNDS AT A      
SUBSTATION.                     
>> WHICH YOU WERE TELLING US    

32:47.317 --> 32:48.506
SUBSTATION.                     
>> WHICH YOU WERE TELLING US    
SOMETIMES HAPPENS AROUND THE

SOMETIMES HAPPENS AROUND THE    
COUNTRY BUT THIS WAS IN A MUCH  

32:49.867 --> 32:53.675
SOMETIMES HAPPENS AROUND THE    
COUNTRY BUT THIS WAS IN A MUCH  
LARGER SCALE.                   

32:53.676 --> 32:55.330
COUNTRY BUT THIS WAS IN A MUCH  
LARGER SCALE.                   
SO WHAT DOES IT SAY TO YOU ABOUT

32:55.332 --> 32:56.522
LARGER SCALE.                   
SO WHAT DOES IT SAY TO YOU ABOUT
HOW WORRIED ALL OF US SHOULD BE 

32:56.524 --> 32:57.714
SO WHAT DOES IT SAY TO YOU ABOUT
HOW WORRIED ALL OF US SHOULD BE 
ABOUT THE POWER GRID?           

32:57.716 --> 32:58.973
HOW WORRIED ALL OF US SHOULD BE 
ABOUT THE POWER GRID?           
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT I    

32:58.975 --> 32:59.735
ABOUT THE POWER GRID?           
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT I    
WOULD SAY WORRY.                

32:59.737 --> 33:01.987
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT I    
WOULD SAY WORRY.                
ONE OF THE THINGS THE CHAIRMAN  

33:01.989 --> 33:04.438
WOULD SAY WORRY.                
ONE OF THE THINGS THE CHAIRMAN  
MENTIONED WAS THAT WE CAN NEVER 

33:04.440 --> 33:05.795
ONE OF THE THINGS THE CHAIRMAN  
MENTIONED WAS THAT WE CAN NEVER 
MITIGATE OUR RISK DOWN TO ZERO. 

33:05.797 --> 33:07.518
MENTIONED WAS THAT WE CAN NEVER 
MITIGATE OUR RISK DOWN TO ZERO. 
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO LIVE 

33:07.520 --> 33:09.636
MITIGATE OUR RISK DOWN TO ZERO. 
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO LIVE 
IN A RISK-FREE ENVIRONMENT.     

33:09.639 --> 33:12.187
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO LIVE 
IN A RISK-FREE ENVIRONMENT.     
BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN    

33:12.189 --> 33:14.572
IN A RISK-FREE ENVIRONMENT.     
BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN    
APPLY SOME MITIGATION STEPS TO  

33:14.574 --> 33:16.261
BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN    
APPLY SOME MITIGATION STEPS TO  
SOME OF THESE SUBSTATIONS AND TO

33:16.263 --> 33:18.082
APPLY SOME MITIGATION STEPS TO  
SOME OF THESE SUBSTATIONS AND TO
SOME OF THE OTHER FACILITIES

AND THAT'S -- YOU CAN IMAGINE,  
THAT'S A CHALLENGE.             
THERE'S ABOUT 45,000 OF THESE

OBVIOUSLY SOME IN MORE CRITICAL

THIS ON CAMERA BUT I KNOW MY    
COLLEAGUES IN TALKING TO HIM    
EARLIER TODAY, HE POINTED OUT   

34:05.342 --> 34:06.997
COLLEAGUES IN TALKING TO HIM    
EARLIER TODAY, HE POINTED OUT   
THERE MAY BE THOUSANDS OF

SUBSTATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY  

34:08.092 --> 34:10.309
THERE MAY BE THOUSANDS OF       
SUBSTATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY  
BUT HE SAID THEY'RE MUCH SMALLER

34:10.311 --> 34:12.727
SUBSTATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY  
BUT HE SAID THEY'RE MUCH SMALLER
NUMBER THAT ARE VULNERABLE IN   

34:12.729 --> 34:17.561

THE WAY THAT THIS STATION WAS IN

CALIFORNIA.                     
>> WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY --      
THEY'RE NOT MORE VULNERABLE BUT 

34:21.140 --> 34:22.662
>> WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY --      
THEY'RE NOT MORE VULNERABLE BUT 
MORE CRITICAL TO THE BULK POWER 

34:22.664 --> 34:23.722
THEY'RE NOT MORE VULNERABLE BUT 
MORE CRITICAL TO THE BULK POWER 
SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE LOCATION  

34:23.724 --> 34:24.483
MORE CRITICAL TO THE BULK POWER

WHERE THEY ARE.                 
THIS METCALF SUBSTATION         
OBVIOUSLY WAS IN A VERY         

34:27.367 --> 34:29.947
THIS METCALF SUBSTATION         
OBVIOUSLY WAS IN A VERY         
SENSITIVE AND CRITICAL LOCATION 

34:29.949 --> 34:31.934
OBVIOUSLY WAS IN A VERY         
SENSITIVE AND CRITICAL LOCATION 
BUT I THINK AS YOU POINTED OUT  

34:31.936 --> 34:33.723
SENSITIVE AND CRITICAL LOCATION 
BUT I THINK AS YOU POINTED OUT  
IN THE INTERVIEW, IT SPEAKS TO  

34:33.725 --> 34:36.307
BUT I THINK AS YOU POINTED OUT  
IN THE INTERVIEW, IT SPEAKS TO  
THE RELIABILITY OF THE BULK     

34:36.309 --> 34:38.459
IN THE INTERVIEW, IT SPEAKS TO  
THE RELIABILITY OF THE BULK     
POWER SYSTEM THAT THE OPERATORS

NO ONE EVEN KNEW THAT THE EVENT 
HAD HAPPENED.

NO ONE EVEN KNEW THAT THE EVENT 
HAD HAPPENED.                   
>> Woodruff: DIDN'T HE SAY      

34:48.695 --> 34:50.514
HAD HAPPENED.                   
>> Woodruff: DIDN'T HE SAY      
THAT WAS MAINLY BECAUSE IT WAS  

34:50.516 --> 34:52.335
>> Woodruff: DIDN'T HE SAY      
THAT WAS MAINLY BECAUSE IT WAS  
SPRING, THERE WAS NOT A HIGH    

34:52.337 --> 34:54.223
THAT WAS MAINLY BECAUSE IT WAS  
SPRING, THERE WAS NOT A HIGH    
DEMAND FOR POWER AT THAT TIME OF

34:54.225 --> 34:54.522
SPRING, THERE WAS NOT A HIGH    
DEMAND FOR POWER AT THAT TIME OF

DEMAND FOR POWER AT THAT TIME OF
YEAR?

34:57.636 --> 34:59.158
YEAR?

FACTORS, BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY

FACTORS, BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY
AGREE WITH HIM ON THE ENTIRE    
CONCEPT THERE BECAUSE THE BULK
