PRISONS RIGHT NOW.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THOSE, THE VAST MAJORITY ARE

03:55.268 --> 03:56.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN STATE PRISONS.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

03:58.505 --> 04:00.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE PAYING $20,000 A

04:01.508 --> 04:02.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRIPPLING STATE BUDGETS.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RED STATES HAVE BEEN TRYING TO

04:04.311 --> 04:05.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK FOR A WAY TO REFORM THE

04:05.278 --> 04:06.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYSTEM.

04:06.012 --> 04:07.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THAT AT THE SAME TIME AS

04:07.581 --> 04:08.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S AN INCREASING

04:08.515 --> 04:10.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RECOGNITION THAT ALL OF THESE

04:10.217 --> 04:11.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICANS IN PRISON HAS A

04:11.651 --> 04:13.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG-TERM DEVASTATING EFFECT ON

04:13.587 --> 04:15.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAMILIES AND ULTIMATELY ON THE

04:15.655 --> 04:17.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMY, ON EDUCATION.

04:17.157 --> 04:18.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, WRAPPING ALL THAT UP, WHAT

04:18.692 --> 04:20.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT GETS US TO A PLACE WHERE

04:20.293 --> 04:21.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME STAUNCH REPUBLICANS IN

04:21.728 --> 04:23.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESS, LIKE JOHN CORNYN OF

04:23.096 --> 04:24.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEXAS, AND PRESIDENT OBAMA IN

04:24.631 --> 04:25.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:25.999 --> 04:26.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SYSTEM.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE PROPOSE AID BILL, HARI,

04:28.468 --> 04:29.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT DOES A LOT OF THINGS.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO BIG POINTS ON IT.

04:31.037 --> 04:33.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE, IT WOULD ROLL BACK THAT

04:33.006 --> 04:35.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREE STRIKES RULE WHERE IF YOU

04:35.108 --> 04:36.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET THREE STRIKES DRUG CRIMES

04:36.943 --> 04:37.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU'LL HAVE A MANDATORY LIFE

SENTENCE.

04:38.578 --> 04:39.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT CANCELS THAT.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE OTHER THING IT DOES IS

04:40.447 --> 04:41.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REVIEW THE SENTENCES FOR MOST

04:41.815 --> 04:43.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEDERAL PRISONERS AND ALLOW

04:43.150 --> 04:45.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THEM TO SPEND A QUARTER

04:45.085 --> 04:46.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:46.486 --> 04:47.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE THOUGHT TO BE

04:47.420 --> 04:48.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NONVIOLENT.

YOU POINTED OUT.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS AN ELECTION YEAR.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THE

04:52.192 --> 04:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THERE ARE FOUR MONTHS THE HOUSE

05:03.170 --> 05:05.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER, LAWMAKERS

05:11.411 --> 05:12.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL NOT BE HERE.

05:12.212 --> 05:14.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR PRIMARY JOB THIS YEAR, AS

05:14.181 --> 05:15.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY OF THEM SEE IT, IS PROBABLY

05:15.615 --> 05:17.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE RE-ELECTED.

05:17.217 --> 05:18.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK WE WILL SEE THEM RAISE

05:18.518 --> 05:19.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME ISSUES, ESPECIALLY

05:19.886 --> 05:21.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS, THAT THEY THINK

05:21.221 --> 05:22.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HELP THEM, AND MAYBE HELP THEIR

05:22.822 --> 05:24.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENTIAL CHANCES.

05:24.357 --> 05:26.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE, HARI, THE SENATE IS A

05:26.193 --> 05:27.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE THAT REPUBLICANS ARE A

05:27.794 --> 05:28.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITTLE BIT WORRIED.

05:28.862 --> 05:29.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE CONCERNED THAT THERE'S A

05:29.763 --> 05:30.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANCE THAT IF THINGS GO

05:30.997 --> 05:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATS' WAY IN GENERAL, THEY

05:32.666 --> 05:33.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD LOSE THE SENATE.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SPEAKING TO HIM AND HIS STAFF, I

05:38.205 --> 05:39.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW HE'S GOING TO TRY TO PUT

05:39.573 --> 05:41.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

I DON'T KNOW THAT THINGS WILL BE

05:44.811 --> 05:46.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PASSED, BUT HE WANTED TO TRY AND

05:46.546 --> 05:47.714 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOW THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE

05:47.714 --> 05:49.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HE AND I THINK OTHER LEADERS ARE

05:51.751 --> 05:53.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:58.959 --> 05:59.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FASCINATING TO WATCH THAT, HARI.

05:59.926 --> 06:01.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
