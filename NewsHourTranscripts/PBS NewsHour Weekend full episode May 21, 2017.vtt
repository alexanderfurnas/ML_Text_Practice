03:54.933 --> 03:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE

03:56.466 --> 03:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT FOCUSING IN ON THOSE

03:58.766 --> 03:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO THEMES?

03:59.166 --> 04:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> HE REALLY WANTED TO RESET THE

04:02.000 --> 04:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ISLAMIC

04:03.166 --> 04:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORLD.

04:04.033 --> 04:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS CAMPAIGN WAS FULL OF ATTACKS

04:06.766 --> 04:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON ISLAM IN GENERAL AND

04:09.066 --> 04:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY TREATING EVERYBODY AS

04:11.200 --> 04:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A TERRORIST.

04:11.766 --> 04:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK HE'S LEARNED A LOT SINCE

04:13.833 --> 04:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE GOT INTO OFFICE.

04:15.066 --> 04:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE MET WITH A LOT OF ISLAMIC

04:16.700 --> 04:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEADERS AND COME TO A CONCLUSION

04:18.833 --> 04:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY ARE NOT ALL THAT BAD

04:20.166 --> 04:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND YOU CAN WORK WITH THEM.

04:21.533 --> 04:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT I THINK HE'S DISCOVERING

04:23.000 --> 04:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE NEEDS TO WORK WITH THEM.

04:24.266 --> 04:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH REGARD TO THE OTHER SIDE OF

04:25.533 --> 04:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT AND THE WAY YOU DO IT IS TO

04:28.100 --> 04:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADOPT THE POSITION THAT ALL OF

04:30.900 --> 04:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE ARABS WERE TAKING.

04:36.533 --> 04:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WERE ANY

OTHER REPRESENTS OF SAY KURDS OR

SHIA WERE THERE.

04:44.366 --> 04:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE SHARE YOUR VIEW COMPLETELY

04:45.800 --> 04:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IRAN IS THE BAD GUY THAT

04:48.066 --> 04:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYTHING THAT GOES WRONG IN

04:49.200 --> 04:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MIDDLE EAST IS BECAUSE OF

04:51.166 --> 04:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRAN AND WE SHARE YOUR VIEW WITH

04:53.066 --> 04:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WITHOUT EQUIVOCATION.

04:54.766 --> 04:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1 HE SAYS I'M NOT GOING TO

04:57.733 --> 04:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREACH TO YOU, IN FACT CHANGING

04:59.600 --> 05:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TONE FROM WHERE PRESIDENT

05:01.000 --> 05:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBAMA WAS, SAYING WE THINK THAT

05:03.066 --> 05:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WAY YOU TREAT YOUR OWN

05:04.633 --> 05:05.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE IS IMPORTANT.

05:05.866 --> 05:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
E-SET WE'RE NOT GOING TO BOTHER

05:08.166 --> 05:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELLING YOU THAT, WE'RE NOT

05:09.766 --> 05:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO PREACH TO YOU AT ALL.

05:11.666 --> 05:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEN HE DID GO AHEAD AND

05:13.166 --> 05:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN HE DECIDED TO PREACH IT WAS

05:14.700 --> 05:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO IRAN.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND BASICALLY HERE WAS A COUNTRY

05:17.500 --> 05:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACROSS THE WATER WHO HAD AN

05:20.233 --> 05:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION, 57% OF THEM VOTED FOR

05:22.933 --> 05:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MODERATE GUY WHO WAS NOT

05:25.033 --> 05:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORTED NECESSARILY BY THE

05:26.233 --> 05:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPREME LEADER AND THAT WENT

05:27.100 --> 05:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNMENTIONED.

05:28.166 --> 05:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I WANT TO BRING FARAH INTO

05:30.933 --> 05:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CONVERSATION.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PRESIDENT SPOKE ABOUT

05:34.466 --> 05:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRADUAL REFORMS AND

05:37.433 --> 05:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERVENTION, HAVING TOLERANCE

05:38.200 --> 05:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR ONE ANOTHER BUT THAT ONE

05:40.333 --> 05:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERIOD DRIVING THEM OUT FORCEFUL

05:42.966 --> 05:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LANK LANGUAGE THAT HE USED.

05:44.666 --> 05:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW WAS THAT RECEIVED BY THOSE

05:46.566 --> 05:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEADERS AND HOW WAS IT RECEIVED

05:48.066 --> 05:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY THE AVERAGE MUSLIM CITIZEN?

05:49.833 --> 05:51.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE IDEA THAT MUSLIMS SHOULD

05:51.066 --> 05:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORK TOGETHER TO FIGHT TERRORIST

05:52.400 --> 05:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORGANIZATIONS IS NOT NEW.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WAS IMPORTANT AND HE DID IT

05:55.666 --> 05:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY STRONGLY WAS TO TALK ABOUT

05:57.233 --> 05:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE IDEOLOGY THAT UNDERPINS

05:58.966 --> 06:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTREMISM YET HE DIDN'T GO INTO

06:01.633 --> 06:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIFICS ABOUT WHERE THAT

06:03.266 --> 06:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IDEOLOGY CAME FROM.

06:04.766 --> 06:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

06:07.633 --> 06:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTAND THAT HERE HE IS IN

06:10.300 --> 06:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIYADH, A COUNTRY THAT REALLY

06:12.533 --> 06:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE SPREAD

06:15.433 --> 06:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF VIOLENT IDEOLOGY AROUND THE

06:17.300 --> 06:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORLD.

06:19.166 --> 06:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISIS USES THE TEXTBOOKS FROM

06:20.766 --> 06:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAUDI ARABIA, YOU KNOW, IN THEIR

06:23.200 --> 06:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO-CALLED CALIPHATE.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE IS A CONNECTION THERE.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HE DANCED AROUND SOME OF

06:31.033 --> 06:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE THEMES THAT WERE VERY

06:32.066 --> 06:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT BUT HE DIDN'T GET INTO

06:33.633 --> 06:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIFICS.

06:34.566 --> 06:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SECOND PIECE, CERTAINLY, IS

06:36.533 --> 06:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WHO WAS HE SPEAKING TO?

06:38.233 --> 06:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YES HE WAS SPEAKING TO THE

06:40.800 --> 06:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
50-PLUS LEADERS OF MUSLIM

06:42.666 --> 06:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAJORITY COUNTRIES AND IT WAS

06:43.666 --> 06:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY CLEAR THAT THIS SPEECH WAS

06:45.800 --> 06:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THEM.

06:46.366 --> 06:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS NOT TO MUSLIM COMMUNITIES

06:48.466 --> 06:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AROUND THE WORLD.

06:49.166 --> 06:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE DID NOT DO THE KIND OF

06:53.333 --> 06:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTENSION TO COMMUNITIES THAT

06:54.700 --> 06:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IF

06:56.700 --> 06:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S WHAT THE AUDIENCE REALLY

06:57.933 --> 06:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS.

06:58.933 --> 06:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR EXAMPLE WHILE HE TALKED

06:59.766 --> 07:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE DEM GRAPHIC OF YOUTH

07:01.366 --> 07:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE MIDDLE EAST -- DEM

07:04.000 --> 07:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRAPHIC OF YOUTH IN THE MIDDLE

07:08.233 --> 07:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EAST, LET'S REMEMBER, OVER A

07:10.433 --> 07:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILLION MUSLIMS AROUND THE WORLD

07:12.200 --> 07:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 30, HE

07:14.000 --> 07:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DID NOT TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE

07:15.766 --> 07:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY CAN HAVE, IF THEY WORK

07:18.166 --> 07:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOGETHER, AND HE DIDN'T OFFER

07:20.700 --> 07:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY DELIVERABLES IN THIS SPEECH

07:22.466 --> 07:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THOSE YOUNG MUSLIMS.

07:23.966 --> 07:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS A DIRECT CONTRAST

07:26.833 --> 07:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBVIOUSLY TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S

07:28.066 --> 07:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEECH IN CAIRO WHICH DID BOTH

07:28.833 --> 07:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE THEMATIC PIECE AND ALSO THE

07:29.833 --> 07:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DELIVERABLE SIDE.

07:31.933 --> 07:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: WHAT DO YOU THINK

07:33.333 --> 07:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE NEW TERRORISM TARGETING

07:34.600 --> 07:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CENTER, I DON'T THINK IT WAS

07:36.100 --> 07:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOST ON ANYONE THAT THIS WAS

07:37.533 --> 07:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANNOUNCED IN SAUDI ARABIA WHICH

07:39.033 --> 07:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS A HISTORY WE KNOW OF

07:40.366 --> 07:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINANCING CERTAIN GROUPS.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT IS INTERESTING AND

07:45.900 --> 07:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRIKING THAT IN THAT ROOM WE

07:47.533 --> 07:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE LOOKING AT OTHER GULF STATES

07:49.300 --> 07:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO HAVE INVESTED IN BOTH THE

07:51.333 --> 07:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MESSAGING PIECE THE IDEOLOGIC

07:53.300 --> 07:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PIECE, HOW DO YOU PUSH BACK

07:56.566 --> 07:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST EXTREMISTS, AND THEY

07:58.600 --> 08:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN PARTNERS WITH US IN

08:00.333 --> 08:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUSHING BACK THE FINANCING.

08:03.866 --> 08:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I APPLAUD THE PRESIDENT FOR

08:05.333 --> 08:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CALLING OUT MUSLIM-MAJORITY

08:06.466 --> 08:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES TO DO MORE.

08:07.566 --> 08:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK HE'S RIGHT TO DO THAT.

08:08.833 --> 08:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS ALSO RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT

08:11.533 --> 08:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AUTHENTICITY OF A MUSLIM VOICE

08:15.766 --> 08:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN MUSLIM COMMUNITIES TO

08:17.633 --> 08:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY PROTECT THE SPREAD OF

08:18.900 --> 08:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IDEOLOGY.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT DIDN'T MATCH WITH

08:21.500 --> 08:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THOSE MUSLIM MAJORITY

08:23.733 --> 08:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES ARE DOING.

08:25.933 --> 08:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE CENTERS IN THE UAE

08:27.600 --> 08:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ARE DOING WORK AROUND

08:29.300 --> 08:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MESSAGING.

08:32.800 --> 08:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAUDI ARABIA IS A VERY IMPORTANT

08:34.366 --> 08:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAYER IN ALL OF THIS BECAUSE

08:35.933 --> 08:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING

08:37.766 --> 08:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT A $400 BILLION DEAL

08:42.200 --> 08:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE WAS DELIVERING TO SAUDI

08:43.866 --> 08:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARABIA AND OFFERING AMERICANS

08:45.633 --> 08:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THAT WE

08:47.233 --> 08:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE GOING TO GET JOBS FROM

08:48.133 --> 08:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT.

08:49.466 --> 08:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE THE

08:51.000 --> 08:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT TO ALSO DO IS OFFER A

08:52.366 --> 08:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEAL TO AMERICA AND THAT MEANS

08:54.133 --> 08:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USING HIS INFLUENCE TO MAKE SURE

08:57.033 --> 08:58.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SAUDI ARABIA DOESN'T

08:58.166 --> 09:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCITE HATE AROUND THE WORLD.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE COULD HAVE OFFERED THAT

09:02.233 --> 09:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A WAY THAT WAS MORE CLEAR IN

09:04.333 --> 09:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS SPEECH.

09:05.833 --> 09:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THESE CENTERS THAT TALK ABOUT

09:07.533 --> 09:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINANCING, THESE CENTERS THAT

09:09.433 --> 09:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALK ABOUT MESSAGING, ARE

09:13.033 --> 09:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLLOW, IF THERE'S NO -- THERE

09:14.533 --> 09:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE NO TEETH BEHIND WHAT IS

09:15.800 --> 09:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY BEING SAID.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE DIDN'T HEAR A LOT ABOUT

09:19.166 --> 09:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUMAN RIGHTS.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS A BRIEF NOD TO WOMEN.

09:22.066 --> 09:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY DO YOU THINK THESE IDEAS

09:23.200 --> 09:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE ABSENT?

09:25.066 --> 09:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THAT THE AUDIENCE IN

09:27.066 --> 09:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICA IS PROBABLY VERY SHOCKED

09:28.933 --> 09:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO SEE SO LITTLE ABOUT DEMOCRACY

09:30.466 --> 09:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS

FROM THIS PRESIDENT.

09:34.833 --> 09:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD,

09:37.866 --> 09:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR FROM

09:39.400 --> 09:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THOSE MINORITIES, THAT WE WORK

09:43.666 --> 09:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARD TO ADVOCATE FOR THINGS THAT

ARE JUST AND TRUE.

09:50.033 --> 09:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT IS AN UNCOMMON THING FOR

09:51.666 --> 09:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT NOT TO DO

09:52.800 --> 09:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TALKING OVER THE HEADS OF THEIR

10:03.433 --> 10:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEADERS TO THE PEOPLE AS IF THIS

10:04.666 --> 10:05.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS A BAD THING.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I NEVER SAW THAT AS A BAD THING.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THEIR PEOPLE DIRECTLY WASN'T A

10:14.666 --> 10:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BAD THING AT ALL AND THAT IS

10:16.366 --> 10:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING AS FARAH SAID HE JUST

10:17.666 --> 10:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIDN'T DO THAT.

10:19.433 --> 10:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE RIGHT KIND OF ISLAM AND FOR

WHICH IS THE RIGHT SECT OR THE

11:20.233 --> 11:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WRONG SECT OF ISLAM BUT WE CAN

11:24.300 --> 11:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
