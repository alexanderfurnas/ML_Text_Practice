JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.240 --> 00:12.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
pope issues
a landmark manifesto on family
life, urging

00:12.646 --> 00:18.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
greater tolerance for divorced
and remarried
Catholics, while standing firmly
against same-sex

00:18.652 --> 00:20.354 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
marriage.

00:20.387 --> 00:26.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then: inside the most
overcrowded prison in
America. Can reform help Alabama
out of a

00:26.593 --> 00:29.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dangerous system that's reaching
a breaking
point?

00:29.263 --> 00:33.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON, Founder, Equal
Justice Initiative:
The truth is, we have got
thousands of people

00:33.400 --> 00:37.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in jails and prisons who don't
need to be
there. And we haven't found the
courage yet

00:37.170 --> 00:39.006 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get them out.

00:39.039 --> 00:43.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.
David Brooks
and Ruth Marcus are here, to
analyze the week's

00:43.810 --> 00:45.078 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
news.

00:45.112 --> 00:52.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:52.052 --> 00:54.821 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:54.855 --> 01:05.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The campaign
combat cooled
off some today in the
presidential race. Two

01:05.198 --> 01:09.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the three Republicans took a
break from
campaigning, and the two
Democrats took a

01:09.770 --> 01:13.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
step back from open warfare.

01:13.373 --> 01:18.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton and Bernie
Sanders reached
a kind of verbal truce this
morning after

01:18.178 --> 01:21.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doing battle over who's
qualified to be president.

01:21.381 --> 01:23.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I have known Hillary Clinton for
25 years.

01:23.817 --> 01:28.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I respect Hillary Clinton. We
were colleagues
in the Senate, and, on her worst
day, she

01:28.588 --> 01:34.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be -- she would be an
infinitely better
president than either of the
Republican candidates.

01:34.061 --> 01:34.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: She's qualified?

01:34.761 --> 01:36.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Of course.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I think, in the heat of the
campaign, people

01:38.465 --> 01:42.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say lots of things. I want to
stay focused
on the issues. There are
contrasts between

01:42.569 --> 01:44.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us, and I think that's fair
game.

01:44.304 --> 01:48.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
front-runner's camp also
dealt with former President Bill
Clinton's

01:48.475 --> 01:54.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confrontation with protesters
yesterday. At
an event in Philadelphia, they
jeered his

01:54.848 --> 01:59.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
record and his wife's on crime
and race.

01:59.219 --> 02:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL CLINTON, Former President
of the United
States: You are defending the
people who kill

02:07.294 --> 02:08.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the lives you say matter. Tell
the truth.

02:09.029 --> 02:10.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today, in Erie,
Pennsylvania,
he voiced regret about the
incident.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL CLINTON: I almost want to
apologize for,
but I want to use it as an
example of the

02:13.633 --> 02:19.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
danger threatening our country.
I was talking
past her the way she was talking
past me.

02:19.973 --> 02:26.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Both Hillary
Clinton and Bernie
Sanders campaigned in New York
state today,

02:26.113 --> 02:31.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Sanders announced he will
visit the Vatican
next week to speak at a
conference on social

02:31.385 --> 02:33.186 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

02:33.220 --> 02:39.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Republican side, Donald
Trump canceled
an event in California to stay
in his home

02:39.059 --> 02:46.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state. He said in a tweet, "So
great to be
in New York. Catching up on many
things. Remember,

02:46.233 --> 02:51.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am still running a major
business while
I campaign, and loving it."

02:51.471 --> 02:57.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Trump's newly hired
convention
manager, Paul Manafort, insisted
the front-runner

02:57.377 --> 03:02.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will win enough delegates before
the convention
that there will be no need for
brokering.

03:02.249 --> 03:05.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL MANAFORT, Donald Trump
Convention Manager:
The reality is, this convention
process will

03:05.318 --> 03:11.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be over with sometime in June,
probably June
7. And it will be apparent to
the world that

03:11.358 --> 03:16.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is over that 1, 237
number, and at that
point in time, when it is
apparent, everything's

03:16.096 --> 03:17.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to come together.

03:17.864 --> 03:22.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ted Cruz was off
the campaign
trail today, while John Kasich
campaigned

03:22.202 --> 03:24.104 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Connecticut.

03:24.137 --> 03:29.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news, Pope
Francis called
for Catholics to put conscience
over dogma

03:29.509 --> 03:37.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on critical moral issues. His
statement, 256-pages-long,
suggested that some clergy might
allow divorced

03:37.617 --> 03:42.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Catholics to take communion.
There was no
change in the church's
opposition to same-sex

03:42.722 --> 03:47.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
marriage. We will explore the
pope's statement
after the news summary.

03:47.394 --> 03:51.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police in Belgium say they have
arrested the
last fugitive from arrested the
Paris attacks

03:51.665 --> 03:57.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in November. Mohamed Abrini was
picked up
in a raid in Brussels, along
with four others.

03:57.737 --> 04:03.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prosecutors say he may also be
the hat-wearing
suspect who escaped after the
bombings in

04:03.910 --> 04:05.745 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Brussels.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC VAN DER SYPT, Spokesman,
Belgian Federal
Prosecutor: At the moment, the
investigators

04:07.581 --> 04:13.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are verifying whether Abrini,
Mohamed, can
be positively identified as
being the third

04:13.153 --> 04:19.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person -- third person present
during the
attacks in Brussels National
Airport, the

04:19.159 --> 04:20.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so-called man with the hat.

04:20.961 --> 04:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mohamed Abrini's
exact role
in the Paris attacks has never
been made clear.

04:26.933 --> 04:33.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Greece resumed deporting
migrants to Turkey
today, after a four-day pause.
More than 120

04:33.140 --> 04:38.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people were ferried away from
the Greek island
of Lesbos under a deal with the
European Union.

04:38.612 --> 04:42.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Human rights activists have
condemned the
deportations.

04:42.282 --> 04:48.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government of Syria has
released an American
who's been held since 2012. He's
identified

04:48.255 --> 04:53.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Kevin Dawes, a freelance
photographer.
Russia says it aided in his
release, flying

04:53.994 --> 04:59.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
him to Moscow last week.
Meanwhile, Syrian
activists report that scores of
kidnapped

04:59.466 --> 05:06.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
workers are being released by
Islamic State
militants. They were seized
earlier this week.

05:06.406 --> 05:12.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry
made an unannounced
visit to Baghdad today, and
urged Iraqis to

05:12.379 --> 05:18.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
focus on fighting ISIS. He met
with Prime
Minister Haider al-Abadi, who's
facing a political

05:18.451 --> 05:22.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crisis over corruption, a
struggling economy
and poor security.

05:22.689 --> 05:26.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: It is
important to have a unified and
functioning

05:26.359 --> 05:32.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
government as rapidly as
possible in order
to move forward, so that all of
these operations

05:32.566 --> 05:37.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are not affected, and so that we
give confidence
to the coalition.

05:37.304 --> 05:42.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kerry said that
Abadi didn't
ask for additional U.S. troops.

05:42.742 --> 05:48.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration today
turned over
thousands of documents on
Operation Fast and

05:48.248 --> 05:54.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Furious. They involve a
gun-running investigation
that may have let Mexican drug
gangs get their

05:54.521 --> 06:00.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hands on 2,000 weapons. House
Republicans
demanded the documents four
years ago, but

06:00.594 --> 06:05.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president initially claimed
executive
privilege. In January, a federal
judge rejected

06:05.365 --> 06:07.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that claim.

06:07.167 --> 06:11.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street finished the week
with modest
gains. The Dow Jones industrial
average was

06:11.605 --> 06:21.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up 35 points to close near
17577. The Nasdaq
rose two points, and the S&amp;P 500
added five.

06:21.848 --> 06:26.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And an inflatable room is headed
toward the
International Space Station. It
was launched

06:26.953 --> 06:34.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today on a SpaceX rocket for a
two-year test.
NASA animation shows how the
pop-up module

06:34.327 --> 06:41.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be attached to the orbiting
lab and inflated.
It could prove an alternative to
metal enclosures.

06:41.301 --> 06:48.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In another first, the booster
rocket landed
on an ocean barge today to be
reused.

06:48.141 --> 06:52.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the pope's
views on the church and the
modern family;

06:52.879 --> 06:59.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a look inside the most
overcrowded prison
system in the nation; why Kenya
is being targeted

06:59.085 --> 07:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the terror group Al-Shabaab;
and much more.

07:14.034 --> 07:19.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's pronouncement from the
pope on family
life was two years in the
making. Pope Francis

07:19.472 --> 07:22.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
explicitly called for the church
to be less
judgmental.

07:22.676 --> 07:29.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, he said more support is
needed for
single and unmarried parents, as
well as same-sex

07:29.049 --> 07:34.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
couples. Divorced or remarried
Catholics shouldn't
be judged or discriminated
against in church

07:35.021 --> 07:40.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life. Priests can be merciful
when it comes
to delivering communion. But he
didn't change

07:41.027 --> 07:45.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doctrine on same-sex marriage or
on the role
of contraception.

07:45.899 --> 07:51.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We sample some of the reaction
now with Amanda
June Gargus. She is the student
administrator

07:51.471 --> 07:57.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at campus ministry at Georgetown
University's
Law Center. Gloria Purvis is the
host of a

07:57.143 --> 08:03.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
radio show on the EWTN's
Catholic Television
Network called "Morning Glory."
And Marianne

08:03.383 --> 08:10.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Duddy-Burke is the executive
director of Dignity
USA, which works on support
changes for the

08:10.056 --> 08:13.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LGBT community in the Catholic
Church.

08:13.593 --> 08:15.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all three of you
to the program.

08:15.729 --> 08:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's begin by -- I just
want to ask each
one of you, what do you think of
this latest

08:19.899 --> 08:21.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
statement by Pope Francis?

08:21.868 --> 08:23.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let me start with you, Ms.
Gargus.

08:23.703 --> 08:26.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMANDA JUNE GARGUS, Georgetown
University:
I think it's a great thing.

08:26.706 --> 08:31.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it falls well within
what the pope
has been saying all year in this
year of mercy

08:31.678 --> 08:39.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of being in love with our
neighbors and how
we show mercy towards the people
around us,

08:39.285 --> 08:46.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so, the saints and the sinners,
those that
conform with how we see God's
love and those

08:46.926 --> 08:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who may not necessarily be
acting in the way
that maybe traditional Catholics
tend to think

08:53.967 --> 08:55.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the church acting.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gloria Purvis,
what about you?
What was your reaction?

08:57.604 --> 08:59.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLORIA PURVIS, Global Catholic
Radio Network:
My reaction was, this is quite a
merciful

08:59.873 --> 09:01.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
message. It had a lot for
everyone.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it was a challenge for
everyone. He
clearly speaks within the
confines of the

09:05.879 --> 09:09.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
church's understanding of
marriage, faithful,
fruitful, faithful forever, and
yet, at the

09:09.949 --> 09:15.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
same time, he says we need to be
merciful
to everyone, walk with them.

09:15.221 --> 09:21.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of favorite lines in the
exhortation
is where he says love coexists
with imperfection.

09:21.094 --> 09:24.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think there is a
hopeful message
for all of us. We all fall short
of perfection.

09:25.031 --> 09:28.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if we're willing to listen
and think with
the mind of the church and try
to form our

09:28.868 --> 09:31.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
consciences properly, the church
is there
with us.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marianne
Duddy-Burke, what
about you? What did you think
when you read

09:34.974 --> 09:36.743 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this?

09:36.776 --> 09:39.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIANNE DUDDY-BURKE, Executive
Director,
Dignity USA: Yes, I find it to
be a very uneven

09:39.813 --> 09:45.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
document. There are certainly
places where
it soars. I love the emphasis on
respecting

09:45.885 --> 09:52.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the formed consciences of so
many of us and
pastoral care, starting from the
needs of

09:52.091 --> 09:53.993 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the person.

09:54.027 --> 09:59.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think those are fantastic and
really consistent
with a lot of what Pope Francis
has been about.

09:59.265 --> 10:03.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there are areas where
it really falls
short of what I think people
were hoping for,

10:03.903 --> 10:09.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that's certainly true on the
issue of
LGBT people, where there really
isn't a lot

10:09.576 --> 10:11.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of progress in this piece.

10:11.211 --> 10:14.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What were you
expecting him
to say in that regard?

10:14.247 --> 10:18.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIANNE DUDDY-BURKE: Well, I
think what was
most encouraging about this
Synod process

10:18.952 --> 10:23.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was at the end of the first
session, when
there was some beautiful
language that came

10:23.556 --> 10:31.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out about LGBT people and how we
should -- our
gifts should be welcomed and
honored by the

10:31.197 --> 10:39.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
church and how commitment
between same-sex
couples was -- could be a sign
of real grace.

10:39.239 --> 10:43.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that language was rolled
back very quickly,
but I think there was some hope
that Pope

10:43.610 --> 10:49.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Francis might take at least some
of that and
move it forward a bit. And he
really doesn't.

10:49.115 --> 10:55.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amanda June
Gargus, what about
-- whether it's the language on
same-sex marriage

10:55.755 --> 11:03.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the LGBT, that affect the
LGBT community,
or on the statement broadly,
where do you

11:03.730 --> 11:06.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think it could have gone further
than it did?

11:06.232 --> 11:09.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANDA JUNE GARGUS: Well, I
think the important
thing to remember when it comes
to documents

11:09.702 --> 11:15.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this is that the pope isn't
in a position
when making these types of
statements to change

11:15.041 --> 11:16.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
church doctrine.

11:16.910 --> 11:22.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have to be very realistic
our expectations
of what's going to come out of
these sessions

11:22.448 --> 11:27.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and out of these speeches. But I
think that
one thing that he didn't touch
on that I think

11:27.287 --> 11:32.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is very pervasive and very
obvious is the
church's role with
contraception.

11:32.325 --> 11:36.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen the pope make
statements about
contraception, particularly in
Central and

11:36.529 --> 11:42.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South America, with the current
issues of
the Zika virus, but we don't see
him talking

11:42.602 --> 11:51.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more broadly about how families
should be
treating contraception. Is that
still the

11:51.644 --> 11:56.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
church's doctrine? Are we going
to remain
in that vein? Or are we going to
have a more

11:56.583 --> 12:00.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
fluid concept of when
contraception is appropriate
and not?

12:00.286 --> 12:05.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think he at least touched
on it somewhat
when talking about the
importance of sex education,

12:05.792 --> 12:09.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that that was an important
aspect of child
development. But I think he
could have gone

12:09.762 --> 12:15.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a step further in helping
Catholics, helping
everyday Catholics understand
exactly what

12:15.401 --> 12:19.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the role of contraception is
going to be in
our community going forward.

12:20.006 --> 12:26.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gloria Purvis,
what about the
language or not -- the missing
language on

12:26.346 --> 12:28.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
contraception?

12:28.081 --> 12:31.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLORIA PURVIS: Well, I think it
was there
when he was talking about that
each child

12:31.918 --> 12:36.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is to be welcomed and that the
mother can
dream about the child with God.

12:36.623 --> 12:39.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I would like to say, what I
would have
liked to have seen -- and we
talked about

12:39.826 --> 12:44.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
structures of sin -- is the
consideration
that perhaps how society is set
up to make

12:44.564 --> 12:50.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the male as the model of
perfection is actually
something that is contrary to us
as women.

12:50.036 --> 12:55.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that is why we think that
our fertility
or motherhood is the enemy of
our progress.

12:55.675 --> 12:59.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a lot of times because of
how high society
is set up. And I would like to
see us challenge

12:59.779 --> 13:04.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that setup, because I think
there's nothing
defective about women. There's
nothing detective

13:04.684 --> 13:07.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in our fertility, but society is
defective
in its view of us.

13:07.487 --> 13:11.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, how would you
have liked
to have seen him change that
concept?

13:11.591 --> 13:16.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLORIA PURVIS: I would like to
have seen him
specifically say, women, you are
not defective

13:16.629 --> 13:22.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of your ability to bear
children,
and, in fact, society needs to
make more places

13:22.635 --> 13:27.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
available for you, in respect of
that awesome
gift that you have.

13:27.607 --> 13:32.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the human person -- if the
economy exists
to serve the human person, so
much so that

13:32.912 --> 13:36.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the economy exists to serve the
human family,
and we need to make sure women
can participate

13:36.616 --> 13:38.317 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in that economy.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marianne
Duddy-Burke, what
effect do you think, what
practical effect

13:41.854 --> 13:47.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do you think this is going to
have? He spoke
about the role of individual
priests in interpreting

13:47.627 --> 13:51.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this and being more
compassionate. What do
you -- how do you think priests
are going

13:51.330 --> 13:53.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to look at this?

13:53.132 --> 13:58.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIANNE DUDDY-BURKE: Well, I
think this has
really far-ranging impact, both
within the

13:58.671 --> 14:05.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
church and at the level of
policy all across
the globe, certainly in the area
of pastoral

14:05.111 --> 14:06.746 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

14:06.779 --> 14:13.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope that it will lead to less
dogmatic
interaction with people across
the board.

14:13.619 --> 14:18.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope that, you know, there's
more of a sense
that the church is first and
foremost here

14:18.991 --> 14:23.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to help care for people and help
us care for
each other, and that that really
needs to

14:23.763 --> 14:25.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be the starting point.

14:25.565 --> 14:30.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there is a lot of
that kind of
language there. I think that we
really have

14:30.403 --> 14:34.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to see what the response is
going to be certainly
at the level of the bishops and
cardinals,

14:34.407 --> 14:39.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because that trickles down to
what happens
in the everyday lives of where
people encounter

14:39.145 --> 14:45.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the church in its pastors and in
each other,
that pastoral care often comes
from the people

14:45.885 --> 14:47.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the church giving it to one
another.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

14:49.655 --> 14:54.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIANNE DUDDY-BURKE: So, that
level, I think
the responsiveness has often
been there, mostly

14:54.627 --> 14:58.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been there. It's really at the
level of the
hierarchy where we start
struggling a little

14:58.765 --> 15:00.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bit more with rigidity.

15:00.399 --> 15:04.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Amanda June
Gargus, let
me pick up on that point.

15:04.403 --> 15:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much do you think is going
the change
in -- either in the teaching,
the decision-making

15:11.344 --> 15:16.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by priests, by bishops, by
individual Catholics,
as a result of this?

15:17.016 --> 15:21.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANDA JUNE GARGUS: I would like
to hope that
there's going to be some change,
that priests

15:21.354 --> 15:28.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to start using this as
a guide for
how to deal with married and
divorced Catholics

15:28.828 --> 15:34.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
especially, since that was a
huge part of
the pope's message.

15:34.600 --> 15:40.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you're going to see a
lot of more
liberal priests using this as an
opportunity

15:40.306 --> 15:45.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to advance their -- already
their feelings
on it. They're going to see this
as an OK

15:45.912 --> 15:47.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to go forward.

15:47.780 --> 15:51.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, for us everyday
Catholics, for
the ones who aren't in the
priesthood, I think

15:51.751 --> 16:00.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this should be the point where
we see our
role as evangelicals, as part of
the clergy

16:00.159 --> 16:09.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Christ, as it were, to love
our neighbor
and to make sure that we are
protecting the

16:09.101 --> 16:13.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family, that we're guiding the
family, that
we're loving the family, but
we're also loving

16:13.773 --> 16:19.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those who may not conform to our
particular
ideas about the family, and that
we're showing

16:19.045 --> 16:21.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the love of Christ in that
environment as
well.

16:21.247 --> 16:24.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Gloria
Purvis, what do
you see changing as a result of
this?

16:24.817 --> 16:28.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLORIA PURVIS: Well, I think,
really, it's
a challenge to the priests,
because it is

16:28.554 --> 16:35.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an awesome responsibility to
walk with the
sheep, if you will, and to keep
us on the

16:35.294 --> 16:37.096 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
straight path.

16:37.129 --> 16:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't like the terms liberal
or conservative
Catholic. I like the terms just
truth. What

16:40.266 --> 16:47.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the truth of our teaching?
And it is not
compassionate to waive the
teaching to make

16:47.340 --> 16:49.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people feel comfortable.

16:49.242 --> 16:52.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what the pope is calling
the priests
to do is to walk with each of
the sheep wherever

16:52.945 --> 16:58.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are and help us to grow in
holiness,
which means properly forming our
conscience

16:58.351 --> 17:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and being willing to listen. And
the priest
is going to have to be a bride
of Christ and

17:02.521 --> 17:07.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have the heart of a mother in
dealing with
some very troubled children. So,
that's what

17:07.693 --> 17:09.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think is going to change.

17:09.528 --> 17:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we thank
all three of
you for helping us look through,
think through

17:13.499 --> 17:18.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what it is that the pope has
said in this
important statement.

17:18.104 --> 17:25.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gloria Purvis, thank you. Amanda
June Gargus
and Marianne Duddy-Burke, we
appreciate it.

17:25.711 --> 17:32.785 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

17:32.818 --> 17:38.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Next: Alabama's prison system at
a breaking
point.

17:38.891 --> 17:44.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state currently packs more
than 24,000
inmates into a system designed
to house about

17:44.530 --> 17:46.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
half that number.

17:46.332 --> 17:50.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown looks inside the
most overcrowded
prison system in the nation.
It's part of

17:50.903 --> 17:56.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our ongoing series Broken
Justice about new
approaches to criminal justice.

17:56.142 --> 18:04.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The William C.
Holman maximum
security prison in Atmore,
Alabama loud, crowded,

18:04.083 --> 18:09.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, when we visited just weeks
after a riot
broke out here, still in partial
lockdown.

18:09.922 --> 18:16.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On March 11, with just 17 guards
overseeing
more than 900 prisoners, a fight
broke out

18:16.495 --> 18:23.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between two inmates. An officer
trying to
break it up was stabbed, as was
the warden.

18:23.269 --> 18:29.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Video uploaded to Facebook by an
inmate using
a smuggled cell phone captured
some of the

18:29.976 --> 18:31.877 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mayhem.

18:31.911 --> 18:38.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it took the prison's rapid
response emergency
squads to reestablish order. It
was a shocking

18:38.951 --> 18:43.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that unfolded here at Holman
Correctional
Facility on March 11 were, but
perhaps more

18:43.356 --> 18:47.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shocking is that no one we have
spoken to
is surprised that something like
this could

18:47.860 --> 18:49.695 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have happened.

GOV. ROBERT BENTLEY (R),
Alabama: Unfortunately,
I think things like that will
continue. That's

18:51.564 --> 18:57.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why I think it's essential that
we solve this
problem, that we solve it once
and for all.

18:57.136 --> 19:02.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We joined Alabama
Governor
Robert Bentley as he toured
Julia Tutwiler

19:02.508 --> 19:09.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Prison, a maximum security
facility for women
outside Montgomery.

19:09.949 --> 19:16.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Department of Justice
sued Tutwiler
in 2014, citing corruption,
sexual assault

19:16.622 --> 19:22.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and harassment of inmates by
staff, just one
of a number of lawsuits accusing
the Alabama

19:22.161 --> 19:25.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Corrections System of violating
inmates' rights.

19:25.464 --> 19:30.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The violence, the overcrowding
and the federal
measures have pushed the solidly
Republican

19:30.770 --> 19:36.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state government into action, a
penal reform
bill passed last year by an
overwhelming majority

19:36.809 --> 19:41.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Republican-controlled
legislature,
and signed into law by the
Republican governor.

19:41.580 --> 19:45.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. ROBERT BENTLEY: I know, in
Alabama, just
like in a lot of states, it was
a three strikes

19:45.518 --> 19:51.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you're out type thing. And
so our prison
population has just dramatically
increased

19:51.123 --> 19:56.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the last 20 years. So, we
need to look
at that. We need to look at a
different approach.

19:56.562 --> 19:59.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what we're doing in
the state with
our prison reform bill.

19:59.198 --> 20:03.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Republican State
Senator Cam
Ward spearheaded the legislative
effort.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAM WARD (R), Alabama State
Senator: It took
many years to get into this
mess; it's going

20:05.671 --> 20:09.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take as many years to get
out. We campaigned
and politicized it so much, that
it was easy

20:09.975 --> 20:12.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get votes by saying, I'm
going to be tough
on crime.

20:12.478 --> 20:16.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a lot harder to say, I'm
going to maintain
a healthy constitutional system.
It doesn't

20:16.649 --> 20:19.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
quite fit on the bumper sticker
the same way
that the first slogan did.

20:19.385 --> 20:24.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Among other
things, the new
law, which just went into effect
in January,

20:24.156 --> 20:28.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
creates a new class of felonies
for low-level
drug and property crimes that
keeps offenders

20:28.861 --> 20:31.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out of state prisons.

20:31.430 --> 20:36.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alabama was the only state that
considered
all forms of property theft
violent crimes.

20:36.368 --> 20:42.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's now reclassified
third-degree burglary
as a nonviolent crime. The law
requires the

20:42.241 --> 20:48.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
hiring of 100 additional
probation and parole
officers. It mandates that
parole boards create

20:48.180 --> 20:53.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
standardized guidelines
statewide, give reasons
why inmates are denied parole,
and reduces

20:53.986 --> 20:56.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
punishments for minor parole
violations.

20:56.388 --> 21:01.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the first time, the new law
uses risk
assessment to focus resources on
those who

21:01.627 --> 21:06.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most need them, and funds drug
treatment and
mental health programs for those
released

21:06.665 --> 21:08.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
under correctional supervision.

21:08.567 --> 21:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAM WARD: Ninety-eight percent
of everybody
who's an inmate in a prison
today in the United

21:12.471 --> 21:15.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States eventually gets released.
However,
what we're not doing is putting
the adequate

21:15.975 --> 21:20.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resources there to monitor them
when they're
on their parole, making sure
they're complying

21:20.212 --> 21:21.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with all the stuff they're
supposed to be
complying with.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We didn't do that. This
legislation did.

21:23.916 --> 21:30.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Are you making
this push for
budgetary reasons, or for moral
reasons?

21:30.055 --> 21:34.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAM WARD: Interestingly enough,
it depends
on who you ask who -- why they
support it.

21:34.593 --> 21:36.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have some who say, hey, for
budgetary
purposes.

21:36.495 --> 21:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We just have to
do this.

21:38.230 --> 21:40.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAM WARD: This is the second
largest item
in our budget. We have got to do
something

21:40.533 --> 21:42.334 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about it.

21:42.368 --> 21:44.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then you have those for moral
purposes. I
would say many of my Democrat
colleagues would

21:44.803 --> 21:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say it's a moral issue for them.
They have
had to deal or hear people about
this. And

21:49.542 --> 21:53.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then, finally, I would say,
myself, I look
at it from a legal aspect.
You're going to

21:53.112 --> 21:57.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
run afoul of the Eighth
Amendment to the Constitution
if you continuing running
facilities and a

21:57.950 --> 21:59.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
system like we have been.

21:59.818 --> 22:03.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Eighth
Amendment prohibits
punishment considered cruel and
unusual and

22:03.556 --> 22:06.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the threat of a federal takeover
motivates
Ward and many others.

22:06.759 --> 22:10.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON, Founder, Equal
Justice Initiative:
I think it is cruel and I think
it's unusual.

22:10.396 --> 22:12.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it violates the Eighth
Amendment.

22:12.198 --> 22:16.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Bryan Stevenson
is a lawyer
and prison reform activist who
founded the

22:16.602 --> 22:22.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Equal Justice Initiative, a
Montgomery-based
nonprofit that represents
prisoners and indigent

22:22.474 --> 22:26.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defendants. He says the state's
reform efforts
don't go nearly far enough.

22:27.012 --> 22:31.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON: Alabama hasn't
done anything
that I would call significant
reform. We had

22:31.383 --> 22:35.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a prison task force that didn't
talk about
prisons, didn't talk about
conditions, didn't

22:35.888 --> 22:42.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talk about anything related to
the prisons.
We passed some really moderate,
minor even,

22:42.895 --> 22:44.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
changes in some of our
sentencing schemes.

22:44.763 --> 22:48.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: It's rough when you're kind
of elbow
to elbow to person.

22:48.567 --> 22:52.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In Dothan,
Alabama, we asked
men who had recently been
released from prison

22:52.871 --> 22:54.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about the conditions.

22:54.540 --> 22:57.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: It's harder to keep clean
when you got
all the people in there like
that.

22:57.476 --> 22:59.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Did you have
that, Dwight?
Was it crowded?

22:59.278 --> 23:01.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DWIGHT HAGOOD, Former Inmate:
Yes, sir. About
every day, there was a stabbing,
fighting,

23:01.213 --> 23:02.348 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cutting.

23:02.381 --> 23:06.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Every day, you
saw things like
that?

23:06.885 --> 23:09.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DWIGHT HAGOOD: Every day.

23:09.121 --> 23:13.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: These men are now
receiving
help from Pastor Kenneth
Glasgow...

23:13.592 --> 23:18.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KENNETH GLASGOW, Pastor,
Ordinary People Society:
I'm just now hitting 15 years,
after doing

23:18.297 --> 23:19.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
14 years.

23:19.965 --> 23:22.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: ... who, after serving 14
years on
a drug charge, created the
Ordinary People

23:22.601 --> 23:29.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Society, an organization and
halfway house
to help people transition out of
prison.

23:30.009 --> 23:36.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Glasgow applauds the efforts
made by the legislature
so far, but is also calling for
a more fundamental

23:36.849 --> 23:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change to the way people view
inmates.

23:39.652 --> 23:44.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH GLASGOW: We're not
ex-convicts. We're
not ex-offenders. We're not
ex-felons. Don't

23:45.024 --> 23:52.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
classify us. We are people with
felony convictions,
people that have paid their debt
to society.

23:52.631 --> 23:54.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
People. People.

23:54.433 --> 24:00.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON: Look, it's
still legal in
this state to impose a mandatory
life without

24:00.239 --> 24:06.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parole sentence on someone in
simple possession
of 2.5 pounds of marijuana,
using it for their

24:06.345 --> 24:08.147 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
personal use.

24:08.180 --> 24:13.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm representing a man who's a
75-year-old
disabled combat veteran who was
found to have

24:13.185 --> 24:18.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2.5 pounds of pot, because he
was using it
to deal with stents in his
heart. And because

24:18.223 --> 24:24.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he had convictions from 30 years
ago in Alabama,
the judge had to impose a
mandatory life without

24:24.663 --> 24:26.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
parole sentence on this man.

24:26.465 --> 24:30.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that's the kind of
sentencing regime we
still have in this state. The
metric that

24:30.135 --> 24:35.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
matters is the number of people
in jails or
prisons. You can talk about
reform all night

24:35.708 --> 24:39.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
long, you can talk about
building prisons,
you can talk about all kinds of
things. But

24:39.878 --> 24:45.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the truth is, we have got
thousands of people
in jails and prisons who don't
need to there.

24:45.250 --> 24:47.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we haven't found the courage
yet to get
them out.

24:47.319 --> 24:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. ROBERT BENTLEY: We're very
proud of how
we have taken this facility and
done some

24:52.024 --> 24:55.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
work in it. It still has
considerable limitations.

24:55.894 --> 25:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Even if the new
reforms do
work, they will only limit the
overcrowding.

25:01.200 --> 25:06.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor Bentley now wants to
take a dramatic
next step. He's proposed
building four supermax

25:06.805 --> 25:11.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prisons, costing $800 million,
to replace
outdated facilities like
Tutwiler.

25:11.477 --> 25:17.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. ROBERT BENTLEY: The
facilities we have
right now with 190 percent
occupancy rate,

25:17.116 --> 25:24.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost 200 percent, I mean, this
is just unacceptable.
And it's dangerous, not only to
the prisoners,

25:24.123 --> 25:29.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to our corrections officers, and
really to
the public, and it's costing us
hundreds of

25:29.261 --> 25:31.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
millions of dollars.

25:31.063 --> 25:36.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we can modernize the
system, and we
can try to correct and help
those who are

25:36.969 --> 25:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here, and that's our goal.

25:38.704 --> 25:42.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But now the
governor faces
a more immediate political
threat: a state

25:42.374 --> 25:47.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ethics investigation into his
time in office,
including whether he violated
state laws in

25:47.579 --> 25:50.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conducting an alleged affair
with a former
adviser.

25:50.382 --> 25:56.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The statehouse, including
members of the governor's
own party, just moved ahead on
impeachment

25:56.422 --> 25:58.223 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
proceedings.

25:58.257 --> 26:01.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ethics investigation now,
does that have
any impact, do you think, on
your potential

26:01.960 --> 26:04.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to pass reform, prison reform?

26:04.263 --> 26:08.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. ROBERT BENTLEY: You know, I
think that,
look, some people will think
that, and some

26:08.600 --> 26:15.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people may use that. I really do
not. I think
that the legislators who
understand the seriousness

26:15.073 --> 26:20.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this will not look at that.
They will try
to solve problems, just like I'm
trying to

26:20.946 --> 26:22.047 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And how big a
priority is this
for you?

26:23.849 --> 26:27.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. ROBERT BENTLEY: This is
very high. This
is -- right now is my highest
priority.

26:27.619 --> 26:29.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Highest?

26:29.421 --> 26:32.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. ROBERT BENTLEY: Highest
right now. We're
the closest right now to solving
this problem

26:32.291 --> 26:37.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that will solve a problem for
the state of
Alabama for the next 30 to 50
years. And that's

26:37.229 --> 26:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
major. And we're going from, as
I say, the
worst in the country, we're
going to go to

26:41.233 --> 26:43.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the best in the country.

26:43.068 --> 26:47.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the meantime,
everyone agrees
there's certain to be continued
overcrowding

26:47.206 --> 26:49.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and more violence.

26:49.208 --> 26:56.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Atmore, Alabama, I'm
Jeffrey Brown for
the "PBS NewsHour."

26:56.482 --> 27:07.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:07.159 --> 27:12.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
David Brooks
and Ruth Marcus analyze the
week's news; plus,

27:12.931 --> 27:17.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how a paralyzed man finished a
10K race.

27:17.469 --> 27:22.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, tonight we begin a
series, Inside
Kenya.

27:22.140 --> 27:27.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The East African nation is the
United States'
primary ally in the region, and
in the fight

27:27.479 --> 27:33.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against the deadly terror group
Al-Shabaab,
based in Somalia. Al-Shabaab
attacks government

27:33.752 --> 27:39.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and military institutions in
Somalia, but
it has also launched major
attacks in neighboring

27:39.391 --> 27:41.226 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Kenya.

27:41.260 --> 27:46.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Nick
Schifrin and producer
Zach Fannin traveled extensively
throughout

27:46.098 --> 27:49.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Northeastern Kenya, along the
Somali border.

27:49.334 --> 27:55.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, with the help of the
Pulitzer Center
on Crisis Reporting, we start
our series with

27:55.040 --> 28:00.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a look at how Al-Shabaab is
targeting Kenya,
and how Kenya is fighting back.

28:00.212 --> 28:04.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And a warning: The story
contains images some
viewers may find disturbing.

28:04.917 --> 28:10.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: On Kenya's front
line against
Al-Shabaab, police on patrol are
armed like

28:10.055 --> 28:17.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
soldiers. They search
traditional straw houses,
checking I.D.s at the barrel of
a gun.

28:17.462 --> 28:20.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIUS KIRAGU, Kenyan Army
(through translator):
The main threat here is the
Al-Shabaab. That

28:20.432 --> 28:24.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is terrorism, because they are
associated
with al-Qaida, and you know what
al-Qaidas

28:24.937 --> 28:26.705 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

28:26.738 --> 28:29.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Officer Julius
Kiragu heads
Kenya's administrative police in
Wajir, only

28:29.808 --> 28:34.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
70 miles from the Somali border.
Every night,
they search for smuggled weapons
and hiding

28:34.713 --> 28:36.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fighters.

28:36.548 --> 28:42.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIUS KIRAGU: They pretend they
are selling
milk and all these things, but
they are waiting

28:42.220 --> 28:44.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the appropriate time to
strike.

28:44.189 --> 28:49.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Most of his
officers are ethnic
Somali, like the majority of the
local population.

28:49.828 --> 28:55.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some officers wear civilian
clothing and ride
around in unmarked cars. They
work with local

28:55.634 --> 28:58.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tribal chiefs, like Zein
Abdulla.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What kinds of weapons have you
found here?

29:00.072 --> 29:03.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZEIN ABDULLA, Tribal Chief:
There were guns.
There were grenades. There were
ammunitions

29:03.675 --> 29:04.810 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and such things.

29:04.843 --> 29:07.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: So, Shabaab has
supporters
even here?

29:07.212 --> 29:11.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZEIN ABDULLA: So, they have
representatives
at least in every district.

29:11.550 --> 29:19.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Al-Shabaab has
waged a decade-long
war in Somalia. In 2011, Kenya
invaded Somalia,

29:19.558 --> 29:22.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a campaign called Protect the
Country.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Emmanuel Chirchir was the face
of the campaign
in Somalia, and on Twitter.

29:25.497 --> 29:28.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMANUEL CHIRCHIR, Kenya Army:
This gives
an opportunity to tell the rest
of the world

29:28.800 --> 29:32.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
what is true and what is
happening in the
battle space.

29:32.270 --> 29:37.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: At first, Kenyan
and other
African troops pushed Shabaab
out of its strongholds,

29:37.275 --> 29:45.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and raised the Somali flag. But
after an operational
pause, Shabaab is strengthening.

29:45.250 --> 29:53.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In January, Shabaab fighters
took over a Kenyan
base. It was Kenya's worst ever
military disaster.

29:53.358 --> 29:59.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 100 soldiers died,
including Chirchir's
brother.

29:59.931 --> 30:07.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMANUEL CHIRCHIR: My brother
died immediately,
instantly. This is what he loved
most. I am

30:07.472 --> 30:13.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happy that he actually died
doing what he
loved most.

30:13.545 --> 30:18.750 align:left position:25%,start line:66.67% size:75%
NICK SCHIFRIN:
Twenty-nine-year-old Dan
Chirchir
had only been in Somalia for
three weeks.

30:18.784 --> 30:25.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His funeral, with full military
honors, was
held at the family's estate in
Western Kenya.

30:25.524 --> 30:30.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The explosion that killed him
was unprecedented.
Al-Shabaab got inside the El
Adde base to

30:30.796 --> 30:32.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
detonate a car bomb, or VBIED.

30:32.831 --> 30:37.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
EMMANUEL CHIRCHIR: The
penetration of that
VBIED changed the game.

30:37.402 --> 30:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: What can you tell
me about
the El Adde attack?

30:39.838 --> 30:44.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
attack was carried
out by one of our brigades. They
were trained

30:44.609 --> 30:46.378 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
commandos.

30:46.411 --> 30:49.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: This 40-year-old
Somali says
he's a member of Al-Shabaab. He
says the El

30:49.915 --> 30:54.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Adde attack took eight months to
plan. He
threatened to kill me if we
didn't keep him

30:54.219 --> 30:55.721 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
anonymous.

30:55.754 --> 31:00.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the main motivation for
you and your
men to have joined Al-Shabaab?

31:00.358 --> 31:05.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
joined thee group
to get a job. Somalia is a place
where there

31:05.397 --> 31:07.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is no government and no work.

31:07.232 --> 31:11.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: What is the main
goal for you
and your men in al-Shabaab?

31:11.503 --> 31:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
want to have
an Islamic State in Somalia,
where Sharia

31:15.440 --> 31:16.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
law is practiced.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Why you have
launched attacks
inside Kenya?

31:19.377 --> 31:23.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Kenya
has invaded
our land.

31:23.048 --> 31:27.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Shabaab claims to
be fighting
for Kenyan Muslims. It recruits
Kenyans to

31:27.886 --> 31:33.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
carry out attacks in Kenya. The
worst in 20
years was on Garissa University.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How bad was the scene here when
you arrived?

31:36.828 --> 31:38.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HAMO MOHAMED, Garissa
University: It was terrible.

31:38.697 --> 31:43.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Hamo Mohamed is
Garissa's dean
of students. This classroom is
still scarred

31:43.168 --> 31:48.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from last year's attack. Shabaab
murdered
19 students in this room for
singing Christian

31:48.640 --> 31:50.408 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
prayers.

31:50.442 --> 31:55.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAMO MOHAMED: Bodies of the
students that
you know them by names, the
young, aspiring,

31:55.814 --> 31:59.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you're seeing their body
lying down, you
know, their blood all over.

31:59.384 --> 32:05.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOFIE GATRIWIRI, Student: They
came when I
was here, and then I would be no
more too.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So I'm just lucky.

32:07.125 --> 32:09.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Sofie Gatriwiri
is a junior.

32:09.194 --> 32:12.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOFIE GATRIWIRI: I'm going to
finish my education
and get a better job.

32:12.798 --> 32:16.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: She was a member
of the Christian
prayer group that was attacked.

32:16.234 --> 32:18.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How many friends did you lose?

32:18.270 --> 32:23.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOFIE GATRIWIRI: I lost like 15.
I don't like
this discussing that story about
those people,

32:23.608 --> 32:27.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those students who passed. I
don't like at
all.

32:27.145 --> 32:32.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The gunmen lured
the students
down into this courtyard, right?

32:32.350 --> 32:37.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That courtyard is in Garissa's
largest dorm,
with students' rooms upstairs.
This was the

32:37.222 --> 32:38.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gunmen's final stop.

32:39.024 --> 32:44.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAMO MOHAMED: It was ugly, what
had happened
here. And you see, you could
find the bodies.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know what the manner, the
way they arranged,
they put them so close.

32:47.999 --> 32:49.434 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Side by side.

32:49.467 --> 32:52.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAMO MOHAMED: Yes, side by side,
so that they
were just lying all over.

32:52.804 --> 32:57.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Shabaab gunmen
locked the doors
and killed everyone. This photo
was taken

32:57.242 --> 33:00.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a few hours later and posted
online.

33:00.378 --> 33:07.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the same spot today; 120
bodies filled
this atrium. The gunmen had gone
from bedroom

33:07.352 --> 33:12.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to bedroom, claiming they just
wanted to talk
to the students. So, many
students willingly

33:12.390 --> 33:17.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came down here. But when they
were all lined
up, they were all shot in the
head, execution-style.

33:17.295 --> 33:24.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, police patrol the campus.
Kenya says
the school represents resistance
to terror.

33:24.903 --> 33:28.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for this community, it's a
reminder of
decades of neglect.

33:28.440 --> 33:32.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAMO MOHAMED: Fifty years of
independence,
and yet you don't have even a
single university

33:32.911 --> 33:35.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the whole of the northern
region, Northern
Kenya. That's marginalization.

33:35.981 --> 33:40.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: When Kenya became
independent
in 1963, the Northern Frontier
District covered

33:41.019 --> 33:45.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nearly half the country's land
mass. But it
had no higher education.

33:45.056 --> 33:53.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Garissa is the region's
only university.
And for 50 years, northeastern
cities and

33:53.164 --> 33:57.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ethnic Somali residents have
received
barely any development funds
from the central

33:57.869 --> 33:59.037 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

33:59.070 --> 34:01.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Has Wajir and the northeastern
region been
neglected?

34:01.106 --> 34:04.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HASHIM ELMOGE, Community
Organizer: Yes. It
was terribly neglected. For 50
years since

34:04.576 --> 34:09.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
independence, we never knew
roads. We never
had good health facilities. We
have no good

34:09.948 --> 34:14.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
education. We're still drinking
from dried-up
wells.

34:14.419 --> 34:19.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Hashim Elmoge is
a former police
officer turned community
organizer.

34:19.724 --> 34:26.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, roads are being built,
and local governance
established. But this is the
first new road

34:26.598 --> 34:33.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Wajir in half-a-century. That
neglect becomes
toxic, when combined with
accusations that

34:33.805 --> 34:37.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
security services abuse ethnic
Somalis.

34:37.342 --> 34:39.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Were you proud of your son?

34:39.277 --> 34:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADOW ABDULLAHI, Father (through
translator):
I loved him so much.

34:41.947 --> 34:47.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Adow Abdullahi's
son was picked
up by police and disappeared.
And then Abdullahi

34:47.485 --> 34:52.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got a call from a town 40 miles
away. Local
media covered how his son's body
had been

34:52.757 --> 34:54.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
found in a river.

34:54.326 --> 34:56.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Was your son's body tortured?

34:56.127 --> 35:03.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ADOW ABDULLAHI (through
translator): He was
strangled. He had marks on his
genitals. He

35:03.635 --> 35:05.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was tortured. He had marks.

35:05.704 --> 35:11.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: How shocked were
you when you
saw your son's body?

35:11.076 --> 35:16.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ADOW ABDULLAHI (through
translator): I am
a Muslim. I have faith in God.
What a father

35:16.848 --> 35:18.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
could feel is what I felt.

35:18.950 --> 35:22.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Can you point
where they hit
you?

35:22.787 --> 35:26.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OMAR FAISAL BASHIR, Kenya
(through translator):
They hit me here, all the way
up, and also

35:26.958 --> 35:28.727 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
below here.

35:28.760 --> 35:32.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Omar Bashir is 19
years old.
He says security services
stopped him on the

35:32.731 --> 35:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
street, took him away, and
tortured him for
four days.

35:36.634 --> 35:37.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you feel pain?

35:37.836 --> 35:39.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OMAR FAISAL BASHIR (through
translator): Yes.

35:39.104 --> 35:42.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: What was your son
like before
this happened

35:42.073 --> 35:46.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MASHIR ULMAK, Father (through
translator):
He was sharp. He was healthy and
he went to

35:46.511 --> 35:48.380 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school.

35:48.413 --> 35:51.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Mashir Ulmak is
Bashir's father.
He is worried about his son.
These days, Bashir

35:51.816 --> 35:54.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
skips school and is depressed.

35:54.552 --> 35:57.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does the government single out
Somali Kenyans?

35:57.822 --> 36:02.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MASHIR ULMAK (through
translator): They single
out ethnic Somalis. They are not
doing this

36:02.961 --> 36:04.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to other communities in Kenya.

36:04.729 --> 36:08.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And when a
community feels
like prey, they want to become
the hunter.

36:08.233 --> 36:12.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OMAR FAISAL BASHIR (through
translator): I
know what I have gone through. I
was innocent.

36:12.370 --> 36:14.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will treat people the same way
I was treated.

36:14.739 --> 36:20.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HASHIM ELMOGE: Because of the
seething discontent,
Kenyan ethnic Somalis are
feeling that Kenya

36:21.012 --> 36:25.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not their home. So, some are
joining terrorist
organizations in Somalia.

36:25.650 --> 36:30.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The police deny
wrongdoing.
They say everything they do is
to fight Al-Shabaab.

36:30.822 --> 36:34.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIUS KIRAGU: The people, they
may not like
the operation, but we have to do
it.

36:34.292 --> 36:39.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Why did you have
to do those
operations.

36:39.564 --> 36:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIUS KIRAGU: The operations?

36:41.699 --> 36:43.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Yes.

36:43.068 --> 36:44.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIUS KIRAGU: Wipe out the
criminals. These
are the Al-Shabaab.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The relationship
between national
security services and local
ethnic Somalis

36:46.638 --> 36:53.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has always been strained. Today,
human rights
activists say it's close to
breaking.

36:53.111 --> 36:57.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HASHIM ELMOGE: The war against
terror is valid.
It is legitimate. As Muslims,
and as ethnic

36:57.415 --> 37:03.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Somalis, we support it.
Overwhelmingly. That
said, our government is using
terror to suppress

37:03.521 --> 37:08.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terror. And the people are more
angry. And
that is why Al-Shabaab is
tapping into that

37:08.893 --> 37:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anger, to radicalize and use
bitter young
men against our security agents.

37:15.733 --> 37:21.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Until Kenya stops
breeding
its own enemies, the country
will remain divided,

37:21.339 --> 37:26.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Al-Shabaab will continue to
exploit those
divisions to wage war.

37:26.311 --> 37:30.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Nick
Schifrin
in Garissa, Kenya.

37:30.281 --> 37:36.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Our reporting
from Kenya continues
on Saturday, when the "NewsHour
Weekend" looks

37:36.354 --> 37:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at why young men join Al-Shabaab
and the efforts
by some to get them out.

37:42.127 --> 37:47.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then on Monday, we examine the
epidemic of
corruption in Kenya and the
people fighting

37:47.398 --> 37:59.611 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
back.

37:59.644 --> 38:04.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the week's political news:
the renewed
war of words between the two
Democratic candidates

38:04.983 --> 38:10.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for president, a former
president's skirmish
with protesters, and how
Wisconsin has altered

38:10.889 --> 38:13.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the race for the Republican
nomination.

38:13.258 --> 38:18.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get analysis now from Brooks
and Marcus.
That's New York Times columnist
David Brooks,

38:18.563 --> 38:23.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
joining us from New York, and
here on set,
Washington Post columnist Ruth
Marcus. Mark

38:23.668 --> 38:25.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Shields is away this week.

38:25.703 --> 38:27.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we welcome both of you.

38:27.505 --> 38:31.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's talk about this war of
words that's
been going on the last few days
between the

38:31.342 --> 38:33.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two Democrats.

38:33.244 --> 38:37.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David, it's gotten -- the
language has gotten
tougher. It's gotten more
personal. What do

38:37.982 --> 38:39.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you make of this?

38:39.350 --> 38:43.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: They're like
1/100th of the
Republican level so far.

38:43.087 --> 38:44.856 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:44.889 --> 38:48.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think that I'm
most amazed
that Bernie Sanders wasn't here
months ago,

38:48.126 --> 38:49.961 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
frankly.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, he made a decision
early on, I think
the wrong decision, to take the
e-mail issue

38:52.530 --> 38:56.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off the table and take a bunch
of issues off
the table and not go after
Hillary Clinton.

38:56.601 --> 38:59.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he really wasn't as tough
on her as
he could be.

38:59.604 --> 39:04.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now he's going after her, to me,
on the least
promising possible grounds, that
she's unqualified.

39:05.009 --> 39:09.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whatever else Hillary Clinton
may be, unqualified,
at least by any conventional
measure, is not

39:09.847 --> 39:12.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one of them. And so I'm a little
mystified.

39:12.217 --> 39:15.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do not think it will hurt the
Democratic
Party. I think, if you look at
the polling

39:15.320 --> 39:20.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
numbers, people -- most -- the
vast majority
people on both -- who support
either candidate

39:20.124 --> 39:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be happy with the other.
And so I think
you will still get a reasonably
united Democratic

39:25.096 --> 39:26.864 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party.

39:26.898 --> 39:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ruth, what do you
make of this,
and why do you think it's
happening now?

39:28.733 --> 39:32.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: So, it's happening
now because
this is the stage in every
protracted primary

39:32.870 --> 39:38.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign where candidates are
tired, nerves
are frayed. Everybody kind of
wants it to

39:38.710 --> 39:44.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be over and wants the other guy
to go away,
or woman to go away, and to win
finally.

39:44.415 --> 39:48.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so these -- this is the
moment when these
things tend to happen. And they
always tend

39:48.920 --> 39:54.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- David is right that this is
really rather
tame compared to what happened
on the Republican

39:54.459 --> 39:56.227 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
side.

39:56.261 --> 39:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, on the Republican side
this week,
you had Donald Trump accusing
his main rival

39:59.731 --> 40:06.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of having committed a federal
felony by coordinating
with his super PAC. So, this is
pretty mild.

40:06.437 --> 40:11.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These things also always look
worse at the
time than they do in retrospect.
If you look

40:11.576 --> 40:16.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back at some of the words that
occurred between
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama
in 2008,

40:16.981 --> 40:22.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was a lot of angst at the
time about
how Hillary Clinton's supporters
would never,

40:22.353 --> 40:27.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever be willing to vote for
Barack Obama after
what had happened to her.

40:27.292 --> 40:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in June of 2008, only 60
percent of them
said they would vote for Obama.
Well, guess

40:32.930 --> 40:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what? They did. He's president.
So, this is
going to -- we had ramp-up
Thursday yesterday.

40:38.703 --> 40:40.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today was kind of tamp-it-down
Friday.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Calm-down Friday.

40:42.740 --> 40:45.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, David, you don't see this
having an effect
in the fall, that this could
come back to

40:45.510 --> 40:49.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bite whoever the Democratic
nominee is? We
assume it's Hillary Clinton, but
we don't

40:49.314 --> 40:50.148 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
know for sure.

40:50.181 --> 40:51.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

40:51.949 --> 40:56.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, no, I really don't think --
I think,
first of all, as Ruth said,
wounds get healed,

40:56.054 --> 40:59.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially around convention
time. Everybody
has a party. They feel good
against each other

40:59.257 --> 41:00.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- with each other.

41:01.025 --> 41:05.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, you know, Ted Cruz or
Donald Trump
or somebody like that is sitting
out there,

41:05.363 --> 41:08.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a very good unifying device for
Democrats.

41:08.066 --> 41:11.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ruth, what about
this exchange
between Bill Clinton yesterday
and these Black

41:11.736 --> 41:20.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lives Matter protesters in
Philadelphia? They
brought up the crime bill,
criticizing him,

41:20.912 --> 41:26.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
criticizing Secretary Clinton,
his wife, for
being his wife, for supporting
him at the

41:26.651 --> 41:28.519 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

41:28.553 --> 41:32.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now she's saying this is
something she would
change. But is this something
that has traction,

41:32.490 --> 41:33.825 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do you think?

41:33.858 --> 41:36.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Well, there's a few
different
risks embedded in there.

41:36.728 --> 41:43.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is the sort of continuing
role of Bill
Clinton, who is simultaneously
her most powerful

41:43.067 --> 41:47.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surrogate in chief and also
Hillary Clinton's
most dangerous surrogate in
chief. So, when

41:47.905 --> 41:53.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he tends to have that
finger-jabbing red-in-the-face
moment, it can be a dangerous
moment for Hillary

41:53.878 --> 41:55.613 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

41:55.646 --> 41:59.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of Black Lives Matter,
again, it
sort of depends on the context.
Compared to

41:59.484 --> 42:06.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what? The Black Lives Matter
protesters have
an issue with Bill Clinton and
to some extent

42:06.324 --> 42:11.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton and criminal
justice reform
and the 1994 crime bill. But
guess what? They

42:11.129 --> 42:14.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have the same issue with Bernie
Sanders. And
guess what? They're going to
have a bigger

42:14.766 --> 42:20.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issue even in this general
election with a
Ted Cruz or a Donald Trump.

42:20.204 --> 42:25.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's an irritant, but it's
an irritant
-- and I don't mean to dismiss
it, but it's

42:25.643 --> 42:30.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an issue that Hillary Clinton
has tried on
the campaign trail to defuse by
saying she's

42:30.615 --> 42:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sorry for mentioning super
predator and she
is sorry, and she regrets a
piece of the 1994

42:36.821 --> 42:38.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
crime bill went too far.

42:38.689 --> 42:43.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to me, this is another one
of those things
that looks like a bigger deal
this week than

42:43.394 --> 42:44.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's going to look in a few
months.

42:44.762 --> 42:46.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, what do
you think?

42:46.531 --> 42:49.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I think there
are a couple
true facts, most of which were
uttered by

42:49.801 --> 42:51.569 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bill Clinton.

42:51.602 --> 42:53.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The one that wasn't was that the
crime bill,
the Clinton crime bill, didn't
have a huge

42:53.971 --> 42:59.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
measurable effect on crime or
incarceration
rates particularly. It was --
some pieces

42:59.377 --> 43:01.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of legislation don't have much
effect. And
that was one of them.

43:01.846 --> 43:05.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second thing to be said is
that there
are such a thing super
predators. And Clinton

43:05.383 --> 43:10.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of made that point, that
some people
are really doing harm to their
neighborhoods.

43:10.721 --> 43:13.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the third thing to be said
is, we have
too much incarceration in this
country.

43:13.991 --> 43:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so any honest appreciation
of this issue
contains two opposite facts. One
is that there

43:22.467 --> 43:27.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a crime problem, and that has
to be cracked
down on, and second that there
is racism within

43:27.538 --> 43:30.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the enforcement community, and
that there
is overincarceration.

43:30.775 --> 43:36.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Clinton -- the
Clintons sort of
stand for those two ends of the
spectrum here.

43:36.380 --> 43:40.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's probably what most
voters recognize,
that we have to be tough on
crime, and, as

43:40.117 --> 43:44.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tony Blair said, tough on racism
or tough
on the causes of crime.

43:44.088 --> 43:48.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But to wrap up
the Democrats,
Ruth, looking like what in New
York, which

43:48.726 --> 43:51.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is coming up in another
week-and-a-half, the
New York primary?

43:51.929 --> 43:58.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Well, Bernie
Sanders is a natural-born
New Yorker, to use a
constitutional phrase.

43:58.469 --> 44:01.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is an adopted
New Yorker.

44:01.439 --> 44:06.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she is in a much stronger
position. This
is a state that she's won, as
she likes to

44:06.577 --> 44:13.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point out, three times, in two
Senate races
and in a presidential primary
previously.

44:13.251 --> 44:18.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so she is in a quite good
position with
New York. He's in a less good
position.

44:19.023 --> 44:25.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have to say, as for New York,
I can't let
the week go without mentioning
that what a

44:25.463 --> 44:29.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
great week in American politics,
when Ted
Cruz is going to the matzah
factory, to the

44:29.867 --> 44:34.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
matzah factory, and Bernie
Sanders is going
to go to the Vatican next week.
So, how great

44:34.872 --> 44:36.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is American politics?

44:36.140 --> 44:37.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He just revealed
that, revealed
that today.

44:37.241 --> 44:38.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: Yes.

44:38.676 --> 44:40.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we're going
to get to the
Republicans in a minute.

44:40.478 --> 44:44.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, David, anything to add on
the Democrats
in New York? What do you see
with the two

44:44.515 --> 44:48.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New Yorkers confronting each
other, one adopted
and one home-born?

44:48.319 --> 44:53.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, if Hillary
lost here, it
would be -- that would be bad.

44:53.224 --> 44:56.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, if she lost here,
if she lost
in California, that would be
bad. Otherwise,

44:56.861 --> 45:00.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she's still basically got the
math on her
side and she's rolling along.

45:00.231 --> 45:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David, let's
turn to the
Republicans.

45:02.600 --> 45:09.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump took quite a
drubbing in Wisconsin
this week. Ted Cruz picked up
almost all the

45:09.206 --> 45:15.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
delegates, I guess, in
Wisconsin, and he just
keeps picking up a delegate here
and a delegate

45:15.212 --> 45:21.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there. How much less inevitable
is Donald
Trump as the Republican nominee,
or is he?

45:21.919 --> 45:26.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, in the
corridors of cognoscenti,
if any of us are to be believed,
there's been

45:26.991 --> 45:29.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like a 180 in the conventional
wisdom.

45:29.360 --> 45:32.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A couple weeks ago, it was,
Trump is inevitable.
He's rolling through everything.
Now it's,

45:32.964 --> 45:36.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cruz is inevitable. There's just
a lot of
chattering that suddenly it's
going to be

45:36.934 --> 45:41.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz. And the basic argument
is that Trump
will not get a first-ballot
majority at the

45:41.339 --> 45:44.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convention. And the sorts of
people who are
delegates to a Republican
Convention are the

45:44.642 --> 45:48.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sorts of people who like Ted
Cruz, and that
given the chance on a second or
third ballot,

45:48.479 --> 45:50.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they would love to dump Trump
and go to Cruz.

45:50.982 --> 45:55.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Magnifying the fact is events
like has been
happening or is about to happen
tomorrow in

45:55.519 --> 46:00.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colorado, where the actual
delegate selection
process is something the Trump
campaign is

46:00.324 --> 46:04.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fumbling horrifically, and the
Cruz campaign
is pretty good at.

46:04.061 --> 46:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so as we focus on the
delegates, and less
the raw vote totals, Ted Cruz is
looking pretty.

46:09.533 --> 46:12.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't know -- I think it's
a little
overstated, because I think Cruz
is about

46:12.069 --> 46:16.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to suffer some really bad
defeats. I think
he is going to look a lot worse
off after

46:16.140 --> 46:22.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Trump-Cruz civil war goes on
for another
couple months, but, right now,
the glow of

46:22.113 --> 46:24.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
inevitability has suddenly
shifted over to
Ted Cruz.

46:24.582 --> 46:28.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you see the
glow the same
way David is describing it?

46:28.753 --> 46:30.554 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:30.588 --> 46:34.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: I think to use the
word inevitable
about the Republican race in
2016 is going

46:34.492 --> 46:36.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be all kind of constantly
wrong.

46:37.028 --> 46:43.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's just undeniable that
Donald Trump
had a very bad night in
Wisconsin and a very

46:43.634 --> 46:51.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bad couple weeks leading up to
that. And those
both affect this aura of -- this
shift in

46:51.142 --> 46:56.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the aura of inevitability,
because what we
have seen with Donald Trump is
underperforming,

46:56.380 --> 46:59.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
underperforming on an electoral
level, right?

46:59.216 --> 47:05.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He won New Hampshire with 35
percent of the
vote, but he lost Wisconsin with
35 percent

47:05.723 --> 47:11.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the vote. He is not -- as the
field has
winnowed, he is not increasing
his vote total.

47:11.529 --> 47:17.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Probably more significant is
something that
David alluded to, is that he is
not doing

47:17.501 --> 47:24.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well in this tension between
being possible
President Trump and being real
Donald Trump.

47:24.141 --> 47:29.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's not doing well alleviating
the tension
between professionalizing his
campaign, which

47:29.046 --> 47:34.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's trying to do with bringing
in Paul Manafort
to do his delegate selection and
convention,

47:34.151 --> 47:38.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and ad-libbing his campaign,
which is what
he is wont to do. And ad-libbing
his way through

47:38.723 --> 47:44.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
editorial board interviews and
different discussions
of abortion has not served him
well over the

47:44.128 --> 47:45.129 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last few weeks.

47:45.162 --> 47:47.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, he's been
off the trail.

47:47.098 --> 47:51.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We haven't really seen Donald
Trump for day
or so, other than that tweet
today about tending

47:51.869 --> 47:58.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to his business, David. But is
there room
for Donald Trump to come back
and be this

47:58.943 --> 48:04.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
term we keep hearing him say,
his wife wants
him to be more presidential, and
to get his

48:04.882 --> 48:07.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
act together when it comes to
building up
his delegate lead?

48:07.985 --> 48:12.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: You know what? I
think a lot
of wives have imagined wishes
for their husband's

48:12.723 --> 48:16.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change in behavior, but they
rarely come about,
certainly not in the case of
Donald Trump.

48:16.594 --> 48:18.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:18.496 --> 48:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: You know, I do not
think he's
going to be more presidential.
He is an aggressor.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's an attacker.

48:24.602 --> 48:29.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been doing that since 1990,
or since
anybody ever heard of Donald
Trump. And so

48:29.073 --> 48:36.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he is the same thing. He's just
not that substantive.
I think some of the
organizational problems

48:36.113 --> 48:41.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the campaign could be
fixed. If you look
at what's happening in Colorado,
you know,

48:41.152 --> 48:47.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people show up at the
congressional districts'
delegate committee hearings, and
the Trump

48:47.424 --> 48:49.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign hands them who to vote
for.

48:49.293 --> 48:52.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the people on the list that
they're handed
who to vote for don't match the
people actually

48:52.596 --> 48:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the ballot. That's just a
basic organizational
incompetence.

48:56.433 --> 48:59.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think, however, he's going
to have a
bunch of rebound and he's going
to look a

48:59.904 --> 49:04.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot better as we head to the
Northeast. Ted
Cruz is just not a
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic

49:04.575 --> 49:10.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate. And so the vibe
around Trump, as
he starts racking up some big
wins, will probably

49:10.881 --> 49:12.683 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

49:12.716 --> 49:15.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, he's probably at a
little nadir,
but it is significant that a big
nadir could

49:15.119 --> 49:20.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come in Cleveland. It could all
come down
to that first or second ballot,
or the negotiations

49:20.157 --> 49:23.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up to that first or second
ballot. And there
is a much higher likelihood than
there was

49:23.494 --> 49:25.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a couple weeks ago that he won't
get there.

49:25.563 --> 49:27.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, of course,
Trump's people
are saying that's not the case.
His delegate

49:27.898 --> 49:29.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
man came out today and said,
we're going to
have it.

49:29.700 --> 49:31.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Right. They have
got it locked.
It's inevitable.

49:31.502 --> 49:36.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But they are also
hanging this
phrase that Ted Cruz used back
in a debate

49:36.273 --> 49:41.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in January critical of New York
values around
his neck, making it a little bit
harder for

49:41.345 --> 49:42.713 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mr. Cruz.

49:42.746 --> 49:46.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: What a surprise
that they would
dredge up that phrase.

49:46.183 --> 49:50.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was -- New York was going to
be hard, as
David mentioned, for Ted Cruz.
It's not his

49:50.588 --> 49:54.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
natural territory. The Northeast
is not his
natural territory. Even if he
hadn't derided

49:54.625 --> 49:58.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New York values, that was going
to be difficult
for him.

49:58.295 --> 50:04.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so that leads to the
situation we're going
to see Trump in going forward,
which is, things

50:04.635 --> 50:08.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to look better. He's
going to rack
up these wins. But, at the same
time, there

50:08.239 --> 50:13.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is this subterranean war for
delegates going
on that he needs to really
improve his performance

50:13.944 --> 50:17.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on to not have more of this kind
of Colorado
debacle that we're seeing.

50:17.748 --> 50:21.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're
watching it, both
terraneanly and subterraneanly.

50:21.185 --> 50:22.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:22.920 --> 50:32.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ruth Marcus and
David Brooks,
have a great weekend. Thank you
both.

50:32.963 --> 50:40.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ruth Marcus and
David Brooks,
have a great weekend. Thank you
both.

50:40.804 --> 50:44.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally to our "NewsHour"
Shares, something
that caught our eye that we
thought might

50:44.508 --> 50:46.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be of interest to you too.

50:46.343 --> 50:52.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ten years ago, a car accident
severed Adam
Gorlitsky's spinal cord, leaving
him paralyzed

50:52.316 --> 50:57.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the waist down. But that
didn't stop
the former high school
cross-country and track

50:57.388 --> 51:04.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
runner from finishing a 10K race
last weekend,
thanks, in part, to a special
robotic suit.

51:04.895 --> 51:13.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Step by step, and
mile by mile,
29-year-old Adam Gorlitsky
walked the entire

51:13.671 --> 51:17.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
length of the Cooper River
Bridge Run in Charleston,
South Carolina, Saturday.

51:17.041 --> 51:22.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM GORLITSKY, South Carolina:
I'm feeling
good. I'm feeling very good,
very confident.

51:22.079 --> 51:28.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gorlitsky used a
robotic exoskeleton
machine to accomplish the feat.
He received

51:28.719 --> 51:34.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the system in December and has
trained two
to three hours a day with it
ever since to

51:34.692 --> 51:36.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
prepare for the race.

51:36.393 --> 51:38.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM GORLITSKY: Not only are you
walking,
but you're walking in the Cooper
River Bridge

51:38.696 --> 51:40.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Run. Come on.

51:40.564 --> 51:46.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Friends and
family walked beside
Gorlitsky on race day as he
battled hills,

51:46.270 --> 51:49.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high winds and physical pain
along the way.
