02:55.366 --> 02:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT WAS A COMBINATION OF

02:56.566 --> 02:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS.

02:57.666 --> 02:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

A LOT OF OIL AND GAS COMPANIES

03:10.033 --> 03:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOBBIED AGAINST THESE MEASURES,

03:11.733 --> 03:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
