the bombing

00:14.481 --> 00:17.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Manchester kills more than
20, including
children.

00:17.884 --> 00:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then: The Russian investigation
deepens.

00:21.121 --> 00:25.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former CIA Director John Brennan
shares his
concern over Russian meddling
and calls the

00:25.158 --> 00:26.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
probe well-founded.

00:26.993 --> 00:31.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN BRENNAN, Former CIA
Director: I encountered
and am aware of information and
intelligence

00:31.398 --> 00:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that revealed contacts and
interactions between
Russian officials and U.S.
persons involved

00:40.874 --> 00:42.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the Trump campaign.

00:42.675 --> 00:47.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the Trump
administration
unveils a budget proposal,
slashing funds

00:47.113 --> 00:49.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for programs that serve the
poor.

00:49.849 --> 00:53.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus, we look ahead to President
Trump's visit
with the pope at the Vatican.

00:53.853 --> 00:58.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IRENE CARATELLI, International
Relations Specialist:
I think that Pope Francis is
going to meet

00:58.458 --> 01:03.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump, knowing he has
the possibility
to influence someone who can
change history.

01:03.997 --> 01:06.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:06.533 --> 01:11.004 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:11.037 --> 01:23.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Britain is
raising its terror
threat level to critical, as
Prime Minister

01:23.349 --> 01:26.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Theresa May warns that another
attack may
be imminent.

01:26.853 --> 01:30.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She ordered the military to
deploy troops
tonight, after the bombing in
Manchester that

01:30.690 --> 01:32.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
killed 22 people.

01:32.559 --> 01:35.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Natalie
Powell begins
our coverage.

01:35.061 --> 01:37.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Oh, my God.

01:37.197 --> 01:38.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's going on?

01:38.798 --> 01:40.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What just happened?

01:40.600 --> 01:45.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIE POWELL: The scene in
Manchester last
night moments after a suicide
bomber blew

01:45.638 --> 01:48.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
himself up at a crowded concert.

01:48.808 --> 01:54.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It happened at the Manchester
arena, an indoor
venue that seats 21,000 people.

01:54.914 --> 02:00.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bomb went off in the space
connecting
the arena and adjacent Victoria
train station.

02:00.987 --> 02:06.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attack set off a stampede,
just as American
pop star Ariana Grande had
finished performing.

02:06.593 --> 02:09.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNA, Eyewitness: I was like, we
need to run,
so we started running.

02:09.629 --> 02:14.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We ran straight out the doors,
all the way
down to the hotel, and all I
could hear was

02:14.567 --> 02:15.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
screaming, people crying.

02:15.568 --> 02:16.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everyone was just running
everywhere.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was completely madness.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN DIAZ, Eyewitness:
People were screaming
around us and pushing down the
stairs to go

02:21.274 --> 02:23.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outside, and people were falling
down.

02:23.910 --> 02:25.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Girls were crying.

02:25.178 --> 02:27.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we saw these women being
treated by paramedics.

02:27.514 --> 02:30.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They had, like, open wounds on
their legs,
no shoes.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was just chaos.

02:32.152 --> 02:37.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIE POWELL: This afternoon,
greater Manchester
Chief Constable Ian Hopkins
publicly identified

02:38.024 --> 02:40.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the attacker as a Briton of
Libyan descent.

02:40.593 --> 02:43.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN HOPKINS, Greater Manchester
Chief Constable:
I can confirm that the man
suspected of carrying

02:43.963 --> 02:48.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out last night's atrocity is
22-year-old Salman
Abedi.

02:48.601 --> 02:54.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIE POWELL: Hopkins also
confirmed police
raided two sites in Manchester
and arrested

02:54.240 --> 02:56.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a man in connection with the
attack.

02:56.376 --> 03:01.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN HOPKINS: Our priority, along
with the
police counterterrorist network
and our security

03:01.080 --> 03:07.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
partners, is to continue to
establish whether
he was acting alone or working
as part of

03:07.787 --> 03:09.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a wider network.

03:09.656 --> 03:13.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIE POWELL: The Islamic
State group claimed
responsibility today, in a
statement that

03:13.793 --> 03:18.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said: "One of the caliphate
soldiers managed
to plant an explosive device in
the middle

03:18.998 --> 03:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of a gathering of crusaders."

03:20.934 --> 03:25.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. intelligence officials
voiced doubts
about the claim.

03:25.471 --> 03:30.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In London, Prime Minister
Theresa May condemned
the attack, the deadliest in
Britain since

03:30.143 --> 03:32.011 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2005.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: All acts
of terrorism are cowardly
attacks on innocent

03:35.949 --> 03:44.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, but this attack stands
out for its
appalling, sickening cowardice,
deliberately

03:44.057 --> 03:49.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
targeting innocent, defenseless
children and
young people, who should have
been enjoying

03:49.696 --> 03:51.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the most memorable nights
of their
lives.

03:51.931 --> 03:57.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NATALIE POWELL: May also
announced that campaigning
for the upcoming June 8 election
has been

03:57.403 --> 03:59.172 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
suspended.

03:59.205 --> 04:02.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her opponent and leader of the
Labor Party,
Jeremy Corbyn, also denounced
the attacks.

04:02.609 --> 04:07.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEREMY CORBYN, Leader, Labor
Party: This is
an appalling act of violence
against people

04:07.780 --> 04:11.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it must be totally and
unreservedly and
completely condemned.

04:11.818 --> 04:18.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIE POWELL: Thousands of
people turned
out today for a vigil in
Manchester.

04:18.124 --> 04:24.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at Buckingham Palace in
London, Queen
Elizabeth II held a minute of
silence.

04:24.397 --> 04:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Condolences also came pouring in
from abroad.

04:27.533 --> 04:31.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump interrupted his
visit to Bethlehem
today to address the attack.

04:31.104 --> 04:36.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
We stand in absolute solidarity
with the people

04:36.209 --> 04:44.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the United Kingdom, so many
young, beautiful,
innocent people living and
enjoying their

04:44.050 --> 04:49.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lives murdered by evil losers in
life.

04:49.355 --> 04:53.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIE POWELL: Newly-elected
French President
Emmanuel Macron went to the
British Embassy

04:53.559 --> 04:57.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in Paris to express his
government's sympathy
and solidarity.

04:57.463 --> 05:01.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EMMANUEL MACRON, French
President (through
translator): What happened
yesterday in Manchester

05:01.868 --> 05:07.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
showed once again that
terrorists have a target,
the free world, youth, and that
we all have

05:07.940 --> 05:10.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a deep common destiny in this
regard.

05:10.276 --> 05:14.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NATALIE POWELL: Russian
President Vladimir
Putin sent his own message of
condolences

05:14.580 --> 05:19.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and said: "We strongly condemn
this cynical,
inhumane crime.

05:19.552 --> 05:24.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are certain its perpetrators
will not escape
the punishment they deserve."

05:24.657 --> 05:29.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Department of Homeland
Security says
there is no credible threat to
U.S. music

05:29.529 --> 05:31.331 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
venues.

05:31.364 --> 05:36.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it warns there may be
increased security
around public places and events
in the days

05:37.003 --> 05:38.805 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ahead.

05:38.838 --> 05:42.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And an increased police presence
is certainly
something that we have seen here
on the streets

05:42.408 --> 05:49.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Manchester, but it's also
likely to continue,
Hari, not just here in
Manchester, but across

05:49.349 --> 05:54.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.K., of course, with the
U.K. government
now increasing the terror threat
level to

05:54.787 --> 05:57.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
critical at its highest level.

05:57.056 --> 06:02.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Natalie, we
have just heard
a few of the details of a couple
of the victims

06:02.128 --> 06:03.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that have come out.

06:03.496 --> 06:06.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been so many victims
that have
been killed and injured.

06:06.132 --> 06:11.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As more news of this is made
public, what's
happening to the people on the
streets there?

06:11.204 --> 06:13.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATALIE POWELL: That's right.

06:13.840 --> 06:20.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now know, of course, that 22
people died
in this attack, 59 people were
injured.

06:20.413 --> 06:25.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among those fatalities, of
course, we, as
you have said, had the names of
a number of

06:25.985 --> 06:30.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them being released, and we are
expecting
more in the coming hours and
days.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A 20-year-old man was among
them.

06:32.525 --> 06:38.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first person to be released,
though, the
name, was an 18-year-old girl
Georgina Callander.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She was a student locally.

06:40.633 --> 06:46.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But perhaps most tragic of all,
Hari, is the
8-year-old girl, the youngest so
far to be

06:46.973 --> 06:49.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pronounced dead, Saffie Rose
Rousso.

06:49.642 --> 06:54.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, she was attending the
concert with her
mother and her sister.

06:54.414 --> 06:58.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were both taken to separate
hospitals
because of their injuries.

06:58.251 --> 07:03.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was only later, we
understand, that
they discovered of her death, of
course, an

07:03.723 --> 07:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
8-year-old girl, which really
goes to show
the tragedy here.

07:07.827 --> 07:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as we are expecting further
names and
certainly ages of these, we know
that a number

07:13.866 --> 07:18.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them were children that
perished in this
attack, are likely to come out
in the coming

07:18.037 --> 07:19.172 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
days.

07:19.205 --> 07:21.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, also, the
role of social
media.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ariana Grande has an enormous
social media
presence.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Social media is probably one of
the first
ways people found out about this
attack.

07:26.345 --> 07:29.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But there were also
opportunities for people
to help through it.

07:29.482 --> 07:32.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATALIE POWELL: Absolutely.

07:32.118 --> 07:37.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was an immediate response
really from Great
Manchester police putting out on
Twitter that

07:37.356 --> 07:39.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an incident had occurred.

07:39.258 --> 07:44.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But immediately after that,
interestingly,
people were tweeting the hashtag
#openManchester,

07:44.864 --> 07:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
telling people that were stuck
in the area
-- a lot of people, of course,
couldn't get

07:48.034 --> 07:52.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home and there was sheer panic
in this area
-- telling them to come into
their own homes

07:53.005 --> 07:54.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they would take care of
them.

07:54.774 --> 07:58.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was very much similar to what
we have seen
in Paris during the Bataclan and
the other

07:58.444 --> 08:03.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks that took place with the
#PorteOuverte
hashtag that trended, getting
people off the

08:03.382 --> 08:06.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
streets and into homes where
they could be
safe.

08:06.686 --> 08:11.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition to that, of course,
we have also
seen a huge movement to try to
find many of

08:11.958 --> 08:15.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the missing people using social
media, using
Twitter.

08:15.294 --> 08:20.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, we have seen a
solidarity
-- solidarity movement here as
well, with

08:20.233 --> 08:22.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the hashtag #peaceforManchester.

08:22.034 --> 08:25.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Natalie Powell
joining us from Manchester,
thank so much.

08:25.404 --> 08:31.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will return to the Manchester
attacks news
after the summary.

08:31.110 --> 08:36.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: There's
word President
Trump has retained Wall Street
lawyer Marc

08:36.482 --> 08:41.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kasowitz in the special counsel
investigation
of contacts between campaign
aides and the

08:41.621 --> 08:43.322 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Russians.

08:43.356 --> 08:47.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Several news organizations
report that here
-- Kasowitz has also represented
Mr. Trump

08:47.093 --> 08:48.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in other matters over the years.

08:48.895 --> 08:51.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's in the same law firm as
former Senator
Joe Lieberman, who is under
consideration

08:51.664 --> 08:53.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for FBI director.

08:53.633 --> 08:58.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The man who was running the CIA
last summer
says he warned Russia not to
interfere in

08:58.104 --> 09:00.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the U.S. presidential election.

09:00.106 --> 09:02.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Brennan testified today
before the House
Intelligence Committee.

09:03.009 --> 09:07.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he became very worried
about contacts
between the Russians and people
involved with

09:07.613 --> 09:08.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Trump campaign.

09:08.614 --> 09:11.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will have a full report later
in the program.

09:11.417 --> 09:16.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The head of the Defense
Intelligence Agency
warned today it is inevitable
North Korea

09:16.556 --> 09:21.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will develop a nuclear missile
that can reach
the U.S. mainland unless
something is done

09:21.527 --> 09:22.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to prevent it.

09:22.828 --> 09:25.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lieutenant General Vincent
Stewart spoke at
a Senate hearing.

09:25.731 --> 09:30.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, meanwhile, at a U.N.
conference in Geneva,
the U.S. traded barbs with the
North, also

09:30.903 --> 09:33.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
known as the Democratic People's
Republic
of Korea.

09:33.606 --> 09:39.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JU YONG CHOL, North Korean
Diplomat: The DPRK's
self-defensive measures to
protect its dignity

09:39.779 --> 09:45.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and vital rights and genuine
peace from the
United States' escalating
nuclear threat are

09:45.318 --> 09:49.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the legitimate rights of a
sovereign state,
and they are not against any
international

09:49.822 --> 09:51.657 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law.

09:51.691 --> 09:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT WOOD, U.S. Special
Representative to
the U.N. Conference on
Disarmament: The United

09:53.459 --> 09:56.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States, as I have said many
times before,
is not the threat to the DPRK's
regime is

09:56.929 --> 09:58.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the regime itself.

09:58.698 --> 10:01.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it needs to come into
compliance with
its international obligations,
and it needs

10:01.667 --> 10:03.436 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do it now.

10:03.469 --> 10:07.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also today,
South Korea's
military said it fired warning
shots at a

10:07.540 --> 10:12.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
possible drone aircraft that
flew from the
North and may have crossed the
border.

10:12.345 --> 10:16.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president of the
Philippines, Rodrigo
Duterte, declared martial law
today in the

10:16.649 --> 10:18.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
country's south.

10:18.484 --> 10:23.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It affects the island of
Mindanao, where Muslim
extremists linked to the Islamic
State group

10:23.289 --> 10:27.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have attacked Marawi, a city of
some 200,000.

10:27.059 --> 10:31.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fighting today killed at
least two soldiers,
a police officer and several
militants and

10:31.497 --> 10:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
continued into the night.

10:33.399 --> 10:37.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two U.S. astronauts aboard the
International
Space Station were forced to
make an unplanned

10:37.637 --> 10:40.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
space walk today for urgent
repairs.

10:40.306 --> 10:44.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Commander Peggy Whitson and
flight engineer
Jack Fischer replaced a broken
data relay

10:44.043 --> 10:49.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
box that operates the station's
radiators,
robotic equipment and solar
panels.

10:49.582 --> 10:54.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whitson now ties the record for
the most space
walks of any American at 10.

10:54.420 --> 10:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She also holds the U.S. record
for the most
accumulated time in space.

10:58.524 --> 11:03.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. government is accusing
Fiat Chrysler
of cheating on diesel emissions
tests, just

11:03.829 --> 11:05.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as Volkswagen did.

11:05.665 --> 11:10.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Justice Department filed
suit today, saying
the automaker used special
software on more

11:10.169 --> 11:13.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than 100,000 vehicles to get
around the tests.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The company denies wrongdoing.

11:16.008 --> 11:19.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wall Street, stocks managed
to climb for
the fourth straight session.

11:19.545 --> 11:23.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 43
points to close near 20938.

11:23.115 --> 11:27.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose five points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added four.

11:27.653 --> 11:31.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
British actor Sir Roger Moore,
who played
James Bond in seven films, has
died after

11:32.024 --> 11:33.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a fight with cancer.

11:33.859 --> 11:39.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He began as Bond in 1973, but
long after he
moved on, his celebrity status
aided him in

11:39.598 --> 11:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his stint as UNICEF goodwill
ambassador.

11:41.701 --> 11:47.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIR ROGER MOORE, Actor: Bond
certainly gives
you a financial security, a
notoriety.

11:47.606 --> 11:56.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I get media and press attention
because they
are curious to know why an
ex-James Bond is

11:56.582 --> 12:00.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of working for children,
which gets them
in.

12:00.386 --> 12:05.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want to talk about Bond,
but I can always
get the subject back onto the
children.

12:05.424 --> 12:09.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The actor also
had a hit
TV series, "The Saint," in the
1960s.

12:09.261 --> 12:11.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was knighted in 2003.

12:11.831 --> 12:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Roger Moore was 89 years old.

12:14.366 --> 12:18.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what the
Manchester attack means for the
global fight

12:18.104 --> 12:24.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against terrorism; more from the
former CIA
director's testimony in the
Russia investigation;

12:24.577 --> 12:34.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deep cuts to social programs in
President
Trump's proposed budget; and
much more.

12:34.620 --> 12:39.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deep cuts to social programs in
President
Trump's proposed budget; and
much more.

12:39.725 --> 12:43.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Manchester mourns and British
military
steps in to help with security,
we turn now

12:43.729 --> 12:47.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to what the attack says about
the capabilities
of terrorist groups.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For that, I'm joined by Michael
Leiter.

12:49.335 --> 12:54.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was the director of the
National Counterterrorism
Center from 2007 to 2011 during
both the George

12:54.240 --> 12:56.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
W. Bush and Obama
administrations.

12:56.575 --> 13:00.813 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
And Alexander
Meleagrou-Hitchens, research
director of the Program on
Extremism at the

13:00.846 --> 13:03.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
George Washington University.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael Leiter, I want to start
with you.

13:05.017 --> 13:09.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The British intelligence
agencies seem a little
concern that the name of the
bomber was leaked

13:09.688 --> 13:13.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by U.S. officials hours before
British authorities
made that public.

13:14.026 --> 13:15.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that significant?

13:15.728 --> 13:17.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL LEITER, Former Director,
National
Counterterrorism Center: I think
it is, Hari.

13:17.530 --> 13:22.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As an investigator, you really
don't want
to release information until you
have a purpose

13:22.968 --> 13:24.770 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in doing so.

13:24.804 --> 13:29.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as the British were clearly
investigating
other elements of this attack,
or at least

13:29.642 --> 13:35.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to determine whether
there were additional
people involved or potential
follow-on attacks,

13:35.047 --> 13:41.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it makes good sense that those
investigators
might want to keep that name
behind the green

13:41.453 --> 13:46.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
curtain until they found use in
disclosing
it.

13:46.458 --> 13:51.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's unfortunate that
information was
disclosed, but, unfortunately,
in this era

13:51.730 --> 13:56.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 24-hour news, keeping these
investigations
classified is obviously a
challenge on both

13:57.002 --> 13:58.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sides of the Atlantic.

13:58.904 --> 14:01.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Alexander
Meleagrou-Hitchens,
you have studied jihadist groups
in the U.K.

14:01.607 --> 14:02.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and elsewhere.

14:02.608 --> 14:04.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are you surprised by this?

14:04.243 --> 14:05.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEXANDER MELEAGROU-HITCHENS,
George Washington
University: Unfortunately not.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This kind of thing has been
coming for some
time.

14:07.947 --> 14:11.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I suppose the main surprise is
the scale of
it.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We also had the Westminster
attack just recently.

14:12.985 --> 14:15.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Only four or five were people
killed there.

14:15.621 --> 14:20.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we considered this to be
kind of what
to expect in the U.K., was not
in mainland

14:20.726 --> 14:22.494 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Europe.

14:22.528 --> 14:26.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The access to sort of criminal
networks wasn't
quite as easy as it was in
mainland Europe.

14:26.632 --> 14:29.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, unfortunately, the scale
is, I think,
the surprise.

14:29.602 --> 14:32.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that it's happened, not
at all, because,
unfortunately, we have been
making arrests

14:32.938 --> 14:35.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the U.K. for a long, long
time, stopping
plots like this repeatedly.

14:35.474 --> 14:37.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can't stop them all.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, Michael
Leiter, as
Alexander just mentioned, just
two months

14:40.179 --> 14:44.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago, there was a stabbing attack
that we all
witnessed -- or the aftermath
that we witnessed

14:44.483 --> 14:45.451 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on TV.

14:45.484 --> 14:46.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is there a pattern here?

14:46.485 --> 14:48.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It seems to have escalated from
that to this.

14:48.821 --> 14:53.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL LEITER: Well, I think
there is clearly
a pattern for ISIS throughout
Western Europe.

14:53.726 --> 14:59.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that pattern is quite
different from what
we saw in the late 2000s from
al-Qaida.

14:59.598 --> 15:05.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would really identify
three significant
changes for ISIS that are
manifesting themselves

15:05.137 --> 15:07.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
again in all of Western Europe
and the U.K.

15:07.673 --> 15:12.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, there's a pace and scale
of radicalization
that we really have not seen
before, largely

15:13.012 --> 15:14.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through the effective use of the
Internet.

15:14.780 --> 15:18.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second, the operational approach
of ISIS is
so very different.

15:18.384 --> 15:23.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rather than large-scale attacks,
they are
actively pursuing and pushing
people to stay

15:23.322 --> 15:25.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where they are and attack in
their homes.

15:25.824 --> 15:33.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, third, the volume is simply
overwhelming
for security services, whether
it's the MI5

15:33.732 --> 15:36.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the U.K. or the FBI here in
the United
States.

15:36.502 --> 15:41.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The volume of threats that they
have to face
is making their jobs very
difficult, and they

15:41.140 --> 15:45.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
simply can't stay on an
individual target
indefinitely.

15:45.844 --> 15:48.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that makes them make some
very difficult
choices.

15:48.414 --> 15:52.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, unfortunately, sometimes,
those choices
end up not being the right ones.

15:52.418 --> 15:56.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Alexander
Meleagrou-Hitchens,
if you had to do a word
association game with

15:56.221 --> 16:00.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the word Manchester, most U.S.
citizens would
probably say the football club.

16:00.259 --> 16:03.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did it get to be a hotbed
for terrorist
recruitment?

16:03.228 --> 16:07.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDER MELEAGROU-HITCHENS:
Well, the area
that it appears the attacker,
Abedi, came

16:07.633 --> 16:09.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from is part of Southern
Manchester.

16:09.601 --> 16:13.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is actually very near a
real hub of radicalization
in the U.K. called Moss Side.

16:13.605 --> 16:17.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's essentially an area, a sort
of deprived
area, a lot of gang activity.

16:17.676 --> 16:22.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we have seen is a sort
of morphing
of sort of a gang culture into a
jihadist

16:22.047 --> 16:23.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
culture, at least a fusing of
those two cultures.

16:23.849 --> 16:28.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, essentially, we have
actually seen
about 16 British individuals
involved in some

16:28.821 --> 16:33.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
form of terrorist activity for
I.S. coming
from pretty much a three-mile
radius.

16:33.759 --> 16:38.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, whether or not this is
relevant to the
current investigation into Abedi
is not yet

16:38.664 --> 16:43.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
clear, but I wouldn't be
surprised if we saw
that he was somehow influenced
by that wider

16:43.402 --> 16:45.170 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
network.

16:45.204 --> 16:48.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael
Leiter, today, the
prime minister escalated the
threat level

16:48.774 --> 16:49.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from severe to critical.

16:49.875 --> 16:52.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That means it had been severe
for so long.

16:52.411 --> 16:57.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, unfortunately, even in the
attacks around
in Paris, we saw one of the
attacks were outside

16:57.716 --> 16:58.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a football stadium.

16:58.717 --> 17:01.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are these sort of attacks almost
indefensible?

17:01.353 --> 17:05.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL LEITER: To some extent,
very regrettably,
they are.

17:05.958 --> 17:09.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Counterterrorism officials can
detect and
disrupt some plots.

17:09.628 --> 17:16.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, often, defenses can be used
to at least
minimize what sort of casualties
we have.

17:16.435 --> 17:21.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as we saw in this attack, as
we saw in
the attack in Turkey at the
airport, as we

17:21.640 --> 17:26.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saw in Brussels, the terrorists
know where
we have security measures,
whether that's

17:26.712 --> 17:30.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
airport screening or metal
detectors entering
the stadium.

17:30.616 --> 17:35.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's not all that difficult
to adjust
your tactics, so you can still
find large

17:35.754 --> 17:39.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
collections of individuals just
outside the
security perimeters.

17:39.224 --> 17:44.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can push the security
perimeters out
some, but, ultimately, we live
in open democratic

17:44.129 --> 17:47.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
societies that are not
constantly policed.

17:47.266 --> 17:53.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in that sense, there will
always be these
soft targets, and security can
only move us

17:53.405 --> 17:55.207 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so far.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of this is going to come
down to not
just intelligence and defense,
but engagement

17:58.644 --> 18:01.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in these communities where we do
have potential
hot spots for radicalization.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And,
Alexander, I want to
ask you about that engagement in
communities.

18:05.317 --> 18:09.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does this happen, that a
British citizen,
even he's from Libyan descent,
grows up there

18:09.455 --> 18:11.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eating fish and chips like
everybody else?

18:11.990 --> 18:14.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What lures him into this
ideology?

18:14.560 --> 18:19.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDER MELEAGROU-HITCHENS:
Well, one of
the sort of cliches, but it is
largely true,

18:19.064 --> 18:24.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about that question -- or the
answer to that
question is that every path to
radicalization

18:24.103 --> 18:25.804 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is unique.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everyone has unique experiences
that leads
them to this kind of action, but
there are

18:28.440 --> 18:30.342 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some overarching issues.

18:30.375 --> 18:31.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You mentioned he was a British
citizen.

18:31.844 --> 18:34.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's the son -- he's a
second-generation British.

18:34.980 --> 18:40.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is the most common
target for radicalizers,
because -- and recruiters,
because these guys,

18:40.052 --> 18:42.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
generally, they're growing up in
Britain.

18:42.588 --> 18:43.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have a different culture to
their parents.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't relate to their
parents.

18:45.524 --> 18:49.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They particularly don't relate
to their -- the
version of Islam their parents
ascribe to.

18:49.761 --> 18:53.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they are looking -- they go
out looking
for a version that speaks to
them, not culturally

18:53.732 --> 18:58.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
infused, say, in Libya or
Pakistan or Bangladesh,
one that speaks to them, one
that talks about

18:58.337 --> 19:00.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
geopolitics, one that involves
their day-to-day
experiences.

19:00.772 --> 19:06.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, jihadist
sort of ideology
and the jihadist version of
Islam can sometimes

19:06.178 --> 19:08.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look like the version these guys
are looking
for.

19:08.113 --> 19:09.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It speaks to their day-to-day
experiences.

19:09.915 --> 19:13.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens,
Michael Leiter, thank you both.

19:13.652 --> 19:20.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL LEITER: Thank you, Hari.

19:20.058 --> 19:25.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALEXANDER MELEAGROU-HITCHENS:
Thank you.

19:25.164 --> 19:31.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The issue of
Russian interference
in last year's election, and
what the Trump

19:31.203 --> 19:36.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign knew or didn't know
about it, was
front and center on Capitol Hill
again today.

19:36.608 --> 19:41.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Two of the nation's top
intelligence officials
and a former CIA director all
testified.

19:41.413 --> 19:44.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner has our report.

19:44.583 --> 19:49.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Top
intelligence chiefs,
past and present, were the
featured attractions

19:49.922 --> 19:52.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Capitol Hill today.

19:52.191 --> 19:57.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former CIA Director John Brennan
went spoke
at a House Intelligence
Committee hearing,

19:57.329 --> 20:01.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
part of its ongoing
investigation into how
Russia meddled in the U.S.
election.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN BRENNAN, Former CIA
Director: It should
be clear to everyone that Russia
brazenly

20:04.236 --> 20:09.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
interfered in our 2016
presidential election
process and that they undertook
these activities

20:09.708 --> 20:13.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
despite our strong protests and
explicit warning
that they not do so.

20:13.345 --> 20:17.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Separately, the
director
of national intelligence, Dan
Coats, spoke

20:17.649 --> 20:22.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at a Senate Armed Services
Committee on worldwide
threats.

20:22.221 --> 20:26.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His appearance coincided with a
Washington
Post reported that President
Trump had asked

20:26.858 --> 20:32.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coats and Admiral Mike Rogers,
head of the
National Security Agency, to --
quote -- "help

20:32.864 --> 20:39.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him push back against an FBI
investigation
into possible coordination
between his campaign

20:39.137 --> 20:41.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the Russian government."

20:41.273 --> 20:46.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Post says both men deemed
the request
inappropriate and refused to
comply.

20:46.178 --> 20:48.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Coats would not discuss the
matter today.

20:48.780 --> 20:53.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN COATS, U.S. National
Intelligence Director:
On this topic, as well as other
topics, I

20:53.218 --> 20:58.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't feel it's appropriate to
characterize
discussions and conversations
with the president.

20:58.190 --> 21:03.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: On the broader
issue of Russia's
foreign election activity, DNI
Coats said

21:03.428 --> 21:11.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's seen evidence of Moscow
meddling in campaigns
this year in France, Germany and
the U.K.

21:11.103 --> 21:15.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Discussing last year's U.S.
election, ex-CIA
Chief Brennan said he had
worried about the

21:15.941 --> 21:21.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contacts that U.S. intelligence
detected Russian
officials were having with Trump
associates.

21:21.680 --> 21:28.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: I encountered and
am aware of
information and intelligence
that revealed

21:28.420 --> 21:36.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contacts and interactions
between Russian
officials and U.S. persons
involved in the

21:37.029 --> 21:46.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump campaign that I was
concerned about
because of known Russian efforts
to suborn

21:46.204 --> 21:47.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
such individuals.

21:47.205 --> 21:48.473 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

21:48.507 --> 21:50.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TREY GOWDY (R), South Carolina:
It's a really
simple question.

21:50.475 --> 21:53.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Brennan was
pressed by Republican
Trey Gowdy of South Carolina on
whether actual

21:53.578 --> 21:55.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
collusion took place.

21:55.414 --> 22:00.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: I don't know
whether or not
such collusion -- and that's
your term -- such

22:00.952 --> 22:02.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
collusion existed.

22:02.721 --> 22:04.523 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

22:04.556 --> 22:09.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I know that there was a
sufficient basis
of information and intelligence
that required

22:09.528 --> 22:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
further investigation by the
bureau to determine
whether or not U.S. persons were
actively

22:15.534 --> 22:18.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conspiring, colluding with
Russian officials.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Brennan also
added an ominous
warning.

22:21.039 --> 22:24.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: The Russians are
watching very
carefully what's going on in
Washington right

22:24.343 --> 22:27.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now, and they will try to
exploit it for their
own purposes.

22:27.179 --> 22:31.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Late last year,
the Obama
administration ordered sanctions
on Russian

22:31.783 --> 22:35.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spy agencies over the election
meddling.

22:35.153 --> 22:41.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two Russian compounds outside
Washington were
closed, and 35 diplomats were
expelled.

22:41.259 --> 22:46.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post reported
that then Trump
adviser Michael Flynn urged the
Russian ambassador

22:46.965 --> 22:48.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not to overreact.

22:48.767 --> 22:55.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, Russian President
Vladimir Putin
said Moscow wouldn't retaliate,
a move Mr.

22:55.173 --> 22:56.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump hailed.

22:56.942 --> 23:02.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in a tweet today, the
Russian Embassy,
unless its diplomatic property
is returned,

23:02.748 --> 23:05.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia will -- quote -- "have to
take countermeasures."

23:05.550 --> 23:11.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, questions continue
about the president's
reported sharing of classified
information

23:11.189 --> 23:16.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Russian diplomats in the
Oval Office
meeting two weeks ago.

23:16.261 --> 23:20.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dan Coats said today he has not
discussed
the issue with the president.

23:20.499 --> 23:26.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Brennan said, if such
information is to be
shared, it's typically done
through intelligence

23:26.238 --> 23:29.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
channels, not spontaneously to
visiting officials.

23:30.008 --> 23:34.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For its part, the White House
said today's
hearings prove -- quote --
"There is still

23:34.246 --> 23:38.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no evidence of any Russia-Trump
campaign collusion."

23:38.517 --> 23:44.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

23:44.089 --> 23:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

23:54.566 --> 23:59.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
look ahead
to President Trump's visit with
the pope;

23:59.738 --> 24:03.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and shifting education dollars
to school choice.

24:03.775 --> 24:07.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: While President Trump
continues
his trip abroad, here in
Washington, the White

24:07.813 --> 24:11.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House was busy unveiling the
administration's
first budget.

24:11.683 --> 24:13.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Our Lisa Desjardins has more.

24:13.685 --> 24:19.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Delivered this
morning, this
is the first full proposal from
President

24:19.157 --> 24:26.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump to Congress: a $4.1
trillion budget
plan the White House says puts
taxpayers first.

24:26.364 --> 24:33.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also puts the budget in
balance in 10 years,
without touching Social Security
retirement

24:33.205 --> 24:34.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
funds or Medicare.

24:35.006 --> 24:37.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY, White House
Budget Director:
They are all, all campaign
promises that the

24:37.876 --> 24:40.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president made while he was
running for office.

24:40.212 --> 24:44.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why I say these numbers
are simply
the president's policies put
onto paper.

24:44.616 --> 24:50.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The president
also promised
to not cut Medicaid, the health
program largely

24:50.055 --> 24:51.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the poor.

24:51.957 --> 24:58.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But this budget would
dramatically cut the
growth in Medicaid spending by
some $610 billion.

24:58.997 --> 25:04.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's on top of the $800
billion reduction
in the GOP's American Health
Care Act.

25:04.469 --> 25:10.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would also cut $192 billion
from SNAP,
also known as food stamps, and
ask states

25:10.575 --> 25:12.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to pay more for that program.

25:12.911 --> 25:18.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it would mean $72 billion
less for Social
Security disability insurance.

25:18.416 --> 25:23.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House believes there
is wide abuse
of such programs by people who
should be supporting

25:23.255 --> 25:24.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
themselves and the economy.

25:24.990 --> 25:30.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: We are not
kicking anybody
off of any program who really
needs it.

25:30.195 --> 25:34.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's not -- we have plenty of
money in this
country to take care of the
people who need

25:34.633 --> 25:36.034 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
help, OK?

25:36.067 --> 25:37.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we will do that.

25:37.836 --> 25:41.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't have enough money to
take care of
people, everybody, who doesn't
need help.

25:41.106 --> 25:43.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Democrats see
it very differently.

25:43.341 --> 25:45.210 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

25:45.243 --> 25:49.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS (I), Vermont:
This is a budget
that is immoral, and that will
cause an enormous

25:49.447 --> 25:54.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
amount of pain for the most
vulnerable people
in our nation.

25:54.286 --> 26:01.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a budget that will be
rejected by
the American people and must not
see the light

26:01.192 --> 26:03.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of day here in Congress.

26:03.328 --> 26:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The Trump
budget also would
dramatically shift other
spending, too.

26:08.199 --> 26:13.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Currently, defense programs and
non-defense
programs are nearly even in
spending.

26:13.505 --> 26:19.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Next year, the Trump budget
would boost the
military spending 10 percent, by
$54 billion,

26:19.911 --> 26:23.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it would cut $54 billion
from non-defense.

26:23.682 --> 26:28.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House points that it
would use the
savings for things like $19
billion for a

26:28.520 --> 26:31.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
new paid parental leave program.

26:31.089 --> 26:35.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Republicans in Congress,
who ultimately
control the spending, thanked
the president,

26:36.027 --> 26:37.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but didn't endorse his plan.

26:37.529 --> 26:39.331 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

26:39.364 --> 26:39.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: Well,
look, the president's budget, as
we all know,

26:39.898 --> 26:42.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a recommendation.

26:42.100 --> 26:46.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every president since I have
been here -- and
that covers a good period of
time -- has made

26:46.271 --> 26:51.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a recommendation, and then we
decide what
we're going to do with those
recommendations.

26:51.309 --> 26:56.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: A
recommendation that is
this president's fullest
expression yet of

26:56.214 --> 26:58.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how he wants the government to
change.

26:58.984 --> 27:01.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

27:01.119 --> 27:05.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's no
doubt that this
budget proposal is the sharpest
departure

27:05.824 --> 27:08.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with past plans in at least a
generation.

27:08.760 --> 27:12.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We look at the potential
impacts, and the
reasoning behind it, with Jared
Bernstein.

27:12.163 --> 27:14.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is an economist who served in
the Obama
administration.

27:14.566 --> 27:18.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now a fellow at the Center
on Budget
and Policy Priorities.

27:18.203 --> 27:21.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Chris Edwards, he is a
budget expert at
the Cato Institute, a
libertarian research

27:21.906 --> 27:23.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
organization here in Washington.

27:23.241 --> 27:24.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jared, let me start with you.

27:24.709 --> 27:26.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In your opinion, what's wrong
with this budget?

27:26.511 --> 27:28.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN, Former Chief
Economist to
Vice President Joe Biden: This
is a budget

27:28.246 --> 27:32.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that solves the following
problem that seems
to really be vexing Republicans,
which is

27:33.018 --> 27:37.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that poor people have too much
in this country,
and rich people don't have
enough.

27:37.188 --> 27:41.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you simply look out at
the landscape
of American inequality, of the
kinds of wage

27:41.426 --> 27:47.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and income stagnation that the
poor face,
and the very effective
anti-poverty programs

27:47.932 --> 27:53.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have helped to kind of push
back against
those market inequalities, this
is a budget

27:53.304 --> 27:56.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that goes just in the wrong
direction at 100
miles an hour.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Chris Edwards?

27:58.710 --> 28:00.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS EDWARDS, Director of Tax
Policy Studies,
Cato Institute: Yes, I think
there is a lot

28:00.378 --> 28:01.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I like about the budget.

28:01.579 --> 28:04.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For one thing, it takes the
deficit problem
seriously.

28:04.082 --> 28:05.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have a $600 billion deficit.

28:06.017 --> 28:09.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's rising to a trillion in a
number of years
if we don't do anything about
it.

28:09.421 --> 28:13.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The federal debt doubled under
the last president.

28:13.258 --> 28:14.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump is doing something serious
about that.

28:14.893 --> 28:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's putting his spending cuts
that he wants
to see on the table.

28:18.730 --> 28:22.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He would reduce the deficit to
zero over 10
years.

28:22.100 --> 28:26.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if Republicans and Democrats
on Capitol
Hill -- they should take the
deficit seriously

28:26.871 --> 28:29.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
too, and they should propose
their own plans
to deal with it.

28:29.307 --> 28:34.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: So, if you
believe the accounting
in this budget, as Chris has
just recounted,

28:34.245 --> 28:38.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have got a bridge to sell you
in New York.

28:38.083 --> 28:42.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Here's probably the most
egregious part of
the phony accounting in here.

28:42.654 --> 28:47.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The budget will cut taxes,
again, for the
wealthy, remember, transferring
low-income

28:47.759 --> 28:52.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
programs to wealthy people, to
the tune of
trillions of dollars, but it
doesn't count

28:52.797 --> 28:56.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the revenue losses in its budget
accounting.

28:56.167 --> 29:00.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, somehow, magically, those
bucks just appear.

29:00.605 --> 29:04.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, there's a phony assumption
of a growth
rate of 3 percent.

29:04.642 --> 29:07.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The trend growth rate in the
economy is 2
percent.

29:07.679 --> 29:11.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you pretend you're going to
get 3 percent,
you can get $2 trillion more
revenue, but

29:11.382 --> 29:14.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no credible economist believes
that fairy
dust.

29:14.319 --> 29:16.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Go ahead.

29:16.087 --> 29:18.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS EDWARDS: I agree that
there is some
smoke and mirrors in this
budget, as there

29:18.656 --> 29:21.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
usually is in presidential
budgets.

29:21.059 --> 29:23.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is a lot of serious
policy issues
being pushed here.

29:23.762 --> 29:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is the idea of federalism,
to move more
of the costs of Medicaid and
food stamps and

29:29.234 --> 29:31.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some other programs back to the
states.

29:31.669 --> 29:35.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, for example, if
New York wants
a bigger Medicaid or food stamp
program, they

29:35.640 --> 29:36.775 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can do that.

29:36.808 --> 29:39.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Texas wants a smaller one,
they can fund
that.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's a serious policy
issue we ought
to be discussing.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Chris, you're
absolutely
right that every president comes
out with

29:44.549 --> 29:46.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their optimistic vision for it.

29:46.351 --> 29:50.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I think a lot of the
concerns, even from
conservatives, today is that
this 3 percent

29:50.421 --> 29:54.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number seems incredibly not just
optimistic,
but almost fantastic.

29:54.192 --> 29:59.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we have got President
Reagan's budget
director saying it would require
206 months

29:59.597 --> 30:02.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of no recession, which has never
seen in U.S.
history.

30:02.967 --> 30:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got the Committee for a
Responsible
Federal Budget, who are not
liberals, by any

30:07.639 --> 30:08.606 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stretch.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're fairly hawkish of the
budget.

30:10.508 --> 30:13.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have called this extremely
unrealistic
and they have said it's a
combination of -- it

30:13.311 --> 30:15.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
needs a combination of good
policy and good
luck.

30:15.513 --> 30:19.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS EDWARDS: I agree the 3
percent growth
number is pretty aggressive.

30:19.050 --> 30:24.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the president has since the
day he's been
in office been cutting
regulations and he's

30:24.422 --> 30:28.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pushing a major tax reform plan
that would
boost growth in the economy.

30:28.259 --> 30:33.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No one knows exactly how much, I
think, additionally
the economy will grow if we make
the economy

30:33.865 --> 30:35.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more efficient.

30:35.433 --> 30:37.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I'm glad he's pushing in
that direction.

30:37.802 --> 30:41.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, you know, it's a good
start.

30:41.039 --> 30:42.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are serious reforms here.

30:42.907 --> 30:46.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: So, that's the
trickle-down,
kind of fairy dust story that
conservatives

30:46.945 --> 30:50.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been trying to tell for
decades now,
and it's never worked.

30:50.481 --> 30:53.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It shouldn't be put forth as,
here's an experiment
we're going to try to see what
happens.

30:53.852 --> 30:58.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, in real time, this
is being
tried in Kansas, where they kind
of bought

30:58.289 --> 31:01.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this trickle-down stuff, cut a
bunch of taxes.

31:01.459 --> 31:06.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're -- not only are they
having lousy
economic outcomes, but their
budget is doing

31:06.698 --> 31:09.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terribly, and they're having to
cut all kinds
of vital services.

31:09.968 --> 31:13.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's where I take so much
issue with
this budget.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our low-income programs are
effective, efficient.

31:16.507 --> 31:20.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're pushing back on poverty
of our most
vulnerable people.

31:20.178 --> 31:23.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is kind of an ain't broke,
don't fix
it moment for those things.

31:23.114 --> 31:28.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But instead of accepting that,
the budget
takes over $3 trillion away from
these programs

31:28.987 --> 31:33.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and gives it to the wealthy in
regressive
tax cuts, which, frankly, they
don't need.

31:33.191 --> 31:37.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS EDWARDS: I won't say that
-- that's
not right, that they're --
they're proposing

31:37.228 --> 31:40.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a budget-neutral, a
deficit-neutral tax reform
plan.

31:40.698 --> 31:43.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They haven't specified it yet,
but that's
what they're aiming for.

31:43.268 --> 31:46.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's not like they're doing
these cuts,
and it's going to wealthy people
at all.

31:46.771 --> 31:50.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of the cuts, they're
saying states should
make up the difference if they
want.

31:50.441 --> 31:54.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to say that the tax cut idea
is a wild
one is not true.

31:54.812 --> 31:57.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The centerpiece is a corporate
tax cut.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama favored a
corporate tax cut.

31:59.183 --> 32:00.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't get around to doing
it.

32:01.019 --> 32:02.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump is putting that front and
center.

32:02.954 --> 32:06.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: So, let me make
a quick proposal
here.

32:06.324 --> 32:10.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chris just said that this is
going to be a
revenue-neutral plan.

32:10.662 --> 32:14.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the way the Bush --
that's the way
the Trump team scores it.

32:14.065 --> 32:16.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we know that's phony
accounting.

32:16.034 --> 32:21.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I say we come back here after
there's an official
score by the CBO, by the JCT,
the groups that

32:21.572 --> 32:25.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
score this without a thumb on
the scale, and
it's going to show seas of red
ink.

32:25.743 --> 32:28.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I would really like to put
your foot to
the fire on that.

32:28.746 --> 32:30.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, when you
look at the
budget, now, let's say you look
up food stamps,

32:31.015 --> 32:32.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the SNAP program, and it says --
there's a
quote there.

32:33.017 --> 32:37.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It says "close eligibility
loopholes, target
benefits to the neediest
households, and require

32:37.522 --> 32:39.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
able-bodied adults to work."

32:39.390 --> 32:40.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That sounds fair enough.

32:40.591 --> 32:42.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's wrong with that?

32:42.393 --> 32:44.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: Well, first of
all, there
already are work requirements
within the food

32:45.029 --> 32:46.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stamp, or SNAP, program.

32:46.764 --> 32:53.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, almost 90 percent
of people
on SNAP who are able-bodied and
have kids

32:53.771 --> 32:56.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are connected to the job market,
are working
or trying to work.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think it's a non-solution
to a non-problem.

32:59.510 --> 33:05.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, this is a program that
provides nutritional
support -- $1.40 per person per
meal, that

33:05.516 --> 33:07.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is what SNAP affords you.

33:07.318 --> 33:09.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, if you want to look out at
America and
say, boy, that's the problem
that is holding

33:09.854 --> 33:14.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us back, and so we have to cut
that to give
reach people more tax cuts, you
and I have

33:14.092 --> 33:15.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a lot to argue about it.

33:15.693 --> 33:18.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Chris, what
about the underlying
demographic shift, right?

33:18.930 --> 33:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, millennials are just not
replacing
the number of baby boomers that
are retiring.

33:22.900 --> 33:27.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How are you ever going to have
labor force
at the levels in the '90s that
it requires

33:27.905 --> 33:32.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to increase the productivity and
get us back
to the sort of optimistic vision
this budget

33:32.076 --> 33:33.044 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lays out?

33:33.077 --> 33:34.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS EDWARDS: I agree that's a
big problem.

33:34.145 --> 33:35.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think the budgets helps
tackle that.

33:35.980 --> 33:40.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for example, with a lot of
the welfare
reforms, the budget director,
Mulvaney wants

33:40.318 --> 33:42.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- he's saying he wants to get
people back
in the work force.

33:42.720 --> 33:46.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a good example here is the
Social Security
disability insurance program.

33:46.858 --> 33:51.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The program, they are going to
be doing a
lot of reforms to try to urge
people back

33:51.829 --> 33:53.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into the work force.

33:53.598 --> 33:58.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are probably millions of
people who
have moderate disabilities who
can and want

33:58.069 --> 34:04.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be back in the work force,
but the current
disability program
disincentivizes them.

34:04.075 --> 34:06.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It encourages them to stay out
of the work
force.

34:06.611 --> 34:10.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, if we can make some
of these
reforms, get people back to the
work force,

34:10.782 --> 34:11.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that would boost growth.

34:11.783 --> 34:12.750 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

34:12.784 --> 34:13.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I'm sorry.

34:13.785 --> 34:14.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Unfortunately, we're out of
time.

34:14.886 --> 34:20.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chris Edwards, Jared Bernstein,
thank you
both.

34:21.025 --> 34:25.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRIS EDWARDS: Thank you.

34:25.229 --> 34:29.434 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: Thank you.

34:29.467 --> 34:34.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The president
continued
his lengthy overseas trip today,
ending his

34:34.539 --> 34:38.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stay in Israel and a visit to
the West Bank.

34:38.076 --> 34:41.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the end of four days in
the Middle
East, after a packed schedule
that included

34:41.512 --> 34:44.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
summits, elaborate dinners, and
high-stakes
meetings.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

34:46.117 --> 34:51.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Trump
crossed the imposing
security wall separating Israel
and the West

34:51.289 --> 34:57.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bank to meet with Palestinian
leader Mahmoud
Abbas in Bethlehem, part of Mr.
Trump's quest

34:57.495 --> 35:01.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to jump-start long-dormant
Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.

35:01.566 --> 35:04.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I intend to do everything I can
to help them

35:04.769 --> 35:06.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
achieve that goal.

35:06.571 --> 35:12.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Abbas assures me he is
ready to
work toward that goal in good
faith, and Prime

35:12.643 --> 35:17.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Minister Netanyahu has promised
the same.

35:17.315 --> 35:23.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Abbas outlined what's
called the
two-state solution, a
Palestinian homeland

35:23.521 --> 35:29.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the territory that Israel
seized 50 years
ago in the Six-Day War.

35:29.093 --> 35:33.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAHMOUD ABBAS, Palestinian
Authority President
(through translator): Our
fundamental problem

35:33.331 --> 35:37.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is with the occupation and
settlements, and
failure of Israel to recognize
the state of

35:37.435 --> 35:39.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Palestine, in the same way we
recognize it.

35:39.737 --> 35:43.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It undermines the realization of
a two-state
solution.

35:43.374 --> 35:45.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The problem is not between us
and Judaism.

35:45.543 --> 35:47.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's between us and occupation.

35:47.478 --> 35:52.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Later, speaking in
Jerusalem, Mr.
Trump acknowledged there would
be hurdles.

35:52.683 --> 35:56.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Both sides will
face tough decisions.

35:56.254 --> 36:02.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But with determination,
compromise and the
belief that peace is possible,
Israelis and

36:02.960 --> 36:05.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Palestinians can make a deal.

36:05.530 --> 36:08.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Missing from Mr.
Trump's comments?

36:08.266 --> 36:13.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An explicit endorsement of a
two-state solution,
which has been U.S. policy for
more than a

36:13.204 --> 36:15.106 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
quarter-century.

36:15.139 --> 36:18.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Daniel Estrin is Jerusalem
correspondent for
NPR News.

36:18.442 --> 36:23.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL ESTRIN, NPR: He spoke a
lot about peace,
but he was very short on
specifics.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was very emblematic of
his whole
trip here.

36:26.484 --> 36:31.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't want to wade into any
thorny issues.

36:31.389 --> 36:33.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't talk about a two-state
solution.

36:33.991 --> 36:37.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He didn't talk about Israeli
assessments in
the West Bank, where
Palestinians want to

36:37.929 --> 36:40.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
build a Palestinian state.

36:40.064 --> 36:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't talk about the U.S.
Embassy.

36:42.233 --> 36:45.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This trip was much more about
smiles.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was much more about
relationship-building.

36:47.171 --> 36:52.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Do you see much
reason for optimism
that President Trump is going to
get these

36:52.510 --> 36:54.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talks, this peace process going
again?

36:54.679 --> 36:56.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANIEL ESTRIN: Clinton tried.

36:56.847 --> 36:57.815 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bush tried.

36:57.848 --> 36:59.016 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Obama tried.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They all failed at bringing
peace.

37:00.885 --> 37:05.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so many people I spoke to
here, Israelis
and Palestinians, said, why
should Trump be

37:05.556 --> 37:07.391 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
any different?

37:07.425 --> 37:12.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I even met a Palestinian woman
yesterday who
said she read Trump's book "How
to Get Rich."

37:12.363 --> 37:18.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She admired Trump's business
success, but
she said, that doesn't translate
into making

37:18.102 --> 37:20.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
someone a peacemaker.

37:20.037 --> 37:25.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, while there is that
cynicism, there are
also people on both sides who
think that actually

37:25.476 --> 37:29.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump perhaps might be the one
to seal the
deal.

37:29.347 --> 37:33.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: On the last day of
his Israel stop,
Mr. Trump visited Yad Vashem,
the nation's

37:33.884 --> 37:35.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Holocaust memorial.

37:35.686 --> 37:41.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Words can never
describe the
bottomless depths of that evil
or the scope

37:41.092 --> 37:44.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the anguish and destruction.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was history's darkest hour.

37:46.897 --> 37:52.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He signed the guest
book: "It is
a great honor to be here with
all of my friends.

37:52.203 --> 37:56.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So amazing, and will never
forget."

37:56.741 --> 38:02.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump's whirlwind tour of
one of the Middle
East's most intractable problems
ended with

38:02.113 --> 38:03.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a departure ceremony.

38:03.748 --> 38:08.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, the president is in
Rome, where,
tomorrow, he is to meet Pope
Francis.

38:08.719 --> 38:11.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

38:11.656 --> 38:15.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As John just
reported, the
president landed this evening in
Rome, ahead

38:15.293 --> 38:17.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of an audience tomorrow morning
with Pope
Francis.

38:17.695 --> 38:20.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Though it is the first meeting
between the
leaders, they are quite familiar
with each

38:20.965 --> 38:24.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other's opposing views on some
major global
issues.

38:24.435 --> 38:27.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant is in
Rome for us, and sent us this
preview.

38:27.905 --> 38:32.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: After the
Manchester bomb
attack, Italy's security status
remains the

38:32.710 --> 38:34.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
same, on high alert.

38:34.612 --> 38:39.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Vatican is always
well-protected, but
it's locked down tighter than
usual for the

38:39.317 --> 38:45.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
duration of President Trump's
meeting with
the leader of the world's 1.2
billion Catholics.

38:45.589 --> 38:49.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite the gulf separating them
in terms
of personality and policies,
Pope Francis

38:49.994 --> 38:51.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
insists he has an open mind.

38:51.829 --> 38:56.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through
translator): I never make a
judgment about

38:56.934 --> 38:58.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a person without listening to
them.

I don't think I should do that.

MALCOLM BRABANT: Massimo Franco,
a Vatican
expert with Italy's most
respected newspaper,

39:05.943 --> 39:09.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says that President Trump
instigated the meeting
and has the most to gain.

39:09.413 --> 39:12.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MASSIMO FRANCO, Corriere della
Sera: This
meeting is more important for
Trump than for

39:12.516 --> 39:20.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the pope, because Trump
presently is very
weak internally, so he needs a
more international

39:20.291 --> 39:22.093 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reach.

39:22.126 --> 39:24.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: International
relations specialist
Professor Irene Caratelli goes
further.

39:24.729 --> 39:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IRENE CARATELLI, International
Relations Specialist:
It's about legitimacy, so he's
looking for

39:29.567 --> 39:31.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a sort of blessing from the
pope.

39:31.869 --> 39:36.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wants to be recognized by all
the different
figures of the world.

39:36.540 --> 39:40.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But Father John
Wauck, an
American speechwriter before he
was ordained,

39:40.845 --> 39:41.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
says there's a mutual benefit.

39:43.614 --> 39:45.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN WAUCK, Catholic Church: The
Catholic
Church is always interested in
its relations

39:45.416 --> 39:49.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the United States, given
the importance
of the U.S. on the international
political

39:49.720 --> 39:55.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scene, largely because there's
an enormous
number of issues in which the
Catholic Church

39:55.059 --> 39:56.861 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can cooperate.

39:56.894 --> 40:00.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But one
potential stumbling
block is the history of sharp
criticism over

40:00.831 --> 40:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a major Trump election pledge.

40:02.666 --> 40:08.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We must restore
integrity and
the rule of law at our borders.

40:08.339 --> 40:10.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

40:10.207 --> 40:16.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: For that reason,
we will soon
begin the construction of a
great, great wall

40:16.580 --> 40:18.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
along our southern border.

40:20.718 --> 40:26.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
POPE FRANCIS (through
translator): A person
who thinks only about building
walls, wherever

40:26.190 --> 40:29.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they may be, and not building
bridges is not
Christian.

40:29.927 --> 40:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: For a religious
leader to question
a person's faith is disgraceful.

MALCOLM BRABANT: This biography
of Pope Francis
by veteran Vatican correspondent
David Willey

40:40.371 --> 40:45.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
portrays the pontiff as a frugal
man who abstains
from the luxurious trappings of
office and

40:45.910 --> 40:49.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tries to maintain contact with
the poor, especially
refugees.

40:49.580 --> 40:54.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, after visiting the
Greek island
of Lesbos, he brought three
Syrian families

40:54.618 --> 40:56.487 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
back to Rome.

40:56.520 --> 40:59.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WILLEY, Author, "The
Promise of Francis":
The pope is very concerned with
the situation

40:59.156 --> 41:01.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of refugees all over the world.

41:01.292 --> 41:06.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think the pope will
hesitate to say
exactly what he thinks about
controversial

41:06.797 --> 41:15.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
subjects, particularly about,
for example,
President Trump's plan to deport
many hundreds

41:15.940 --> 41:19.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of thousands, if not millions of
illegal migrants
in the United States.

41:19.710 --> 41:23.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Today, at the
Vatican, the
pope condemned the barbarity of
the terrorist

41:23.714 --> 41:25.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bomb in Manchester.

41:25.349 --> 41:27.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The attack may affect the issues
under discussion.

41:27.952 --> 41:33.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MASSIMO FRANCO: Trump and the
pope are against
terrorism, of course, but I
think that the

41:33.557 --> 41:40.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approach of the pope is more on
the causes,
on the source of Islamic
terrorism.

41:41.031 --> 41:47.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The pope tends to say that it is
not Islamic
terrorism, but it is terrorists
motivated

41:48.005 --> 41:50.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
falsely with religious reasons.

41:50.741 --> 41:52.610 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REV.

41:52.643 --> 41:55.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN WAUCK: Donald Trump's
statements recently
in Saudi Arabia, I think, made
him sound quite

41:55.546 --> 42:01.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a bit more like the pope, in
other words,
emphasizing that this is not a
battle between

42:01.285 --> 42:05.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one religion and another, and
stressing the
need for peace and all.

42:05.122 --> 42:07.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think there's going to be
some common
ground there.

42:07.191 --> 42:10.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, there will be common
ground on
things like human trafficking,
maybe less

42:10.661 --> 42:14.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so on the questions of climate
change, if
that comes up.

42:14.298 --> 42:19.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: According to
veteran Vatican
watchers, one of the key factors
in determining

42:19.036 --> 42:23.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether or not this meeting has
been a success
will be its duration.

42:23.574 --> 42:28.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the meeting ends after about
15 minutes
or so, that will be a bad sign,
because, they

42:28.312 --> 42:32.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say, it will suggest that Pope
Francis has
cut the meeting short.

42:32.750 --> 42:36.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the experts believe there
are strong reasons
to lay foundations for the
future.

42:36.220 --> 42:41.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IRENE CARATELLI: I think that
Pope Francis
is going to meet President
Trump, knowing

42:41.825 --> 42:45.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he has the possibility to
influence someone
who can change history.

42:45.362 --> 42:51.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WILLEY: I think that both
of them are
canny people who realize the
advantages of

42:51.502 --> 42:56.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a face-to-face meeting and will
-- both of
them will be absolutely
fascinated to see

42:56.974 --> 42:58.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
each other in the flesh for the
first time.

42:58.976 --> 43:02.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Most experts
doubt that President
Trump will change his views
substantially

43:02.980 --> 43:07.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Rome, but they think at least
the two men
will have a new understanding of
each other.

43:07.318 --> 43:13.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Rome.

43:13.290 --> 43:23.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As we
discussed before,
the Trump administration's
budget proposes

43:23.400 --> 43:26.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
major cuts to a number of
federal agencies
and initiatives.

43:26.770 --> 43:31.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We wanted to take a deeper look
at the proposed
cuts with regards to education
and a push

43:31.842 --> 43:35.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for expanding school choice with
some of those
dollars.

43:35.412 --> 43:39.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that story,
which is
part of our weekly series Making
the Grade.

43:39.049 --> 43:44.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
administration's budget
proposes roughly $9 billion in
cuts to various

43:44.121 --> 43:46.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
federal education programs.

43:46.090 --> 43:48.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's about a 13 percent
reduction.

43:48.359 --> 43:52.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A billion from those cuts would
be rerouted
to advance school choice, where
parents can

43:52.730 --> 43:56.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take public school funds and
spend it on any
school they choose.

43:56.600 --> 43:59.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary of Education of Betsy
DeVos praised
that idea in a speech yesterday.

43:59.870 --> 44:03.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETSY DEVOS, U.S. Education
Secretary: We
must offer the widest number of
quality options

44:03.941 --> 44:07.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to every family and every child.

44:07.911 --> 44:13.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Empowering parents with choices
is how to
give students second, third or
fourth chances

44:13.450 --> 44:16.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before it's too late.

44:16.153 --> 44:20.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Even the most expensive,
state-of-the-art,
high-performing school will not
be the perfect

44:20.391 --> 44:23.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fit for every single child.

44:23.527 --> 44:28.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parents know or they can figure
out what learning
environment is best for their
child.

44:28.766 --> 44:32.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For more on
what this all
means for students nationwide,
I'm joined

44:32.603 --> 44:34.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
now by Anya Kamenetz.

44:34.538 --> 44:39.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's an education reporter for
NPR and the
author of several books on the
future of education.

44:39.710 --> 44:42.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Anya, welcome to the "NewsHour."

44:42.312 --> 44:46.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's talk about -- before we
get to the broader
issue of the budget, let's talk
about school

44:46.050 --> 44:47.951 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
choice.

44:47.985 --> 44:51.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has obviously been a huge
issue for Secretary
DeVos, one that she has
championed for many,

44:51.388 --> 44:53.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
many years.

44:53.223 --> 44:57.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remind us what school choice
means and what
this budget does with regard to
school choice.

44:57.528 --> 45:01.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANYA KAMENETZ, NPR: So, school
choice is a
catch-all term.

45:01.165 --> 45:07.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It can mean sending students to
charter schools,
which are alternative public
schools, or using

45:07.604 --> 45:12.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vouchers to send them to private
schools,
or even using vouchers for
homeschooling or

45:12.476 --> 45:14.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
online and virtual schools.

45:14.278 --> 45:18.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all of those are embraced by
Secretary
DeVos.

45:18.682 --> 45:23.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The budget proposal that we're
seeing promotes
choice in a lot of different
ways.

45:23.687 --> 45:28.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there's more money in it for
states to
expand charter programs.

45:28.192 --> 45:34.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is money for states that
want to give
poor students open enrollment
and the chances

45:34.832 --> 45:39.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to leave their low-performing
schools for
other schools within the
district, as well

45:39.269 --> 45:43.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as money for voucher programs,
which, again,
promote private schools.

45:43.373 --> 45:47.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And school
choice obviously
is a very controversial topic.

45:47.444 --> 45:52.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Critics of it think of it as a
way of draining
money away from public schools
and putting

45:52.049 --> 45:56.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them into private or religious
schools.

45:56.153 --> 45:59.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does the data tell us on
how good these
schools are?

46:00.023 --> 46:01.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does school choice do for
kids?

46:02.025 --> 46:05.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANYA KAMENETZ: Well, as you
mentioned, this
is a really contentious issue,
and there is

46:05.929 --> 46:07.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kind of a moving target.

46:07.531 --> 46:10.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of different
arguments for,
against and around school
choice.

46:10.901 --> 46:15.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, recently, in looking at the
research,
I think one thing that we can
say is that

46:15.506 --> 46:18.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there do seem to be positive
competition effects.

46:18.108 --> 46:23.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In other words, public schools
perk up when
there's a new sheriff in town.

46:23.480 --> 46:28.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, when you talk
about students,
especially poor students,
leaving their schools

46:28.185 --> 46:32.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and going out to schools of
choice, charter
schools, private schools, there
is controversy

46:32.422 --> 46:33.423 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

46:33.457 --> 46:35.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In some cases, they may do a
little bit better.

46:35.826 --> 46:37.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In other cases, in fact, they do
worse.

46:37.961 --> 46:43.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of the most recent
studies on voucher
programs in particular in
Louisiana, in Ohio

46:43.600 --> 46:49.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and in Washington, D.C., have
shown declines
in performance when students
leave for private

46:49.740 --> 46:51.575 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
schools.

46:51.608 --> 46:54.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's really notable,
because, when you
look at education research, a
lot of times,

46:54.344 --> 46:58.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's no effect, sometimes,
there's positive
effects, but to find a negative
effect is

46:58.081 --> 46:59.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a little bit unusual.

46:59.883 --> 47:02.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
let's go back
to this larger issue of the
budget itself,

47:02.152 --> 47:03.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
$9 billion in cuts.

47:03.420 --> 47:06.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of these will fall on
higher education
in particular.

47:06.323 --> 47:07.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can you tell us about those
cuts?

47:08.025 --> 47:09.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYA KAMENETZ: Absolutely.

47:09.793 --> 47:14.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the biggest item here is an
end to subsidized
student loans.

47:14.932 --> 47:19.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, there's two student
loan programs
for subsidized loans.

47:19.136 --> 47:24.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you qualify, for
undergraduates, the government
picks up your interest while
you're in school.

47:24.274 --> 47:27.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that would be going away
under this plan.

47:27.377 --> 47:32.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second really significant
cut is in the
loan repayment program called
public service

47:32.149 --> 47:34.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
loan forgiveness.

47:34.084 --> 47:39.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is for teachers,
doctors, firefighters,
police officers, people engaged
in nonprofits

47:39.556 --> 47:41.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and government work.

47:41.091 --> 47:45.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were supposed to have their
loans forgiven
after 10 years of service.

47:45.462 --> 47:47.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this program's only 10 years
old.

47:47.865 --> 47:52.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if you're following along,
the repayment
was supposed to start this
October.

47:52.569 --> 47:55.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And all -- upwards of
half-a-million people
are enrolled in this program.

47:55.806 --> 47:59.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it goes away, it would be a
big panic for
a lot of people.

47:59.209 --> 48:02.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On top of that, there's cuts to
a number of
different programs.

48:02.646 --> 48:04.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's flat funding for Pell.

48:04.514 --> 48:09.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a small program that
might be going
away would be child care for
college students.

48:09.086 --> 48:13.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's significant for
working students
who we see at many of our
community colleges,

48:13.457 --> 48:15.225 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for example.

48:15.259 --> 48:17.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Obviously,
this is just
the president's proposal, and
Congress still

48:17.594 --> 48:19.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has to weigh in on this.

48:19.396 --> 48:24.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How likely do you think it is
that this budget
will remain intact going through
Congress?

48:24.134 --> 48:30.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANYA KAMENETZ: I mean, I'm sure
you have got
a lot of people giving this a
negative handicap.

48:30.474 --> 48:34.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the K-12 side, there's broad
bipartisan
support for a lot of these
proposals that

48:34.745 --> 48:36.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are under the gun here in.

48:36.580 --> 48:41.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In higher ed, some of these cuts
could be
made with budget reconciliation
without any

48:41.551 --> 48:46.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic votes, so that may be
a little
bit of a brighter future for
those proposals,

48:46.924 --> 48:51.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
if indeed we do see any
legislation passing
through in the next few months.

48:51.194 --> 48:53.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Anya Kamenetz
of National Public Radio, thank
you.

48:53.230 --> 48:55.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYA KAMENETZ: Thank you.

48:55.098 --> 49:07.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye,
that may be

49:07.511 --> 49:09.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

49:09.346 --> 49:12.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Disabled animals sometimes need
a helping
hand in order to walk again.

49:12.582 --> 49:18.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One Virginia man dedicated his
life to making
sure they get that much-needed
leg up.

49:18.255 --> 49:20.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Julia Griffin
explains.

49:20.123 --> 49:25.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: That hum of
machinery filling
this Northern Virginia workshop
means Derrick

49:25.262 --> 49:27.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Campana is hard at work.

49:27.130 --> 49:32.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DERRICK CAMPANA, Animal Ortho
Care: This is
one of the more final steps in
the fabrication

49:32.369 --> 49:34.271 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

49:34.304 --> 49:38.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: What he and his
team are fabricating
are artificial limbs, not for
humans, like

49:38.241 --> 49:42.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many orthotists, but for equally
rewarding
patients.

49:42.112 --> 49:47.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Campana is the one of the
world's go-to experts
for animal braces and
prosthetics, a passion

49:47.918 --> 49:49.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that started more than 12 years
ago.

49:49.686 --> 49:53.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DERRICK CAMPANA: A veterinarian
came to my
office, and she brought a dog
that needed

49:53.724 --> 49:55.225 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a prosthesis.

49:55.258 --> 49:58.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, at the time, it was so
strange to me
that someone would even do that.

49:58.929 --> 50:01.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I gave it a shot, and it was
successful.

50:01.465 --> 50:04.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, a light bulb went off and I
said, oh,
let's start a business.

50:04.034 --> 50:06.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm sure there's tons of animals
in need out
there.

50:06.570 --> 50:12.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Animals like
Angel Marie, a
pony whose front legs were
crushed at birth.

50:12.142 --> 50:13.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Owner Lennie Green:

50:13.777 --> 50:17.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LENNIE GREEN, Animal Owner: Kids
just love
her to death, and she loves
kids.

50:17.881 --> 50:21.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So it's really a great thing.

50:21.752 --> 50:25.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The prosthetics, if it wasn't
for that, she
would have never made it.

50:25.989 --> 50:31.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: But there's also
been goats,
rams, and even two elephants in
Thailand.

50:31.395 --> 50:33.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DERRICK CAMPANA: So, there's
Mosha and Motala.

50:33.764 --> 50:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they both lost their legs
due to land
mines.

50:36.933 --> 50:40.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They have had prosthetic
devices, but they
wanted an updated one because
they are using

50:40.404 --> 50:42.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different materials than we
would use over
here.

50:42.839 --> 50:45.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we're able to help create
those new prosthetics
for them.

50:45.542 --> 50:50.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Exotic animals
aside, Campana
estimates 90 percent of the more
than 10,000

50:50.514 --> 50:53.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
patients he's treated are man's
best friend.

50:53.750 --> 50:58.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DERRICK CAMPANA: We love the
stories where,
every morning, the dog will
bring the device

50:58.321 --> 51:04.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the owner's feet and say,
hey, it's time
to get up and walk and be a dog
again.

51:04.828 --> 51:06.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Derby is one of
his most famous.

51:07.030 --> 51:11.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DERRICK CAMPANA: Derby is one of
those congenital
cases, birth defect.

51:11.201 --> 51:17.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were able to 3-D-scan the
legs and design
these legs in 3-D upon these
positive molds

51:18.008 --> 51:23.046 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
and build these
three-dimensional plastic
prostheses with a 3-D printer.

51:23.080 --> 51:29.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: He can't help
every patient,
Campana is glad prosthetics can
be an alternative

51:29.419 --> 51:32.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to costly surgeries or putting
an animal down.

51:32.289 --> 51:38.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DERRICK CAMPANA: Seeing those
dogs walk again,
and their tails wag, and their
eyes glitter

51:38.261 --> 51:40.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again, and it's just the best
feeling in the
world.

51:40.997 --> 51:42.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's a job I will do until I
die.

51:42.332 --> 51:45.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Well, there you
go, Fido.

51:45.268 --> 51:47.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, for the record, that
dog's name
is Kenna.

51:47.871 --> 51:57.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Julia Griffin
in Sterling, Virginia.

51:58.014 --> 52:07.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Later this
evening on PBS,
"Frontline" looks at one of the
most divisive

52:07.324 --> 52:10.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
figures in the White House,
chief strategist
Steve Bannon.

52:10.227 --> 52:15.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Bannon's War" explores Bannon's
world view,
his belief that disruption is
power, and his

52:15.765 --> 52:20.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fight to deliver on Trump's
campaign promises,
including the travel ban.

52:20.437 --> 52:25.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Bannon had engineered
a sweeping
executive order aimed at
fulfilling a campaign

52:25.075 --> 52:28.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
promise to restrict Muslims from
entering
the United States.

52:28.645 --> 52:32.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BAKER, The New York Times:
That's Steve
Bannon's idea is to just throw
everybody off-balance,

52:32.849 --> 52:36.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
knock them back before they had
a chance to
resist.

52:36.520 --> 52:42.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Until this moment, the
order's details
had been a well-kept secret in
Washington,

52:42.526 --> 52:44.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even among Trump's own team.

52:44.261 --> 52:46.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOSHUA GREEN, Bloomberg
Businessweek: They
wanted to rush this thing
through and get

52:46.963 --> 52:52.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it out there and essentially
take a shock
and awe approach to change
immigration policy.

52:52.702 --> 52:56.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BAKER: Defense Secretary
Mattis, he
knew very late in the process
this was what

52:56.173 --> 52:58.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was going to be done during this
visit.

52:58.108 --> 53:02.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: Bannon didn't want
other agencies
to have a chance to see what was
in this executive

53:03.013 --> 53:06.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
order and say, whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute,
slow down, this might not be
something we

53:06.917 --> 53:08.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
want to do.

53:08.718 --> 53:12.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BAKER: John Kelly is the
new secretary
of homeland security, a retired
four-star

53:12.522 --> 53:14.224 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
general.

53:14.257 --> 53:17.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's on the phone being briefed
on a helicopter
while they're doing this
announcement.

53:17.928 --> 53:20.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Protection of the nation from
foreign terrorists'

53:20.730 --> 53:23.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
entry into the United States.

53:23.967 --> 53:26.770 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Big stuff.

53:26.803 --> 53:33.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: The president's first and
most important
responsibility to the American
people is the

53:33.710 --> 53:37.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to keep the homeland safe, and
so I think
that that's what the president
was shooting

53:37.414 --> 53:40.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for there, is to protect the
homeland.

53:40.650 --> 53:45.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Bannon and the new
president had
sent a message: Change had come.

53:45.121 --> 53:48.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: That was, in the eyes of
Bannon, a way
to rupture the establishment.

53:48.925 --> 53:51.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They knew it was going to be
disruptive.

53:51.561 --> 53:54.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They wanted the disruption.

53:54.564 --> 53:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Bannon sees disruption as power.

53:56.866 --> 54:02.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: "Frontline"
airs tonight
on most PBS stations.

54:02.439 --> 54:05.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: Maybe
you have heard the buzz?

54:05.342 --> 54:10.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scientists are puzzled by an
unexpected appearance
of cicadas in the Washington,
D.C., area this

54:11.014 --> 54:12.215 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
spring.

54:12.249 --> 54:15.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why have the insects emerged
four years ahead
of schedule?

54:15.619 --> 54:17.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We investigate that and more on
our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

54:17.887 --> 54:19.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:19.623 --> 54:21.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

54:21.124 --> 54:24.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

54:24.127 --> 54:26.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you.

54:26.429 --> 54:31.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
See you soon.

54:31.768 --> 54:36.439 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
See you soon.
