GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:07.741 --> 00:11.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We bring you the
"NewsHour" tonight
from the Quicken Loans Arena in
Cleveland,

00:11.612 --> 00:16.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ohio, site of the 2016
Republican National
Convention.

00:16.250 --> 00:21.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's day three of
the convention.
Donald Trump and Mike Pence
emerge as a united

00:22.089 --> 00:26.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
front, but is the GOP ready to
rally behind
the new Republican ticket?

00:26.593 --> 00:31.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And from "The
Apprentice" to the
Republican nominee, we wrap up
our series

00:31.999 --> 00:36.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
mapping Trump's path from
Queens, New York,
to, he hopes, the White House.

00:36.637 --> 00:40.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIMOTHY O'BRIEN, Author,
"TrumpNation": Donald
Trump, the political operator,
is very much

00:41.041 --> 00:44.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the same person as Donald Trump,
the marketer
and self-promoter.

00:44.811 --> 00:47.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I'm Hari
Sreenivasan in
Washington.

00:47.881 --> 00:53.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our End of AIDS series takes us
to a Kenyan
island where reducing the spread
of HIV means

00:53.353 --> 00:55.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reaching one group in
particular.

00:55.689 --> 01:00.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON COHEN, "Science": The HIV
prevalence in
fishermen is incredibly high. I
mean, we're

01:00.661 --> 01:05.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking on the order of 30, 40
percent. That's
something you see in people who
inject drugs.

01:05.966 --> 01:13.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:13.140 --> 01:15.542 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:15.642 --> 01:27.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The nominating is
done, and
Donald Trump is back here in
Cleveland, the

01:27.321 --> 01:29.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Republican convention city.

01:29.189 --> 01:33.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, delegates hear from the
man who he
chose to be his running mate,
and from a rival

01:33.627 --> 01:36.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who battled him nearly to the
end.

01:36.196 --> 01:39.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Correspondent Lisa Desjardins
begins our coverage.

01:39.333 --> 01:45.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Donald Trump
flew into Cleveland
this afternoon to claim what he
won last night,

01:45.372 --> 01:50.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then, a helicopter ride to
downtown, where
he was joined by his running
mate, Indiana

01:50.644 --> 01:52.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Governor Mike Pence.

01:52.379 --> 01:54.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
The last time, I got accused for
speaking

01:54.247 --> 01:58.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a little too long, so this time,
I'm going
to speak a lot short. But I just
want to introduce

01:58.719 --> 02:05.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a man who's become a friend of
mine, somebody
who's going to make an
unbelievable vice president

02:05.192 --> 02:07.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the United States, Governor
Mike Pence.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential
Candidate: It is such an honor
to welcome

02:10.697 --> 02:16.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you to Cleveland. We're excited
to hear you
address the nation tomorrow
night. It's been

02:16.636 --> 02:22.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exciting to hear from your
family. More to
come tonight. And I'm convinced
what begins

02:22.442 --> 02:25.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Cleveland will end in the
White House.

02:25.779 --> 02:29.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The ticket's
number-two man
delivers his own prime-time
address tonight,

02:29.850 --> 02:33.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and campaign manager Paul
Manafort says the
nation will see what Trump saw.

02:33.487 --> 02:37.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL MANAFORT, Trump Convention
Manager: Governor
Pence was the kind of guy who
didn't see no

02:37.457 --> 02:43.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for an answer, that, when he
became governor,
and he made a difference as
governor. And

02:43.330 --> 02:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that was an attitude was very
appealing, and
record was very appealing.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Manafort also
brushed off
questions today of any perceived
awkwardness

02:51.271 --> 02:53.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
between the two men-

02:53.306 --> 02:55.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL MANAFORT: Have they spent
two years together?
No. But are they comfortable
with each other

02:55.876 --> 03:00.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both on a personal basis and a
policy basis?
Absolutely. Will that grow? Yes.

03:00.680 --> 03:04.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Pence will use
his speech
to focus on tonight's theme,
make America

03:04.751 --> 03:09.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first again. Also scheduled to
speak, a slew
of Trump's primary challengers,
including

03:09.790 --> 03:15.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Texas Senator Ted Cruz. He's
stopped short
of making a formal endorsement,
after a bitter

03:15.429 --> 03:21.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
primary battle, during which
Trump dubbed
him lyin' Ted.

03:21.668 --> 03:25.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Even today, Trump's plane
interrupted Cruz
at one point, as he spoke to
supporters.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R), Texas: That
was pretty
well-orchestrated.

03:27.841 --> 03:33.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, there's a lot of talk
about unity.
I want to see unity, and the way
to see unity

03:34.081 --> 03:39.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is for us to unite behind shared
principles,
us to unite in defense of
liberty.

03:39.886 --> 03:44.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Cruz gave no
specifics on
exactly what he will say
tonight, but Trump's

03:44.925 --> 03:47.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lieutenant, Manafort, promised a
supportive
speech.

03:47.894 --> 03:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL MANAFORT: I think that he
will talk about
Hillary Clinton and the failures
-- how America

03:53.467 --> 03:56.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cannot afford to have Hillary
Clinton president.
And I think he will say
something, he will

03:57.070 --> 04:01.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
give a sign of where he is on
Donald Trump
that will be pleasing to the
Trump campaign

04:01.441 --> 04:03.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and to Republicans.

04:03.310 --> 04:06.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Also tonight,
speaking the
that podium will be another
member of the

04:06.813 --> 04:11.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump family. Eric Trump is the
candidate's
middle son. He's expected to
give a very personal

04:11.318 --> 04:15.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
portrait of a son speaking of
his father.

04:15.155 --> 04:20.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the fallout continues
from Melania
Trump's speech Monday night that
lifted sections

04:20.293 --> 04:25.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from a Michelle Obama speech.
Yesterday, the
Trump campaign dismissed any
allegations of

04:25.265 --> 04:31.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plagiarism. Today, Meredith
McIver, a Trump
staff writer, took
responsibility.

04:31.271 --> 04:36.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, McIver wrote:
"She read me
some passages from Mrs. Obama's
speech as

04:36.276 --> 04:41.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
examples. I wrote them down and
later included
some of the phrasing in the
draft that ultimately

04:41.448 --> 04:46.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
became the final speech. I
didn't check Mrs.
Obama's speech."

04:46.586 --> 04:51.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McIver said she offered Trump
her resignation,
but he refused.

04:51.758 --> 04:56.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Outside the convention hall,
there were new
protests, and this time,
multiple arrests.

04:56.163 --> 05:02.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police on horseback and bicycles
converged
on one site and used pepper
spray as anti-Trump

05:02.135 --> 05:04.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protesters tried to burn an
American flag.

05:04.204 --> 05:09.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins
in Cleveland.

05:09.209 --> 05:14.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And now we go down
to the convention
floor.

05:14.981 --> 05:20.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NPR's "Weekend Edition Sunday"
host Rachel
Martin will be with us this week
and next

05:20.420 --> 05:23.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for our joint "PBS NewsHour"-NPR
coverage
of the conventions.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rachel, what are you watching
for tonight?

05:25.892 --> 05:27.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RACHEL MARTIN: Hi there, Gwen.

05:27.727 --> 05:30.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, yes, I'm down on the
convention floor
near the area where the
delegation from Texas

05:31.097 --> 05:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is sitting, because, as you
heard, Senator
Ted Cruz will be speaking
tonight, addressing

05:36.570 --> 05:40.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the delegates here. He ended up
being the
most fierce competitor against
Donald Trump

05:40.974 --> 05:42.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in that primary season.

05:42.809 --> 05:46.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Even though he secured a
prime-time speaking
slot in the convention tonight,
he hasn't

05:46.880 --> 05:50.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually endorsed Donald Trump.
So it is going
to be interesting to watch
whether or not

05:50.650 --> 05:55.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he uses this as an opportunity
to do just
that, or if he decides just to
move past the

05:55.956 --> 06:00.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moment and instead lay out his
own vision
for the future of the Republican
Party, with

06:00.493 --> 06:05.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perhaps an eye on 2020, when he
may have another
shot at the nomination himself.

06:05.899 --> 06:09.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But no doubt the big draw
tonight is Mike
Pence. When the vice
presidential nominee

06:10.070 --> 06:15.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
takes the stage, he will be
commanding all
the attention. Pence was picked
for the Trump

06:15.308 --> 06:19.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ticket for that V.P. slot as an
olive branch
to establishment Republicans who
have been

06:20.080 --> 06:22.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reluctant to support Trump.

06:22.515 --> 06:28.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is really going to be
interesting to
watch whether or not Pence is
able to unify

06:28.421 --> 06:32.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the party in that kind of
address tonight,
because, no doubt, there is a
real split in

06:32.692 --> 06:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the party right now between
establishment
conservatives on the one hand
and Trump supporters

06:37.264 --> 06:41.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who say, listen, the party has
missed the
boat. They don't understand
where the voters

06:41.601 --> 06:43.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are anymore.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're looking to Donald Trump
to kind of
steer the ship, steer the
Republican Party

06:46.606 --> 06:50.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a new direction. So, we are
going to be
exploring that tension tonight
and asking

06:50.577 --> 06:55.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a question. What does it mean to
be a Republican
in 2016?

06:55.448 --> 07:00.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, lots to come here. Stay with
us. I will
throw it back to you, Gwen and
Judy, in the

07:00.720 --> 07:02.489 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
studio.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you,
Rachel. And we will
be talking to you throughout the
night.

07:05.091 --> 07:10.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was before a crowd of more
than 1,000 delegates
at the Republican state
convention in Springfield,

07:10.597 --> 07:17.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Illinois in 1858 where Abraham
Lincoln said
a house divided against itself
cannot stand.

07:17.904 --> 07:21.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week in Cleveland, we have
seen real
divisions in the party of
Lincoln, and heard

07:21.908 --> 07:25.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
questions raised about how they
unite, as
you just heard from Rachel.

07:25.412 --> 07:29.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We explore those now with John
Feehery. He's
a Republican strategist and
columnist for

07:29.716 --> 07:34.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Hill newspaper. He worked
for many years
on Capitol Hill for members of
the House Republican

07:34.454 --> 07:40.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leadership. And Leslie Rutledge,
she's Arkansas'
attorney general. She's also a
speaker you

07:40.493 --> 07:42.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
saw on stage here last night.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LESLIE RUTLEDGE, Arkansas
Attorney General:
Thank you.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Leslie Rutledge,
let me start
with you.

07:47.567 --> 07:51.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is the Republican Party that we
have seen
at this convention both in the
speakers and

07:51.671 --> 07:54.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the messages we have been
hearing, is that
a united party?

07:54.741 --> 07:56.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LESLIE RUTLEDGE: It is a very
united party.

07:56.710 --> 08:00.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that what we have
seen this week,
as the delegates work through
the platform,

08:00.547 --> 08:04.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as they work through the rules
and all the
issues, and what it boils down
to is that

08:05.051 --> 08:09.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republicans are ready to
take back the
White House. We're ready to grow
jobs across

08:09.122 --> 08:14.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America, to push back on the
regulatory environment
that hurts small businesses.

08:14.694 --> 08:18.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why we are seeing
Republicans this
week uniting behind Donald Trump
and Governor

08:18.865 --> 08:20.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Pence.

08:20.734 --> 08:24.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: John Feehery, we
have -- you have
been to many conventions. You
have worked

08:24.237 --> 08:27.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Capitol Hill for some time.
Or you did
from some time.

08:27.374 --> 08:32.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we see a convention that
feels very different
from the convention that
nominated Mitt Romney

08:32.445 --> 08:36.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Paul Ryan, someone very
different from
when they nominated John McCain
and Sarah

08:36.750 --> 08:38.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Palin. What would you say is the
difference?

08:38.551 --> 08:40.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN FEEHERY, Republican
Strategist: Well,
I think it's a completely
different dynamic,

08:40.987 --> 08:44.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because we have a non-politician
who is really
kind of dominating this whole --
I think the

08:44.991 --> 08:49.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
most effective speakers,
including you, were
people who are not in the
Washington mind-set,

08:49.396 --> 08:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some people who were kind of --
a lot of normal
Americans kind of expressing
themselves.

08:53.566 --> 08:57.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that Trump has kind of
brought that
to the table. Many times, we
have been this

08:57.570 --> 09:02.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
establishment party. We are not
the party
of George Bush anymore. We have
moved on.

09:02.242 --> 09:06.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In many ways, we're a more
populist party.
We're a party that is very
frustrated with

09:06.279 --> 09:10.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how Washington has operated to a
really nth
degree.

09:10.483 --> 09:14.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm not sure if we're a
divided party
,but there are a lot of sore
losers out there

09:14.287 --> 09:16.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a lot of people who are not
comfortable
with Donald Trump.

09:16.189 --> 09:19.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what about
that, Leslie
Rutledge? What is going to
happen to those

09:19.726 --> 09:23.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delegates? As you know, he got
the lion's
share of the delegate votes.
He's the nominee

09:24.030 --> 09:28.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the party, but there were,
what, 700 and
some votes for somebody else.
How does that

09:29.002 --> 09:32.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
element of the party come
together?

09:32.605 --> 09:34.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LESLIE RUTLEDGE: Sure.

09:34.374 --> 09:37.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, Donald Trump has already
united the
party. While there may have been
votes for

09:37.477 --> 09:43.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone else on the floor, but
across America
in those primaries, new voters
were coming

09:43.349 --> 09:47.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out in droves just to vote for
Donald Trump.
And that's what we were seeing,
this enthusiasm

09:47.253 --> 09:53.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
behind the outside-Washington
candidate in
Mr. Trump, in Governor Pence,
because they

09:53.426 --> 09:57.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know that things must change and
that Hillary
Clinton is dangerous.

09:57.530 --> 10:01.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She's -- deception and
dishonesty are second
nature to Hillary Clinton. And
that's what

10:01.901 --> 10:06.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I talked about last night in my
speech. And
that's why, when we look at the
Supreme Court,

10:06.239 --> 10:10.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people ask me, why is this
election so important,
Leslie? And I tell them, as
attorney general,

10:10.577 --> 10:15.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the chief legal officer, we
look to the
Supreme Court nominations. And
for me, it

10:15.281 --> 10:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
boils down to those two words.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You just mentioned
that you did
spend a lot of time on the floor
last night

10:19.686 --> 10:23.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking about Hillary Clinton.
That seemed
to be the theme of the night, as
much as jobs

10:23.256 --> 10:24.657 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and the economy.

10:24.757 --> 10:28.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, is this an anti-Clinton
convention or
a pro-Trump convention?

10:28.828 --> 10:30.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LESLIE RUTLEDGE: Well, it's
both.

10:30.663 --> 10:35.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And certainly it's prominently
pro-Donald
Trump, because we want Donald
Trump to be

10:35.335 --> 10:39.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president. We are supporting him
100 percent.
But what we don't want are four
more years

10:39.572 --> 10:45.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the same failed policies that
hurt Arkansas
and businesses around the
country.

10:45.545 --> 10:49.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we look at these small
businesses, which
are the backbone of America, we
want to get

10:50.049 --> 10:55.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these regulatory burdens off of
the small
businesses. I'm raised on a
cattle farm, married

10:55.421 --> 11:00.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a row crop farmer. We know
firsthand the
sort of regulatory burdens on
our farmers

11:00.860 --> 11:03.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and on industry across America.

11:03.496 --> 11:08.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Feehery, who
else does
Donald Trump need to reach out
to, to win

11:08.701 --> 11:10.570 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this election?

11:10.670 --> 11:15.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We both are familiar with the
so-called autopsy,
with the report done by the
Republican Party

11:15.942 --> 11:21.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after Mitt Romney's loss in
2012. In essence,
it said the party needs to reach
beyond its

11:21.781 --> 11:25.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
base to Hispanics, to
minorities. What does
Donald Trump need to do?

11:25.885 --> 11:28.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEEHERY: Well, I think
there are two
groups that are really worrying
for him, and

11:28.855 --> 11:32.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is female voters, because
he's getting
crunched by female voters.

11:32.525 --> 11:37.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm glad that you're here
talking, because
you need to make that case. He
has got to

11:37.330 --> 11:40.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change his messaging, because I
think, for
a lot of the people, a lot of
women voters,

11:40.967 --> 11:44.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he has is not being particularly
kind of sensitive
in his language.

11:44.904 --> 11:48.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second group, I think he's
got to expand
the working class. He's really
gotten effective

11:48.908 --> 11:52.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with white working-class voters.
But there's
plenty of African-American
working-class voters,

11:52.745 --> 11:56.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many Hispanic working-class
voters that are
really frustrated about this
economy, haven't

11:56.749 --> 11:58.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really had much going on in the
last couple
of years.

11:59.085 --> 12:03.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think if he can spread
that message
about he can bring a more
pro-business philosophy

12:03.289 --> 12:06.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and grow jobs more effectively,
I think that
was kind of a wasted opportunity
yesterday.

12:06.593 --> 12:09.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, we need to bash Hillary
Clinton, but
I'll tell you what -- because
that unites

12:09.896 --> 12:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the party. But we also have to
have a positive
message about how Trump can help
grow this

12:13.533 --> 12:15.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
economy, because ultimately
people want that.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's ask
Leslie Rutledge
to respond to that.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LESLIE RUTLEDGE: Sure.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Just so happens
you're a woman.
Just so happens you're a very
big Donald Trump

12:21.975 --> 12:25.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supporter. How does the party --
or does the
party need to do what John
Feehery is suggesting?

12:25.578 --> 12:30.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLIE RUTLEDGE: Well, as I
mentioned last
night in my remarks, that Donald
Trump understands

12:30.183 --> 12:33.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that women, as well as men, are
not single-issue
voters.

12:33.119 --> 12:37.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And for far too long, the
Democratic Party
and certainly Secretary Clinton
have treated

12:37.357 --> 12:42.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women as if we were single-issue
voters. Women
an men care about jobs. They
care about economy.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They care about national
security.

12:43.796 --> 12:45.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But I didn't hear
that conversation
on the floor last night.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLIE RUTLEDGE: Well, if you
listened to
my speech, you heard me say that
exact line,

12:48.901 --> 12:53.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Donald Trump -- unlike
Hillary Clinton,
Donald Trump knows that women
and men are

12:54.007 --> 12:55.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not single-issue voters.

12:55.975 --> 13:00.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We care about the jobs, the
economy and national
security, verbatim, and that's
what I said

13:01.014 --> 13:05.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last night. And we're going to
keep talking
about that, because women and
men, that's

13:05.118 --> 13:08.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what they want. They want a safe
place for
their families to live. They
want to be able

13:08.921 --> 13:13.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have a job, to be able to pay
their bills,
go to those soccer games. And
that's the sort

13:14.060 --> 13:17.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of America that people across
this country
want.

13:17.330 --> 13:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Feehery, you
were just
saying that some of Donald
Trump's remarks

13:20.500 --> 13:23.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
haven't been sensitive was the
word you used.

13:23.636 --> 13:27.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What kind of language do you
want to see him
using that he hasn't been? What
do you want

13:27.440 --> 13:29.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him to stop saying? What do you
want him to
start saying?

13:29.409 --> 13:33.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEEHERY: Well, listen, I
think that when
you're talking about fixing the
immigration

13:33.479 --> 13:38.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system, and I think Donald Trump
needs to
let the private Donald Trump
come out.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From everything I know about
from what I have
heard about Donald Trump,
privately, he's

13:41.454 --> 13:45.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a guy who does a lot of
listening. He is a
guy who is not full of the
bravado. He is

13:45.692 --> 13:49.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a guy who actually is very
effective in small
groups. Everyone I have talked
to says that.

13:49.829 --> 13:54.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He needs to let the private guy
out, because
I think the bravado and kind of
the language

13:54.901 --> 13:59.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that gets beyond the pale a
little bit -- and
we all know what it is -- he
needs to scale

13:59.138 --> 14:04.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that back. And I think if he can
-- just continue
to pound on Hillary Clinton is
not sufficient.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

14:06.079 --> 14:08.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Has this convention
-- I want
you both to take a stab at this
-- has it

14:08.414 --> 14:10.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
helped Donald Trump?

14:10.349 --> 14:16.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been distractions. We
saw the Melania
Trump speech distraction. We
have seen the

14:16.355 --> 14:23.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rules distraction, the Cruz
voters rising
up, booing the Trump plane today
as it landed.

14:23.362 --> 14:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wonder whether you think this
convention
has been distracting overall or
whether it

14:27.800 --> 14:31.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the end helps introduce
Donald Trump to
a broader audience?

14:31.104 --> 14:32.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESLIE RUTLEDGE: Absolutely.

14:33.005 --> 14:36.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we talk about Melania
Trump's amazing
speech, I mean, by and large, it
was a terrific

14:36.876 --> 14:41.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speech filled with wonderful
messages about
Donald Trump as a husband,
Donald Trump as

14:41.681 --> 14:47.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a father and a grandfather and
really introducing
us, but for that distraction
that was unfortunate,

14:47.253 --> 14:52.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because she showed that she is a
strong, smart,
confident woman and would be a
tremendous

14:52.859 --> 14:54.660 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
first lady.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Likewise, we heard from Donald
Trump Jr. last
night. We are going to hear from
more of the

14:57.363 --> 15:03.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump family to get to John's
point to see
Donald Trump the man. And four
years ago,

15:03.302 --> 15:07.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we didn't see enough of who Mitt
Romney was.
They didn't really showcase that
enough. And

15:08.007 --> 15:11.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm hoping that we have learned
from our mistakes
and that we are showcasing what
an incredible

15:11.978 --> 15:14.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
person Donald Trump and the
entire Trump family
are.

15:14.213 --> 15:16.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN FEEHERY: Listen, we have
had some hiccups
at this convention.

15:16.282 --> 15:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the best things that
happened is finally
the never Trump people have
ended their fantasy

15:21.187 --> 15:25.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
land. We have the candidate. Now
we can start
looking forward. I'm looking
forward to a

15:25.158 --> 15:28.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
good speech by Mike Pence and
Marco Rubio
and Ted Cruz tonight.

15:28.461 --> 15:32.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm looking forward to see
what Donald
Trump says tomorrow night. And
hopefully we

15:32.131 --> 15:35.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a little bit more of a
glimpse of who
he is as a real person in
private. He has

15:35.701 --> 15:40.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a great family. They're very,
very poised.
Let's talk about that and let's
talk about

15:40.439 --> 15:42.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what he can do for the rest of
our families.

15:42.675 --> 15:47.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: John Feehery, Leslie
Rutledge
weigh in on the future of the
Republican Party.

15:47.246 --> 15:47.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you both very much.

LESLIE RUTLEDGE: Thank you all.

15:48.981 --> 15:50.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you. Thank
you.

15:50.917 --> 15:53.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tonight, we continue
our series
exploring Donald Trump's life,
his transformation

15:53.886 --> 15:58.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from businessman to reality TV
star, to presidential
nominee.

15:58.191 --> 16:03.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this final installment, we
look at Trump's
political transformation to
billionaire populist.

16:03.563 --> 16:10.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In retrospect, this scene seemed
inevitable,
Donald Trump, surrounded by the
trappings

16:10.102 --> 16:14.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of wealth and celebrity, staking
his claim
to the world's most powerful
office.

16:14.473 --> 16:21.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I am officially running for
president of the

16:21.814 --> 16:28.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
United States, and we are going
to make our
country great again.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

16:30.423 --> 16:35.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: His candidacy was
initially dismissed
as a prank, a long shot. But, in
fact, it

16:35.361 --> 16:38.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was 28 years in the making.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Gwenda Blair is a Trump
biographer.

16:40.199 --> 16:43.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWENDA BLAIR, Author, "The
Trumps": It's not
the first time, second, third,
fourth, or

16:43.603 --> 16:48.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even fifth. It's the sixth time
that he has
talked about being president.

16:48.941 --> 16:53.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump's earliest
interest in the
intersection of politics and
business was

16:53.279 --> 17:00.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fueled by his developer father,
Fred, but
also by a shadier figure, Roy
Cohn, the tough-talking

17:00.152 --> 17:05.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
power attorney who rose to
prominence as Senator
Joseph McCarthy's fixer during
the communist

17:06.092 --> 17:07.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
scares of the 1950s.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Author Timothy O'Brien:

17:09.028 --> 17:12.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIMOTHY O'BRIEN, Author,
"TrumpNation": The
Donald Trump who will sue
anyone's pants off

17:12.999 --> 17:20.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a drop of a hat learned that
from Roy Cohn.
The Donald who learned that the
best way for

17:20.239 --> 17:25.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a business campaign, or a
political campaign,
to be run was in a
scorched-earth fashion,

17:25.544 --> 17:27.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he learned that from Roy Cohn.

17:27.513 --> 17:31.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Running for
president, or at least
talking about the possibility,
became something

17:31.617 --> 17:33.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a hobby for Trump.

17:33.486 --> 17:37.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY O'BRIEN: Donald Trump,
the political
operator, is very much the same
person as

17:38.024 --> 17:45.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, the marketer and
self-promoter.
And he's brought those same
self-promotional

17:45.298 --> 17:48.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and marketing skills to bear on
the political
race.

17:48.134 --> 17:53.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Indeed, his first
foray into presidential
politics was a sales pitch,
literally, to

17:53.472 --> 17:55.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
promote his new book.

17:55.207 --> 17:56.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here's writer Michael D'Antonio.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, Trump
Biographer: In 1987,
he had a book, "The Art of the
Deal," that

18:00.579 --> 18:05.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he wanted to promote. Instead of
buying ad
space, he pretended to run for
president.

18:06.052 --> 18:11.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went to New Hampshire, gave a
couple of
speeches. He made some
pronouncements about

18:11.924 --> 18:15.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Reagan administration's
failures, and
got a lot of attention. He was
one of the

18:15.861 --> 18:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first people actually to use
running for president
as a business tactic.

18:21.701 --> 18:28.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump played coy
about his political
ambitions, and even about his
political leanings.

18:28.174 --> 18:29.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LARRY KING, CNN: Are you a
Republican, Donald?

18:30.009 --> 18:31.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I'm a Republican,
yes.

18:31.510 --> 18:34.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LARRY KING: So, if there were
politics, it
would be as a Republican?

18:34.213 --> 18:38.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: It would be, I
guess, as a Republican.
But I don't see that there will
be politics.

18:38.351 --> 18:44.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: He flirted with a
Reform Party
bid in 2000, floating Oprah
Winfrey as a possible

18:44.557 --> 18:46.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
V.P. pick.

18:46.158 --> 18:48.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Oprah. I love
Oprah. Oprah would
always be my first choice.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LARRY KING: Oprah?

18:49.595 --> 18:50.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Oprah. Your
competitor, right?

18:50.896 --> 18:52.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And he made noise
again in 2004.

18:52.865 --> 18:58.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Well, you would be
shocked if
I said that, in many cases, I
probably identify

18:58.471 --> 18:59.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more as a Democrat.

18:59.672 --> 19:03.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The hints came again
in 2008 and
2012.

19:03.409 --> 19:08.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY O'BRIEN: He's found
these different
flash points that he's used to
get himself

19:08.180 --> 19:15.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attention, but he's never, ever
developed
a mature, deeply informed
political platform.

19:15.321 --> 19:20.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: During that time,
critics charge,
some of his positions have been
as inconsistent

19:20.693 --> 19:23.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as his party affiliation, on
issues like abortion.

19:23.863 --> 19:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Well, look, I'm
very pro-choice.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I am very, very proud to say
that I am
pro-life.

19:30.169 --> 19:35.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: His view has also
clearly shifted
on the woman who is now his
likely general

19:35.408 --> 19:37.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
election opponent.

19:37.243 --> 19:39.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Hillary Clinton, I
think is
a terrific woman. I mean, I'm a
little biased,

19:39.678 --> 19:41.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because I have known her for
years.

19:41.347 --> 19:44.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Most people know she's a
world-class liar.

19:44.283 --> 19:50.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: By 2011, he was
questioning President
Barack Obama's citizenship,
promoting the

19:50.389 --> 19:54.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
already discredited notion that
the president
wasn't qualified to serve.

19:54.960 --> 19:58.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: People have birth
certificates.
He doesn't have a birth
certificate. Now,

19:58.931 --> 20:04.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he may have one, but there's
something on
that. There's maybe religion.
Maybe it says

20:04.303 --> 20:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he is a Muslim. I don't know.

20:06.205 --> 20:13.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWENDA BLAIR: It really was, I
think, seeing
whether the latent hostility
toward a black

20:13.312 --> 20:21.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president, how deep it was. And
he immediately
got a very, very strong feedback
that it was

20:21.954 --> 20:28.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quite deep, quite widespread. He
got a lot
of attention for that. And I
think that that

20:28.227 --> 20:32.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was really the launching for
2012. But it
turned into 2016.

20:32.832 --> 20:36.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Which brings us back
to this moment:

20:36.502 --> 20:41.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I will build a
great, great
wall on our southern border. And
I will have

20:41.907 --> 20:44.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mexico pay for that wall.

20:44.143 --> 20:50.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWENDA BLAIR: He's a sharp guy.
He's very
shrewd at reading what people
want to hear.

20:50.382 --> 20:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they want to hear that
they're right,
that they have a reason to be
angry.

20:54.220 --> 20:59.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Blasting through a
field of 16
other primary contenders, Donald
Trump has

20:59.825 --> 21:01.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now emerged as the GOP nominee.

21:01.827 --> 21:06.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL D'ANTONIO: Lo and
behold, by the time
he is campaigning, it is almost
enough to

21:06.665 --> 21:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run as a celebrity candidate. So
I think what
we have seen is sort of the
confluence of

21:15.074 --> 21:21.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Donald Trump celebrity
strategy, the Donald
Trump self-promotion strategy,
and a changing

21:21.780 --> 21:26.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political environment that
allowed him to
leverage both of these things to
become the

21:26.485 --> 21:27.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
presumptive nominee.

21:27.686 --> 21:33.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Thank you all.
Thank you very
much.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

21:36.262 --> 21:39.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.
JUDY WOODRUFF: And with that
report, we turn
to syndicated columnist Mark
Shields, New

21:39.198 --> 21:43.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York Times columnist David
Brooks, and Amy
Walter of The Cook Political
Report, who are

21:44.036 --> 21:49.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also joining us around this
table each night
for our live convention
coverage.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Welcome to all three of you. We
love spending
all this time with you.

21:52.211 --> 21:56.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark, is the Donald Trump we're
seeing in
this reports that Gwen prepared,
is that the

21:56.749 --> 21:58.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump coming through at this
convention?

21:58.617 --> 22:00.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Unfortunately,
yes.

22:00.953 --> 22:07.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a terrific piece of
reporting, but
I think it is coming through,
Donald Trump's

22:07.626 --> 22:16.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ego, Donald Trump's vanity. It's
-- I don't
think it's necessarily
flattering to him,

22:16.168 --> 22:17.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but I think it is coming
through.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David?

22:19.572 --> 22:23.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I don't think so.
I think there
is a patina of normalcy in this
convention.

22:23.342 --> 22:27.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, we sit in the booth like
we always do
every four years. We get french
fries or whatever

22:27.279 --> 22:28.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- I get at least every four
years.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:30.482 --> 22:32.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so it seems
like, oh, we're
at another convention.

22:33.018 --> 22:38.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But this is not another
convention. This is
a party that used to believe in
free trade,

22:38.524 --> 22:45.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
immigration, capitalism,
compassionate conservatism,
and that party is gone, at least
on the podium.

22:45.397 --> 22:50.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Republican Party is
nominating a guy
without any known principles,
without any

22:50.269 --> 22:54.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
known experience, without any
known ethical
standards.

22:54.306 --> 22:59.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's bizarre. I mean, I'm
getting more cosmically
depressed the more I think -- I
step back

22:59.678 --> 23:03.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the normal patina of life
here and think
about what's actually happening.

23:03.182 --> 23:07.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And as Amy wrote in
her column
for The Cook Political Report
today, the same

23:07.620 --> 23:08.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cheesy music from the band.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: It
is the same cheesy music.

23:10.356 --> 23:12.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That's my -- that's
Amy opinion,
not mine.

23:12.157 --> 23:13.292 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

23:13.392 --> 23:14.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They're going to
be insulted
by this.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.095 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

23:16.195 --> 23:18.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How different is
this convention
from -- I mean, four years ago,
we were all

23:18.464 --> 23:23.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, and there was Mitt Romney
and Paul Ryan,
four years before that, John
McCain and Sarah

23:23.602 --> 23:28.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Palin. And this in some ways is
exactly the
same as we have always seen, and
in some ways

23:28.440 --> 23:29.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's so different.
AMY WALTER: And yet they feel
very different.

23:29.708 --> 23:31.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The party is so
different.

23:31.543 --> 23:34.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The party is so
different, in
part because I don't think there
is a party.

23:34.380 --> 23:37.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is Trump's convention, and
he has put
his stamp all over it, and we
are going to

23:37.549 --> 23:42.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
once again see him tonight and
of course his
big speech on Thursday. But this
party is

23:42.621 --> 23:47.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not Trump's. And you could feel
that in the
hall. We talked a lot about the
disunity among

23:47.726 --> 23:52.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many members of the delegation,
the fact that
the hall is not filled, the fact
that speaker

23:52.398 --> 23:56.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after speaker has come up and
given their
version of what they see as the
Republican

23:56.702 --> 23:58.470 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party.

23:58.570 --> 24:01.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not necessarily the version
that Donald
Trump has. To have Paul Ryan,
the speaker

24:01.874 --> 24:09.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the House, not mention any --
the most
important parts of the Donald
Trump messaging,

24:09.181 --> 24:14.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the wall, immigration, trade, I
think, was
quite important and quite
significant.

24:14.186 --> 24:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will be very curious to see
what Senator
Ted Cruz says tonight. He is
somebody who

24:18.757 --> 24:23.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has yet endorse Donald Trump.
And there is
no indication that he is going
to do that

24:23.329 --> 24:26.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tonight. Instead, he's going to
put out his
vision of the Republican Party.

24:26.565 --> 24:30.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And yet, Mark, a
lot of these
delegates really like Donald
Trump and think

24:30.803 --> 24:33.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's just what their party
needs, what the
country needs.

24:33.205 --> 24:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: They do. I don't
think there
is any question. A very healthy
majority of

24:37.776 --> 24:39.645 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them do.

24:39.745 --> 24:43.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just have one point that I
want to make
about this election, this
campaign, this convention.

24:43.816 --> 24:50.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it reminds me -- just before
the collapse
of the Soviet Union and the end
of the civil

24:50.289 --> 24:56.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
war -- the end of the Cold War,
Georgy Arbatov
was a Soviet expert on the
United States.

24:56.428 --> 25:00.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he made a brilliant
prediction. He said
to the United States, we're
going to do a

25:00.466 --> 25:06.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrible thing to you. We're
going to deprive
you of an enemy. And the
organizing principle

25:06.939 --> 25:10.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the United States defensive
foreign policy
had been opposition to the
Soviet Union. There

25:10.909 --> 25:12.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is no more Soviet Union.

25:12.678 --> 25:17.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you take Hillary Clinton out,
there is
no organizing principle for this
convention.

25:17.549 --> 25:23.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, Mitch McConnell
spoke, Republican
leader of the Senate; 24 times,
he mentioned

25:23.322 --> 25:29.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton. Five times, he
mentioned
Donald Trump. Twice as often,
Hillary Clinton

25:29.194 --> 25:31.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been mentioned as has Donald
Trump.

25:32.097 --> 25:37.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's true in this
campaign. If
Hillary Clinton disappeared
tomorrow and Donald

25:37.836 --> 25:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump was a referendum up or
down, he would
be in trouble. And I think the
same thing

25:41.473 --> 25:43.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is true for the Democrats.

25:43.308 --> 25:46.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Mike Pence steps
up to the
podium tonight. This is his big
moment, even

25:47.045 --> 25:51.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
though a lot of people feel they
know him.
Does that make a difference?
Does that begin

25:51.316 --> 25:56.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to orient this party or orient
this convention,
David Brooks, or is it just
going to be what

25:57.089 --> 25:58.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's going to be?

25:59.091 --> 26:01.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I doubt it will
make a difference.
The Trump persona is sort of
dominating this

26:01.727 --> 26:03.562 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
atmosphere.

26:03.662 --> 26:06.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at least we might get an
emotional break.
I'm sort of struck about the
emotional tone

26:06.231 --> 26:09.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the convention, which the
first night was
about loss. The second night,
let's face it,

26:09.635 --> 26:13.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was sort of about hatred.
It's hard to
say you want to lock up Hillary
Clinton without

26:14.006 --> 26:17.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually hating her. And it's
hard to imagine
a party that is not corrupted by
hatred.

26:17.476 --> 26:22.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, also, it's funny you
mention Arbatov.
We -- they took away the Soviet
Union as an

26:22.281 --> 26:26.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enemy. We have got an ally
apparently in Vladimir
Putin, who we have now adjusted
the platform

26:27.052 --> 26:31.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to soften the Republican Party's
view of Vladimir
Putin, so we have got sort of a
soft-core

26:31.623 --> 26:33.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Putinism going on here.

26:34.059 --> 26:40.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Pence is a nice guy, a warm
guy, a genial
guy. And that's not exactly the
tone we have

26:40.833 --> 26:41.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been hearing. So, I'm hoping...

26:42.034 --> 26:43.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Do you think he will
talk about
the wall?

26:43.302 --> 26:45.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I would be -- I
will jump out
of the...

26:45.604 --> 26:45.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

26:46.038 --> 26:46.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:46.805 --> 26:47.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: No. Don't do that.

26:47.272 --> 26:48.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

26:48.774 --> 26:50.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: He will not talk
about the -- I
would be very surprised.

26:50.642 --> 26:53.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: What I'm really
surprised that
we haven't heard about -- and
Donald Trump

26:53.145 --> 26:59.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the one that I expect to make
this message
the most strongly -- is that all
this establishment

26:59.618 --> 27:03.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- we have been talking about
disunity, disunity
this whole time, but Donald
Trump won this

27:03.188 --> 27:04.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nomination.

27:05.057 --> 27:08.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump is getting
anywhere from
40 to 45 percent of the vote
right now. He

27:09.094 --> 27:15.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is close to Hillary Clinton,
either tied or
a couple of points behind. And
his message

27:15.901 --> 27:20.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is resonating with a good group,
a good, significant
chunk of voters.

27:21.073 --> 27:24.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the message that's coming
across here
that's not coming across from
the establishment,

27:24.877 --> 27:29.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this idea that they have been
left behind,
that the establishment still
isn't putting

27:29.481 --> 27:34.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policies forward that address
economic stagnation,
the feeling they have of this
loss.

27:34.653 --> 27:41.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And until that happens, which I
think needs
to happen tonight, then you
know, we're going

27:41.126 --> 27:42.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get that change.

27:43.028 --> 27:46.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, do you
agree? That's
what -- what do they need to do
tonight and

27:46.798 --> 27:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tomorrow night to fix or to fill
out what
the message has been so far?

27:53.005 --> 27:56.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: To be the party of
open arms,
rather than clenched fists.

27:56.508 --> 28:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Mike Pence is a step
in the right
direction that way. It's
interesting. Paul

28:00.946 --> 28:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ryan, Mitch McConnell, others
have used him
as a hook for sort of speaking
positively

28:07.185 --> 28:10.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the Trump candidacy. Mike
Pence gives
a legitimacy...

28:10.889 --> 28:12.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Wasn't that the plan
for Trump
all along?

28:12.858 --> 28:14.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I don't
know.

28:14.726 --> 28:21.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Pence is still in small
print on the
sign. And he had barely a
walk-on cameo apart

28:21.767 --> 28:27.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in his own announcement last
Saturday. So,
tonight, this is really the
first chance to

28:27.272 --> 28:31.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see and see what his role might
be in this
campaign.

28:31.276 --> 28:35.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I saw Donald Trump
Jr. today at
an event in which he basically
said that Mike

28:35.747 --> 28:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pence was a calming influence,
and they couldn't
pick any of the other finalists
because you

28:39.718 --> 28:42.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't need two Donald Trumps
being another
Donald Trump.

28:42.321 --> 28:42.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.790 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:44.890 --> 28:46.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So they seem to
recognize on some
point the need for a calming
influence, David.

28:46.858 --> 28:50.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And someone who
seems a little
genial and will reassure
orthodox conservatives.

28:50.596 --> 28:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There really are, I think -- OK,
I'm quoting
Amy's newsletter today. But
there are several

28:54.800 --> 28:58.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- I'm struck by how many
different parties
there are here. There is a
Kasich party. There

28:58.370 --> 29:02.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a Cruz party. There is sort
of a Trump
thing.

29:02.608 --> 29:06.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there is an -- even an
old-guard
George H.W. Bush-Bob Dole party
lurking here

29:06.478 --> 29:06.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the corners.

29:07.045 --> 29:08.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

29:08.947 --> 29:11.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so Pence is
not offensive
to any of those parts of the
parties, whereas

29:11.883 --> 29:13.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump is alien.

29:13.619 --> 29:15.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I have to say it's
good to hear
that you are reading each
other's...

29:15.921 --> 29:16.288 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:16.388 --> 29:17.556 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

29:17.656 --> 29:18.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: ... and quoting each
other, and
not just...

29:19.091 --> 29:20.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

29:20.192 --> 29:20.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But they always
do, don't they?

29:20.926 --> 29:22.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: They do.

29:22.928 --> 29:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thank you all very much, Amy
Walter, ark Shields,
David Brooks. We're going to see
you all later

29:26.765 --> 29:28.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight.

29:28.567 --> 29:31.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can stay with us as well
tonight,
beginning at 8:00 p.m. Eastern
time, for our

29:31.103 --> 29:36.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
special NPR/"PBS NewsHour"
coverage of the
Republican presidential
convention in Cleveland.

29:36.808 --> 29:38.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we will go back to Hari
Sreenivasan in
D.C.

29:38.710 --> 29:42.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the other
news of this
day: A federal appeals court
struck down the

29:42.981 --> 29:48.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Texas voter I.D. law. The judges
found it
has a -- quote --
"discriminatory effect,"

29:48.153 --> 29:53.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they ordered changes before
the November
election. The 2011 law requires
voters to

29:53.392 --> 29:57.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show one of seven forms of
identification.
Supporters say it prevents
fraud. The U.S.

29:57.663 --> 30:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice Department and other
opponents say
low-income and minority voters
have a harder

30:01.366 --> 30:03.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time obtaining the I.D.s.

30:03.802 --> 30:07.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The government of Turkey
declared an emergency
for the next three months, in
the wake of

30:07.739 --> 30:13.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
last week's failed coup.
Officials also closed
more than 600 private schools
and other establishments,

30:13.912 --> 30:18.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a political crackdown kept
growing. In
Istanbul, buses brought hundreds
of people

30:18.383 --> 30:22.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to court on suspicion of
involvement in the
coup attempt. Thousands have
been fired or

30:22.821 --> 30:24.623 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
arrested.

30:24.723 --> 30:28.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
French lawmakers have voted to
extend emergency
rule there for another six
months. The state

30:28.927 --> 30:32.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of emergency was first declared
after the
Paris attacks last November. It
was about

30:32.864 --> 30:38.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to expire, when a truck attack
in Nice killed
84 people last week. Today,
President Francois

30:38.203 --> 30:43.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hollande visited a military
reserve unit that's
to be deployed under emergency
rule. He acknowledged

30:43.141 --> 30:45.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
public criticism of security
failures.

30:45.510 --> 30:48.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French
President (through
translator): After such a
tragedy, the anger

30:48.914 --> 30:53.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is legitimate, because
compatriots were killed,
because innocents were hit, but
it must not

30:53.618 --> 30:58.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
degenerate into hate and
suspicion. The debate
itself is also necessary to know
the truth

30:58.590 --> 31:03.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when such a tragedy happens, but
it must not
affect our vital unity, nor ruin
our necessary

31:04.029 --> 31:05.931 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cohesion.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Islamic
State group
has claimed the attacks. But
Hollande's government

31:08.400 --> 31:11.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also warned today against
blaming all Muslims.

31:11.403 --> 31:16.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, a U.S.-backed rebel
group says it's
investigating the beheading of a
young boy

31:16.675 --> 31:20.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by one of its fighters. It was
captured on
video, and opposition activists
said the victim

31:20.746 --> 31:25.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a 12-year-old Palestinian
refugee. Armed
men on the video accused him of
spying for

31:25.917 --> 31:29.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Palestinian militia that
supports the Syrian
government.

31:29.688 --> 31:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, Wall
Street kept moving
higher. The Dow Jones industrial
average gained

31:33.225 --> 31:40.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
36 points to close at 18595. The
Nasdaq rose
53 points, and the S&amp;P 500 added
nine.

31:40.298 --> 31:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two deaths of note tonight:
Hawaii Congressman
Mark Takai has died. The
first-term Democrat

31:46.037 --> 31:51.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passed away today at his home,
nine months
after he was diagnosed with
pancreatic cancer.

31:51.309 --> 31:54.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He announced in May he wouldn't
run again.

31:54.212 --> 31:59.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Garry Marshall died Tuesday,
after a career
that created fixtures of
American entertainment.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown looks back at his
life and work.

32:01.219 --> 32:08.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Director,
producer, writer
and actor, Garry Marshall made
TV and movie

32:08.527 --> 32:14.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
audiences laugh for more than 50
years. and
he was still working this past
spring, promoting

32:14.232 --> 32:16.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his final movie, "Mother's Day."

32:16.101 --> 32:20.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARRY MARSHALL, Director: I like
to really
examine the human condition of
regular people,

32:21.072 --> 32:22.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because I'm a regular person.
You know me.

32:23.074 --> 32:27.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Marshall grew up
in the Bronx
and began his career writing
jokes for comedians

32:27.612 --> 32:33.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and scripts for 1960s TV
comedies, including
"Make Room for Daddy" and "The
Dick Van Dyke

32:33.952 --> 32:35.787 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Show."

32:35.887 --> 32:41.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A breakthrough came in 1970,
when he co-created
TV's version of "The Odd
Couple." It ran five

32:41.827 --> 32:53.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
years and led to a sitcom
empire. "Happy Days"
debuted in 1974, and had a
decade-long run.

32:53.104 --> 33:00.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In turn, it spun off "Laverne &amp;
Shirley,"
starring Marshall's sister,
Penny, an actress

33:00.111 --> 33:07.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and director in her own right.
And in 1978,
"Mork &amp; Mindy" brought a young
Robin Williams

33:07.953 --> 33:09.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into national view.

33:09.921 --> 33:14.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marshall estimated he wrote
1,000 TV sitcom
scripts, before switching to the
big screen

33:15.060 --> 33:24.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the 1980s. He directed Bette
Midler in
the 1988 movie "Beaches." And in
1990, "Pretty

33:24.135 --> 33:30.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Woman," pairing Richard Gere and
an emerging
star, Julia Roberts, became a
smash hit.

33:30.141 --> 33:34.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Years later, Marshall described
his approach
to directing this way:

33:34.880 --> 33:38.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARRY MARSHALL: You don't know
if it's a hit
or a flop, it'll do well or not,
but we do

33:38.884 --> 33:44.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
know the process can be
pleasant. And once
there's too much yelling and
screaming, I

33:44.289 --> 33:49.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go home. So I try to make it
where you don't
do that, and people somehow get
along. My

33:50.095 --> 33:52.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
best directing tool is hugging.

33:52.898 --> 33:56.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The casino is our main means of
income.

33:56.568 --> 34:01.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Marshall
occasionally appeared
on screen as well, including in
Albert Brooks'

34:01.506 --> 34:04.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1985 comedy, "Lost in America."

34:04.676 --> 34:09.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Along the way, his work earned
him dozens
of awards and nominations, and a
star on the

34:09.180 --> 34:14.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hollywood Walk of Fame. Garry
Marshall died
Tuesday in Burbank, California,
after suffering

34:15.020 --> 34:21.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a stroke. He was 81 years old.

34:21.259 --> 34:32.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Defense chiefs
and other
leaders from more than 30
countries are here

34:32.570 --> 34:37.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Washington for two days of
meetings on
the war against ISIS in Iraq and
Syria.

34:38.076 --> 34:43.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The summit comes as ISIS loses
territory in
both countries, but the group
and its followers

34:43.114 --> 34:45.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lash out with terrorist strikes
globally.

34:46.017 --> 34:51.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meantime, there is continuing
turmoil in Turkey,
which borders both Syria and
Iraq, after Friday's

34:51.289 --> 34:53.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coup attempt.

34:53.158 --> 34:55.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on all of this, I spoke
a short time
ago with Michael Fallon, the
United Kingdom's

34:56.027 --> 34:58.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
defense secretary.

34:58.163 --> 34:59.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Defense Secretary, welcome.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON, U.K. Defense
Secretary: Thank
you, Hari.

35:01.333 --> 35:04.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: First off,
right now, we're
hearing that the Turkish
president has declared

35:04.636 --> 35:09.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a state of emergency for another
three months.
This comes in a week where there
has been

35:09.274 --> 35:15.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a significant purge of people
who might have
been in opposition to him. Is
Turkey still

35:15.714 --> 35:17.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a reliable ally in NATO?

35:17.716 --> 35:22.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, yes, it's
still a key
ally in NATO. It's a cornerstone
of NATO.

35:22.253 --> 35:28.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very important in the
southeast corner
of NATO to have Turkey there as
a longstanding

35:28.293 --> 35:30.095 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
member.

35:30.195 --> 35:34.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has formidable armed forces.
And it's helping
us fight ISIL as well in the
Middle East.

35:34.165 --> 35:36.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, Turkey is important.

35:36.101 --> 35:39.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, it's obviously concerning
that there's
been this coup. And we're
particularly concerned

35:40.038 --> 35:45.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Turkey keeps to the path of
respecting
human rights when it's dealing
with the aftermath

35:45.844 --> 35:47.545 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the coup.

35:47.645 --> 35:50.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And does
what's happening
now compromise your ability to
fight ISIS

35:50.882 --> 35:52.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
together with Turkey?

35:52.751 --> 35:55.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, Turkey's
made it clear
that this doesn't affect their
commitment

35:56.087 --> 36:01.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the fight against ISIL. We
want to seal
that border with Syria to stem
the flow of

36:01.359 --> 36:02.861 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
foreign fighters.

36:02.961 --> 36:07.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they have every interest in
not having
ISIL flourish on their doorstep.

36:07.165 --> 36:10.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, you're
here for a series
of conversations among defense
secretaries

36:10.802 --> 36:15.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and other world leaders on what
to do in this
fight. What is the United
Kingdom prepared

36:15.473 --> 36:17.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to do? What more are you
prepared to do?

36:17.342 --> 36:20.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, we're
already playing
the second part, after the
United States,

36:20.612 --> 36:24.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this fight. We have carried
out the second
highest number of airstrikes.

36:25.083 --> 36:32.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We provide a large portion of
the surveillance
through aircraft ahead. And we
have trained

36:32.690 --> 36:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around 19,000 Iraqi and Kurdish
troops, specialist
training in how to deal with
improvised explosive

36:41.466 --> 36:46.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devices. So we're playing a big
part in this.
And we have announced recently
that we're

36:46.771 --> 36:50.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stepping up, putting more troops
in, as the
United States has asked every
member of the

36:51.076 --> 36:52.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coalition to do.

36:53.044 --> 36:57.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are doubling the number of
troops we have
in Iraq itself, so that they can
do more training,

36:57.549 --> 37:03.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to really pick up on the
momentum there is
now. ISIS is being pushed back
along the Tigris

37:03.955 --> 37:09.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the Euphrates. Towns and
cities are being
liberated. And we want to keep
that momentum

37:09.627 --> 37:11.463 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But when you
think of fighting
wars as a defense secretary, how
do you deal

37:13.431 --> 37:17.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the shift that's happened
in your enemies?
We're no longer fighting enemies
who are on

37:17.268 --> 37:21.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a battlefield wearing a uniform
with certain
colors on the other side of a
line. Right?

37:21.973 --> 37:26.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we have shifted to an
insurgency strategy.
And then now it seems, with the
attacks that

37:26.444 --> 37:30.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been happening all through
Europe, these
are lone wolves,
self-radicalized. And it

37:30.448 --> 37:33.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
somehow falls on your doorstep
to say, let's
keep the country safe.

37:33.485 --> 37:37.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: You're right.
There is no
front line in these conflicts
anymore.

37:37.355 --> 37:41.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this requires new tactics.
You need to
deal with their hybrid warfare,
the kind of

37:41.826 --> 37:47.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
messages they're pumping out to
sustain this
very poisonous ideology. And
then you need

37:47.799 --> 37:52.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to deal with them where they
have captured
particular cities and they're
imposing barbaric

37:52.737 --> 37:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
punishments on the citizens or
imposing very
high taxes.

37:57.208 --> 38:02.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you need to deal with all
these things.
In the end, these things can
only be done

38:02.447 --> 38:09.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
locally. They have to be won by
local forces
with security provided by the
government in

38:09.420 --> 38:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that country. Now, we can help.
We can help
with airpower, with technology,
with training,

38:14.993 --> 38:19.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with resources, help to
stabilize these countries
once they have been liberated.

38:19.364 --> 38:25.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the end, the fight has
to be on the
ground by local forces that can
retain the

38:25.770 --> 38:27.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hearts and minds of the people
that they're
freeing.

38:28.072 --> 38:31.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, Britain
went through
a big decision-making process
just a few weeks

38:31.676 --> 38:37.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago. Before that decision, you
were a remainer.
You wanted to stay in the E.U.,
it's no secret.

38:38.049 --> 38:42.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You said during that time that
U.K.'s departure
would actually weaken Europe, it
would strengthen

38:42.120 --> 38:43.054 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Russia's hand.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here we are, after the vote.
Your thoughts?

38:45.156 --> 38:50.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, NATO is
the -- the North
Atlantic alliance is the
principal security

38:50.428 --> 38:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we have that Britain is
part of in Europe.
And we have added more troops to
the eastern

38:55.800 --> 38:58.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
border of NATO. We have stepped
up to that.

38:58.937 --> 39:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Being inside the European Union
gave us another
lever. It was the union, not
NATO, for example,

39:05.043 --> 39:09.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that imposed sanctions on
Russia, and we will
continue in the remaining years
we're inside

39:10.014 --> 39:14.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the European Union to keep those
sanctions
up, to keep the pressure up on
Russia.

39:14.819 --> 39:18.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would rather we would have
stayed. But the
people have decided. We have had
the vote

39:19.057 --> 39:24.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now. And what we have to do is
make a success
of leaving the European Union,
develop new

39:24.996 --> 39:31.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relations with Europe, ensure
our trade is
protected, and to continue to
play our part

39:31.202 --> 39:36.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the security of Europe, which
we're doing
through a greater commitment to
NATO and more

39:36.975 --> 39:39.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work with our key allies, like
the United
States.

39:39.444 --> 39:43.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Just in the
last few weeks,
we had a series of reports
coming out of Eastern

39:43.114 --> 39:48.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe on how NATO is preparing
for the possibility
of Russian aggression in places
like Poland,

39:48.286 --> 39:50.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
places like Estonia.

39:50.221 --> 39:54.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What happens if Estonia raises
its hand and
says, NATO, I need help right
now? How likely

39:54.425 --> 39:58.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the U.K. to want to help a
member of the
E.U. that also might may be a
member of the

39:58.663 --> 40:00.231 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
NATO alliance?

40:00.331 --> 40:01.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, all
members of NATO
are committed to help each
other.

40:02.033 --> 40:05.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, the Baltic states,
including
Estonia, have put their hands up
and said,

40:05.803 --> 40:10.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we want more reassurance. We
have got Russia
conducting large-scale exercises
right on

40:10.575 --> 40:17.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their doorstep, flying planes
over the Baltic,
and intimidating them through
hybrid and social

40:17.515 --> 40:19.350 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
media.

40:19.450 --> 40:23.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we are stepping forward, as
one of the
four countries deploying a new
forward presence,

40:24.055 --> 40:30.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an entire battalion in Estonia
from next year,
with French and Danish troops
added to it.

40:30.828 --> 40:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United States is doing the
same in Poland
itself. So we're all helping
there to give

40:36.000 --> 40:40.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more reassurance on the on the
eastern side
of NATO and making it very clear
to Russia

40:40.438 --> 40:46.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that, if they attempt to
intervene in a NATO
country, in the way that they
did in Ukraine,

40:46.311 --> 40:48.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is outside NATO, then
there will be
consequences.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Defense Secretary
Michael Fallon, thanks for
joining us.

40:51.416 --> 40:55.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Thank you.

40:56.020 --> 41:12.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, as
the International
AIDS Conference convenes in
Durban, South

41:12.136 --> 41:15.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Africa, this week, we continue
our End of
AIDS series.

41:15.239 --> 41:19.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we have been reporting,
public health officials
believe that getting the
overwhelming majority

41:20.044 --> 41:26.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of HIV-positive people tested
and consistently
treated is a crucial step to
ending the epidemic,

41:26.417 --> 41:28.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but that's proven a difficult
goal.

41:28.720 --> 41:32.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in Western Kenya, on the
border with Uganda,
there's a small island where
researchers are

41:32.857 --> 41:36.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
finding remarkable success with
even the hardest-to-reach
groups.

41:36.994 --> 41:40.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Correspondent William Brangham
and producer
Jason Kane continue our series,
with support

41:40.732 --> 41:44.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the Pulitzer Center on
Crisis Reporting.

41:44.302 --> 41:49.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's late on a
Monday night.

41:49.307 --> 41:53.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fisherman Kevin Opiyo and his
crew are heading
out onto Lake Victoria on the
very western

41:53.644 --> 42:01.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
edge of Kenya. They throw out
their lines
and stretch out their nets,
hoping the tiny

42:01.886 --> 42:05.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
omena fish are schooling below.

42:05.523 --> 42:11.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fishing these waters is long,
grueling, dangerous
work. It's also become one of
the main pathways

42:11.696 --> 42:15.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for the growth of the HIV
epidemic in this
part of Kenya.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Opiyo himself is infected.

42:17.268 --> 42:21.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN OPIYO, Fisherman (through
translator):
I'm confident that I got it
through sexual

42:21.272 --> 42:24.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intercourse and can say it was
the time I
was working in Remba.

42:24.642 --> 42:29.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Fishing crews
often have
travel long distances to other
islands on

42:29.113 --> 42:30.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the lake, and into neighboring
Uganda.

42:31.048 --> 42:35.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MOSES KAMYA, HIV Researcher:
I think there's
a mentality among fishermen that
life is not

42:35.653 --> 42:39.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as important. Therefore, you can
enjoy it
and have as much sex as you can.

42:39.690 --> 42:43.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Moses
Kamya is an HIV
researcher who's been working
with fishermen

42:43.795 --> 42:45.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the region for years.

42:45.630 --> 42:50.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MOSES KAMYA: You know,
fishermen tend
to have a lot of disposable
income, and, you

42:50.301 --> 42:58.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, they can buy sex very
easily. And, of
course, where fishermen are,
there are, you

42:58.910 --> 43:01.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, sex workers who hang
around them.

43:01.579 --> 43:06.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The fishermen
live on Mfangano
Island here on Lake Victoria,
near the border

43:06.751 --> 43:12.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Uganda. The island's 25,000
residents
live clustered in homes near the
water, and

43:12.723 --> 43:14.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fishing is the main industry.

43:14.992 --> 43:19.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Largely because of this
migratory fishing,
it's estimated that nearly one
out of every

43:19.430 --> 43:26.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three adults here is infected
with HIV. We
traveled to Mfangano Island with
Jon Cohen.

43:27.038 --> 43:31.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's covered the epidemic for
"Science" magazine
in more than two dozen countries
and helped

43:31.209 --> 43:33.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
us report this series.

43:33.144 --> 43:37.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON COHEN, "Science": Here in
this region,
the HIV prevalence in fishermen
is incredibly

43:37.582 --> 43:42.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high. I mean, we're talking on
the order of
30, 40 percent. That's something
you see in

43:42.353 --> 43:46.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who inject drugs. It's
something you
see in sex workers. But people
haven't thought

43:46.858 --> 43:52.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about heterosexual men as being
a key affected
population, and these fishermen,
they are.

43:52.763 --> 43:57.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, to stem
this epidemic,
how do you reach this
hard-to-reach population?

43:57.969 --> 44:03.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, you try something like
this.

44:03.508 --> 44:10.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is what state-of-the-art
HIV care and
prevention in Kenya looks like.
You set up

44:10.281 --> 44:14.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your testing team, not in a
clinic, but right
next to the water. You do it at
night, because

44:14.685 --> 44:19.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's when the fishermen are
coming home.
You get a band to play. You give
away prizes.

44:19.257 --> 44:24.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DIANE HAVLIR, University of
California,
San Francisco: What we have
done, in order

44:24.829 --> 44:31.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have a place where people
want to go test,
is made it accessible to them.
We have brought

44:31.536 --> 44:36.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
testing to people, as opposed to
having people
have to go for the test.

44:36.307 --> 44:40.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Diane
Havlir is one
of the world's foremost experts
on treating

44:40.111 --> 44:44.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HIV. As we reported earlier,
she's helping
lead San Francisco's ambitious
strategy to

44:45.016 --> 44:49.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end the epidemic there, and
she's helping
run one of the largest HIV
test-and-treat

44:49.720 --> 44:52.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
studies in the world here and in
Uganda.

44:52.757 --> 44:56.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The study, sponsored by the
U.S., Kenya and
Uganda, is called SEARCH.

44:56.894 --> 45:00.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DIANE HAVLIR: HIV medicines
have been
transformative for the
individual. So what

45:01.098 --> 45:07.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're testing in SEARCH is, can
we transform
communities with treatment?

45:07.672 --> 45:09.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Not just
individuals.

45:09.407 --> 45:12.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DIANE HAVLIR: Not just
individuals, the
whole community. And in order to
do that,

45:12.910 --> 45:16.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the first things that we
had to do
was to figure out how to offer
testing to

45:16.948 --> 45:22.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every person, not just people
who were sick,
every single person in that
community.

45:22.553 --> 45:25.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Kenya, like
most governments
in the developing world, only
starts people

45:26.057 --> 45:30.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with HIV on treatment after
their immune system
becomes compromised.

45:30.227 --> 45:35.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the SEARCH study is trying
to determine
whether treating HIV-positive
people immediately,

45:35.199 --> 45:39.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regardless of how sick they are,
can have
an impact across the entire
community. But

45:39.804 --> 45:45.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the problem still exists that
men here, particularly
fishermen, have generally been
very reluctant

45:45.276 --> 45:46.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get tested.

45:46.978 --> 45:49.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JAMES AYIEKO, SEARCH: We are
not able
to get to him. So, that's a
challenge.

45:49.480 --> 45:52.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: DR. James
Ayieko is one
of the doctors with the SEARCH
study.

45:52.817 --> 46:01.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JAMES AYIEKO: Our system
doesn't make
health care-seeking a manly
thing. So, you

46:01.559 --> 46:06.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to get something extra that
would motivate
them, you know, to come to care.

46:07.031 --> 46:11.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The SEARCH
team also makes
an economic argument to
fishermen: If you

46:11.469 --> 46:15.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't treat your HIV, you will
get sicker,
and it's going to cost you
because you can't

46:15.539 --> 46:17.475 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

46:17.575 --> 46:21.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JAMES AYIEKO: You know, if
you're infected,
you can stay out there. The
disease will progress,

46:21.145 --> 46:25.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you will get worse, and then you
might be
brought in, in a stretcher to
the hospital,

46:25.850 --> 46:32.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is not a good option. So,
the idea,
this study is trying to bring
the idea of,

46:32.657 --> 46:34.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we can keep you healthy as you
are.

46:34.625 --> 46:38.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Fisherman
Kevin Opiyo thought
he might have gotten HIV, but
even when he

46:38.529 --> 46:43.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
started to feel sick and weak
and found it
hard to work, he still didn't
want to get

46:43.234 --> 46:45.002 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tested.

46:45.102 --> 46:47.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KEVIN OPIYO (through
translator): It was fear
of my past life, fear of the
ladies that I

46:48.039 --> 46:52.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
used to move around with. It was
that fear
that kept me away from testing.

46:52.109 --> 46:55.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It was likely
during this
period that Opiyo brought the
virus home to

46:55.946 --> 46:57.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the island and infected his wife
as well.

46:58.049 --> 47:02.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DIANE HAVLIR: One of the
things which,
sadly, still exists in HIV, it
remains a highly

47:02.653 --> 47:09.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stigmatized disease. And people
may suspect
they're at risk for HIV disease.
They may

47:09.393 --> 47:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deny to themselves they're at
risk for HIV
disease. So, it takes a lot of
energy, often,

47:16.000 --> 47:19.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a person to go to seek
testing.

47:19.236 --> 47:24.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At SEARCH's
community health
events, they know the stigma of
HIV and AIDS

47:24.475 --> 47:29.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will keep people away, so they
don't call
this an HIV event, and it isn't
just that.

47:29.647 --> 47:34.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They offer testing and care for
all sorts
of health issues: diabetes,
family planning,

47:34.819 --> 47:41.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hypertension, as well as HIV.

47:41.726 --> 47:46.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On this day, they even ran a
boat race to
attract more fishermen to the
event. Six teams

47:46.664 --> 47:52.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of young men competed in a race.
The prize?
Brand-new cell phones. But, of
course, you

47:52.236 --> 47:54.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
couldn't compete until you got
tested.

47:54.672 --> 47:59.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Craig Cohen is part of the
SEARCH team,
and he says this broader health
approach is

47:59.844 --> 48:01.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more appealing for men.

48:01.712 --> 48:03.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. CRAIG COHEN, SEARCH: I'm
going there to
make sure that I'm healthy, that
my family's

48:03.948 --> 48:05.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
healthy, my children are
healthy.

48:05.416 --> 48:07.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It provides
cover, in a
sense.

48:07.251 --> 48:11.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. CRAIG COHEN: It's not just
cover. I mean,
these other conditions --
malaria is super

48:12.022 --> 48:16.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
endemic here, depending on the
season. It
also helps to build up a sense
of camaraderie

48:17.061 --> 48:21.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around health, so that people
are understanding
that the clinic here is here for
everyone,

48:22.099 --> 48:27.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether you're 70 years old, or
50 years old
living with diabetes, whether
you're 40 years

48:27.404 --> 48:28.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
old and living with HIV.

48:28.405 --> 48:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Making the
tent bigger.

48:30.341 --> 48:33.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. CRAIG COHEN: Making the tent
much bigger,
and understanding that health is
about everyone.

48:33.778 --> 48:38.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HIV is part -- is under that
tent. It's not
an HIV tent. It's a health tent.

48:38.749 --> 48:42.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But even after
people are
diagnosed with HIV and get
started right away

48:42.720 --> 48:48.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on daily treatment, the next
challenge becomes
keeping them in treatment.

48:48.793 --> 48:55.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for those who fall out of
care, the SEARCH
team will come find you. Today,
the team is

48:55.199 --> 49:02.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out looking for another
HIV-positive fisherman
who'd missed his last
appointment.

49:02.406 --> 49:07.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If someone stops taking their
HIV meds, the
virus will surge back, making
the person sicker.

49:07.611 --> 49:12.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a resurgent virus means
you're also much
more likely to pass the virus to
others. A

49:12.917 --> 49:16.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
person who's on regular
treatment almost never
does that.

49:16.120 --> 49:19.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they found the missing
fisherman, persuaded
him to come back to the clinic
on the spot,

49:19.990 --> 49:25.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and made sure he stayed on his
meds, one more
success in a long campaign.

49:25.796 --> 49:33.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two years ago, the U.N. set an
ambitious HIV/AIDS
goal called 90-90-90. It said
that, by the

49:33.671 --> 49:39.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year 2020, 90 percent of people
who have HIV
should know their status, that
90 percent

49:39.577 --> 49:44.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of those people should be taking
antiretroviral
treatment, and that 90 percent
of them should

49:44.782 --> 49:50.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be treated consistently enough
that the virus
is suppressed, undetectable in
their blood,

49:50.554 --> 49:52.857 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all that by 2020.

49:52.957 --> 49:56.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here on this Kenyan island,
thanks in
large part to the SEARCH study,
they have

49:57.094 --> 50:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
already hit that goal four years
early. There
are few other places in the
world with similar

50:02.533 --> 50:07.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
success. Of course, replicating
what's happening
here across an entire nation, or
the rest

50:07.671 --> 50:12.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the world, will require
enormous funding
and effort, but the SEARCH team
hopes that

50:12.776 --> 50:15.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by proving what works, they can
set an example.

50:15.346 --> 50:21.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JAMES AYIEKO: I think a
study like the
SEARCH trial is giving out
evidence to show

50:21.952 --> 50:28.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that what was hypothesized is
really -- is
really going to be the direction
that HIV

50:28.959 --> 50:30.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
treatment and care should go.

50:30.728 --> 50:35.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Having hit
this 90-90-90
goal, the SEARCH team is
monitoring their

50:35.299 --> 50:40.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
broader aim of creating
community-wide change.
The study has found that, by
treating people

50:40.271 --> 50:45.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with HIV immediately, those
individuals have
been working an entire week more
per month,

50:45.776 --> 50:48.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
compared to those who waited to
start treatment.

50:48.279 --> 50:52.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A large percentage of the
community is, of
course, still living with HIV
from before

50:52.182 --> 50:56.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this study began, but far fewer
people are
dying from it, and the virus is
much less

50:57.087 --> 50:58.889 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
likely to spread.

50:58.989 --> 51:04.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DIANE HAVLIR: When people
are taking a
treatment that is changing a
uniformly fatal

51:04.461 --> 51:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disease to a chronic disease,
they think about
investments differently. They
think about

51:09.500 --> 51:13.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investing, for example, in their
farming,
maybe in their fishing. And they
think about

51:13.771 --> 51:15.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investing more and having their
children go
to school.

51:15.940 --> 51:20.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But Jon Cohen
says this
still may come up short on the
broader goal

51:20.744 --> 51:22.579 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of ending AIDS.

51:22.680 --> 51:27.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON COHEN: The whole idea of
test and treat,
it may or may not be enough to
break the back

51:27.918 --> 51:34.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of an epidemic. We really don't
know. You
know, it could be that you get
to 90-90-90,

51:34.825 --> 51:39.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and transmissions are still
occurring at too
high of a rate to really stop
the epidemic

51:39.496 --> 51:41.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from being an epidemic.

51:41.398 --> 51:46.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The SEARCH
study here will
be wrapping up by 2020. It's
hoped that, if

51:46.503 --> 51:51.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's successful enough, these
practices will
be embedded into HIV care more
permanently

51:51.275 --> 51:55.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
throughout Kenya and Uganda and
perhaps the
rest of the world.

51:55.279 --> 52:00.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
