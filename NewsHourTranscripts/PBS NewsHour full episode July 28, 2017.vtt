JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.766 --> 00:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.766 --> 00:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
a White House shakeup
at the highest level.

00:10.600 --> 00:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump picks Secretary
of Homeland Security John Kelly
as his new chief of staff,

00:16.733 --> 00:17.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
replacing Reince Priebus.

00:17.866 --> 00:18.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Then:

00:18.866 --> 00:20.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:20.900 --> 00:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: This is, you know,
clearly a disappointing moment.

00:22.933 --> 00:25.000 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A
dramatic defeat.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The U.S. Senate fails
to pass health care
reform in an overnight
vote, dealing a painful

00:31.366 --> 00:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
blow to the president
and the Republican Party.

00:34.333 --> 00:36.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's Friday.

00:36.500 --> 00:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mark Shields and David
Brooks weigh in on all
these developments,
capping yet another

00:39.833 --> 00:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tumultuous week for the
Trump administration.

00:43.033 --> 00:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: Detroit's violent past
put to paint - - how the
deadly 1967 riots inspire a new

00:50.933 --> 00:53.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
generation of artists
in the Motor City.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRINA CHATMAN, Curator,
Charles H. Wright Museum
of African-American
History: You see

00:55.366 --> 00:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the emotions of the
artists, describing history
from their perspective.

00:59.366 --> 01:00.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I see the politics.

01:00.900 --> 01:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I see the social concerns
that people had in it.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I see their pain.

01:06.800 --> 01:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:12.766 --> 01:14.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:14.966 --> 01:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reince Priebus
is out as White House chief of
staff tonight, after just six

01:27.066 --> 01:29.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
months on the job.

01:29.066 --> 01:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump announced in
a tweet late today that John
Kelly, the secretary of homeland

01:33.800 --> 01:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
security, will take his place.

01:35.966 --> 01:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president had more to say
after returning from a day trip
to New York, a trip that Priebus

01:41.466 --> 01:43.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
was on.

01:43.166 --> 01:46.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP, President
of the United States:
Reince is a good man.

01:46.100 --> 01:49.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John Kelly will do
a fantastic job.

01:49.266 --> 01:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
General Kelly has been a star,
done an incredible job thus far,
respected by everybody, a great,

01:56.633 --> 01:57.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
great American.

01:57.633 --> 01:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Reince Priebus, a good man.

01:58.633 --> 02:00.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

02:00.833 --> 02:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to help
unpack what led to this change
at the top, I'm joined now

02:05.066 --> 02:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Robert Costa, reporter
for The Washington
Post and moderator of
"Washington Week" here

02:10.533 --> 02:11.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on PBS.

02:11.300 --> 02:13.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome, Robert.

02:13.366 --> 02:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as I go to you, I'm going
to share with everybody just
briefly what the president's

02:15.733 --> 02:17.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tweets were.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He tweeted -- this was late
this afternoon - - he said: "I
am pleased to inform you that

02:20.100 --> 02:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just named General
Secretary John F. Kelly as
White House chief of staff.

02:24.666 --> 02:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's a great American
and great leader.

02:27.100 --> 02:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He said: "John has also
done a spectacular job
at Homeland Security.

02:31.533 --> 02:34.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's been a true star
of my administration."

02:34.000 --> 02:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And finally, he said: "I would
like to thank Reince Priebus
for his service and dedication

02:37.500 --> 02:38.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to this country.

02:38.900 --> 02:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We accomplished a lot together
and I'm proud of him!"

02:42.466 --> 02:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I guess it didn't work out.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: It was a sudden
change, Judy, but it was also
a change that was in the works

02:47.666 --> 02:49.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for months.

02:49.766 --> 02:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president brought on Reince
Priebus because he saw him as
a whisperer to House speaker,

02:53.466 --> 02:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Ryan, a close friend of
Priebus from Wisconsin and
he thought Priebus could help

02:57.266 --> 02:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
get his legislative
agenda through.

02:59.566 --> 03:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as that agenda stalled on
health care and other fronts,
he began to muse in recent

03:03.600 --> 03:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
months with friends about
perhaps making a change at
the top of the White House.

03:07.666 --> 03:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kelly has been at the forefront
of his mind because he's
not a dramatic future and he

03:11.766 --> 03:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has executed for the president
on immigration policy.

03:14.033 --> 03:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There have
been so many ups and downs,
as you know very well, because

03:17.666 --> 03:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have been covering it every
day, for this White House.

03:20.600 --> 03:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did the president
see Reince Priebus as
connected to that or not?

03:25.033 --> 03:27.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Did he blame him for
what's been going on?

03:27.000 --> 03:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: He thought
Priebus, because he had run the
Republican National Committee,

03:30.700 --> 03:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
could be a stabilizing force.

03:32.700 --> 03:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Priebus as RNC chairman
was always a low-key presence.

03:36.366 --> 03:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wasn't who was known for
managing a large organization
in a military-style fashion.

03:42.833 --> 03:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president wanted that
kind of person to come in.

03:44.733 --> 03:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's important to note
that Kelly has a strong
relationship with Jared Kushner,

03:47.933 --> 03:51.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the senior adviser, and
actually Steve Bannon,
the chief strategist.

03:51.533 --> 03:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they represent the two poles
in this warring White House.

03:54.700 --> 03:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there is an expectation now
from my sources that Kelly can
come in and try to be a calming

04:00.233 --> 04:02.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
force.

04:02.266 --> 04:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned
the two poles, but we also
had the announcement the other

04:04.300 --> 04:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day from the president he is
bringing in a new communications
director, Anthony Scaramucci,

04:09.733 --> 04:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who has been in a
very visible war.

04:12.333 --> 04:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the language that he used
in that conversation with a "New
Yorker" magazine reporter was

04:20.300 --> 04:23.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
making all kind of news
headlines yesterday.

04:23.033 --> 04:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How does that fit into all this?

04:25.133 --> 04:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: No, it's a smart
observation, because it does
seem incongruent to have this

04:28.566 --> 04:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
swashbuckling New Yorker in
Anthony Scaramucci now working
alongside General Kelly, who is

04:34.766 --> 04:36.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
known for being a
very precise man.

04:36.866 --> 04:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it really reflects how the
president is trying to turn to
his loyalists from New York,

04:40.600 --> 04:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as well as to military figures
as he tries to right the ship.

04:44.866 --> 04:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He knows his health care
legislation is going nowhere
right now on Capitol Hill.

04:49.400 --> 04:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's trying to recover
his presidency, turning
to two different types,
the New Yorkers and

04:55.100 --> 04:57.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the military.

04:57.200 --> 05:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, does this
look to you, Robert, like
this is a team that can work

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
smoothly together, that can get
this White House back on some
semblance of a normal track?

05:06.966 --> 05:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: Well, General
Kelly has said publicly in
the past that he would like to

05:09.366 --> 05:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
maybe try to monitor the
president's calls, that
he thinks there could
be more organization

05:14.233 --> 05:16.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
inside of the West Wing.

05:16.366 --> 05:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to be interesting
to see if he can really try
to contain the Oval Office.

05:19.133 --> 05:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is an Oval Office
that's known for having
a lot of entryway, people
coming in and offering

05:23.433 --> 05:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their advice, often
unsolicited, to the president.

05:26.233 --> 05:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Kelly can get ahold of that
in a way Priebus never did,
maybe he can turn it around.

05:30.366 --> 05:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he also has to navigate
all the different circles
around President Trump.

05:34.133 --> 05:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is someone who is known
not just for having a
straight chain of command.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He talks to a lot of
people all the time.

05:39.266 --> 05:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking
of which, what one hears is
that this is a president who

05:42.466 --> 05:44.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really likes to be his
own chief of staff.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT COSTA: Indeed.

05:45.266 --> 05:46.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He likes
-- he's a detail person.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He wants to know what everybody
is doing, how they're doing it.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How is likely to fit with
somebody like General Kelly?

05:52.433 --> 05:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: General Kelly
doesn't have a deep personal
relationship with President

05:56.333 --> 05:57.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

05:57.466 --> 05:59.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Will he stop the
president from tweeting?

05:59.300 --> 06:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's what all my
sources want to know.

06:01.533 --> 06:05.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Can he actually stop
the president from, as
you say, being his own
chief of staff, being

06:05.166 --> 06:07.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his own spokesman?

06:07.633 --> 06:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For now, it seems like
Scaramucci and others
are channeling the
president in their public

06:10.266 --> 06:12.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
presentation, not
trying to hold him back.

06:12.233 --> 06:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The other thing,
Robert, I have to raise are
the so-called -- what the

06:15.566 --> 06:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House and the president
like to call the leaks which
they say are coming from a

06:19.933 --> 06:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of people in the White
House and the administration
that shouldn't be, but
then the stories one

06:26.866 --> 06:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also hears that not only is
the president talking to the
press, but people at the highest

06:29.633 --> 06:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
levels in the White House.

06:31.566 --> 06:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How is all that likely to change
or not as a result of this?

06:34.700 --> 06:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: It's a very
messy situation, because the
president is furious behind the

06:38.400 --> 06:40.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
scenes.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's telling his aides that
they need to stop the leaks,
but often these leaks are coming

06:42.600 --> 06:45.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from some of his own
White House officials.

06:45.200 --> 06:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a big difference
between intelligence
community leaks and leaks
about palace intrigue

06:50.933 --> 06:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
inside of the West Wing.

06:52.900 --> 06:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a lot of the president's
aides are just trying to reflect
his own unhappiness about

06:55.800 --> 06:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a White House he thinks
that is talking too much.

06:58.033 --> 07:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it is --
as you and I were just saying,
it's one more tumultuous

07:01.566 --> 07:03.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
day in what's been
nonstop tumult.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: And everyone was
thinking maybe Attorney General
Sessions would be the person

07:06.866 --> 07:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go at the end of this week,
after all of his struggles
with President Trump, but it

07:10.400 --> 07:12.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was Priebus.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we don't
know what is going to happen
to the attorney general at this

07:15.166 --> 07:16.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
point.

07:16.166 --> 07:17.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT COSTA: We do not.

07:17.166 --> 07:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Robert Costa, thanks.

07:19.166 --> 07:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you're going to have much
more on "Washington Week"
on all these PBS stations.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT COSTA: Thank you.

07:23.266 --> 07:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to the
day's other big story, and
that is the collapse of Senate

07:26.933 --> 07:29.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republican efforts to
pass a health care bill.

07:29.866 --> 07:34.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A last-ditch effort
for a partial repeal of
Obamacare failed by a
single vote early today,

07:36.433 --> 07:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
frustrating Republican
leaders and the president.

07:38.900 --> 07:41.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins
begins our coverage.

07:41.500 --> 07:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: President Trump
today showed no sign of backing
down, despite the stunning

07:47.666 --> 07:49.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Senate defeat.

07:49.733 --> 07:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of
the United States: They should
have approved health care last

07:51.500 --> 07:53.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
night, but you can't
have everything.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Boy, oh, boy.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have been working on
that one for seven years.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can you believe that?

07:58.600 --> 07:59.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The swamp.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But we will get it done.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're going get it done.

08:04.466 --> 08:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At an event for
police officers in Ronkonkoma,
New York, he was blunt.

08:07.333 --> 08:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: You
know, I said from the
beginning, let Obamacare
implode, and then do it.

08:13.666 --> 08:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I turned out to be right.

08:16.466 --> 08:17.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let Obamacare implode.

08:17.766 --> 08:19.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

08:19.266 --> 08:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All this after
the Senate's overnight drama.

08:25.266 --> 08:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Outside the Capitol stood
a crowd of protesters.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Inside, around 10:00 p.m.

08:28.666 --> 08:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last night, Republicans had
just released their bill, and
Democrats like Chris Murphy

08:32.833 --> 08:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were irate that the vote on
it was in just two hours.

08:36.333 --> 08:38.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:38.400 --> 08:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS MURPHY (D), Connecticut:
This is nuclear-grade bonkers,
what is happening here tonight.

08:41.900 --> 08:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Hawaii Democrat
Mazie Hirono, now being treated
for kidney cancer, added

08:46.800 --> 08:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a personal dimension.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:49.833 --> 08:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAZIE HIRONO (D), Hawaii: I
lost a sister to pneumonia
when she was only 2 years old

08:56.000 --> 08:57.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Japan.

08:57.500 --> 09:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She died at home, so I know
how important health care is.

09:01.433 --> 09:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I don't get is why
every single senator
doesn't know that know that.

09:08.433 --> 09:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: A frustrated
Senator Mike Enzi, Republican
of Wyoming, said Democrats

09:11.766 --> 09:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
offered only complaints.

09:12.933 --> 09:14.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:14.900 --> 09:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL B. ENZI (R),
Wyoming: And I started
hearing, it's not perfect.

09:17.233 --> 09:19.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not perfect.

09:19.200 --> 09:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, where are the
suggestions for making it
as near perfect as possible?

09:25.366 --> 09:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And so, shortly
after midnight, a first vote
began, with Democrats somber

09:29.666 --> 09:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and in their seats.

09:31.533 --> 09:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the opposite side,
slowly arriving Republicans
were more social.

09:35.233 --> 09:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But something notable, Alaska
Senator Lisa Murkowski walked
over to Arizona's John McCain,

09:41.266 --> 09:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and he signaled a thumbs down.

09:43.533 --> 09:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Murkowski, along with Susan
Collins of Maine, were
two expected no votes.

09:48.233 --> 09:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Soon, Vice President Mike Pence
stepped over, shook hands and
then spent a long 20 minutes

09:54.600 --> 09:56.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
apparently trying to
win McCain's vote.

09:56.966 --> 09:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Minutes later, another signal.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
McCain walked over to Democrats.

10:01.633 --> 10:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A large group surrounded him.

10:03.566 --> 10:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nearby, GOP Leader Mitch
McConnell walked the other way,
just as McCain was embraced

10:09.800 --> 10:12.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by California's
Dianne Feinstein.

10:12.966 --> 10:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The final vote resembled a
great sporting event, Democrats
on their feet as McCain walked

10:18.800 --> 10:20.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up to vote.

10:20.700 --> 10:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some, like Massachusetts'
Elizabeth Warren,
leaned to watch him.

10:23.666 --> 10:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he signaled his vote
with a simple thumbs down.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

10:29.733 --> 10:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Democrats
gasped and clapped,
before their leader waved
them off and stopped

10:34.000 --> 10:35.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the applause.

10:35.833 --> 10:39.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Outside, protesters
did not hold back.

10:39.166 --> 10:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It all marked a seismic shift
in momentum and emotions.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:44.266 --> 10:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: This is, you know,
clearly a disappointing moment.

10:46.500 --> 10:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Republican
Leader McConnell thanked his
side and slammed Democrats.

10:50.133 --> 10:52.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL: Now, I imagine
many of our colleagues on the
other side are celebrating.

10:54.533 --> 10:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the American people are
going to regret that we couldn't
find a better way forward.

11:03.600 --> 11:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as I said, we look forward
to our colleagues on the other
side suggesting what they have

11:13.500 --> 11:15.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in mind.

11:15.366 --> 11:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As the
night turned to day,
bipartisan calls grew louder.

11:18.900 --> 11:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democratic Minority Leader Chuck
Schumer said his party is ready.

11:21.966 --> 11:24.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:24.100 --> 11:24.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY),
Minority Leader: I hope
we can work together to
make the system better

11:24.900 --> 11:27.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a bipartisan way.

11:27.866 --> 11:31.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I'm optimistic
that that can happen.

11:31.100 --> 11:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nobody has said
Obamacare is perfect.

11:34.466 --> 11:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nobody has said our health care
system doesn't need fixing.

11:37.533 --> 11:40.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: So,
where does that begin?

11:40.333 --> 11:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Likely with a return to the
traditional committee process.

11:43.566 --> 11:48.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa
joins me now for more,
along with Sarah Kliff.

11:50.466 --> 11:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a senior policy
correspondent for the Web site
Vox, and she covers health care.

11:53.166 --> 11:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you were with us last night.

11:54.933 --> 11:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we wanted to have you
both with us again tonight.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, Lisa, what a lot of drama.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You were up most of the
night covering that.

12:01.700 --> 12:02.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where do things stand?

12:02.700 --> 12:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where do they go from here?

12:04.800 --> 12:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It seems like
the idea is that perhaps they
can get help from the Health

12:07.866 --> 12:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Committee, which is the
Health, Labor and Pensions
Committee in the Senate.

12:11.933 --> 12:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One reason for that, Judy,
not just because its covers
health care, but because of its

12:14.633 --> 12:16.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
leaders.

12:16.700 --> 12:19.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Senator Lamar Alexander
of Tennessee is the
Republican chairman,
and the ranking Democrat

12:19.500 --> 12:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is Patty Murray, both of them
senior members of their party
who thought are of very highly

12:24.233 --> 12:26.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and who have done
bipartisan deals before.

12:26.900 --> 12:29.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senator Alexander is
planning hearings.

12:29.133 --> 12:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're hoping that
something comes of this
in the way of legislation.

12:31.933 --> 12:35.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Also, Judy, there were
conversations on and off
the floor last night.

12:35.166 --> 12:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Perdue told me already
Republicans and Democrats
speaking with each other.

12:38.966 --> 12:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But they all have
one problem still.

12:41.333 --> 12:43.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Unclear what could pass.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seemed like last night's
vote was very close, but the
truth is, Judy, is that McCain

12:46.566 --> 12:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was expressing something
a lot of Republicans felt.

12:49.333 --> 12:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This bill was far short of a
number of people who really
wanted it to become law.

12:53.533 --> 12:56.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what
are the roadblocks?

12:56.033 --> 12:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is it figuring out the policy?

12:58.100 --> 13:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because I have had people
say to me, well, if you could
just put folks in a room and

13:01.233 --> 13:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not worry about politics,
you could get it done.

13:04.100 --> 13:06.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But you're suggesting
it's not that simple.

13:06.366 --> 13:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's
complicated because
Republicans have tried
to put a lot of together

13:09.733 --> 13:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
different ideas together here.

13:11.766 --> 13:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For one, Planned Parenthood,
defunding Planned Parenthood
has been part of that.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's something that
Susan Collins and Lisa
Murkowski haven't liked.

13:17.500 --> 13:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is an idea that, if they
pared it down and focused on
fixing the Affordable Care

13:21.433 --> 13:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Act, that perhaps, perhaps
they can come up with
some ideas they share.

13:25.300 --> 13:29.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this is just less than 24
hours after things fell apart.

13:29.766 --> 13:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that is the hope right now.

13:31.833 --> 13:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about what's at stake as they
figure this out, Sarah Kliff,

13:36.100 --> 13:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because, until there is new
legislation, the Affordable
Care Act is in effect.

13:41.700 --> 13:42.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's out there.

13:42.933 --> 13:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's going to happen to it?

13:44.533 --> 13:46.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SARAH KLIFF, Vox: That
is a fantastic question,
and you're right.

13:46.633 --> 13:49.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are millions of
people who get coverage
through the Affordable
Care Act, particularly

13:49.566 --> 13:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
through the marketplaces.

13:51.233 --> 13:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
These are people who buy
private insurance, often
with tax subsidies,.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we are expecting some pretty
significant premium increases
unless we have some kind

13:58.533 --> 14:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of changes in policy from
the Trump administration.

14:01.333 --> 14:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have done some things
to increase uncertainty.

14:03.633 --> 14:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when insurance companies
sense uncertainty, they
react by raising prices.

14:07.333 --> 14:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what we're seeing
in the marketplaces right now.

14:10.033 --> 14:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
are insurance companies
- - I know it's only
been not even 24 hours

14:13.833 --> 14:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since this happened, but
what's your understanding,
from having reported on
this for a long time,

14:19.866 --> 14:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that insurance
companies need to have?

14:21.933 --> 14:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are they looking for
as Congress works its way
through at this point?

14:25.200 --> 14:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: They're going
to be looking for two things.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They want to know that
the individual mandate,
the requirement to
carry health insurance,

14:30.933 --> 14:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that will be enforced by
the Trump administration.

14:33.333 --> 14:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even though the Trump
administration has been
negative on that provision,
they want to know

14:36.633 --> 14:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they will tell people, if
you don't buy insurance, there
is a fine because they think

14:40.800 --> 14:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that gets healthy people
to sign up for coverage.

14:43.233 --> 14:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also want a guarantee
from President Trump that he
will continue paying threat

14:46.833 --> 14:49.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cost-sharing
reduction subsidies.

14:49.466 --> 14:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's this $8 million --
or $8 billion -- excuse me
-- fund that helps offset
co-pays for low-income

14:54.366 --> 14:55.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Americans.

14:55.866 --> 14:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't know if they're
going to get that money.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they want a
guarantee on that.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, meantime,
Lisa, what the president has
said -- in fact, he said it

15:01.933 --> 15:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - was tweeting this morning
and last night - - let Obamacare
implode, which sounds like

15:08.266 --> 15:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's not going to be
putting any money out there.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right, nor does
it sound like he necessarily
wants to enforce the individual

15:12.866 --> 15:14.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or employer mandates.

15:14.266 --> 15:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that's a real question
for Congress now.

15:16.700 --> 15:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does Congress take action
to force, for example,
those cost-sharing
reductions, that $8 billion,

15:20.966 --> 15:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think it's $10
billion next year?

15:23.333 --> 15:25.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Does Congress fund
that on its own?

15:25.366 --> 15:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are many Republicans
would like to do that, but they
know that anything right now

15:29.800 --> 15:33.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in Congress like that
is a heavy lift, but it
is in the conversation.

15:33.433 --> 15:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there --
Sarah, as you talk to folks out
there in the health care world,

15:37.433 --> 15:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
whether it's insurance
companies, hospitals,
and the others, are they
coming up with another

15:43.166 --> 15:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
approach at all this?

15:44.633 --> 15:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are they standing back
with their fingers crossed?

15:47.633 --> 15:50.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How do they look
at this right now?

15:50.166 --> 15:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: The insurance
companies in particular
have been quite vocal,
really less vocal in

15:54.400 --> 15:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the repeal fight, and much
more vocal on stabilization.

15:57.133 --> 16:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They keep talking about
the cost-sharing reduction
subsidies, about the
individual mandate.

16:04.066 --> 16:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even just today, after we saw
repeal fail, we saw this flurry
of letters from insurance

16:06.800 --> 16:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
companies saying, we need
stabilization right now.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we are getting
close to the deadline.

16:11.800 --> 16:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Insurance companies
have to decide in about
September if they're going
to sell on healthcare.gov

16:15.666 --> 16:17.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or not.

16:17.733 --> 16:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these are assurances
they are asking before they
sign those contract letters.

16:20.533 --> 16:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if they're
on that kind of timeline,
Lisa, it takes Congress a while

16:25.100 --> 16:26.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get things done.

16:26.566 --> 16:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They did have at least some
recess coming in August.

16:30.100 --> 16:33.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What does the timeline
look like there and what
about House members?

16:33.433 --> 16:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have had an even more
conservative position on
this than in the Senate.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The Senate
is in session two more weeks.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's part of the August
recess that they rolled back.

16:41.900 --> 16:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I don't expect major action,
but perhaps conversations
can tart happening that give

16:46.200 --> 16:50.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
us an idea of whether
something tangible is
possible in September.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As for the House, Speaker Ryan
put out a statement saying he
was disappointed and frustrated.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think the real feelings
of House members were expressed
better by Diane Black of the

16:57.533 --> 17:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Budget Committee, who lashed
out at the Senate, said it was
a slap in the face of what the

17:02.000 --> 17:04.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
House had done.

17:04.066 --> 17:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it seems like that is
going to be a real problem in
the two chambers trusting each

17:07.100 --> 17:09.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other in the future.

17:09.100 --> 17:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is some hope that they
could do something by September,
but I'm not sure what that's

17:12.700 --> 17:14.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
based on, to be honest.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes, I think
people -- a lot of people, it
seems to me, Sarah, are standing

17:16.733 --> 17:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back saying, can the two
parties work together now, when
clearly the Republicans, acting

17:22.500 --> 17:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on their own, it didn't happen?

17:24.600 --> 17:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: And lot of it,
honestly, rests with the Trump
administration at this point.

17:27.566 --> 17:30.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They are creating a
lot of the uncertainty.

17:30.100 --> 17:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's been interesting
to watch their Health
and Human Services
Department, which has kind

17:33.100 --> 17:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of acted as an attack shop
on the Affordable Care Act.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They send press releases every
time an insurance company quits
the marketplace or raises its

17:40.333 --> 17:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rates and they send
these and say, look, this
is why we need repeal.

17:44.133 --> 17:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am watching to see if they
change their tactics now
that the repeal bill seems to

17:48.100 --> 17:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be dead and say, yes, we won't
repeal, but, in the meantime, we
kind of -- we run healthcare.gov

17:52.833 --> 17:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right now, and we want to make
it work as well as we can.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't know if we're
going to see that shift.

17:57.766 --> 18:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if we do, it would really
be a 180 from how they have
treated the Affordable Care

18:01.666 --> 18:04.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Act so far.

18:04.233 --> 18:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So much
of the ball is in the
administration's court,
the Trump administration's

18:06.300 --> 18:08.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
court, as we wait to
see what Congress does.

18:08.633 --> 18:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you both, an
extraordinary story to follow.

18:11.200 --> 18:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sarah Kliff, our own Lisa
Desjardins, thank you.

18:15.633 --> 18:20.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
North Korea launched its
second intercontinental
ballistic missile

18:22.466 --> 18:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that flew higher and
farther than its first
attempts earlier this month.

18:25.266 --> 18:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This missile stayed aloft for
45 minutes, before landing
in the Sea of Japan, near the

18:31.400 --> 18:33.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Western Japanese
island of Hokkaido.

18:33.466 --> 18:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHINZO ABE, Japanese Prime
Minister (through translator):
This launch clearly shows that

18:36.433 --> 18:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the threat to our security
is real and severe.

18:39.533 --> 18:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As long as North Korea
continues these provocations,
the U.S., South Korea,
China and Russia and

18:46.500 --> 18:49.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the whole international
community must closely
cooperate and apply
additional pressure.

18:49.800 --> 18:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Pentagon
confirms that the U.S. and
South Korea together staged a

18:54.466 --> 18:58.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
joint-live fire military
exercise in response.

18:58.733 --> 19:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The North Korean missile was
launched at a high angle.

19:02.200 --> 19:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some U.S. analysts say that
the flight path, flattened out,
means that it could reach the

19:07.800 --> 19:09.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.S. mainland.

19:09.933 --> 19:14.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Washington has slapped
more economic sanctions
on Iran, for launching
a rocket that can carry

19:15.033 --> 19:16.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
satellites.

19:16.766 --> 19:20.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Tehran said yesterday
it successfully fired
the rocket into space.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. says the same
technology could be used in
missiles that carry warheads.

19:27.033 --> 19:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The new sanctions target
six Iranian companies
that are deemed central
to Iran's ballistic

19:30.866 --> 19:32.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
missile program.

19:32.733 --> 19:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The prime minister of
Pakistan is out of a job.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nawaz Sharif stepped down today,
after the country's highest
court ordered him removed

19:40.933 --> 19:42.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from office.

19:42.433 --> 19:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jonathan Miller of Independent
Television News,has our report.

19:46.433 --> 19:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN MILLER: Three thousand
armed police and paramilitary
rangers ringed Pakistan's

19:53.366 --> 19:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Supreme Court as, in courtroom
number one, a five-judge
panel met to decide the fate

19:59.733 --> 20:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, accused of accumulating
wealth disproportionate to his

20:04.933 --> 20:07.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
income.

20:07.733 --> 20:12.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Elected three times
to the highest office,
but yet to complete a
five-year term, Sharif

20:14.666 --> 20:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been toppled in a coup,
jailed, exiled, and once
before ousted for corruption.

20:20.266 --> 20:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Would history be repeated?

20:23.033 --> 20:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Opposition glee signaled what
was a unanimous guilty verdict,
the prime minister deemed

20:31.433 --> 20:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
untruthful and dishonest,
ordered to stand down and barred
from holding office, as judges

20:38.533 --> 20:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ordered a criminal investigation
which could put him in jail.

20:42.666 --> 20:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: The team of the prime
minister has committed
a heinous crime by way
of fraud and forgery

20:52.166 --> 20:54.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the documents.

20:54.300 --> 20:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN MILLER: The documents
relate to posh flats in this
block on Park Lane in London.

21:00.666 --> 21:04.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Leaked from a legal firm
in Panama, the Panama
papers revealed that
two of Sharif's sons

21:07.200 --> 21:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and his daughter concealed
family ownership of
these through a string
of offshore companies.

21:12.133 --> 21:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nawaz Sharif was questioned in
person by civilian and military
investigators just last month.

21:18.600 --> 21:23.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When he emerged, he said there
was no stain of corruption
on either him or his family,

21:24.700 --> 21:29.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
no embezzlement, no
misappropriation of
government funds.

21:31.666 --> 21:35.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, he's gone,
amid calls for the U.K.

Sharif must now nominate an
interim successor to lead the
country until elections in 10

21:43.533 --> 21:45.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
months' time.

He will likely remain a
potent force, now, though,
from behind the scenes.

JUDY WOODRUFF: That report
from Jonathan Miller of
Independent Television News.

21:56.800 --> 22:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Israeli-Palestinian tensions
eased today at a flash point
around a Jerusalem mosque, one

22:01.533 --> 22:03.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
day after Israel removed
new security devices.

22:03.833 --> 22:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, elsewhere, a Palestinian
teenager was killed in clashes
with Israeli troops at the

22:09.566 --> 22:11.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Gaza border.

22:11.566 --> 22:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another Palestinian was shot
and killed in the West Bank,
after attacking Israeli soldiers

22:16.733 --> 22:19.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with a knife.

22:19.166 --> 22:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A British baby whose
plight gained international
attention died today,
just short of his first

22:23.666 --> 22:25.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
birthday.

22:25.633 --> 22:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Charlie Gard had a rare genetic
disease that damaged his
brain and hindered his ability

22:29.900 --> 22:31.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to breathe.

22:31.966 --> 22:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His parents had wanted to try
an experimental treatment here
in the U.S., but a British

22:37.533 --> 22:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
court ruled that it wouldn't
help, and it blocked the move.

22:40.066 --> 22:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, the
U.S. House today approved $3.9
billion in emergency spending

22:47.400 --> 22:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for veterans' medical care.

22:49.466 --> 22:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is for a program allowing
vets to seek private care
at government expense.

22:54.300 --> 22:59.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The effort began after
a scandal over long wait
times at VA hospitals.

23:00.266 --> 23:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The bill now goes to the Senate.

23:02.533 --> 23:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump talked tough
today about how police ought
to treat criminal suspects.

23:07.433 --> 23:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happened during his
speech in Suffolk County,
New York, on Long Island
about illegal immigration

23:13.166 --> 23:15.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and violent crime.

23:15.266 --> 23:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At one point, he criticized the
police practice of shielding a
suspect's head as they're taken

23:20.733 --> 23:22.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

23:22.866 --> 23:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of
the United States: I said,
please don't be too nice.

23:24.966 --> 23:27.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

23:27.066 --> 23:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Like, when you
guys put someone in a car and
you're protecting their head,

23:30.233 --> 23:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, the way you put
your hand over -- like,
don't hit your head and
they have just killed

23:36.100 --> 23:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
somebody, don't hit your head.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I said, you can take
the hand away, OK?

23:39.566 --> 23:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Trump also
pledged again to -- quote --
"destroy" the violent street

23:44.233 --> 23:46.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gang MS-13.

23:46.166 --> 23:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff
Sessions was in El Salvador,
where the gang controls

23:50.733 --> 23:52.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
entire towns.

23:52.733 --> 23:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said that he hopes his
efforts will help mend relations
with the president, who's been

23:56.766 --> 23:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
verbally attacking him for days.

23:59.633 --> 24:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Parts of North Carolina's Outer
Banks spent a second day in
the dark, after construction

24:04.333 --> 24:07.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
workers accidentally
cut the power supply.

24:07.466 --> 24:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cars lined up to take ferries
off Ocracoke Island as officials
ordered a mandatory evacuation

24:13.900 --> 24:15.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of some 10,000 tourists.

24:15.533 --> 24:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Full restoration of power
could take days or even weeks.

24:22.633 --> 24:25.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And on Wall Street,
disappointing earnings
from Amazon and other
big firms kept stocks

24:25.266 --> 24:27.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in check.

24:27.366 --> 24:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial
average managed to gain 33
points to close at 21830.

24:32.766 --> 24:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the Nasdaq fell seven and
the S&amp;P 500 slipped three.

24:36.666 --> 24:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, the Dow gained 1
percent, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P
lost a fraction of a percent.

24:43.700 --> 24:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Russia retaliates against new
U.S. sanctions; Mark Shields and

24:49.633 --> 24:53.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
David Brooks weigh in on
the White House shakeup;
the 1967 Detroit riots
as seen through the

24:55.533 --> 25:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lens of artists; and much more.

25:09.200 --> 25:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government of Russia
announced today that the U.S.
would need to drastically reduce

25:13.733 --> 25:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the number of its officials
working in Russia, and could no
longer use two properties there.

25:19.900 --> 25:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan is
in New York with more.

25:22.500 --> 25:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
move follows two American
actions, both related to
the Russian interference

25:27.733 --> 25:30.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the 2016 U.S.
presidential election.

25:30.200 --> 25:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last December, the
Obama administration
seized two Russian-owned
compounds in the U.S., and

25:36.766 --> 25:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expelled 35 Russian diplomats
who the U.S. claimed were
intelligence operatives.

25:42.733 --> 25:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, the U.S.
Senate passed a bill that
included new sanctions on
Russia for its election

25:45.700 --> 25:47.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hacking.

25:47.133 --> 25:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That bill now awaits the
president's signature or veto.

25:49.766 --> 25:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
With me now is special
correspondent Nick Schifrin.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nick, in addition to what
Judy just told us, what
are the Russians demanding?

25:54.600 --> 25:56.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Yes.

25:56.633 --> 26:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By September the 1st, the
U.S. has to reduce its staff
inside of Russia to 455.

26:02.633 --> 26:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's at the embassy in
Moscow and three consulates
around the country.

26:04.666 --> 26:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And by Monday, they will lose
access to a storage facility
inside Moscow, as well as

26:10.833 --> 26:12.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a country house that
they generally use
right outside of Moscow.

26:12.400 --> 26:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Russia vows to punish them
even more if the U.S. responds.

26:17.033 --> 26:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is the
State Department concerned?

26:18.700 --> 26:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do we have lots
more people there?

26:20.800 --> 26:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Yes, this is a
major escalation because of the
numbers of people who are there.

26:27.533 --> 26:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former U.S. officials tell me
that there are anywhere from
1,100 to 1,500 staff in Russia,

26:33.033 --> 26:38.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
so to bring that down to
455 could mean expelling
hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of U.S.

26:40.033 --> 26:42.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
staff.

26:42.466 --> 26:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is on a magnitude
much higher than the
expelling of 35 Russians
believed to be intelligence

26:47.133 --> 26:49.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
officers by President
Obama last year.

26:49.433 --> 26:54.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, clearly, today's
announcement is designed
not just to affect
U.S. ability to conduct

26:56.433 --> 26:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intelligence in Russia, but the
U.S. ability entirely, the U.S.
government's entire ability

27:00.833 --> 27:02.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to conduct its
operations in Russia.

27:02.933 --> 27:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, what
are the Russians that you
spoke to today telling you?

27:05.233 --> 27:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is this significant enough?

27:06.300 --> 27:08.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is this a turning point?

27:08.400 --> 27:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It could be a
turning point, because it does
seem to signify that President

27:11.133 --> 27:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vladimir Putin has given
up his hope that the
relationship could get better.

27:18.133 --> 27:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, the U.S. and Russia
have high-level talks going on
right now, and Russia certainly

27:21.633 --> 27:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had been expecting some
concessions out of that, but one
Russian official told me today

27:26.366 --> 27:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - quote -- "We came to a point
where there was no that hope
those talks could yield any

27:31.966 --> 27:34.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
results."

27:34.033 --> 27:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that lack of hope really
pervades the entire Russian
point of view right now.

27:36.233 --> 27:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They hoped, perhaps
expected, President Trump
to improve the relationship.

27:40.533 --> 27:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And other than some pro-Russian
rhetoric, not much has changed.

27:44.466 --> 27:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are still country
homes not returned to Russia.

27:47.100 --> 27:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are still sanctions,
and, as you mentioned,
that congressional bill.

27:50.166 --> 27:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Russians have been delayed
this response for seven
months, hoping the relationship

27:54.400 --> 27:55.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would get better.

27:55.633 --> 27:57.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it seems like their
patience has run out.

27:57.933 --> 28:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Hari, the U.S. would
say, look, it was Russia that
brought us to this point, both

28:01.733 --> 28:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the election hacking and
its actions in Ukraine.

28:04.633 --> 28:06.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russia says, we
didn't hack anything.

28:06.600 --> 28:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the statement today calls
what the U.S. is doing a
witch-hunt -- quote -- "The U.S.

28:10.433 --> 28:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is using Russia's alleged
interference in its
domestic affairs as an
absolutely contrived

28:15.366 --> 28:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
excuse for its persevering and
crude campaigns against Russia."

28:19.266 --> 28:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally,
put this in perspective.

28:20.733 --> 28:22.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You just did a long
series on Russia.

28:22.733 --> 28:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where is the relationship
between the two countries
in the longer arc?

28:25.833 --> 28:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Even during the
Cold War, there was no occasion
when either side kicked out

28:29.900 --> 28:32.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hundreds of the
other person's staff.

28:32.666 --> 28:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of Russia watchers
told me today that they think
it's about the early '80s.

28:39.066 --> 28:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's been that long since this
relationship was that bad.

28:40.900 --> 28:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's, of course, after the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

28:43.800 --> 28:48.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, what brought the
relationship better in
the '80s was a change
eventually in Soviet

28:48.533 --> 28:49.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
leadership.

28:49.533 --> 28:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

28:51.066 --> 28:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And President
Putin is not going anywhere.

28:53.166 --> 28:56.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the question is, how
does the U.S. respond, not
only to today, but also does

28:56.166 --> 28:59.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Trump sign
that congressional bill
increasing sanctions?

28:59.433 --> 29:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Nick Schifrin, many thanks.

29:06.300 --> 29:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Thank you.

29:09.733 --> 29:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's been another
head-turning week in Washington,
from the Republican failure

29:16.700 --> 29:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on health care, to the
president's surprising
statement on transgender
military members,

29:23.166 --> 29:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a flurry of profanity
from the new White
House communications
director and then, to

29:25.833 --> 29:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cap it off, today's announcement
from Mr. Trump that he is
changing his chief of staff.

29:29.666 --> 29:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here to help make sense of
it all, Shields and Brooks.

29:32.633 --> 29:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

29:36.800 --> 29:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I thought we had a lot of
things to talk about, David,
before about an hour ago, when

29:41.066 --> 29:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we learned that the president
was changing his chief of staff.

29:44.300 --> 29:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is this -- I guess we knew
that this might happen.

29:48.433 --> 29:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reince Priebus has been in
trouble with this president,
we think, for a while, but what

29:53.200 --> 29:54.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do you think?

29:54.733 --> 29:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, he was never
given the chance to do the job.

29:56.800 --> 29:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every other chief of staff
we have ever seen sort
of controls the schedule.

29:59.933 --> 30:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They control the tempo
in the White House.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're the alter
ego of the president.

30:03.333 --> 30:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are given some clear
sign of respect that they
speak for the president.

30:06.300 --> 30:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Priebus never had that.

30:08.333 --> 30:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so he was wounded
and stabbed before
Scaramucci came along.

30:12.933 --> 30:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was stabbed like a pinata.

30:15.133 --> 30:18.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so he was sort of a pathetic
figure hanging out there.

30:18.066 --> 30:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so this doesn't come
as a total surprise, except
for maybe the timing.

30:21.666 --> 30:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As for General Kelly
taking the job, I sort of
question his sanity there.

30:25.933 --> 30:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's been a loyalist, but I
really -- with all due respect
to the Marine Corps, I don't

30:32.866 --> 30:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see how someone who's been
trained in pretty orderly chain
of command is going to survive

30:35.800 --> 30:37.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this mess.

30:37.300 --> 30:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If he can control the
schedule, it will be one thing.

30:39.466 --> 30:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just don't think that's
going to happen, given all the
independent power figures all

30:44.133 --> 30:45.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
around him.

30:45.700 --> 30:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you make
of it, Priebus out and Kelly in?

30:47.866 --> 30:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, I am
continually amazed that it's not
simply a matter of human decency

30:56.366 --> 31:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or empathy when your boss is
firing anybody to make sure
that that person leaves and has

31:03.866 --> 31:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a soft landing, that
they can leave with their
self-respect, that they
can leave with someplace

31:08.400 --> 31:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go to, with a plausible
explanation to their family
and friends that they weren't

31:14.266 --> 31:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
humiliated, abused and derided.

31:16.700 --> 31:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This president treats staff
and others like a used sickness
bag on a bad airplane flight.

31:23.800 --> 31:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's just absolutely no sense
of respect or decency shown,
so you humiliate somebody.

31:31.033 --> 31:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for those who are
left, there is just a
sense of, could I be next?

31:35.966 --> 31:37.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It certainly doesn't
inspire loyalty.

31:37.600 --> 31:41.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
As far as Kelly is
concerned, General Kelly
is a four-star general.

31:41.666 --> 31:43.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think David
put his finger on it.

31:43.400 --> 31:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He had a very distinguished
and honorable military career.

31:46.300 --> 31:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But he grew up in a
military structure.

31:48.066 --> 31:50.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He thrived up in a
military structure.

31:50.266 --> 31:55.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
As a chief of staff at
the White House, this is
a freelancing operation.

31:56.166 --> 31:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no chain of command.

31:58.366 --> 32:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are all sorts of
people who go in and see
the president any time,
who are not accountable

32:01.633 --> 32:03.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to you or responsible.

32:03.666 --> 32:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And least of all, you have
a president who will even --
won't abide by any sense of a

32:08.266 --> 32:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
chain of command or structure.

32:10.500 --> 32:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't know that General
Kelly has any particular
political gifts or knowledge of

32:17.066 --> 32:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the legislative process or
dealings with the press.

32:20.266 --> 32:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I'm not -- I know that
the president admires
him and the job he's
done at Homeland Security

32:26.466 --> 32:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and his career, but
I don't see the fit.

32:29.033 --> 32:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we should
say that Reince Priebus, just
in the last few minutes, David,

32:32.266 --> 32:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put out a statement saying
it's been one of the greatest
honors of his life to serve this

32:36.733 --> 32:38.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

32:38.000 --> 32:38.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I guess that's what
one expects, maybe.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Gracious.

32:40.266 --> 32:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not sure he would
pass a lie-detector test.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

32:44.200 --> 32:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But one of the
things that's happening here
is that the president is moving

32:47.433 --> 32:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
away from the Republican Party.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Priebus was a link to
the Republican Party.

32:51.300 --> 32:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The congressional
Republicans were -- had
some sort of relationship.

32:54.766 --> 32:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeff Sessions was a key to
the link between congressional
Republicans and Donald Trump,

32:59.733 --> 33:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he's been under
assault in the most
humiliating way imaginable.

33:03.933 --> 33:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so you're beginning to see
an administration - - I don't
know what party they're joining,

33:07.866 --> 33:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
maybe the Bannon party, but
it's not the Republican Party.

33:11.200 --> 33:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you want to pass
legislation, you probably need
your allies on Capitol Hill.

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you want to survive
investigative committees,
you probably want some
friends in your party.

33:22.433 --> 33:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this administration seems to
be moving the other direction.

33:24.433 --> 33:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In fact, you
look at the White House, and
Vice President Mike Pence, Mark,

33:27.266 --> 33:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may be the only person prominent
in the White House circle who
has any kind of Washington

33:33.766 --> 33:34.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experience.

33:34.766 --> 33:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, Judy.

33:38.833 --> 33:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And presidents thrive,
ideally, when they're both
loved and feared politically.

33:42.733 --> 33:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump is neither.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.966 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Nobody loves him
on Capitol Hill.

33:46.966 --> 33:49.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he shows loyalty
is a one-way street.

33:49.433 --> 33:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's not somebody who has
personal relationships
of any standing.

33:56.466 --> 34:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the loyalty or disloyalty
that he shows to his people,
including Jeff Sessions, the

34:03.366 --> 34:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attorney general, who was just
humiliated, someone who was
with him early and strong,

34:08.966 --> 34:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at a time when no other senator
stood up for him, and remained
there through all the "Access

34:12.633 --> 34:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hollywood" and the how to molest
and harass and sexually bar
the women tapes and so forth.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, there isn't that, Judy.

34:21.433 --> 34:23.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That doesn't exist.

34:23.466 --> 34:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And David's absolutely right.

34:25.666 --> 34:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you get in trouble, you
have got to have people who,
A, like you, believe in you and

34:32.100 --> 34:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are willing to go to some
political cost for you.

34:33.833 --> 34:35.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we saw that on
the health care.

34:35.933 --> 34:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, Donald Trump had about
as much influence on health care
as I had on the National League

34:39.566 --> 34:41.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pennant race.

34:41.600 --> 34:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, which
leads us to another - - I mean,
David, you said they have had a

34:44.000 --> 34:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
struggle anything passed,
getting legislation passed.

34:47.366 --> 34:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was a flame-out for them.

34:49.633 --> 34:52.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, this
was a bigger thing than
Donald Trump, though.

34:52.866 --> 34:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was only one bill that lost.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was four bills that lost.

34:56.300 --> 34:58.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it wasn't only
a six-months effort.

34:58.166 --> 34:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a seven-year effort.

34:59.366 --> 35:01.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: I agree.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: And you
could say you could go
back to Newt Gingrich.

35:03.233 --> 35:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Think of all the ways the
Republicans have tried to trim
entitlements like Medicaid or

35:05.800 --> 35:07.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cut government.

35:07.066 --> 35:08.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Name a signal victory.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's not a victory.

35:09.866 --> 35:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They haven't been able
to trim one agency, cut
back one entitlement.

35:12.533 --> 35:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They failed every single time.

35:14.633 --> 35:17.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that suggests isn't
an electoral failure.

35:17.100 --> 35:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not a failure of whether
Mitch McConnell had the right
strategy or not, though that

35:20.200 --> 35:21.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was lamentable.

35:21.800 --> 35:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a failure of trying to
take things away from people.

35:24.700 --> 35:27.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People are under
assault from technology.

35:27.366 --> 35:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're under assault from a
breakdown in social fabric,
breakdown in families.

35:30.466 --> 35:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have got wage stagnations.

35:32.466 --> 35:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just don't want a party
to come in and say, we're going
to take more away from you.

35:35.866 --> 35:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so Republicans have to wrap
their minds around the fact that
the American people basically

35:40.166 --> 35:45.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decided that health care is
a right, and they figure,
we should get health care.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And our fellow countrymen
should get health care.

35:48.666 --> 35:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't mean you have to do
it the way the Democrats want
to do it with single-payer

35:50.166 --> 35:51.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or whatever.

35:51.433 --> 35:53.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can do it with
market mechanisms.

35:53.433 --> 35:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you have basically
got to wrap your mind
around universal coverage.

35:55.433 --> 35:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you
see what happened here, Mark?

35:56.900 --> 35:58.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And where do you see it
going on health care?

35:58.866 --> 36:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, the yapping
dog, which was the Republican
Party, after chasing the

36:03.233 --> 36:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bus for seven years,
caught it and had no idea
what to do with the bus.

36:08.166 --> 36:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All you needed is that
final vote that Lisa
described so well, and
that is the final argument,

36:16.666 --> 36:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after seven years, after winning
three national elections where
that is your organizing issue,

36:21.466 --> 36:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're going to repeal Obamacare,
came down to a single promise
and pledge to your fellow

36:26.300 --> 36:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans from the leadership,
and that is, what you are
voting for, we promise will

36:31.000 --> 36:32.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not become law.

36:32.933 --> 36:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, if you can
imagine anything, I mean,
that just said it all.

36:38.333 --> 36:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, it was a
terrible performance.

36:40.733 --> 36:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The House voted on something
without even a congressional
budget scoring of it.

36:45.400 --> 36:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Senate voted on something.

36:46.966 --> 36:49.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They didn't even have a
bill when they brought
it to the floor.

36:49.433 --> 36:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There was no legislation.

36:51.200 --> 36:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I mean, it was horrendous.

36:54.033 --> 36:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was disappointing.

36:55.033 --> 36:56.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There were no ideas.

36:56.933 --> 36:57.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There was no will.

36:57.933 --> 36:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There was no imagination.

36:59.066 --> 37:00.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And there was
certainly no courage.

37:00.833 --> 37:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't blame Donald Trump, but
what was Donald Trump saying?

37:04.366 --> 37:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump was saying he's
disappointed in the attorney
general because he wasn't

37:07.733 --> 37:09.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
loyal to him.

37:09.766 --> 37:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was his contribution to
the debate on health care as it
came to a vote in the Senate.

37:13.166 --> 37:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you
think the prospects are, David,
that they are going to be able

37:15.500 --> 37:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to work with the Democrats, or
is that just something people
are saying that's never really

37:19.033 --> 37:20.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Going to happen?

37:20.533 --> 37:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think that
there is a potential there.

37:22.566 --> 37:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the Republicans get to the
point we're going to expand
coverage, let's talk about

37:26.433 --> 37:29.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
how do it, I think you
could do some pretty
market-friendly reforms.

37:29.833 --> 37:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Bush did it with
the prescription drug bill
a number of years ago.

37:33.633 --> 37:36.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But they're a long way
from that right now.

37:36.633 --> 37:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: John McCain
does deserve, in my
judgment, a shout-out.

37:43.566 --> 37:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John McCain's vote, flying back,
kept it alive, kept the debate
alive, allowing the motion

37:49.200 --> 37:51.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to proceed.

37:51.266 --> 37:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And John McCain applied the
-- he gave the speech once he
had the whole audience there

37:57.333 --> 38:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of senators, and he told them
what they had done wrong, that
they all stood accused, that

38:00.966 --> 38:05.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
their cheap partisanship
had replaced any kind
of sense of legislating.

38:05.500 --> 38:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I really do think that
his vote -- we found out that
the testosterone level among

38:13.700 --> 38:18.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans was limited
essentially to two members
whose names were Lisa and Susan.

38:18.266 --> 38:20.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:20.766 --> 38:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And John
McCain joined that
want trio and showed, I
thought, real -- distinct

38:26.100 --> 38:29.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
political courage, and
for the right reasons.

38:29.900 --> 38:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And some of the
Republican men in the House
of Representatives went after

38:32.866 --> 38:35.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
those women, as
a matter of fact.

38:35.733 --> 38:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, Blake
Farenthold, a courageous
Aaron Burr would-be.

38:38.700 --> 38:39.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

38:39.700 --> 38:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Aaron Burr.

38:40.700 --> 38:41.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:41.933 --> 38:43.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It does
raise the question.

38:43.866 --> 38:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People are watching this,
David, and they have to be
asking, is anything going to get

38:46.800 --> 38:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
done in our nation's capital,
with the White House in
some measure of chaos?

38:54.300 --> 38:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, there have been some
changes, but where's the
-- you know, what are
people to look forward

39:00.500 --> 39:01.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to now?

39:01.933 --> 39:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I don't
think much is going to get done.

39:03.233 --> 39:04.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think they're
going to do tax reform.

39:04.333 --> 39:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tax reform is super hard.

39:05.800 --> 39:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's potentially as hard or
harder than health care reform.

39:09.166 --> 39:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it seems very unlikely
that that is going to get done.

39:12.133 --> 39:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what hasn't happened is,
you don't have people waking
up thinking, how creatively

39:19.100 --> 39:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can I come up with some
piece of legislation that
will do somebody some good?

39:24.233 --> 39:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I started covering
Congress in the 1980s, there
were a bunch of entrepreneurs.

39:28.100 --> 39:29.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jack Kemp was there.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bill Bradley would have
something on the gold standard.

39:31.500 --> 39:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a guy named
Jim Courter who always
had defense reform ideas.

39:35.066 --> 39:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so you had start-ups in
the back rows of the House.

39:38.666 --> 39:41.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then they would
finagle their way
through the committees.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now you have very
few entrepreneurs.

39:42.300 --> 39:44.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have few people
thinking creatively.

39:44.833 --> 39:45.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I rarely get e-mail.

39:45.833 --> 39:48.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I rarely calls.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a guy named Ro
Khanna from San Francisco
or from Palo Alto who
is a Democrat who thinks

39:50.566 --> 39:51.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this way.

39:51.766 --> 39:53.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there is not as much
as entrepreneurship.

39:53.866 --> 39:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the main cause is because
the leadership of the body has
taken control and destroyed

39:59.600 --> 40:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
creativity throughout the ranks.

40:01.633 --> 40:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a fault of both
Nancy Pelosi probably and Mitch
McConnell, who just centralized

40:05.033 --> 40:06.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everything.

40:06.666 --> 40:09.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so the committee
system is broken and the
start-ups are broken.

40:09.533 --> 40:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the
White House is having its
own share of problems.

40:12.200 --> 40:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have alluded to this, Mark,
a lot of attention this week
about this profanity-laced phone

40:19.266 --> 40:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conversation that the new White
House communications director --
he hasn't actually taken the job

40:26.033 --> 40:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yet, but he's been named by
the president - - had with
a "New Yorker" reporter.

40:31.700 --> 40:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seems that everywhere we
look, there is conflict, there
is screaming, there is discord.

40:36.433 --> 40:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, where do we see
hope and something positive?

40:41.733 --> 40:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, obviously
not in Shields and Brooks.

40:42.933 --> 40:44.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:44.200 --> 40:45.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm
giving you a chance.

40:45.500 --> 40:48.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

40:48.033 --> 40:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: "Mass
For Shut-Ins" is on, on
Sunday at 9:00, if people
want to hear a good

40:52.000 --> 40:53.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sermon.

40:53.900 --> 40:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, I would say this,
Judy, that Anthony
Scaramucci is Donald Trump.

41:00.100 --> 41:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every White House staff
to some degree inevitably
becomes a mirror reflection
of the candidate,

41:03.933 --> 41:04.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the president.

41:04.933 --> 41:06.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He is it.

41:06.966 --> 41:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what he did, Donald Trump
approved of, the abusing of the
chief of staff, the abusing,

41:12.500 --> 41:15.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the denigration of
other leading members of
the White House staff.

41:15.566 --> 41:19.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, and did Donald
Trump disapprove?

41:19.000 --> 41:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you had a 14-year-old
daughter volunteering
on the Hill or a
14-year-old boy, I don't

41:25.400 --> 41:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care, and this is the
kind of language you get?

41:27.033 --> 41:29.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is blood-curdling.

41:29.500 --> 41:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's offensive and it's obscene.

41:31.200 --> 41:32.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You get
to defend him, David.

41:32.700 --> 41:33.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes,
it is offensable.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm from New York City.

41:35.166 --> 41:37.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mark's from Boston.

41:37.133 --> 41:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on behalf of eight
million New Yorkers, I want to
apologize for our language.

41:40.100 --> 41:43.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Scaramucci and Trump, I
just want to say that,
even though they're from
Queens and Long Island,

41:43.866 --> 41:45.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm pretty sure
they're Yankee fans.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're not Mets fans.

41:46.266 --> 41:47.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:47.500 --> 41:48.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: We
don't talk that way.

41:48.466 --> 41:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, Mets fans.

41:49.733 --> 41:50.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: No,
it's -- I agree.

41:50.966 --> 41:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Blood-curdling
would be the word.

41:53.033 --> 41:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I
gave you both a chance to
say something positive.

41:53.866 --> 41:55.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You didn't do it.

41:55.100 --> 41:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: You're
wonderful, Judy.

41:56.833 --> 41:57.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Maybe we
will let you come back
and try again next week.

41:57.700 --> 41:59.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:59.233 --> 42:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks,
Mark Shields, thank you both.

42:05.600 --> 42:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now: a look at how artists
captured Detroit's turbulent
history in the civil rights era.

42:19.933 --> 42:24.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This week marks the 50th
anniversary of major
civil unrest in the
Motor City, and a unique

42:26.366 --> 42:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
series of exhibitions are
chronicling that moment.

42:28.966 --> 42:31.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown went to
Michigan to see them.

42:31.366 --> 42:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A fiery red sky,
people trapped in a burning
city, charred remains from the

42:38.366 --> 42:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1967 Detroit riots, a painting
by Yvonne Parks Catchings in an
exhibition titled Say It Loud:

42:46.400 --> 42:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Art, History, Rebellion, at
the Charles H. Wright Museum
of African-American History.

42:53.500 --> 42:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Striking images of
confrontation, and consequences,
in works by national
and local artists from

42:59.533 --> 43:00.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the 1960s on.

43:00.966 --> 43:03.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Curator Patrina Chatman:

43:03.400 --> 43:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRINA CHATMAN, Curator,
Charles H. Wright Museum
of African-American
History: You see

43:05.333 --> 43:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the emotions of the
artists, describing history
from their perspective.

43:07.966 --> 43:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I see the politics.

43:09.433 --> 43:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I see the social concerns
that people had in it.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I see their pain.

43:15.766 --> 43:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I see and I feel their
pain, and I think other
people will feel it as well.

43:22.566 --> 43:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: July, 1967,
five days of violence,
fear and destruction in
a major American city

43:29.700 --> 43:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that would leave 43 dead, some
7,200 arrested, and more than
2,000 buildings destroyed.

43:39.666 --> 43:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Fifty years later, some
of the city's leading
cultural institutions
are asking questions:

43:44.133 --> 43:46.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Was it a riot?

43:46.266 --> 43:48.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
A rebellion?

43:48.133 --> 43:50.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Even a revolution?

43:50.166 --> 43:54.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And using art to
look back and ahead.

43:54.500 --> 43:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the Detroit Historical
Museum, which, for

funder of the "NewsHour"

43:59.266 --> 44:04.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and which spearheaded
the citywide effort, old
TVs play news footage.

44:04.166 --> 44:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A replica of a National Guard
tank has been turned into an
audiovisual experience, with

44:10.266 --> 44:14.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
oral histories
told by Detroiters.

44:14.466 --> 44:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Detroit Institute of Art
weighs in with an exhibition
titled Art of Rebellion: Black

44:21.333 --> 44:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Art of the Civil Rights Movement
with works by individuals,
including leading figures

44:27.766 --> 44:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
such as Romare Bearden and
Sam Gilliam, and so-called
collectives formed in the 1960s

44:33.233 --> 44:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and after by artists seeking
a greater voice in society.

44:36.533 --> 44:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VALERIE MERCER, Curator,
Detroit Institute of Art: The
civil rights movement and the

44:43.466 --> 44:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
black power movement
emboldened a lot of the
African-American artists.

44:49.033 --> 44:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of the mainstream
art museums didn't
provide many opportunities
to African-American

44:53.966 --> 44:56.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
artists during
the '60s and '70s.

44:56.100 --> 45:01.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They were also very
uncomfortable dealing
with racial, social
and political issues,

45:03.566 --> 45:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so they avoided that work.

45:05.400 --> 45:07.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now things are
changing, fortunately.

45:07.666 --> 45:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Several local
artists attended the opening,
including Allie McGhee, who told

45:14.100 --> 45:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me of his encounters with the
National Guard 50 years ago.

45:16.766 --> 45:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLIE MCGHEE, Artist: I had
people drive up because I was
out past curfew, and have a

45:21.333 --> 45:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
young man who's like 17 or
18 scared to death, stick
a bayonet in your ribcage.

45:30.300 --> 45:32.500 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
You don't forget
stuff like this.

45:32.500 --> 45:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For this
exhibition, McGhee contributed a
painting from 1968 titled Black

45:38.866 --> 45:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Attack, and a later abstract
work titled Apartheid.

45:41.633 --> 45:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Since then, his art has gone
well beyond such subjects.

45:46.100 --> 45:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It just took him a while to
get past what he'd witnessed.

45:48.733 --> 45:52.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ALLIE MCGHEE: It
wasn't something you
could walk away from.

45:52.000 --> 45:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for me, it sort of like
was a dominant subject matter
for maybe 15 or 20 years.

45:59.933 --> 46:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You couldn't
get it out of your head
or your mind or your work?

46:03.233 --> 46:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLIE MCGHEE: No, you can't.

46:04.466 --> 46:06.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yes, the subtleties
of it kept recurring.

46:06.466 --> 46:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I had to work that out of
my painting experience.

46:12.433 --> 46:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not good to be angry.

46:15.133 --> 46:17.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It lowers the
intellectual level.

46:17.533 --> 46:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You don't accomplish a lot.

46:19.300 --> 46:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're blinded by it.

46:21.433 --> 46:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Rita Dickerson's
painting commemorates the terror
and killings of three black men

46:27.933 --> 46:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the Algiers Hotel,
one of the most harrowing
episodes of those July days.

46:33.166 --> 46:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she also adds the names
of young black men and women
killed in police shootings more

46:37.833 --> 46:39.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recently.

46:39.100 --> 46:40.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Dickerson grew up on
Detroit's East Side.

46:40.600 --> 46:43.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RITA DICKERSON, Artist:
We had two bakeries.

46:43.366 --> 46:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We had a hardware
store, two pharmacies.

46:46.133 --> 46:51.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Everything was there
within one block, and we
could walk every place.

46:52.300 --> 46:54.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And during the riot,
all that burned down.

46:54.100 --> 46:57.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And 50 years later,
it has not returned.

46:57.600 --> 46:59.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's still desolate.

46:59.666 --> 47:02.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it breaks my
heart, breaks my heart.

47:02.200 --> 47:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In so many
of Detroit's neighborhoods,
on so many blocks, the
abandoned homes and

47:07.766 --> 47:09.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
empty lots remain.

47:09.900 --> 47:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there are signs of
life in Detroit today.

47:13.033 --> 47:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The youngest artist in the
exhibition, 29-year-old
Mario Moore, is literally
a product of the

47:19.400 --> 47:20.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
museum.

47:20.400 --> 47:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
His parents met here.

47:22.466 --> 47:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIO MOORE, Artist: So, it's
my grandmother holding images
of her living sons, right,

47:25.200 --> 47:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the sense of protection,
like, these are mine, you
can't have them, right?

47:29.866 --> 47:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: His
grandmother, Helen Moore,
is a longtime Detroit
activist, and the subject

47:35.600 --> 47:36.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Mario's work here.

47:36.833 --> 47:39.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It addresses violence
and how it's portrayed.

47:39.166 --> 47:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIO MOORE: As soon as you
turn on the news, what tends to
happen is they show the mourning

47:44.066 --> 47:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
black mother, right, the mother
that's crying about the recent
death of her son, her husband,

47:50.533 --> 47:52.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her daughter.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's
the narrative, the story.

47:53.233 --> 47:55.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARIO MOORE: That's
the narrative you get.

47:55.200 --> 47:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I feel like it was something
that began out of a way to
kind of find compassion for

48:01.733 --> 48:03.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the other, right?

48:03.800 --> 48:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But once that gets used over
and over and over and over
again, it loses its value.

48:09.433 --> 48:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nobody really cares anymore.

48:11.100 --> 48:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, for me, the women
in my family have a very
different perspective.

48:14.833 --> 48:17.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I feel like they're
very protective,
they're very powerful.

48:17.900 --> 48:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Different
perspectives on Detroit's
past and future, through
exhibitions around

48:23.766 --> 48:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the city over the coming months.

48:25.866 --> 48:30.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown in Detroit.

48:32.800 --> 48:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, to our
"NewsHour" Shares, something
that caught our eye that

48:43.233 --> 48:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we thought might be of
interest to you, too.

48:46.200 --> 48:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Boston's inner city often sees
a spike in violence during
the summer, when many students

48:51.000 --> 48:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are out of school
and on the streets.

48:53.233 --> 48:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as Tina Martin from PBS
station WGBH reports, one mother
is trying to change that trend

48:59.633 --> 49:02.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by exposing young
people to the outdoors.

49:02.100 --> 49:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Amid trees,
chirping birds and rugged rocks,
it wasn't always easy to do,

49:10.633 --> 49:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but Judith Foster smiles
as she leads her group on a
three-mile walk through the Blue

49:15.200 --> 49:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hills Reservation in Milton.

49:17.166 --> 49:19.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The walks are part
of her HERO group.

49:19.033 --> 49:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDITH FOSTER, HERO: Healing,
empathy, redemption, oasis.

49:21.366 --> 49:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Foster started
the walks as a way to
heal from her own tragedy.

49:25.966 --> 49:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDITH FOSTER: About 8:00 in
the morning or so, I got home
from work, and that was the

49:32.700 --> 49:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
news I got home to, that
my son had been murdered.

49:35.800 --> 49:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Four years ago,
Judith's youngest child, Paul,
a senior at a college in North

49:42.866 --> 49:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Carolina, was shot and killed
at a nightclub, just few weeks
before he was set to graduate

49:47.033 --> 49:48.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with a degree in
computer science.

49:48.766 --> 49:51.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Paul's murder is still
under investigation.

49:51.433 --> 49:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But during her time of loss and
grief, Judith says she found
solace in walking the Blue

49:56.300 --> 49:58.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hills.

49:58.366 --> 50:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDITH FOSTER: He had a love
of nature, and I thought by
being doing this, being close

50:02.200 --> 50:03.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to nature, I would
be close to him.

50:03.866 --> 50:06.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TINA MARTIN: So, every
Saturday, she invites
people to walk with her.

50:06.333 --> 50:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BAKARI JOHNSON, Walker: We
have to do something to break
the cycle, break the mold.

50:10.300 --> 50:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nobody would think is
something that would be
fun at the end of the day.

50:13.500 --> 50:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You think nature walk, you are
thinking, oh, come on, this
is some tree hugger stuff.

50:15.966 --> 50:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at the end of the
day, anybody can do it
and anybody can enjoy it.

50:19.133 --> 50:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN:
Twenty-five-year-old Bakari
Johnson uses the walks to
get away from the noise

50:22.766 --> 50:24.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the city.

50:24.300 --> 50:26.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He hopes to keep walking
all summer to stay
away from trouble.

50:26.633 --> 50:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BAKARI JOHNSON: It is a worry,
but, personally, I feel like
I have been not just lucky so

50:32.700 --> 50:34.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
far.

50:34.666 --> 50:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I feel like part of the reason
I'm still here is because
I have also been smart.

50:36.300 --> 50:38.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDITH FOSTER: And
don't be afraid to touch
the trees, the leaves.

50:38.266 --> 50:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PASTOR MARK SCOTT, Co-Chair,
Boston Youth Violence Reduction
Task Force: It's really

50:40.100 --> 50:42.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
simple, right?

50:42.666 --> 50:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we're doing is
taking a walk in nature,
which is a tremendous
resource that is available

50:46.600 --> 50:47.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to us.

50:47.566 --> 50:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're doing it with friends.

50:49.633 --> 50:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Pastor Mark Scott,
co-chair of the Boston Youth
Violence Reduction Task Force,

50:52.700 --> 50:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hopes, as it gets hotter and
violence spikes, young people
will choose to take a few steps

50:58.466 --> 51:00.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to keep the peace.

51:00.633 --> 51:03.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PASTOR MARK SCOTT:
We're constantly being
hit and bombarded by
this kind of violence,

51:03.533 --> 51:05.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and we have to react
to it every time.

51:05.866 --> 51:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are things that we
can do, traditions that we can
create, like coming out on 12:00

51:10.633 --> 51:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
noon a Saturday to take a
walk in the woods that are
right next to your city.

51:15.133 --> 51:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: The HERO group
gets bigger as the weeks go by.

51:18.300 --> 51:21.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The walks are free
and open to anyone.

51:21.100 --> 51:23.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Judith believes her
son Paul would approve.

51:23.566 --> 51:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDITH FOSTER: He's smiling.

51:24.800 --> 51:26.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's loving it.

51:26.800 --> 51:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I find strength in knowing
that I'm doing something
that he loved to do.

51:30.666 --> 51:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Tina Martin
in Milton, Massachusetts.

51:35.266 --> 51:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on the
"NewsHour" online: Our politics
team recently asked for your

51:42.266 --> 51:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
best haiku, a short form
of Japanese poetry, about
the health care battle.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you sent in an outpouring
of poetic expression.

51:49.600 --> 51:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ronnie Dugger and Dorothy
Workman sent in our winning
poems, which you can read in our

on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:04.300 --> 52:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And another reminder that Robert
Costa will continue coverage
of the most recent White

52:08.500 --> 52:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House shakeup and the aftermath
of the health care vote on
"Washington Week," which airs

52:13.300 --> 52:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
later tonight here on PBS.

52:16.433 --> 52:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tomorrow on "PBS NewsHour
Weekend": India is creating a
biometric database of all its

52:23.500 --> 52:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
citizens using fingerprints
and eye scans, but some have
raised privacy and security

52:28.533 --> 52:30.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
concerns.

52:30.633 --> 52:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: Ajay Bhushan
Pandey heads Aadhaar,
the agency running the
identification program.

AJAY BHUSHAN PANDEY, Aadhaar:
We have now reached the
figure of 1.15 billion.

52:38.166 --> 52:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Pandey says the
Aadhaar project will improve
national security by making it

52:44.700 --> 52:47.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
easier to monitor
border crossings with
India's neighbors.

52:47.300 --> 52:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Opponents of Aadhaar were
skeptical when it began
as a voluntary program
to improve transparency

52:52.866 --> 52:53.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the welfare system.

52:53.833 --> 52:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: You need electricity 24/7.

52:55.566 --> 52:57.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You need the Internet
up and running 24/7.

52:57.333 --> 52:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You need proper data speeds.

52:59.933 --> 53:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, given the limitations
of technology, given
the absence of a privacy
law, for the government

53:06.533 --> 53:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to steamroller this kind of
scheme, to my mind, seems
to be rather ill-advised.

53:11.133 --> 53:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's tomorrow
night on "PBS NewsHour Weekend."

some of the most remote areas

53:30.700 --> 53:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the country, and a great
change from Washington.

53:33.400 --> 53:34.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.
