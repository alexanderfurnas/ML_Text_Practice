JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.875 --> 00:12.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: With
only three
weeks to go until Iowa voters
kick off the

00:12.579 --> 00:19.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2016 presidential primary
season, the race
tightens between two leading
Democrats and

00:19.419 --> 00:23.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
among Republicans, all part of
Politics Monday.

00:23.357 --> 00:29.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: actor Sean Penn's meeting
with drug
lord El Chapo and ethical
questions around

00:29.329 --> 00:31.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the "Rolling Stone" article.

00:31.365 --> 00:42.809 align:left position:37.5%,start line:66.67% size:62.5%
And
remembering legendary singer,
artist and writer
David Bowie, who transformed
rock music over

00:42.843 --> 00:44.711 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decades.

00:44.745 --> 00:48.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY DECURTIS, "Rolling
Stone": Bowie never
seemed old, you know? That sense
of reinvention

00:48.782 --> 00:53.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really made him seem of the time
at every
time.

00:53.453 --> 00:56.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:56.890 --> 01:01.295 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:01.328 --> 01:14.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gunmen burst into
a shopping
mall in Iraq today, killing at
least 18 people

01:14.274 --> 01:19.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and wounding 40 others. The
Islamic State
group claimed responsibility for
the attack

01:19.546 --> 01:26.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Baghdad. It began with a car
bomb and suicide
blast at the Jawhara Mall. That
touched off

01:26.053 --> 01:31.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a 90-minute gun battle before
security forces
gained control. To the north,
another suicide

01:32.025 --> 01:37.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attack killed two dozen people.
Ten more were
killed in other bombings.

01:37.798 --> 01:42.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Food and medicine finally got
through today
to a Syrian town that's slowly
starving to

01:43.003 --> 01:48.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
death. An aid convoy was allowed
in under
an agreement with pro-government
forces who

01:48.508 --> 01:50.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have blockaded the place.

01:50.477 --> 01:53.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lindsey Hilsum of Independent
Television News
has the story.

01:53.680 --> 02:00.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY HILSUM: At last. This
morning, Red
Crescent trucks headed towards
the besieged

02:00.187 --> 02:07.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town of Madaya, carrying tinned
food, rice,
lentils, and other supplies, all
desperately

02:07.561 --> 02:10.130 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
needed.

02:10.163 --> 02:15.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people waited. They haven't
had a food
delivery like this for three
months. Five

02:15.802 --> 02:22.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more died of hunger or
hunger-related diseases
yesterday. Aid workers went in
first. Food

02:23.010 --> 02:28.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a weapon of war in Syria. And
the U.N.
and Red Crescent have carefully
negotiated

02:28.115 --> 02:33.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with both government and rebels.
Anything
can go wrong at the last minute.
And this

02:33.653 --> 02:35.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is just a stopgap.

02:35.255 --> 02:39.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): People
are very
happy today because the food has
arrived,

02:39.259 --> 02:43.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they're worried and upset
because they're
still under siege. The town
isn't yet open

02:43.096 --> 02:46.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the world, so the human
disaster we have
witnessed could happen again in
two weeks'

02:47.000 --> 02:48.869 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

02:48.902 --> 02:52.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY HILSUM: Under the
agreement, emergency
aid is being delivered from the
Syrian capital,

02:52.773 --> 02:59.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Damascus, both to Madaya, which
is held by
rebels, while besieged by Syrian
government

02:59.046 --> 03:07.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces and Hezbollah, and to the
Shia villages
in the north, near Idlib, Foua
and Kefraya,

03:07.120 --> 03:11.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which are besieged by the rebel
group Ahrar
Al Sham.

03:11.324 --> 03:16.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The rebels surround the
villages, and although
there isn't the same level of
hunger there

03:16.596 --> 03:24.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as in Madaya, the people, who
are mostly government
supporters, are trapped, unable
to leave.

03:24.838 --> 03:30.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As darkness fell this evening,
the convoys
finally got permission from all
sides to enter

03:30.277 --> 03:37.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Madaya. The World Food Program
hopes to provide
enough to feed 40,000 people in
the area for

03:37.517 --> 03:44.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one month. That's just a tenth
of the number
of Syrians who urgently need
food aid this

03:44.324 --> 03:46.159 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
winter.

03:46.193 --> 03:50.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The United
Nations says that
4.5 million Syrians are in need
of humanitarian

03:50.864 --> 03:52.632 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
aid.

03:52.666 --> 03:58.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Germany's leaders today
condemned retaliatory
violence against immigrants. Six
Pakistanis

03:58.071 --> 04:04.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a Syrian were assaulted
Sunday in Cologne,
as tensions flared over New
Year's Eve attacks,

04:04.678 --> 04:09.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mostly carried out by migrants.
Meanwhile,
Turkey said that it plans to
offer work permits

04:09.583 --> 04:14.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Syrian refugees so that fewer
of them will
try to get to Europe.

04:14.421 --> 04:21.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Pakistan, new efforts began
to revive long-stalled
peace talks in neighboring
Afghanistan. Representatives

04:21.561 --> 04:28.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Afghanistan, China, the
U.S. and Pakistan
met late into the night in
Islamabad. The

04:28.135 --> 04:33.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four nations didn't invite the
Taliban to
the session, but Pakistani
officials said

04:33.740 --> 04:36.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it's vital to bring the
militants into the
fold.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARTAJ AZIZ, Foreign Affairs to
Pakistani
Prime Minister: The primary
objective of the

04:38.845 --> 04:46.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reconciliation process is to
create conditions
to bring the Taliban groups to
the negotiating

04:46.386 --> 04:53.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
table and offer them incentives
that can persuade
them to move away from using
violence as a

04:53.160 --> 04:55.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tool for pursuing political
goals.

04:55.295 --> 05:00.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Taliban said
today that
it will not agree to any direct
talks with

05:00.066 --> 05:04.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Afghanistan without first
talking to the United
States.

05:04.171 --> 05:09.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, on Wall
Street, stocks
managed small gains, despite oil
prices falling

05:09.643 --> 05:15.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to just over $31 a barrel. That
is the lowest
in 12 years. The Dow Jones
industrial average

05:16.016 --> 05:24.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gained 52 points to close near
16400. The
Nasdaq fell five points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added

05:24.791 --> 05:26.526 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a point.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Ringling Bros. and
Barnum &amp; Bailey
Circus has announced that it's
retiring all

05:30.597 --> 05:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of its touring elephants in May.
That's a
year-and-a-half earlier than
originally planned,

05:36.203 --> 05:41.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it comes as more cities are
banning events
involving elephant acts. The
pachyderms will

05:41.741 --> 05:45.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go to live at the company's
conservation center
in Florida.

05:45.612 --> 05:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Bernie Sanders
closing the gap in Iowa; the
legacy of superstar

05:52.886 --> 06:02.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Bowie; mandatory union
dues before the
Supreme Court; and much more.

06:02.996 --> 06:12.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Bowie; mandatory union
dues before the
Supreme Court; and much more.

06:12.372 --> 06:18.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With just three weeks to go
until the nation's
first early voting contests in
Iowa, the polls

06:18.111 --> 06:22.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are narrowing and many of the
presidential
candidates are sharpening their
attacks.

06:22.949 --> 06:28.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side today,
Hillary Clinton
stressed the differences within
the Democratic

06:28.054 --> 06:33.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
field, while Bernie Sanders
pushed his core
populist message to potential
Hawkeye State

06:33.760 --> 06:35.662 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voters.

06:35.695 --> 06:38.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
You can run a strong and, I
believe, winning

06:38.098 --> 06:44.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign without asking Wall
Street or the
drug companies or millionaires
and billionaires

06:44.571 --> 06:49.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for their support. You can go to
ordinary
people who want real change in
this country

06:49.442 --> 06:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you can do it with the
support of the
middle class of this country.

06:54.214 --> 06:58.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
As you begin to think about the
caucus and

06:58.351 --> 07:02.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
read about what we're each
saying and talk
to your friends and neighbors, I
think it's

07:02.922 --> 07:11.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time for us to have the kind of
spirited debate
that you deserve us to have.
Again, we're

07:11.097 --> 07:17.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
so much better than the
Republicans, but we
do have differences, and you
deserve to know

07:17.203 --> 07:19.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what those differences are.

07:19.039 --> 07:23.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's get
into some of
those differences now on this
Politics Monday.

07:23.176 --> 07:28.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reporting from the trial,
they're both in
Iowa tonight, Tamara Keith of
NPR and Amy

07:28.148 --> 07:30.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Walter of The Cook Political
Report.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hope you are both indoors,
because I
know it's cold outside.

07:34.421 --> 07:40.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are seeing a tightening of
the race today,
Amy, new poll out today showing
Bernie Sanders

07:40.393 --> 07:45.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has caught up to within three
points of Hillary
Clinton. That's an NBC/Wall
Street Journal/Marist

07:45.765 --> 07:47.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
poll.

07:47.300 --> 07:52.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do we understand why this race
is tightening?
What's behind these numbers?

07:52.272 --> 07:55.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well,
the Hillary Clinton campaign
will tell you,

07:55.975 --> 08:00.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in fact, they have told us since
the very
beginning of this race, that
they expected

08:00.180 --> 08:03.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this was going to be tight all
along. Of course,
all candidates say that.

08:03.350 --> 08:08.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we know why it's going to be
tight. It's
because the same dynamics are in
play this

08:08.788 --> 08:15.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year as they were back in 2007
and 2008. Back
then, Hillary Clinton did best
among those

08:15.662 --> 08:20.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who traditionally come in
caucus, older
voters. She did much better with
women, where

08:20.600 --> 08:24.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Barack Obama did better with
independents
and younger people, people who
don't necessarily

08:24.571 --> 08:26.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
show up to caucus.

08:26.539 --> 08:32.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This same dynamic is playing out
here in 2016,
but Bernie Sanders playing the
role of Barack

08:32.112 --> 08:37.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama and Hillary Clinton
playing the role
of herself again. And so the
question on caucus

08:37.217 --> 08:42.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night will come down to exactly
who comes
out to vote, which, of course,
none of us

08:42.355 --> 08:44.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can know until that night.

08:44.224 --> 08:48.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if it's a big number of
people that come
out, including people who don't
traditionally

08:48.962 --> 08:55.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show up on a Monday in February,
then this
race will indeed be very close.
If it's more

08:55.802 --> 09:00.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the traditional kind of
Democratic voters
that show up every year, then
Hillary Clinton,

09:00.540 --> 09:02.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think, will have an easier
time winning.

09:02.575 --> 09:07.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Tamara, is
this tightening
changing the way these
candidates talk to

09:07.080 --> 09:08.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the voters and what they're
saying?

09:08.915 --> 09:11.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: I don't
know if it's the tightening
that's doing it

09:11.418 --> 09:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or the limited time left on the
calendar,
but they are definitely talking
in a different

09:16.856 --> 09:18.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
way than they have before.

09:18.625 --> 09:22.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In particular, Hillary Clinton
is much more
pointed in the way she talks
about Bernie

09:22.829 --> 09:26.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders than she has been in the
past. And
just let me give you a little
example, which

09:26.099 --> 09:31.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is an argument they're now
having about guns.
This came up back in October,
and Hillary

09:31.604 --> 09:37.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton talked about Bernie
Sanders' position
on immunity or some level of
immunity for

09:37.777 --> 09:42.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gun makers and gun dealers, but
she never
really called him out by name.

09:42.782 --> 09:49.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now she's saying Bernie Sanders
supported
this thing when it came up in
2005 in Congress.

09:49.789 --> 09:55.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's open to possibly changing
his position
on it or revisiting it, but he
hasn't changed

09:55.662 --> 10:02.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his position yet. And she is
saying, Barack
Obama, the president and I, we
want to take

10:02.268 --> 10:06.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
away this immunity. Bernie
Sanders, calling
him out by name, doesn't want
to.

10:06.339 --> 10:11.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's very different that she
-- they're
talking about each other now by
name, and

10:11.511 --> 10:13.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're talking very
specifically about issues.

10:13.446 --> 10:17.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Amy, I saw
this afternoon
her campaign put out a statement
about that

10:17.383 --> 10:22.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she wants to put a surcharge on
multimillionaires.
It's very clear what she's
trying to -- whose

10:22.956 --> 10:24.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attention she's trying to get.

10:24.924 --> 10:27.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Exactly.

10:27.494 --> 10:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I was at a Bernie Sanders
event today
here in Iowa. And what was
interesting, to

10:33.466 --> 10:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tamara's point, you know,
Hillary Clinton
seems to have sharpened her
attacks on Bernie

10:38.538 --> 10:46.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders, whereas Bernie seems to
be the sort
of subtler, gentler attacker
here, still refusing

10:46.479 --> 10:50.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to call her out. He calls her
out, but not
quite as pointedly.

10:50.650 --> 10:56.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He continues to mention the fact
that he's
never run negative ads in his
time as a candidate,

10:56.322 --> 11:00.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suggesting he's not going to do
it this time.
He wants to win on the merits of
the debate.

11:00.260 --> 11:05.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's no question that, in
talking to
Bernie Sanders' supporters, they
feel like,

11:05.298 --> 11:10.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no matter what, they have won
because they
have forced Hillary Clinton to
move to their

11:10.203 --> 11:16.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
position. They see a more
liberal position,
and, specifically, of course, on
this last

11:16.476 --> 11:18.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
issue, on economic inequality.

11:18.311 --> 11:22.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Tamara, they
must -- the
Sanders people must think that
this sort of,

11:22.515 --> 11:25.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as you put it, soft response is
working for
them.

11:25.718 --> 11:31.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It's very much
Bernie Sanders'
personality. It's the persona
that he's had

11:31.658 --> 11:36.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a candidate throughout his
political career,
and he doesn't intend to change
that.

11:36.095 --> 11:42.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, he is willing to go
there on issues.
He has been calling on Clinton
to support

11:42.869 --> 11:47.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a bill on paid family leave that
he's a co-sponsor
of, along with Kirsten
Gillibrand and other

11:47.941 --> 11:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
senators. Clinton says, I
support paid family
leave just like you do, but she
wants to pay

11:54.213 --> 11:56.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for it in a different way.

11:56.249 --> 12:03.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think that -- and with that
tax proposal,
Bernie Sanders' campaign came
out and said

12:03.623 --> 12:08.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that won't be enough, what
Clinton is proposing.
So I think they are starting to
get chippy

12:08.861 --> 12:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on issues themselves, and I
think we can expect
to see them fighting about taxes
in the weeks

12:13.933 --> 12:14.767 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ahead.

12:14.801 --> 12:15.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I like that word,
chippy.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, guess who else is...

12:17.503 --> 12:19.305 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

12:19.339 --> 12:21.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Guess who else is
talking about
Bernie Sanders? None other than
Donald Trump

12:21.941 --> 12:26.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had something to say about him
today. This
is part of what Mr. Trump said.
Let's listen.

12:26.879 --> 12:30.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I want to run against Bernie.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

12:31.951 --> 12:37.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, that's a dream
come true.
This guy, he would make some
president -- 90

12:37.957 --> 12:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent tax, everybody. Does
anybody mind
paying 90 percent tax? Because
you go with

12:43.630 --> 12:48.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie, you're going to have
yourself a nice
90 percent tax. He wants to take
it all away

12:48.267 --> 12:50.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from you.

12:50.069 --> 12:54.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, Mr.
Trump still has
other Republican candidates to
worry about,

12:54.140 --> 12:56.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but he is talking about Bernie
Sanders.

12:56.342 --> 13:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, two things
going on here.
One, Donald Trump always has to
be part of

13:02.315 --> 13:09.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whatever the talking points are.
So he wanted
get himself into what is a
debate between

13:09.122 --> 13:12.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders and Hillary
Clinton and make
sure nobody forgot about him. He
inserts himself.

13:12.992 --> 13:17.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the other piece goes to what
Bernie Sanders
is talking about a lot more now,
which is

13:17.597 --> 13:22.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he is the more electable
candidate. For
a long time, the conventional
wisdom has been,

13:22.802 --> 13:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well, Hillary Clinton, she may
have a tough
time with very liberal voters,
but she is

13:26.673 --> 13:28.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a better general election
candidate.

13:28.541 --> 13:32.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders points to these
recent polls
that you, Judy, pointed out,
specifically

13:32.445 --> 13:38.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Marist poll, that shows
that Bernie
Sanders is beating Donald Trump
handily in

13:38.818 --> 13:43.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New Hampshire, whereas Hillary
Clinton is
only up by one point. Bernie
Sanders is now

13:43.589 --> 13:45.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying, I'm the more electable
candidate.

13:45.458 --> 13:49.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, to be sure, nobody has
talked about Bernie
Sanders yet. This issue that
Donald Trump

13:49.429 --> 13:55.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brought up about 90 percent tax,
we will hear
a lot about the amount of
spending and where

13:55.635 --> 13:59.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's coming. From should Bernie
Sanders be
the nominee, it will be a very
tough road

13:59.639 --> 14:01.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for him. Those numbers will
change.

14:01.641 --> 14:06.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, I think what Donald
Trump is trying
to do is to say, whoa, whoa,
whoa, don't let

14:06.913 --> 14:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bernie Sanders put the cart
before the horse
here.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, about 45
seconds left,
Tamara.

14:11.784 --> 14:16.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But fill us in on, where does
the Republican
race stand right now in Iowa?

14:16.155 --> 14:20.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, it's sort of
a neck-and-neck
situation, depending on which
poll you look

14:20.526 --> 14:26.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at, between Donald Trump and Ted
Cruz, Ted
Cruz being the senator from
Texas.

14:26.833 --> 14:33.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Ted Cruz has really
consolidated the evangelical
vote, and Donald Trump seems to
be getting

14:33.172 --> 14:39.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost all of the rest. And
Trump, I think,
today even speculated as to why
some of those

14:39.479 --> 14:45.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who are so far behind in
the polls
don't just drop out. So, there
you have it.

14:45.918 --> 14:49.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're just
watching,
along with the two of you. We're
glad you're

14:49.655 --> 14:51.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there as our eyes and ears.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tamara Keith, Amy Walter, good
luck on the
trail. Thank you both.

14:54.694 --> 14:55.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Thank you.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.
Thanks.

14:58.364 --> 15:03.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And while the
candidates jockey
for position and try to win over
voters, the

15:04.003 --> 15:09.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bipartisan group called No
Labels is still
hammering away at its goal of
bringing the

15:09.375 --> 15:11.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
parties together.

15:11.210 --> 15:16.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, they announced
Republicans Ben Carson,
Chris Christie, John Kasich,
Rand Paul, and

15:16.616 --> 15:21.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, and one Democrat,
Martin O'Malley,
have all signed a pledge to work
toward the

15:22.021 --> 15:28.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No Labels policy agenda, which
calls for creating
jobs, securing Social Security
and Medicare,

15:28.828 --> 15:32.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
balancing the federal budget,
and making the
United States energy-secure.

15:32.431 --> 15:37.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A short time ago, I spoke with
the group's
co-chairs, former Connecticut
Senator Joe

15:37.436 --> 15:42.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lieberman and former Utah
Governor Jon Huntsman.

15:42.041 --> 15:45.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Lieberman, Governor
Huntsman, thank
you for joining us.

15:45.678 --> 15:52.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you have five Republicans
and one Democrat
who have signed this pledge.
What exactly

15:52.185 --> 15:53.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are they pledging to do,
Governor Huntsman?

15:54.020 --> 15:57.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON HUNTSMAN (R), Former Utah
Governor: Well,
they are pledging to embrace a
process for

15:57.990 --> 16:04.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goal-setting and leadership in a
bipartisan
fashion, drawing from the
elements of a national

16:04.063 --> 16:11.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strategic agenda, which include
four big policy
categories, jobs, entitlements,
energy, and

16:11.871 --> 16:13.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a balanced budget.

16:13.840 --> 16:18.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, essentially, every one of
the six candidates,
a very diverse group, I might
add, they are

16:18.611 --> 16:23.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stating that they will support
the national
strategic agenda, and, number
two, they will

16:23.916 --> 16:28.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sit down and meet with a
bipartisan group
of congressional leaders within
30 days of

16:29.021 --> 16:34.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being elected to the presidency,
and, third,
to establish a goal of drawing
from one of

16:34.794 --> 16:40.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those big issue categories and
leading out
in a bipartisan fashion in
delivering what

16:40.533 --> 16:42.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the American people really are
looking for.

16:42.435 --> 16:47.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Senator
Lieberman, hearing
this, aren't these, though, the
kind of general

16:47.573 --> 16:52.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
goals stated in a broad-brush
way that just
about anyone could agree to?

16:52.378 --> 16:56.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE LIEBERMAN (D), Former U.S.
Senator: Well,
that's exactly the way we framed
them, because

16:56.148 --> 17:01.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're operating from the premise
that we're
trying to disrupt the
dysfunction in the Washington

17:01.587 --> 17:03.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political system.

17:03.389 --> 17:07.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're trying to create some
incentives for
people to work together, and one
of the best

17:07.059 --> 17:12.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ways is to have people agree at
least on commonly
held goals. That's the four
policy areas.

17:12.832 --> 17:17.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, really, left, right, center,
Democrat,
Republican, should agree on the
goals, and

17:17.470 --> 17:22.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then for these presidential
candidate to promise,
if they get elected that, within
the first

17:22.975 --> 17:29.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
30 days in office, they will
call members
of Congress, both parties in, to
begin negotiating

17:29.081 --> 17:31.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get something done on at
least one of the
goals.

17:32.018 --> 17:38.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Frankly, I'm surprised all that
15 of the
current presidential candidates
didn't sign

17:38.624 --> 17:43.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on to this. I'm grateful that
the six did,
but I'm puzzled that the other
nine haven't,

17:43.596 --> 17:48.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we're going to continue to
pursue them
to make our case that it's not
asking much

17:48.401 --> 17:54.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for them to pledge, promise to
work together
across party lines, which hasn't
happened

17:54.507 --> 17:56.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very much in Washington lately.

17:56.275 --> 17:59.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor
Huntsman, though,
at the same time, isn't it the
case -- the

17:59.378 --> 18:05.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact that candidates from
different parties,
say, a conservative Republican,
is going to

18:05.751 --> 18:12.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a very different concept of
what it means
to secure Social Security and
Medicare than

18:12.892 --> 18:14.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a liberal Democrat?

18:14.660 --> 18:17.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON HUNTSMAN: And that, Judy, is
the beauty
of governing. And that's what
this process

18:17.663 --> 18:19.432 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is so important.

18:19.465 --> 18:22.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what I had to do as a
governor of a
state. You create a vision. You
put forward

18:22.435 --> 18:27.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ideas. You build bipartisan
coalitions and
you manage it through to
fruition. It's been

18:27.373 --> 18:31.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a long time since we have put
points on the
board in terms of getting big,
important things

18:31.510 --> 18:33.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
done for the American people.

18:33.412 --> 18:38.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can remember in the '80s, when
Ronald Reagan
did so with Speaker Tip O'Neill.
They set

18:38.851 --> 18:44.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a goal around Medicare, Social
Security and
tax reform. And I remember in
the '90s, when

18:44.223 --> 18:49.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich,
then speaker
of the House, they too set a
goal. Differing

18:49.795 --> 18:55.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
widely from an ideological
standpoint, they
took two respectively different
pathways to

18:55.401 --> 18:57.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the end point, but you know
what? They got
there.

18:57.436 --> 19:02.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you have to set the goal
first and expect
that people on both sides are
going to negotiate,

19:02.341 --> 19:06.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compromise and ultimately figure
out a way
to get there. That's all part of
the process.

19:06.145 --> 19:11.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Senator
Lieberman, you're
not underestimating how far
apart these candidates,

19:11.884 --> 19:14.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many of them are, on these
fundamental questions?

19:14.353 --> 19:19.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE LIEBERMAN: In a sense, we
are, through
No Labels, in a very different
way expressing

19:19.825 --> 19:25.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the anger, the frustration that
so many Americans
feel about how the American
government has

19:25.131 --> 19:26.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gone off the track.

19:26.932 --> 19:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is being expressed by a
lot of these
candidates with anger as well.
But, in the

19:32.738 --> 19:38.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end, you got to be more than
angry. You got
to be willing, history tells us,
to work with

19:38.277 --> 19:42.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people in the other party to get
something
done. And we're trying to create
a vehicle

19:42.815 --> 19:48.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the voters to send that
message loud and
clear to the presidential
candidates.

19:48.320 --> 19:52.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Governor
Huntsman, finally,
though, can you really hold
these candidates

19:52.258 --> 19:53.692 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
accountable?

19:53.726 --> 19:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON HUNTSMAN: The American
people will do
just that. I have no doubt.

19:56.429 --> 20:02.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The country is hungry for this
kind of sense
of bipartisan problem-solving.
They're turning

20:02.468 --> 20:06.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out. And you better believe
they're turning
out to the town hall meetings
and will be

20:06.906 --> 20:10.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right up until the primary, and
they're going
to hold the candidates
accountable, ultimately.

20:10.943 --> 20:15.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why creating the
vehicle, which
we have done through No Labels,
is exactly

20:15.748 --> 20:20.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what needs to be done. There is
no other movement
quite like it. We're
Republicans. We're Democrats.

20:20.519 --> 20:25.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're independents. We have
different affiliations,
but we all agree on the
necessity of problem-solving

20:25.858 --> 20:29.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in order to get the work of the
American people
done. And that's what's been
missing.

20:29.361 --> 20:39.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor Jon
Huntsman, Senator
Joe Lieberman, we thank you
both.

20:39.405 --> 20:46.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor Jon
Huntsman, Senator
Joe Lieberman, we thank you
both.

20:46.112 --> 20:51.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the most influential and
revolutionary
musical artists of his
generation, David Bowie,

20:51.851 --> 20:55.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
died yesterday after an 18-month
battle with
cancer.

20:55.955 --> 21:02.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a career that spanned more
than five decades,
the sale of more than 140
million albums,

21:02.628 --> 21:08.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and included an ever-changing
and sometimes
androgynous look that led to
glam rock and

21:08.367 --> 21:13.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many other iconic moments, David
Bowie remained
an original to the end.

21:13.639 --> 21:16.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has our
remembrance.

21:16.909 --> 21:26.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Constantly
changing, but somehow
always uniquely himself, David
Bowie was one

21:26.952 --> 21:37.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Constantly
changing, but somehow
always uniquely himself, David
Bowie was one

21:38.030 --> 21:44.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the culture's heroic figures
for decades,
appearing in many guises, shapes
and forms,

21:44.970 --> 21:49.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leaving a mark on rock music and
well beyond.

21:49.141 --> 22:00.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was born David Jones in South
London in
1947, and rose to fame first in
1969 as Major

22:00.886 --> 22:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tom in the hit song "Space
Oddity," and then,
memorably, in the early '70s as
another otherworldly

22:14.233 --> 22:17.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
character, Ziggy Stardust.

22:17.403 --> 22:20.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Rolling Stone" music critic
Anthony DeCurtis:

22:20.639 --> 22:28.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY DECURTIS, "Rolling
Stone": Suddenly,
here's David Bowie, kind of a
much more complex,

22:29.014 --> 22:35.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
subversive figure than many of
those artists
were. And he really gave a lot
of energy for

22:35.888 --> 22:42.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what was going to drive music,
well, until
now, really, but certainly
through the '70s.

22:42.761 --> 22:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When he came on the scene, it
was like, this
is the future.

22:46.866 --> 22:51.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Nothing you have seen
or heard about
David Bowie will prepare you.

22:51.103 --> 22:56.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In 1976, Bowie
stepped into
another artistic world, acting
as the pale

22:56.242 --> 23:00.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
alien in the film "The Man Who
Fell to Earth."

23:00.613 --> 23:07.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, in the '80s, he became a
music video
and fashion icon, cementing his
mainstream

23:07.820 --> 23:17.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pop star status with a string of
hits, telling
his fans, let's dance. His range
of pursuits,

23:17.863 --> 23:24.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pop star status with a string of
hits, telling
his fans, let's dance. His range
of pursuits,

23:25.004 --> 23:32.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very much including a visual
sensibility,
also attracted those in the art
world.

23:32.077 --> 23:36.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Michael Darling is with
Chicago's Museum of
Contemporary Art, which hosted
an exhibition

23:36.615 --> 23:38.417 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Bowie.

23:38.450 --> 23:40.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL DARLING, Chicago Museum
of Contemporary
Art: The thing that made Bowie
such a good

23:40.286 --> 23:46.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
subject for a museum exhibition
is the variety
of his output. We had costumes.
We had stage

23:46.592 --> 23:50.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
designs, graphic designs,
handwritten lyrics,
and things like that.

23:50.262 --> 23:55.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The range, the
showmanship,
playfulness all were hugely
influential. Madonna

23:55.901 --> 23:59.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spoke to it when Bowie was
inducted into the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in
1996.

23:59.905 --> 24:06.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADONNA, Musician: Before I saw
David Bowie
live, I was your normal,
dysfunctional, rebellious

24:06.945 --> 24:13.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
teenager from the Midwest. And
he has truly
changed my life.

24:13.619 --> 24:17.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Today, other
musicians and
artists spoke to Bowie's
influence, including

24:17.489 --> 24:19.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some of the day's biggest stars.

24:19.425 --> 24:22.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY DECURTIS: It's one thing
to be influential
in rock 'n' roll, but when you
start affecting

24:22.795 --> 24:30.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the pop world -- and by that, I
mean people
like Madonna or Lady Gaga --
Bowie was an

24:30.569 --> 24:33.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
extremely important figure for
them.

24:33.305 --> 24:39.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This idea that you could
continually reinvent
yourself, that every time you
stepped out

24:39.178 --> 24:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the stage, it was a stage,
and which character
are you going to be playing?
That was anybody's

24:45.718 --> 24:52.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guess. Bowie never seemed old.
That sense
of reinvention really made him
seem of the

24:52.791 --> 24:54.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time at every time.

24:54.560 --> 24:58.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL DARLING: So many artists
these days
are working across different
media. They're

24:58.497 --> 25:03.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making videos. They're doing
performances.
They're painting. They're taking
photographs.

25:03.635 --> 25:08.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And David Bowie was already, you
know, as
early as the 1960s, doing that
kind of work.

25:08.941 --> 25:14.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Tributes also
came from fans,
some at a mural in his hometown,
even some

25:14.113 --> 25:18.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from very high places, such as
British Prime
Minister David Cameron.

25:18.684 --> 25:22.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON, British Prime
Minister: David
Bowie was a genius. For someone
of my age,

25:22.721 --> 25:25.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
he provided a lot of the
soundtrack of our
lives.

25:25.524 --> 25:29.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Bowie was married
for more
than 20 years to the supermodel
Iman, with

25:29.928 --> 25:34.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whom he had a daughter. He also
had a son
from a previous marriage.

25:34.066 --> 25:38.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had remained active in recent
years, he'd
kept working. The song "Lazarus"
appears on

25:38.804 --> 25:44.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his last album, a collaboration
with a jazz
quartet called "Blackstar,"
which was released

25:44.343 --> 25:54.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this past Friday, on Bowie's
birthday.

25:54.386 --> 26:02.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this past Friday, on Bowie's
birthday.

26:02.694 --> 26:12.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Bowie died of cancer
Sunday night. He
was 69 years old.

26:12.738 --> 26:19.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Bowie died of cancer
Sunday night. He
was 69 years old.

26:19.745 --> 26:24.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

26:24.950 --> 26:30.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
ethics of
interviewing an infamous drug
lord; how college

26:30.389 --> 26:35.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
players continue to play
football despite
bans after they have had
concussions; and

26:35.561 --> 26:39.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the power of poetry in a
juvenile detention
center.

26:39.364 --> 26:42.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, first, to the Supreme
Court.

26:42.835 --> 26:47.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the justices heard
arguments involving
a group of California
schoolteachers and a

26:47.940 --> 26:53.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
major teachers union, in a case
that could
have wide ramifications for
organized labor.

26:53.912 --> 26:59.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question: Can teachers who
aren't union
members be required to pay some
union dues?

26:59.985 --> 27:03.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our regular Marcia Coyle of "The
National
Law Journal" was in the
courtroom today, and

27:03.822 --> 27:06.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she's here with us now to tell
us more.

27:06.725 --> 27:09.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marcia, before I begin, I have
to say, you
and I were just talking about
David Bowie,

27:09.995 --> 27:11.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and you said you remembered
something special.

27:11.930 --> 27:13.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
I do.

27:13.765 --> 27:19.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember his duet with Bing
Crosby on a
Crosby Christmas special, when
he sang "Peace

27:19.505 --> 27:25.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Earth" and Bing Crosby sang
"Little Drummer
Boy." And it was just a really
beautiful duet,

27:25.210 --> 27:26.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a moment, yes.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another testament
to his versatility.

27:28.347 --> 27:29.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Yes, definitely.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I had to ask you
about that.

27:31.049 --> 27:33.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this case involving the
teachers in California...

27:33.585 --> 27:34.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: No singing in the
Supreme Court
today.

27:34.820 --> 27:35.487 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

27:35.521 --> 27:35.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No singing today.

27:36.021 --> 27:37.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: No.

27:37.089 --> 27:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is a case
with some history.

27:38.524 --> 27:40.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Yes.

27:40.526 --> 27:48.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 1977, the Supreme Court
upheld a state
law that required unions, which
at the time

27:48.667 --> 27:55.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were the exclusive bargaining
agent and had
to represent all public
employees in that

27:55.173 --> 28:00.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unit, it allowed those unions to
collect -- or
it required those unions to
collect so-called

28:00.145 --> 28:06.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agency shop fees in order to
cover their share
of the collective bargaining
costs, even though

28:06.718 --> 28:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they were non-members of the
union.

28:09.221 --> 28:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Supreme Court at the time
said that the
interference with their First
Amendment speech

28:14.927 --> 28:19.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and association rights were
justified for
two reasons. Government
employers wanted labor

28:19.965 --> 28:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
peace. They didn't want to be
negotiating
with multiple representatives
with often conflicting

28:25.170 --> 28:26.972 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
demands.

28:27.005 --> 28:33.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, the government
employers wanted
to avoid free riders, those
non-union members

28:33.812 --> 28:39.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who would get the benefits of
collective bargaining
without sharing in the cost.
Fast-forward

28:39.217 --> 28:46.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost 40 years. The Supreme
Court has two
cases, one in 2012, another in
2014, both

28:46.658 --> 28:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Justice Alito, casting doubt
on whether
that 1977 decision was really
good law.

28:55.334 --> 29:03.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And into that doubt stepped some
smart lawyers,
anti-union lawyers who created a
case that

29:03.141 --> 29:08.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would challenge that 1977
decision head on.
And that's the case the court
heard today.

29:08.213 --> 29:11.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, tell us how
it unfolded
today, the main arguments. And
how did the

29:12.017 --> 29:12.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
justices respond?

29:12.651 --> 29:14.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: OK.

29:14.419 --> 29:18.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
First up would be the 10
California public
school teachers who are
objecting to paying

29:18.724 --> 29:27.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any fees to the union. The -- I
saw in the
court what I would call a clear
ideological

29:27.232 --> 29:34.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
divide. You had the more
conservative justices
being very skeptical of the
union's claims

29:34.539 --> 29:42.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the interests served by
that 1977 decision
really did comport or really did
justify the

29:42.347 --> 29:47.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First Amendment encroachment by
the agency
shop fees.

29:47.986 --> 29:52.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice Kennedy was the most
critical voice,
I think, during the arguments.
He said this

29:52.391 --> 29:58.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was compelled speech, and what
the unions
were doing were creating
compelled riders,

29:58.296 --> 30:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not free riders, but compelled
riders.

30:01.500 --> 30:08.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You also had the chief justice
and Justices
Alito and Justice Scalia
questioning the line

30:08.674 --> 30:14.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the court in 1977 drew
between collective
bargaining activities, for which
unions could

30:14.413 --> 30:20.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
collect the fees, and unrelated
activities
that were more political.

30:20.152 --> 30:24.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice Scalia said everything
that is collectively
bargained with the government
has a political

30:24.690 --> 30:33.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
component to it. On the other
side, you had
justices like Justice Ginsburg,
Kagan, Sotomayor

30:33.165 --> 30:39.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
demanding of the California
teachers who are
challenging this a special
justification for

30:39.571 --> 30:47.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overruling a 1977 precedent
that's been around
40 years, and, as Justice Kagan
said, tens

30:47.145 --> 30:54.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of thousands of contracts,
affecting maybe
10 million people have been in
place because

30:54.119 --> 30:55.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of that 1977 decision.

30:55.987 --> 31:01.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marcia, something
-- in fact,
a fair amount has been written
about whether

31:01.059 --> 31:05.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is going to have broader
repercussions.
Did that come up in the
arguments today?

31:05.263 --> 31:07.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: It did.

31:07.065 --> 31:12.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, Justice Ginsburg said,
if this 1977
precedent falls, so, too, will
the court's

31:12.070 --> 31:19.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decisions upholding similar
required fees,
for example, that lawyers play
-- pay in mandatory

31:19.411 --> 31:25.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bar associations, and even
student activity
fees paid in public
universities.

31:25.517 --> 31:30.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is a disagreement
between the two
sides over the impact. The
teachers challenging

31:30.655 --> 31:36.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fees, their lawyers say, no,
unions will
continue to go on. There are 25
states that

31:36.661 --> 31:42.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't have agency shop fees and
their unions
continue to exist and thrive.

31:42.267 --> 31:48.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other side, the unions, say,
no, this
is a major blow. We use this
money to do things

31:48.140 --> 31:54.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like train teachers, train
firefighters in
other types of unions, provide
equipment that

31:54.813 --> 31:59.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
maybe counties and local
governments can't
afford. So they see this as a
real weakening

31:59.351 --> 32:03.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and a blow if that 1977 decision
falls.

32:03.054 --> 32:06.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, this one
has been watched
closely. And we're going to be
seeing a lot

32:06.458 --> 32:08.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more of you soon.

32:08.260 --> 32:11.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: It is going to be
a very big
end of term, Judy, so I'm sure I
will be back.

32:11.363 --> 32:12.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We can't wait.

32:13.031 --> 32:13.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Marcia Coyle, thank you.

32:13.665 --> 32:16.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure.

32:16.334 --> 32:27.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The United States
and Mexico
are now trying to determine how
to have the

32:27.913 --> 32:33.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recently-captured drug kingpin
El Chapo extradited
from Mexico to the U.S.

32:33.485 --> 32:38.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This weekend, "Rolling Stone"
magazine published
a story about El Chapo that
could have come

32:38.924 --> 32:44.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
straight out of a Hollywood
screenplay. It
was written and reported by
actor Sean Penn,

32:44.563 --> 32:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who secretly visited the drug
kingpin in Mexico
before he'd been captured. But
some are questioning

32:50.869 --> 32:53.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the ethics of "Rolling Stone"'s
methods.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Our William Brangham has more.

32:55.407 --> 32:59.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: "Rolling
Stone"'s article
was the very first time the
public has heard

32:59.311 --> 33:04.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman
directly. The
meeting between the drug lord
and Sean Penn

33:04.449 --> 33:09.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was set up by another actor,
Kate del Castillo,
one of Mexico's most famous TV
stars.

33:09.454 --> 33:14.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Rolling Stone" gave the drug
kingpin fugitive
final approval of the piece.
Sean Penn did

33:14.793 --> 33:19.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spend an evening with Guzman.
But Guzman's
quotes in the piece came from a
video recording

33:19.231 --> 33:21.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after the actor sent him
questions.

33:21.766 --> 33:26.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to the magazine, this
photo accompanied
the story for authentication
purposes, proof

33:26.104 --> 33:27.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that the two had met.

33:27.906 --> 33:31.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me for more on this is
Angela Kocherga.
She's the borderlands bureau
director for

33:31.843 --> 33:36.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cronkite News at Arizona PBS and
a professor
at the Cronkite School of
Journalism.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Angela, thank you for joining
us.

33:38.750 --> 33:42.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wonder if you could just tell
me, what was
your first reaction when you saw
the Sean

33:42.721 --> 33:44.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Penn piece in "Rolling Stone"?

33:44.522 --> 33:47.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA KOCHERGA, Cronkite News:
Well, I thought,
if anyone had gone to a
Hollywood producer

33:47.592 --> 33:50.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with this scenario, they would
have been laughed
out of the room, but, of course,
this was

33:50.695 --> 33:52.430 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the reality.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have this very famous
Mexican actress.
You have this Sean Penn, an
actor/activist,

33:54.866 --> 33:59.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then you have got the most
wanted man
in Mexico meeting in this jungle
hideaway.

33:59.738 --> 34:01.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, it was surprising.

34:01.673 --> 34:07.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the more difficult part of
this for journalists
was that it raised some very
troubling issues

34:07.712 --> 34:13.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about access and what
constitutes real journalism,
as opposed to more of a
conversation, rather

34:13.818 --> 34:15.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than what they're calling an
interview.

34:15.787 --> 34:17.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, let's
talk about some
of those issues.

34:18.023 --> 34:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we mentioned, "Rolling Stone"
granted El
Chapo final approval of the
piece. The magazine

34:25.096 --> 34:29.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
points out that they didn't --
he says he
didn't actually want anything
changed. But

34:29.267 --> 34:32.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that's not a very common
practice for journalists
to grant their subjects.

34:32.470 --> 34:34.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANGELA KOCHERGA: No.

34:34.372 --> 34:38.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, that's not a
ringing endorsement
of hard-hitting journalism, when
your main

34:38.276 --> 34:43.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
subject gives it the green light
without changing
a single word. In Mexico,
unfortunately, this

34:43.448 --> 34:48.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a reality. Self-censorship is
a tool of
survival. Many, many
journalists, colleagues

34:48.720 --> 34:52.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Mexico, have to censor
themselves in order
to survive.

34:52.123 --> 34:56.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
News organizations, individual
journalists
have had to flee for their
lives. Others have

34:56.528 --> 35:01.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been kidnapped and killed in
Mexico for covering
organized crime and official
corruption, which

35:01.633 --> 35:07.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
often intersects. So, this is
really a very
troubling thing, treated as kind
of an entertainment-style

35:07.272 --> 35:11.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
news story, when we have people
dying, journalists
in Mexico risking their lives to
bring their

35:11.776 --> 35:13.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
readers and viewers the truth.

35:13.578 --> 35:18.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, do you
think the public
is served in any way by Sean
Penn's -- quote,

35:18.283 --> 35:20.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unquote -- "interview" with El
Chapo?

35:20.285 --> 35:24.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA KOCHERGA: I think if it
had been characterized
as more of a conversation. The
actual content

35:25.023 --> 35:27.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the interview really doesn't
reveal anything
new.

35:27.759 --> 35:31.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get to see El Chapo and we
hear it in his
own words, but, I mean, he's
basically just

35:31.863 --> 35:37.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
admitting, yes, I'm sending
unknown amounts,
I mean, giant amounts of drugs,
heroin, meth,

35:37.836 --> 35:40.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and every other kind of drug,
across the border.

35:40.138 --> 35:45.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's more the story behind
the story that's
fascinating, the fact that you
have a Hollywood

35:45.443 --> 35:51.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actor and a Mexican soap opera
star who plays
a queenpin, a drug queenpin, in
a soap opera

35:51.549 --> 35:56.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Mexico finding their way into
this jungle
hideaway, at the invitation of
Mexico's most

35:56.621 --> 35:58.390 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wanted man.

35:58.423 --> 36:02.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That story, how they were able
to get there
-- and there are photos on --
from Mexican

36:02.327 --> 36:06.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paparazzi that actually show the
two arriving
in Mexico. So, it doesn't seem,
as much as

36:06.364 --> 36:10.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they wanted to make this a
secret trip, it
seemed that Mexican authorities
probably had

36:10.702 --> 36:12.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a way to track them.

36:12.504 --> 36:16.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Almost every single person in
every tiny town
in Mexico knows who Kate del
Castillo is.

36:16.574 --> 36:20.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But take on
this issue.
You're a journalist. You have
covered this

36:20.745 --> 36:24.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story many, many years. You
teach young journalists.

36:24.149 --> 36:27.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there a circumstance that you
would ever
have agreed to these types of
conditions,

36:27.852 --> 36:32.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to let an actor go and interview
a kingpin
under these circumstances, with
these kind

36:32.323 --> 36:33.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of conditions put on it?

36:33.792 --> 36:37.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA KOCHERGA: I don't think
it's a -- we
would call it journalism.

36:37.228 --> 36:41.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would call it a conversation
between an
actor and a drug lord. And that,
in and of

36:41.633 --> 36:44.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
itself, the story behind the
story, is fascinating,
how they came together.

36:44.469 --> 36:49.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we also have to remember,
although Chapo
says, yes, I know drugs kill,
but I do it

36:49.641 --> 36:54.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for -- because I was raised as a
poor person
in Mexico and there were no
other recourses,

36:54.979 --> 36:58.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, those are real stories
in Mexico,that
there is real meat to that part
of it.

36:58.983 --> 37:04.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he also runs the most brutal
drug -- one
of the most brutal drug cartels
in Mexico.

37:04.456 --> 37:09.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I covered the very violent years
in Ciudad
Juarez, the border city across
from El Paso,

37:09.928 --> 37:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Texas, and 10,000 people were
killed in the
span of about five years, as the
Sinaloa cartel,

37:15.233 --> 37:20.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run by Chapo, took on the local
hometown cartel,
the Juarez cartel, and there was
an absolute

37:20.138 --> 37:21.940 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bloodbath.

37:21.973 --> 37:24.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we can't forget the many,
many lives that
have been lost and the many
journalists who

37:24.576 --> 37:28.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have risked their lives trying
to tell these
stories and many others who have
been silenced.

37:28.446 --> 37:32.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are entire regions of
Mexico that are
part of drug trafficking
strongholds, where

37:32.717 --> 37:38.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
journalists cannot report
anything about the
drug cartel without prior
approval.

37:38.056 --> 37:42.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what Sean Penn did probably
is not new
for Mexican journalists, but he
obviously

37:42.160 --> 37:44.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
faced none of the risks that
they face every
day.

37:44.129 --> 37:47.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, and
just for
the record, we did reach out to
"Rolling Stone,"

37:47.265 --> 37:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they had no comment to offer
us.

37:49.067 --> 37:56.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Angela Kocherga, Walter
Cronkite School
of Journalism at Arizona State
University,

37:56.074 --> 37:58.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thank you so much.

37:58.376 --> 38:02.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANGELA KOCHERGA: Thank you.

38:02.647 --> 38:09.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: concussions
in football
and the college game.

38:09.087 --> 38:13.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fans are increasingly aware of
concussions
at the pro level. The most
recent example

38:13.558 --> 38:18.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was on Saturday, when Antonio
Brown of the
Pittsburgh Steelers suffered one
after a brutal

38:19.030 --> 38:24.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hit by Cincinnati linebacker
Vontaze Burfict.
Burfict could be facing
suspension.

38:24.936 --> 38:30.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, tens of millions of
viewers will
watch Clemson and Alabama face
off in college

38:30.508 --> 38:35.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
football's championship game.
It's a big night
for the sport. But, like pro
football, one

38:36.014 --> 38:41.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
question lingering throughout
the season is
how teams are handling
concussions.

38:41.085 --> 38:46.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has one look at
that in a
conversation he recorded
earlier.

38:46.291 --> 38:51.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just as the NFL has taken new
steps to protect
players, some schools and teams
and the NCAA

38:51.429 --> 38:56.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have taken new precautions as
well. But when
it comes to college football,
schools have

38:56.234 --> 39:01.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more latitude on some decisions
and there
are questions about where a team
may take

39:01.172 --> 39:02.807 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
too big a risk.

39:02.840 --> 39:07.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAT, an online news site that
focuses on
health, medical and science, has
a report

39:07.045 --> 39:12.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exploring whether some players
with too many
concussions are still allowed to
play.

39:12.550 --> 39:17.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It tells it through the story of
a sophomore
quarterback, A.J. Long, who
played for Syracuse.

39:17.922 --> 39:23.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After he suffered his third
concussion, the
team's head doctor summoned him.
He was told

39:23.061 --> 39:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him he could no longer play at
Syracuse, but
A.J. wanted to keep playing
somehow.

39:28.600 --> 39:32.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's an excerpt from a video
by STAT featuring
A.J. and his father.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A.J. LONG, Former Syracuse
Football Player:
He was like, hey, from my
professional opinion,

39:35.006 --> 39:40.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that it would be best if
you didn't
play football anymore, so,
therefore, I'm

39:40.078 --> 39:44.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to disqualify you from
continuing to
play contact sports at Syracuse
University.

39:44.849 --> 39:51.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you hear those words, and
it's the final
verdict, it hurts and it shocks
you.

39:51.656 --> 39:57.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACE LONG, Father of A.J. Long:
When the doctor
called, he was really vague.
Well, when you're

39:57.528 --> 40:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
telling me that you're ending my
son's career,
you're worried about his
welfare, what is

40:02.634 --> 40:04.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this going to entail for the
rest of his life?

40:04.802 --> 40:09.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A.J. LONG: After my family doing
their research
and telling me that we're going
to go to a

40:09.207 --> 40:12.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
specialist and we're going to
have them look
at it to tell us what they
think, because

40:12.610 --> 40:16.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is what they do for living,
what I'm
hoping happens is that they look
at my brain

40:16.948 --> 40:19.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they tell me my brain is
fine and it's
completely safe for me to
continue to play

40:19.817 --> 40:21.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the game that I love, in
football.

40:21.719 --> 40:26.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACE LONG: The brain is something
that you
can't play with, but, you know,
it's hard

40:26.157 --> 40:28.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to put a value on the
competitive spirit.

40:28.259 --> 40:32.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David
Armstrong is a reporter
for STAT and joins me now from
Boston.

40:32.997 --> 40:36.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David, as you point out, and the
pictures
do in the piece, this is a kid
that has Syracuse

40:36.768 --> 40:40.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tattooed on his arm. He dreams
of playing
there. He wants it. You can tell
even from

40:40.805 --> 40:43.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this video that he wants to play
ball.

40:43.074 --> 40:48.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the idea that he's
essentially now a free
agent and can be signed again by
another college,

40:48.079 --> 40:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even after he has this history
of concussions.

40:50.348 --> 40:55.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ARMSTRONG, STAT: Yes.
That's what was
really surprising to us, was
that a doctor

40:55.420 --> 41:01.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at one university thought that
his condition
was so perilous, and the danger
so extreme,

41:02.026 --> 41:07.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he could never play contact
sports again
at that university is then able
to go out

41:07.131 --> 41:13.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and be recruited by other
schools, and there
is no NCAA regulation or
restriction on that.

41:13.538 --> 41:17.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So he is basically a free agent
now, with
several schools wooing him.

41:17.975 --> 41:22.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And how about
the tracking
on this? Is there any system
inside the NCAA?

41:22.980 --> 41:26.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You talked to a lot of different
colleges
and sought information from so
many different

41:26.884 --> 41:30.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
schools. How do they know if
they're inheriting
an injured player?

41:30.922 --> 41:35.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID ARMSTRONG: Well, there is
no real way
to know for sure.

41:35.393 --> 41:39.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The player might let them know
or they might
get some information from
someone they know

41:39.797 --> 41:46.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at another school, but the NCAA
doesn't keep
a list or a database of players
who are medically

41:46.371 --> 41:51.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disqualified. And what we found
was that we
approached the 65 schools that
are at the

41:51.642 --> 41:56.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
upper echelon of college
football, and we
asked all of them for basic
information about

41:56.214 --> 41:59.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how many athletes are being
qualified for
concussions.

41:59.951 --> 42:05.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And only nine even responded to
us. And two
gave us the information we were
looking for.

42:05.523 --> 42:09.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's clearly a subject
they're not comfortable
speaking about. And at the
moment, there is

42:09.627 --> 42:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no real good solution that is
even being discussed
about how to make sure athletes
are being

42:15.099 --> 42:16.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
protected for the long term.

42:17.001 --> 42:20.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, you point
out that
there isn't any single standard
on exactly

42:20.905 --> 42:22.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how many concussions is too
many.

42:22.940 --> 42:24.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID ARMSTRONG: That's true.

42:24.776 --> 42:27.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talked to -- one of the more
interesting
people, I think, in the story is
the University

42:27.979 --> 42:32.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Arizona head trainer. And he
told us that
he has disqualified a football
player for

42:32.884 --> 42:37.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a single concussion because it
was so severe,
but that, in another case, he
had a player

42:37.889 --> 42:42.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with 10 concussions throughout
his college
career and his high school
career that he

42:42.927 --> 42:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allowed to continue playing
because he didn't
think that the concussions were
so severe

42:48.399 --> 42:53.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as to disable him and to
incapacitate him
and disqualify him from the
team.

42:53.337 --> 42:59.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It almost
seems like the
player or the parents or the
family, their

42:59.243 --> 43:05.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dreams are their own worst
enemy. Here's a
student who knows what the
potential outcomes

43:05.683 --> 43:09.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are, at least with all the news
that we have
been seeing about what happens
to NFL players

43:09.287 --> 43:14.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with CTE later in their career,
some of them
who have suffered concussions on
the gridiron.

43:14.192 --> 43:16.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID ARMSTRONG: Well, that's
right.

43:16.561 --> 43:21.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, part of the problem here
is the science
and research into this issue is
still in its

43:21.332 --> 43:26.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
infancy, and there is no real
good guidelines
on, for instance, how many
concussions are

43:26.170 --> 43:33.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
too many. So, you have A.J. Long
and his family,
who have two diametrically
opposed opinions,

43:33.044 --> 43:37.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one from a doctor at Syracuse
who says, this
is too dangerous, you are not
playing anymore,

43:37.849 --> 43:42.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then another one from a
concussion center
in Philadelphia, a very
reputable one, that

43:42.320 --> 43:46.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says, as of today, you are
cleared to play
full-contact football.

43:46.357 --> 43:53.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you can imagine the angst
over a decision
like that, when you have black
and white decisions

43:53.464 --> 43:55.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in front of you and evaluations.

43:55.233 --> 43:59.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And those
decisions will
impact the rest of your, not
just playing

43:59.537 --> 44:03.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
career, but, if you have a pro
career, perhaps
the rest of your financial life
as well.

44:03.908 --> 44:08.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ARMSTRONG: Right, because
we know that,
in many cases, there are
long-term effects

44:08.913 --> 44:10.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from these repeated blows to the
head.

44:10.715 --> 44:15.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that's a calculation that the
family and
the player have to make. But
they're doing

44:15.620 --> 44:20.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so with information that's very
confusing
to them and in a system where
one school can

44:20.558 --> 44:25.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tell you, you can't play because
it's too
dangerous, and another school
says, come and

44:25.129 --> 44:26.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
play for us.

44:27.031 --> 44:31.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's why we want to
chronicle this story
and A.J.'s decision, because a
lot of athletes

44:31.135 --> 44:32.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are finding themselves in this
position.

44:32.937 --> 44:36.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What was the
reason that
the schools gave you when they
didn't give

44:36.440 --> 44:38.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you the information you were
looking for?

44:38.276 --> 44:43.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ARMSTRONG: They mostly
cited privacy
concerns, even though we didn't
ask for names

44:43.781 --> 44:46.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or identifying information of
that nature.

44:46.584 --> 44:52.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said that we would be to,
in some cases,
figure out who the injured
athlete is, and,

44:52.056 --> 44:56.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
therefore, that's a violation of
federal law
protecting student privacy and
also health

44:56.827 --> 44:58.696 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
records.

44:58.729 --> 45:01.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a lot of cases, we don't
agree with that.
And this is an area that we are
going to continue

45:01.666 --> 45:03.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to follow up on.

45:03.501 --> 45:07.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, is there
any movement
by the schools in any kind of a
unified fashion

45:07.371 --> 45:09.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the NCAA to figure this
out?

45:09.807 --> 45:12.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID ARMSTRONG: None at all
that we can find.

45:12.743 --> 45:18.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's one of those things where
the NCAA has
just sort of said, you know, the
schools that

45:18.182 --> 45:22.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are members of our organization,
you're on
your own. You figure it out. You
create your

45:22.153 --> 45:23.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own standard.

45:23.955 --> 45:26.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
David Armstrong
from STAT, thanks so much for
joining us.

45:26.691 --> 45:30.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID ARMSTRONG: Thanks for
having me.

45:30.962 --> 45:40.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
a look at
a writing program inside one of
the nation's

45:40.972 --> 45:43.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
largest juvenile detention
facilities.

45:43.941 --> 45:45.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has that story.

45:45.643 --> 45:50.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS, Poet: You
know the
truth of the quarrels and how
history lets

45:50.081 --> 45:53.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the blame go blameless for the
blood that
flows black in the streets.

45:53.484 --> 45:57.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In a classroom
inside the Cook
County Temporary Juvenile
Detention Center

45:57.822 --> 46:03.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Chicago, incarcerated young
people recently
gathered to hear poet Reginald
Dwayne Betts

46:03.661 --> 46:05.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
read his work and take their
questions.

46:05.830 --> 46:08.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: That's
part of what
I meant by history, that it's
this bigger

46:08.332 --> 46:11.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing that we have to understand
to even understand
our own lives.

46:11.802 --> 46:14.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: When you come to
a place like
this, what are you hoping to get
out of it?

46:14.472 --> 46:17.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: I think,
honestly,
I'm trying to get them to pay
attention to

46:17.608 --> 46:21.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their own stories. So I will
read a poem to
them, I will talk to them, and
if I get them

46:21.779 --> 46:25.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to think about their own
stories, they get
to write their stories down and
kind of think

46:25.683 --> 46:30.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a different way about how
their stories
shape the life that they have.
And if you

46:30.421 --> 46:33.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want a different life, you find
a way to tell
different stories.

46:33.758 --> 46:38.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Betts should
know. As a teenager,
he was arrested for carjacking,
tried as an

46:39.030 --> 46:41.332 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
adult, and spent
eight-and-a-half years in
prison.

46:41.365 --> 46:44.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: Yes,
because it's really
easy for me to walk in here and
say that,

46:44.869 --> 46:47.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, when I was 16 years
old, I got locked
up, and pretend like that's the
beginning

46:47.838 --> 46:52.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the narrative or that's the
most important
part of the narrative, when, in
fact, I think

46:52.343 --> 46:54.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it's not the most important
part of the
narrative.

46:55.012 --> 46:58.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't want to define
myself that way,
because, in part, I don't want
you to define

46:58.349 --> 47:00.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
yourselves that way.

47:00.151 --> 47:04.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: While still in
prison, Betts
read intensively, began writing
poetry and

47:04.321 --> 47:10.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
completed high school. And since
getting out
in 2005, he's graduated from
college, earned

47:10.561 --> 47:16.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his master's, written a memoir
and two books
of poetry, and at age 35 is now
a third-year

47:16.567 --> 47:18.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
student at Yale Law School.

47:18.369 --> 47:22.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: What I
want to do today
is to sort of let them know that
I believe

47:22.239 --> 47:26.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what doesn't look and what
doesn't seem to
be possible right now, but I
believe is possible

47:26.444 --> 47:32.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for them, because it is
implausible, but,
hey, implausible happens all the
time.

47:32.516 --> 47:36.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is one of
the nation's
largest juvenile detention
centers, on the

47:37.021 --> 47:43.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day we visited housing over 300
young people
aged 10 to 16 who are awaiting
trial. As a

47:43.894 --> 47:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
condition to film this story, we
were required
to conceal their identities.

47:48.499 --> 47:53.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also home to a fully
functioning public
school, so students don't fall
behind on classwork

47:53.804 --> 47:55.039 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
while here.

47:55.072 --> 47:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: I want
you to talk
in your voice.

47:57.141 --> 48:01.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Betts visited
through a program
called Free Write Jail Arts and
Literacy,

48:01.979 --> 48:08.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which for 15 years has provided
tutoring and
creative writing instruction.

48:08.385 --> 48:16.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A native of Trinidad, Roger
Bonair-Agard is
a poet and teacher who
encourages his students

48:16.660 --> 48:20.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to find their voices using the
familiar language
and places around them.

48:20.898 --> 48:24.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER BONAIR-AGARD, The Poetry
Foundation:
As you might imagine, the young
people here

48:24.068 --> 48:29.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have had who they are, and how
they talk,
and where they live devalued for
a very long

48:29.140 --> 48:30.875 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

48:30.908 --> 48:35.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the idea that those
voices and those
places should be brought to
something that

48:35.679 --> 48:39.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could eventually be this is
really important.

48:39.183 --> 48:43.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: Why you looking at me
like that?
Why you looking at me? Because
I'm willing

48:43.721 --> 48:45.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make a change based on my
mistakes?

48:45.322 --> 48:48.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A student we
spoke with read
one of her new poems.

48:48.759 --> 48:53.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: So I ask, why you
looking at me like
that? Speak. Tell me you
understand I'm more

48:53.697 --> 48:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than what you see. So, take that
chance and
get to know me.

48:56.500 --> 48:58.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's all I have.

48:58.469 --> 48:59.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Nice.

48:59.937 --> 49:01.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why you looking at me like that,
huh?

49:01.272 --> 49:02.439 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Yes.

49:02.473 --> 49:04.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you feel like
that's going
on a lot?

49:04.341 --> 49:09.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: Yes, not just me and,
like, others.
I found myself other people --
that's a common

49:09.480 --> 49:15.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing people do. Me personally,
as a youth,
an African-American, I get
judged. I'm already

49:15.853 --> 49:19.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- I'm detained right now, so I
get will judged
back because of that.

49:19.990 --> 49:24.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, really, if people sit down
and get to
know me, like, such as yourself,
you will

49:24.195 --> 49:29.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know and learn that I'm a good
person, I'm
a good kid, and I'm not what
they think I

49:30.000 --> 49:32.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
am. I'm much better than what
they think I
am.

49:32.536 --> 49:34.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN KEESLING, Director, Free
Write Jail Arts
and Literacy: Our work is
grounded in narrative.

49:34.738 --> 49:38.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ryan Keesling is
the director
of Free Write.

49:38.309 --> 49:44.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN KEESLING: Those issues are
their personal
issues that are serious, and
they need to

49:44.381 --> 49:48.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be processed in some way. Like,
we're not
coming and saying, oh, you did
this, or you

49:48.485 --> 49:51.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did that, you had this happen to
you, you
had this happen to you,
therefore, you are

49:51.255 --> 49:52.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this kind of person.

49:52.990 --> 49:57.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we just allow those issues
to sort of
come to the surface, and
assemble pieces of

49:57.728 --> 50:00.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
art that represent their
processing of those
experiences.

50:00.965 --> 50:05.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: So, let me grab the
broken pieces,
and use my thoughts as glue, put
it all back

50:05.302 --> 50:09.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together, so I can at least have
a clue. Why
blame myself, when I can look
back at my roots,

50:09.640 --> 50:13.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and see myself as a young boy,
watching and
picking up what my father used
to do?

50:13.444 --> 50:16.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One day he said, son, come here.
Let me show
you how this works. He handed me
a handful

50:16.647 --> 50:20.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of crack and put a .22 on my
waistline, which
was hidden behind my shirt. He
said, there's

50:20.317 --> 50:23.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money to be made, and you will
find out what
it's worth, setting me up to die
early, which

50:23.554 --> 50:25.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say he ain't care about my
birth.

50:25.356 --> 50:29.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In a place like
this, does
writing get you respect? It is
something you

50:29.660 --> 50:31.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- that everybody knows you do,
or...

50:31.729 --> 50:34.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STUDENT: It's definitely
something everybody
know I do.

50:34.531 --> 50:40.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, like, they look at it as
like it's
a positive thing. And I love --
I love getting

50:40.104 --> 50:46.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
praise for positive things,
because I didn't
do a lot of positive stuff when
I was out.

50:46.343 --> 50:50.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So doing something positive and
getting a
different reaction, it's like,
OK, I ain't

50:50.481 --> 50:51.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
never felt this before.

50:51.649 --> 50:53.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I mean, why not keep going
with this,
you know?

50:53.951 --> 51:00.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Things here
didn't always seem
so positive. In 1999, the ACLU
sued Cook County,

51:00.291 --> 51:05.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
accusing the center of
overcrowding, unsanitary
conditions and abuse.

51:05.696 --> 51:10.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2007, the federal government
took over,
and through a transitional
administration,

51:10.467 --> 51:15.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the population dropped from more
than 800
residents to today's 300.

51:16.006 --> 51:20.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, control was handed
over to Cook
County's office of the chief
judge, Timothy

51:20.277 --> 51:22.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Evans, who wants to maintain
that momentum.

51:22.112 --> 51:25.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY EVANS, Cook County Chief
Judge: I
think that we are changing, and
we have to

51:25.950 --> 51:32.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
find a way to keep these people
who've gone
through the system from
returning to the system.

51:32.256 --> 51:38.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have to be trained how to
get a job and
keep a job. They have to develop
skills. They

51:39.029 --> 51:43.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can't just be let out with $40
in their pocket
and expect, oh, they're going to
be fine.

51:43.734 --> 51:45.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEONARD DIXON, Superintendent,
Cook County
Juvenile Temporary Detention
Center: Detention

51:45.202 --> 51:48.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is like the emergency room of
the juvenile
justice system.

51:48.172 --> 51:52.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In charge of the
day-to-day
is superintendent Leonard Dixon,
who has run

51:52.609 --> 51:57.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
juvenile institutions across the
country,
most recently in Detroit, and is
known as

51:57.548 --> 51:59.316 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a reformer.

51:59.350 --> 52:01.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEONARD DIXON: I believe in
jails. I don't
have a problem with that. My
issue is, what

52:01.685 --> 52:06.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do you do with people when you
get them in
there, and what kind of services
are you providing,

52:06.256 --> 52:08.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that you can get them back
out in society,
so they can do well?

52:08.926 --> 52:11.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. This
facility is predominantly
African-American.

52:11.762 --> 52:12.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEONARD DIXON: Yes, it's...

52:12.963 --> 52:14.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Far higher
percentage than
the county.

52:14.798 --> 52:19.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEONARD DIXON: There's no
question about it;
96 percent of the kids in here
are kids of

52:19.803 --> 52:24.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
color. And that's a question
that we need
to be asking, why is it that
way?

52:24.575 --> 52:30.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is it a community? Is it the
courts? It's
-- all of it comes together.
It's the police

52:30.114 --> 52:33.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
department. I mean, it's
everything. Everybody
has to come together to figure
out why.

52:33.884 --> 52:38.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Dixon wants to
see more cases
dealt with outside these walls
through halfway

52:38.756 --> 52:42.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
houses, shelters, churches, and
community
programs.

52:42.126 --> 52:46.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Illinois state legislature
took one step
in that direction last year,
passing a bill

52:46.630 --> 52:51.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that aims to reduce the number
of minors automatically
tried as adults, except for the
most violent

52:51.735 --> 52:57.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crimes. It's one drop in a wave
of penal reform
now being discussed across the
country that

52:57.941 --> 53:00.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reginald Dwayne Betts and others
have been
advocating.

53:00.310 --> 53:04.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS: I do
think that a lot
of organizations around the
country, and they're

53:04.281 --> 53:09.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pushing to limit confinement to
when it's
-- only when it's necessary. And
they're pushing

53:09.820 --> 53:14.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to sort of find different ways
within a community
to treat young folks that have
gotten in trouble.
