SOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS SAID THE

18:37.082 --> 18:38.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT WAS KEEPING HIS

18:38.283 --> 18:40.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROMISE TO SHAKE UP WASHINGTON.

18:40.252 --> 18:41.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME TRUMP CRITICS SAID HE WAS

INTERFERING WITH A SERIOUS

18:43.555 --> 18:45.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ALLIES PAUSE THIS WEEK.

18:58.737 --> 19:00.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT DID.

19:00.572 --> 19:02.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT

19:02.040 --> 19:04.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXACTLY THE ISSUE THAT TRUMP

19:04.476 --> 19:07.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANTED TO GET BEHIND THEM, THE

19:07.112 --> 19:08.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSSIBILITY OF SOME KIND OF

19:08.914 --> 19:10.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLLUSION BETWEEN SOME OF HIS

19:10.249 --> 19:11.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSOCIATES AND THE RUSSIAN, IS

19:11.884 --> 19:13.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO INTENSIFY.

19:13.452 --> 19:14.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTINGLY, YOU HAD THE

19:14.686 --> 19:16.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

19:22.161 --> 19:23.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DID NOTICE A STORY THAT I

19:25.531 --> 19:26.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK WE SHOULD PAY MORE

19:26.732 --> 19:28.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTENTION TO THAN WE HAVE: AN

19:28.934 --> 19:30.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARM OF THE TREASURY-- I WANT TO

19:30.202 --> 19:31.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET THIS RIGHT, IT IS THE

19:31.537 --> 19:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE TO

19:36.542 --> 19:37.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIVE THEM INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT

19:37.976 --> 19:40.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT COMMITTEE KNOWS ABOUT

19:40.212 --> 19:41.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS.

19:41.580 --> 19:42.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS ANY

19:42.414 --> 19:44.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SMOKE, MUCH LESS FIRE, BUT IF

19:44.616 --> 19:46.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS STUFF BACK THERE THAT'S

19:46.585 --> 19:47.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO SHOW SOME KIND OF

19:47.586 --> 19:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINANCIAL HANKY-PANKY BETWEEN

19:49.988 --> 19:51.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP ASSOCIATES AND THE

19:51.256 --> 19:53.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIANS, THAT'S THE UNIT OF THE

19:53.692 --> 19:54.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TREASURY THAT'S BEST EQUIPPED TO

19:54.793 --> 19:55.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIND OUT.

19:55.594 --> 19:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK WHATEVER TRUMP WANTED

19:59.064 --> 20:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DO IN FIRING COMEY, HE MAY

20:00.866 --> 20:02.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE HAD THE REVERSE EFFECT.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHO IS GOING TO BE A

20:04.136 --> 20:05.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPLACEMENT?

20:05.103 --> 20:07.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'VE SAID THAT THE INTERVIEW

20:07.539 --> 20:09.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROCESS HAS BEGUN, BUT ONCE THAT

20:09.508 --> 20:11.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPLACEMENT IS THERE, WHAT KIND

20:11.043 --> 20:12.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF CREDIBILITY CHALLENGES DO

20:12.144 --> 20:14.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY FACE?

20:14.580 --> 20:15.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE

20:15.948 --> 20:17.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP HAS SET A LANDMINE AND

20:17.849 --> 20:19.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEPPED ON IT HIMSELF.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FACT THAT HE ASSERTED THAT

20:21.119 --> 20:22.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RUSSIA STORY WAS VERY MUCH

20:22.921 --> 20:25.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON HIS MIND WHEN HE FIRED COMEY,

20:25.290 --> 20:26.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE'S ALREADY SAID PUBLICLY

20:26.992 --> 20:27.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE DOESN'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG

20:27.926 --> 20:29.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH TRYING TO EXACT A PLEDGE OF

20:29.561 --> 20:31.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOYALTY FROM THE F.B.I.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIRECTOR, IS GOING TO MEAN THAT

20:32.864 --> 20:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS FOR

20:34.233 --> 20:36.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHOEVER THAT NEW F.B.I. DIRECTOR

20:36.068 --> 20:37.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS IS GOING TO BE VERY INTENSE.

20:37.936 --> 20:39.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALONG THOSE LINES, I WANT TO

20:39.071 --> 20:41.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT ONE THING OUT: THE SENATE

20:41.240 --> 20:42.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS WHERE THE

20:42.608 --> 20:44.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFIRMATION PROCESS BEGINS.

20:44.142 --> 20:45.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE MORE REPUBLICANS THAN

20:45.277 --> 20:46.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATS ON IT BECAUSE THEY RUN

20:46.612 --> 20:48.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SENATE; BUT THERE ARE THREE

20:48.146 --> 20:49.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS ON THE COMMITTEE,

20:49.748 --> 20:51.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEN SASS AND JEFF FLAKE AND

LINDSEY GRAHAM, WHO ARE

20:57.222 --> 20:58.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMONG THE MOST NON-FANS OF

20:58.223 --> 20:58.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE

20:58.991 --> 20:59.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND MY SENSE

20:59.992 --> 21:00.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THE VETTING PROCESS IS GOING

21:00.892 --> 21:02.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE VERY, VERY INTERESTING

21:02.027 --> 21:03.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO WATCH ONCE THAT NOMINEE,

21:03.395 --> 21:04.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHOEVER HE OR SHE IS, GETS

21:04.663 --> 21:05.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE THAT COMMITTEE.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Woodruff: HOW DOES ALL THIS

21:07.032 --> 21:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAY WITH THE BUSINESS OF TRUMP

21:08.166 --> 21:11.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORTERS?

21:11.937 --> 21:13.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, HERE WE

21:13.772 --> 21:14.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO AGAIN.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE

21:16.975 --> 21:18.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN AND IN THE FIRST FOUR

21:18.176 --> 21:20.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONTHS THAT WHATEVER ROILS

21:20.412 --> 21:21.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASHINGTON OR THE EDITORIAL

21:21.880 --> 21:23.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAGES OF THE NEWSPAPER, TRUMP'S

21:23.282 --> 21:25.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASE IS HAPPY WITH WHAT'S HE'S

21:25.917 --> 21:26.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOING.

21:26.652 --> 21:29.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GREAT MAJORITY OF

21:29.888 --> 21:32.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS THINK HE WAS RIGHT

21:32.257 --> 21:33.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FIRE COMEY.

21:33.558 --> 21:35.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS THE BROADER STORY.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE SO POLARIZED, WE'RE LIKE

21:37.529 --> 21:39.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARRING TRIBES; THAT WHOEVER IS

21:39.031 --> 21:41.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE HEAD OF MY TEAM, I'M GOING

21:41.099 --> 21:42.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DEFEND COME HELL OR HIGH

21:42.301 --> 21:43.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WATER.

21:43.735 --> 21:44.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER PART ABOUT THAT IS

21:44.770 --> 21:47.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE REPORTING IN THE MEDIA

21:47.105 --> 21:48.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS GOING TO HAVE VERY LITTLE

21:48.807 --> 21:50.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EFFECT ON THAT BASE.

21:50.409 --> 21:51.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'VE LEARNED FROM A RECENT PEW

21:51.810 --> 21:53.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLL THAT IF YOU ASK PEOPLE, "DO

21:53.745 --> 21:55.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU THINK THE MEDIA SHOULD ACT

21:55.380 --> 21:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS WATCHDOGS?," A YEAR AGO,

21:57.316 --> 21:58.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WERE

21:58.684 --> 21:59.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXACTLY THE SAME; THREE-QUARTERS

21:59.918 --> 22:00.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID YES.

22:00.719 --> 22:02.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, MORE THAN 90% OF DEMOCRATS

22:02.321 --> 22:04.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY YES, AND LESS THAN 50% OF

22:04.089 --> 22:05.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS SAY YES.

22:05.357 --> 22:08.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THIS POLARIZATION WILL HELP

22:08.160 --> 22:10.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP WITH HIS BASE.

22:10.862 --> 22:11.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: JEFF

22:11.897 --> 22:14.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
