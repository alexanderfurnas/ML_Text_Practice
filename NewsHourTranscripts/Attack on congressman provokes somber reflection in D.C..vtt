JUDY WOODRUFF: A leading
Republican in the U.S. House
lies critically wounded tonight.

00:04.833 --> 00:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Illinois man who shot him,
along with a police officer,
a congressional staffer,

00:10.700 --> 00:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and a lobbyist, has died.

00:12.866 --> 00:17.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They came together in a
fusillade of bullets and
bloodshed early today,
just outside Washington.

00:18.466 --> 00:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our Lisa Desjardins
begins our coverage.

00:20.900 --> 00:22.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(GUNFIRE)

00:22.933 --> 00:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For at least
five minutes, gunshots crackled
across the Northern Virginia

00:28.800 --> 00:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
baseball field where
Republican members of
Congress were practicing.

00:30.933 --> 00:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cell phone video shared with the
"NewsHour" captured a harrowing
scene of a gunfight between

00:36.833 --> 00:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the attacker and Capitol Police.

00:37.533 --> 00:38.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Hey.

00:38.500 --> 00:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that guy OK out there?

00:41.166 --> 00:43.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Has that guy been shot?

00:43.566 --> 00:44.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is he OK?

00:44.566 --> 00:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is anybody talking to him?

00:46.666 --> 00:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The man who
shot the video, Noah Nathan,
had been out walking his dogs.

00:48.733 --> 00:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NOAH NATHAN, Eyewitness: I saw
the congressional players, and,
you know, they're a regular

00:51.100 --> 00:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here practicing in the morning.

00:53.366 --> 00:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then I heard -- I
thought it was fireworks.

00:55.866 --> 00:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then I heard another
one and realized, OK,
maybe that's not fireworks.

00:58.566 --> 01:00.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's gunfire.

01:00.700 --> 01:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then people started
scattering, and then
there was more shots
and you could hear them

01:02.233 --> 01:04.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
skimming off the gravel
and hitting the fence.

01:04.033 --> 01:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it was a helpless feeling.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I couldn't do anything.

01:08.033 --> 01:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As lawmakers
jumped over fences, seeking
cover, House Majority Whip

01:11.600 --> 01:13.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Steve Scalise was
shot in the hip.

01:13.966 --> 01:16.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Alabama Congressman
Mo Brooks saw it all.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:18.333 --> 01:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MO BROOKS (R), Alabama: It's
the feeling of helplessness,
when you have got a baseball

01:20.433 --> 01:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bat and a guy's got a rifle.

01:22.900 --> 01:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you see your friends,
Steve Scalise in particular,
lying on the ground, dragging

01:29.833 --> 01:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
himself from the infield dirt
to the outfield grass, and
there was nothing we could do to

01:32.833 --> 01:34.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
help him.

01:34.766 --> 01:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Georgia
Congressman Barry Loudermilk
says it wasn't a random attack.

01:37.166 --> 01:38.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARRY LOUDERMILK (R), Georgia:
There were civilians out there.

01:40.666 --> 01:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were people walking their
dogs, laying on the ground
screaming and crying, but he

01:41.500 --> 01:42.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wasn't targeting them.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was shooting at us.

01:44.566 --> 01:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Joe Barton
of Texas had taken his
young sons to the practice.

01:46.366 --> 01:48.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:48.533 --> 01:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE BARTON (R), Texas: We got
some of us were in the dugout,
some of us were on the ground.

01:51.166 --> 01:53.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was behind the dugout.

01:53.533 --> 01:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My son Jack got under an SUV.

01:56.833 --> 01:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he was very brave.

01:59.233 --> 02:01.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
My other son Brad was
in the batting cage and
he also was very brave.

02:01.966 --> 02:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In the video,
you can hear people shouting
for police to shoot the gunman.

02:06.833 --> 02:08.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Shoot him!

02:08.066 --> 02:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS:
Again, Mo Brooks:

02:08.833 --> 02:10.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:10.900 --> 02:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MO BROOKS: The bravery that
they displayed, taking on a
guy with the rifle while they

02:12.933 --> 02:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have pistols, shooting from
long distance, and if they
had not been successful, then

02:19.566 --> 02:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the tragedy here would have
undoubtedly been much greater,
because those of us who were

02:22.200 --> 02:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the first base dugout,
we'd of had no chance.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS:
First-responders were on
the scene in minutes.

02:27.466 --> 02:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some victims were airlifted
to hospitals by helicopter.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Scalise underwent surgery and
was in critical condition.

02:33.433 --> 02:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The suspected shooter was
also taken to the hospital,
where he died of his wounds.

02:38.333 --> 02:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police identified him as
66-year-old James Hodgkinson
of Belleville, Illinois.

02:42.533 --> 02:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY SLATER, FBI: Law
enforcement has reason to
believe that the shooter
has been in Alexandria,

02:49.033 --> 02:54.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Virginia, area since
March of this year.

02:56.100 --> 02:59.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The FBI has issued again
a seeking information
poster that is located
on our Web site asking

03:00.566 --> 03:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the public to come forward with
information on the shooter.

03:04.566 --> 03:09.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Florida
Congressman Ron DeSantis
believes he talked with
Hodgkinson just before

03:09.566 --> 03:10.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the shooting.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:12.633 --> 03:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON DESANTIS (R), Florida: An
unidentified individual walked
up to the car, asked Congressman

03:14.700 --> 03:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Duncan, who was in the front
passenger seat, whether they
were Republicans or Democrats

03:18.766 --> 03:19.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the field.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a little bit abrasive.

03:21.833 --> 03:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was something that kind of
struck me as odd, not odd to
the extent I thought he was

03:24.133 --> 03:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to go shoot people.

03:26.133 --> 03:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Already,
a picture has begun to
emerge of Hodgkinson.

03:28.900 --> 03:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Facebook page of the same
name is filled with anti-Trump
posts, and Hodgkinson apparently

03:35.200 --> 03:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
volunteered for Bernie
Sanders' presidential campaign.

03:37.633 --> 03:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Vermont senator today
condemned the shooting
on the Senate floor.

03:41.300 --> 03:42.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:42.933 --> 03:46.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BERNIE SANDERS (I),
Vermont: I am sickened
by this despicable act.

03:46.333 --> 03:51.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And let me be as
clear as I can be.

03:52.733 --> 03:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Violence of any kind is
unacceptable in our society.

03:56.366 --> 04:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I condemn this action in
the strongest possible terms.

04:01.066 --> 04:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There is a
contrast between the location
of this shooting, a neighborhood

04:06.000 --> 04:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is known for putting up
signs of welcome and opposing
hate, and this act of violence

04:09.966 --> 04:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that some say may symbolize
rising anger in America.

04:13.900 --> 04:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the scene, Virginia Governor
Terry McAuliffe specifically
pointed to politics.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

04:19.533 --> 04:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERRY MCAULIFFE (D), Virginia:
What you saw in the last
presidential campaign, there's

04:21.566 --> 04:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just a lot of dug-in hard
feelings out there that
exist in this country today.

04:27.833 --> 04:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do think our country
has become way too divided
between red and blue.

04:31.966 --> 04:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: President
Trump echoed the cry for unity
at the White House hours after

04:35.666 --> 04:37.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the shooting.

04:37.766 --> 04:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: We may have our
differences, but we do well

04:40.600 --> 04:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in times like these to remember
that everyone who serves in
our nation's capital is here

04:48.133 --> 04:52.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because, above all,
they love our country.

04:52.333 --> 04:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The House
canceled votes for the day,
but shaken lawmakers, Democrats

04:57.033 --> 05:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Republicans alike,
gathered on the House floor
in a show of solidarity.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:02.233 --> 05:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House: We are united.

05:04.900 --> 05:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are united in our shock,
we are united in our anguish.

05:09.266 --> 05:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
An attack on one of us is
an attack on all of us.

05:14.866 --> 05:15.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

05:15.533 --> 05:18.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:18.066 --> 05:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA),
House Minority Leader:
We cannot let that be a
victory for the assailant

05:20.766 --> 05:22.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or anyone who would
think that way.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, tomorrow, we will
go out on the field.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will root for our team.

05:26.566 --> 05:30.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We want everyone to do
his or her very best.

05:30.166 --> 05:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will use this occasion
as one that brings us together
and not separates us further.

05:36.833 --> 05:39.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: An
update on conditions.

05:39.600 --> 05:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressman Scalise and one
other staffer who was shot
are in critical condition.

05:43.700 --> 05:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The others injured
today, we're told, are in
good or fair condition.

05:47.266 --> 05:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, also, about that baseball
game, it is scheduled to be,
as planned, tomorrow night.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are not canceling.

05:55.033 --> 05:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Judy, they're adding
another charity cause,
the Fallen Officers Fund.

05:58.466 --> 06:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa, are
there changes in security as
a result of what happened?

06:04.966 --> 06:06.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: I
think the answer to
that, Judy, is not yet.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here, of course, the Capitol
is a highly secure building.

06:09.166 --> 06:10.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's no changes here.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
No one said there
need to be changes.

06:12.933 --> 06:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is a real
question about these
events where many members
of Congress gather in one

06:15.600 --> 06:17.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place.

06:17.600 --> 06:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressman Scalise's security
detail was there today, as
well as one other Capitol

06:21.000 --> 06:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police officer because so
many congressmen were present.

06:24.333 --> 06:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're wondering if there
need to be more of a police
presence when there are not just

06:30.933 --> 06:32.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
leaders, but any members
of Congress gathered
in one place like that.

06:32.833 --> 06:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa,
you're at that Capitol Building
every day, practically.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How are people
dealing with this?

06:39.233 --> 06:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think the
mood today, Judy, is sober.

06:42.833 --> 06:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not highly emotional, but
it's one where they are taking
very serious stock of where

06:47.600 --> 06:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we are as a nation and where
people are in terms of how
