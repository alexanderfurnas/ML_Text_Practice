pocket still being held
by Islamic State forces.

We are continuing to liberate
all our land from Da'esh.

00:26.933 --> 00:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Iraqi people ended the
myth of Da'esh in record time,
although the world thought

00:31.000 --> 00:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that this wasn't possible.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

State's self-proclaimed
capital, Raqqa.

00:39.366 --> 00:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

into the most heavily fortified
portion of the ISIS stronghold.

00:48.500 --> 00:52.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Trump's first
face-to-face meeting

he received at the
Guantanamo Naval Base.

01:09.533 --> 01:13.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's widely reported
that he will also be
paid nearly $8 million.

01:13.800 --> 01:18.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Omar Khadr was captured
in Afghanistan when
he just 15 years old.

01:18.166 --> 01:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He initially admitted to
killing a U.S. soldier and
spent 10 years at Guantanamo.

01:22.633 --> 01:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Khadr says his confession was
coerced, and Canada's Supreme
Court has now ruled he was

01:27.466 --> 01:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interrogated under what it
called oppressive circumstances.

Christie signed it into law.

01:41.066 --> 01:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

criticized for using a
state beach on Sunday,
after it was closed

01:45.233 --> 01:47.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the public.

01:47.233 --> 01:50.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The new budget agreement allowed
state parks and beaches to
reopen for everyone just in

01:50.566 --> 01:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
time for the Fourth of July.

01:51.733 --> 01:53.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

01:56.266 --> 01:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I saw on the news yesterday
that it was closed for budget
issues, so it's pretty cool.

01:59.633 --> 02:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: It's my first time.

02:00.666 --> 02:02.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Our first time.

02:02.166 --> 02:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Well, it's amazing
that it opened in time.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's very thankful,
and it's a very special
day to reopen Liberty Park.

02:06.966 --> 02:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In Maine,
Governor Paul LePage also
signed a new budget, ending a

02:11.266 --> 02:14.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
partial government
shutdown in his state.

02:14.066 --> 02:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in Illinois, there was
no break in a budget impasse
that's now in its third year.

Republican Governor Bruce
Rauner vetoed a $36 billion
package, along with a major tax

02:24.200 --> 02:26.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hike.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Democratic-controlled
state Senate quickly
overrode the veto.

02:27.866 --> 02:30.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the House took
no immediate action.

02:30.766 --> 02:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the nation marked its
241st birthday today with an
array of annual celebrations.

02:37.700 --> 02:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fourth of July parades began
with one in Gatlinburg,
Tennessee, at midnight.

02:42.733 --> 02:44.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's been their
tradition for 42 years.

02:44.700 --> 02:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in Washington this evening,
President and Mrs. Trump
