anybody has

what I

01:56.149 --> 02:02.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hear coming from the other side
is
because not only are what they
are

shot at wresting the nomination
away
from clinton and we can win in

02:20.941 --> 02:27.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

2016 it's the perfect time for
politics
Monday with Tamara Keith and Amy
Walter

03:06.987 --> 03:11.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both are in New Hampshire and I
spoke
with him a short time ago

03:11.958 --> 03:18.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tamara Keith of NPR and Amy
Walter of
the cook Political Report 2016
is

03:18.331 --> 03:22.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
finally here you're both in new
hampshire Tamara let me start
with you

03:22.736 --> 03:27.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you were you were with bill
clinton when
he spoke today earlier in new
hampshire

03:27.941 --> 03:32.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was thought he might respond
to some
of what Donald Trump has been
talking

03:32.379 --> 03:38.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about lately but he didn't he
certainly
did not he was there to be the
the

03:38.485 --> 03:43.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supportive spouse mostly eat he
started
out talking about news articles
that

03:43.557 --> 03:48.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's read in may be made veiled
references to some of Donald
Trump's

03:48.562 --> 03:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
language on on Muslims but he
didn't go
there on some of the other
things donald

03:53.166 --> 03:59.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has been going going after
him on
and then he really saying the
praises of

03:59.473 --> 04:04.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his wife and told a series of
anecdotes
about her going back to when
they first

04:04.511 --> 04:09.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
met in in law school and many of
the
people in the audience there
talk to

04:09.182 --> 04:13.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
afterwards said that they
learned new
things about hillary clinton so
he was

04:13.720 --> 04:16.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he was doing the the proud
husband thing

04:16.456 --> 04:22.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and and not really hitting hard
against
other candidates so Amy the the
hillary

04:22.395 --> 04:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clinton campaigned use him
purely as an
asset I think so and i think im
listen

04:27.300 --> 04:34.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
he brings right now in a
democratic
primary a very good track record

04:34.241 --> 04:38.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic voters like him they
responded him and I think we'll
see him

04:38.979 --> 04:43.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the trail much more in the
coming in
the coming months again you
can't have

04:43.483 --> 04:46.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hillary Clinton everywhere she
had
somebody who knows what it's
like to run

04:46.820 --> 04:51.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a presidential campaign going
out into
all of these early primary state
and

04:51.892 --> 04:55.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they think it's just such a
striking
contrast between what hillary
clinton

04:55.996 --> 05:01.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can do with her husband former
president
and what jim bush can't do with
his

05:01.501 --> 05:06.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brother former president he
bringing him
on the road there's been a lot
of talk

05:06.373 --> 05:10.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about that early on but we
haven't seen
it quite yet and the last name
of course

05:10.110 --> 05:14.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of bush much more problematic
for gym in
a republican primary the clinton
named

05:14.548 --> 05:18.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still gold in a democratic
primary of
course the reason bill clinton
is there

05:18.585 --> 05:24.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tamara is is the fact that
Bernie
Sanders happens to be running a
little

05:24.257 --> 05:25.859 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bit ahead in the

05:25.892 --> 05:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the polls how worried are
they about
Bernie Sanders how how strong a
race is

05:33.300 --> 05:38.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he putting up there he is you
say is
leading in the polls here has a
strong

05:38.471 --> 05:43.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organization here both in New
Hampshire
and also in iowa he's he's
working hard

05:43.043 --> 05:49.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in Iowa to build his
organization there
because the clintons can sort of
right

05:49.382 --> 05:54.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off New Hampshire and and they
keep
putting out these lines like
well you

05:54.387 --> 05:58.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know he is from a neighboring
state and
and people don't tend to lose
then their

05:58.425 --> 06:02.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
neighboring state in new
hampshire so
there they are definitely
setting

06:02.762 --> 06:08.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expectations though it's unclear
whether
they actually think that that he
could

06:08.501 --> 06:12.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
win in new hampshire whether
they're
just trying to lower lower the
bar but

06:12.239 --> 06:15.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy the other thing we're
watching today
as we mentioned as Donald Trump
out with

06:15.909 --> 06:22.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his first television ad words
fear is is
being associated with it the
trunk

06:22.082 --> 06:27.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign has waited until now to
put
this out what's the strategy
here to do

06:27.420 --> 06:30.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is have a hard time
understanding the
strategy of the Trump campaigned
so I

06:30.957 --> 06:36.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't know if its strategy as
much as
the fact that he is doubling
down on

06:36.129 --> 06:39.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what has gotten him so far

06:39.366 --> 06:45.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thus far which is this idea that
he is
the strongest and the toughest
and most

06:45.538 --> 06:50.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resolute in the field and I
think the
more that we hear about trouble
in the

06:50.277 --> 06:56.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mideast more now that we're
hearing
about problems coming from all
sectors

06:56.616 --> 07:03.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when it relates to Isis etcetera
this
just makes donald Trump look
even better

07:03.390 --> 07:07.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the eyes of many Republican
primary
voters for frustration
frustrated

07:07.761 --> 07:15.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anxious ready to turn the page
and this
just reminds them of what they
liked and

07:15.902 --> 07:19.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him in the first place of course
it also
reminds a lot of moderate voters

07:19.372 --> 07:23.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
independent leaning voters about
what
they don't like about Donald
Trump and I

07:23.743 --> 07:27.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think this is always going to be
the
trouble for trent is what works
very

07:27.914 --> 07:32.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well in a republican primary
cuts
against him among general
electric among

07:32.786 --> 07:35.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the general electorate and we
need is
that I think the understanding
of a lot

07:35.989 --> 07:37.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of people that when you talk
about 10

07:37.624 --> 07:43.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorism democrats feel that
that's not
the strong their strongest issue
that

07:43.763 --> 07:48.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans are just naturally
going to
be in a better place on that
though

07:48.034 --> 07:52.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton would would say
that she
is strong on those issues as a
former

07:52.906 --> 07:56.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secretary of state I think
that's the
case but she would certainly
make to me

07:56.776 --> 08:01.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what was striking with the
donald Trump
ad is the imagery of
undocumented

08:01.948 --> 08:07.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigrants presumably grainy
footage
running across the border I
think that's

08:07.120 --> 08:10.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what it's supposed to be it
takes me
back to the nineteen nineties in

08:10.090 --> 08:14.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
california and governor pete
wilson's
re-election campaign had an ad
with

08:14.461 --> 08:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
similar footage of people
flooding over
the borders and that added and
some

08:20.667 --> 08:25.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other things that he ran on in
that
campaign ultimately hurt the
republican

08:25.105 --> 08:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party in california in a way
that some
Republicans are concerned could
hurt the

08:29.309 --> 08:33.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national party with with this
combat in
the language about immigrants
because

08:33.613 --> 08:38.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the demographics are changing in
this
country and an appealing to
Latino

08:38.451 --> 08:41.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voters and Asian voters is going
to be
critical

08:41.788 --> 08:44.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many believe for the future of
the
Republican Party in this country

08:44.924 --> 08:48.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy the other candidate i want
to ask
you about as chris Christie
you're going

08:48.128 --> 08:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be seeing him and an event
later
today he has three events in New

08:53.867 --> 08:58.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hampshire today what's going on
with
chris Christie in the granite
state it's

08:58.438 --> 09:02.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be very interesting to
see what
chris Christie does and whether
he's

09:02.675 --> 09:08.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to coalesce what is at this
point
been a very fractured primary up
here in

09:08.782 --> 09:12.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new hampshire donald Trump
leading the
pack with about 25 percent of
the vote

09:12.619 --> 09:16.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then the rest of it is
really
splintered about and chris
Christie

09:16.356 --> 09:21.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wants to be the establishment
candidate
right now he's competing for
that lane

09:21.060 --> 09:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for that antitrust blame with
Jeb Bush
Marco Rubio john Kasich

09:27.367 --> 09:32.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speech today right here at st.
Anselm's
College where he made the case
that you

09:32.439 --> 09:36.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know what I understand you're
angry
America I get it I'm with you on
that

09:36.776 --> 09:41.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but you need somebody who's
actually
been tested I he says have been
tested

09:41.314 --> 09:45.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the executive level the
others
haven't anybody can do
showmanship and

09:45.685 --> 09:48.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
take somebody else to have real
executive experience

09:49.022 --> 09:52.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we're going to hear a
lot more
about that in the days and weeks
