GWEN IFILL, NEWSHOUR ANCHOR:
Good evening, I m Gwen Ifill.

00:05.939 --> 00:58.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF, NEWSHOUR ANCHOR:
And I m Judy Woodruff.

00:58.091 --> 01:02.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And welcome to this PBS NEWSHOUR
special: coverage of the second
presidential debate

01:02.529 --> 01:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between Democrat Hillary Clinton
and Republican Donald Trump.

01:06.433 --> 01:10.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The stage is set at Washington
University in St. Louis.

01:10.704 --> 01:15.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The most unconventional campaign
in modern presidential history
has reached entirely

01:15.175 --> 01:18.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new levels.

01:18.278 --> 01:24.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Friday s release of the
videotape from 2005 of Donald
Trump using lewd language and
bragging

01:24.484 --> 01:29.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about making unwanted sexual
advances on women has prompted a
number of Republicans to
withdraw

01:29.623 --> 01:32.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their support from
their party s nominee.

01:32.526 --> 01:37.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IFILL: Tonight s debate will be
a town hall format where Hillary
Clinton and Donald Trump

01:37.597 --> 01:41.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be taking questions from an
audience of uncommitted voters,
as well as from moderators

01:41.768 --> 01:46.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Martha Radiate of ABC News
and Anderson Cooper of CNN.

01:46.340 --> 01:53.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining us at our table are our
regular NEWSHOUR contributors:
syndicated columnist Mark
Shields,

01:53.046 --> 01:57.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New York Times columnist David
Brooks, and Amy Walter of The
Cook Political Report.

01:57.684 --> 02:02.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in another unprecedented
turn: Donald Trump staged a
surprise appearance little

02:02.122 --> 02:05.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than an hour ago with four
women, three of who whom accused
Bill Clinton of sexual

02:05.192 --> 02:07.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
assault or harassment.

02:07.861 --> 02:11.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In response, the Clinton
campaign said, we re not
surprised see Donald Trump
continue his

02:11.665 --> 02:15.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
destructive race to the bottom.

02:15.102 --> 02:19.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Friends, the moral equivalency
wars are in full I don t know,
sway, David?

02:19.840 --> 02:23.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS, THE NEW YORK
TIMES: This could be one of the
most historic and repulsive

02:23.377 --> 02:25.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
debates to the American
political history.

02:25.579 --> 02:30.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We ve entered TV a reality
TV show of the bottom level.

02:30.017 --> 02:34.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so I m expecting a
traffic accident frankly.

02:34.721 --> 02:37.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what trump did tonight I
think will backfire on him badly
as more Republicans flee from

02:37.057 --> 02:39.559 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

02:39.559 --> 02:41.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Amy, how much of all
this stuff do you think is going
to come up tonight?

02:41.895 --> 02:44.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, THE COOK POLITICAL
REPORT: Well, the fact that I
can t let my fourth-grader

02:44.398 --> 02:47.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
watch a presidential debate I
think tells you all you need to
know about where we are

02:47.968 --> 02:51.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in this campaign and
what I expect from it.

02:51.038 --> 02:55.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, I think Donald Trump s
before he had this press
conference my thought was

02:55.142 --> 02:57.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he s either going to come in do
contrition or he s going to do
combative.

02:57.511 --> 03:01.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we know obviously
which half he chose.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has decided throughout the
course of this campaign to
double down, triple down, any

03:03.984 --> 03:06.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time he s challenged.

03:06.319 --> 03:09.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is only interested in talking
to his the faithful, never
interested in reaching beyond

03:09.322 --> 03:11.925 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IFILL: And, Mark Shields, are we
talking about a policy debate
tonight or a personality debate?

03:14.327 --> 03:15.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS, SYNDICATED
COLUMNIST: We re talking about
Donald Trump trying to save

03:15.896 --> 03:17.297 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his candidacy.

03:17.297 --> 03:18.865 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Stop Republicans
from fleeing him.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Energizing the base.

03:20.434 --> 03:23.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Making it a Clinton race again.

03:23.136 --> 03:24.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think unsuccessfully.

03:24.237 --> 03:42.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And now here are

03:42.656 --> 04:19.359 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the moderators,
Martha Radiate and

04:19.359 --> 04:28.468 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Anderson Cooper.

04:28.468 --> 04:46.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
[*] RADIATE: Ladies and
gentlemen the Republican nominee
for president, Donald J. Trump,
and

04:46.253 --> 04:57.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Democratic nominee for
president, Hillary Clinton.

04:57.230 --> 05:06.807 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

05:06.807 --> 05:17.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: Thank you very
much for being here.

05:17.384 --> 05:21.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We re going to begin with a
question from one of the members
in our town hall.

05:21.254 --> 05:24.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Each of you will have two
minutes to respond to this
question.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Secretary Clinton, you won the
coin toss, so you ll go first.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our first question comes
from Patrice Brock.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.896 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Patrice?

05:29.896 --> 05:34.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Thank you,
and good evening.

05:34.434 --> 05:41.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The last debate could have been
rated as MA, mature audiences,
per TV parental guidelines.

05:41.908 --> 05:45.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Knowing that educators assign
viewing the presidential debates
as students homework,

05:45.512 --> 05:48.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do you feel you re modeling
appropriate and positive
behavior for today s youth?

05:48.748 --> 05:50.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, thank you.

05:50.150 --> 05:53.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are you a teacher?

05:53.053 --> 05:59.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, I think that that s a very
good question, because I ve
heard from lots of teachers

05:59.459 --> 06:02.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and parents about some of their
concerns about some of the
things that are being said and

06:02.762 --> 06:07.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
done in this campaign.

06:07.534 --> 06:13.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it is very important
for us to make clear to our
children that our country

06:13.506 --> 06:17.744 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
really is great
because we re good.

06:17.744 --> 06:22.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we are going to respect one
another, lift each other up.

06:22.949 --> 06:30.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are going to be looking for
ways to celebrate our diversity,
and we are going to try to

06:30.390 --> 06:35.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reach out to every boy and girl,
as well as every adult, to bring
them in to working on

06:35.528 --> 06:38.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
behalf of our country.

06:38.131 --> 06:42.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have a very positive and
optimistic view about what we
can do together.

06:42.269 --> 06:46.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That s why the slogan of my
campaign is Stronger Together,
because I think if

06:46.840 --> 06:54.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we work together, if we overcome
the divisiveness that sometimes
sets Americans against one

06:54.014 --> 06:59.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another, and instead we make
some big goals and I ve set
forth some big goals, getting

06:59.419 --> 07:05.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the economy to work for
everyone, not just those at the
top, making sure that we have

07:05.392 --> 07:09.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the best education system from
preschool through college and
making it affordable, and so
much

07:09.462 --> 07:11.865 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
else.

07:11.865 --> 07:15.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we set those goals and we go
together to try to achieve them,
there s nothing in

07:15.902 --> 07:19.172 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
my opinion that
America can t do.

07:19.172 --> 07:23.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that s why I hope that we
will come together in this
campaign.

07:23.977 --> 07:29.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, I m hoping to earn
your vote, I m hoping to be
elected in November, and

07:29.349 --> 07:32.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can promise you, I will
work with every American.

07:32.886 --> 07:37.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to be the president for
all Americans, regardless of
your political beliefs, where

07:37.390 --> 07:40.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you come from, what you
look like, your religion.

07:40.960 --> 07:45.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want us to heal our country
and bring it together because
that s, I think, the best

07:45.065 --> 07:48.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way for us to get the future
that our children and our
grandchildren deserve.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: Secretary
Clinton, thank you.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Well, I actually
agree with that.

07:52.605 --> 07:56.710 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I agree with
everything she said.

07:56.710 --> 08:02.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I began this campaign because I
was so tired of seeing such
foolish things happen to our

08:02.182 --> 08:03.683 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

08:03.683 --> 08:04.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a great country.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a great land.

08:07.587 --> 08:10.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I ve gotten to know the people
of the country over the last
year-and-a-half that I ve

08:10.824 --> 08:14.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been doing this as a politician.

08:14.561 --> 08:18.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I cannot believe I m saying that
about myself, but I guess I have
been a politician.

08:18.031 --> 08:23.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: And my whole concept was
to make America great again.

08:23.103 --> 08:29.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I watch the deals being
made, when I watch what s
happening with some horrible

08:29.209 --> 08:34.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things like Obamacare, where
your health insurance and health
care is going up by numbers that

08:34.013 --> 08:41.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are astronomical, 68 percent, 59
percent, 71 percent, when I look
at the Iran deal and

08:41.721 --> 08:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how bad a deal it is for us,
it s a one-sided transaction
where we re giving back $150

08:47.660 --> 08:51.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
billion to a terrorist state,
really, the number one terror
state, we ve made them

08:51.798 --> 08:56.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a strong country from really a
very weak country just three
years ago.

08:56.836 --> 09:00.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I look at all of the things
that I see and all of the
potential that our country

09:00.874 --> 09:04.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has, we have such tremendous
potential, whether it s in
business and trade, where we re

09:04.677 --> 09:06.546 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doing so badly.

09:06.546 --> 09:11.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Last year, we had almost
$800 billion trade deficit.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In other words, trading
with other countries.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We had an $800 billion deficit.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It s hard to believe.

09:18.324 --> 09:19.793 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Inconceivable.

09:19.793 --> 09:20.960 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
You say who s
making these deals?

09:20.960 --> 09:22.562 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We re going the
make great deals.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We re going to have
a strong border.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We re going to bring
back law and order.

09:26.866 --> 09:30.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Just today, policemen
was shot, two killed.

09:30.670 --> 09:33.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this is happening
on a weekly basis.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to bring back
respect to law enforcement.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, we have to
take care of people on all
sides.

09:39.512 --> 09:43.016 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We need justice.

09:43.016 --> 09:48.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I want to do things that
haven t been done, including
fixing and making our inner

09:48.988 --> 09:53.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
cities better for the
African-American citizens that
are so great, and for the
Latinos, Hispanics,

09:53.993 --> 09:55.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and I look forward to doing it.

09:55.662 --> 09:58.031 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
It s called make
America great again.

09:58.031 --> 10:01.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question from Patrice was
about are you both modeling
positive and appropriate
behavior

10:03.937 --> 10:06.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for today s youth?

10:06.840 --> 10:08.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We received a lot of questions
online, Mr. Trump, about the
tape that was released on

10:08.975 --> 10:11.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Friday, as you can imagine.

10:11.010 --> 10:13.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You called what you said
locker room banter.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You described kissing women
without consent, grabbing their
genitals.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is sexual assault.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You bragged that you have
sexually assaulted women.

10:20.019 --> 10:21.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you understand that?

10:21.721 --> 10:23.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: No, I didn t
say that at all.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don t think you understood
what was this was locker room
talk.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I m not proud of it.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I apologize to my family.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I apologize to the
American people.

10:32.932 --> 10:34.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Certainly I m not proud of it.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But this is locker room talk.

10:37.270 --> 10:42.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, when we have a world
where you have ISIS chopping off
heads, where you have and,

10:42.375 --> 10:48.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
frankly, drowning people in
steel cages, where you have wars
and horrible, horrible sights

10:48.615 --> 10:52.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all over, where you have so many
bad things happening, this is
like medieval times.

10:52.719 --> 10:55.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We haven t seen anything like
this, the carnage all over the
world.

10:55.555 --> 10:57.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they look and they see.

10:57.924 --> 11:04.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you imagine the people that
are, frankly, doing so well
against us with ISIS?

11:04.330 --> 11:05.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they look at our country
and they see what s going on.

11:05.798 --> 11:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Yes, I m very embarrassed by it.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.235 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I hate it.

11:09.235 --> 11:12.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it s locker room talk, and
it s one of those things.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.207 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I will knock the
hell out of ISIS.

11:14.207 --> 11:17.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We re going to defeat ISIS.

11:17.210 --> 11:23.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIS happened a number of years
ago in a vacuum that was left
because of bad judgment.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I will tell you, I
will take care of ISIS.

11:25.084 --> 11:27.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COOPER: So, Mr. Trump

11:27.320 --> 11:31.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: And we should get on to
much more important things and
much bigger things.

11:31.291 --> 11:35.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COOPER: Just for the record,
though, are you saying that what
you said on that bus 11 years

11:35.161 --> 11:38.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago that you did not actually
kiss women without consent or
grope women without consent?

11:38.865 --> 11:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: I have great
respect for women.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nobody has more respect
for women than I do.

11:42.969 --> 11:45.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COOPER: So, for the record,
you re saying you never did
that?

11:45.905 --> 11:48.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I ve said things that,
frankly, you hear these things I
said.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I was embarrassed by it.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I have tremendous
respect for women.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: Have you ever
done those things?

11:53.212 --> 11:54.981 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: And women
have respect for me.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I will tell you:
No, I have not.

11:57.383 --> 12:00.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I will tell you that I m
going to make our country safe.

12:00.587 --> 12:04.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We re going to have borders in
our country, which we don t have
now.

12:04.424 --> 12:07.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are pouring into our
country, and they re coming in
from the Middle East and other
places.

12:07.527 --> 12:10.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We re going to make
America safe again.

12:10.263 --> 12:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We re going to make America
great again, but we re going to
make America safe again.

12:13.333 --> 12:18.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we re going to make America
wealthy again, because if you
don t do that, it

12:18.404 --> 12:21.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just it sounds harsh to say,
but we have to build up the
wealth of our nation.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Right now, other nations
are taking our jobs and they re
taking our wealth.

12:24.844 --> 12:26.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.

12:26.212 --> 12:27.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: And that s what
I want to talk about.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COOPER: Secretary Clinton,
do you want to respond?

12:30.850 --> 12:34.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, like everyone
else, I ve spent a lot of time
thinking over the last

12:34.020 --> 12:40.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
48 hours about what
we heard and saw.

12:40.093 --> 12:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, with prior Republican
nominees for president, I
disagreed with them on politics,

12:46.933 --> 12:53.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policies, principles, but I
never questioned their fitness
to serve.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is different.

12:56.476 --> 13:03.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I said starting back in June
that he was not fit to be
president and
commander-in-chief.

13:03.683 --> 13:09.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And many Republicans and
independents have said the same
thing.

13:09.956 --> 13:16.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we all saw and heard on
Friday was Donald talking about
women, what he thinks about

13:16.963 --> 13:20.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
women, what he does to women.

13:20.867 --> 13:27.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he has said that the video
doesn t represent who he is.

13:27.206 --> 13:33.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think it s clear to anyone
who heard it that it represents
exactly who he is.

13:33.079 --> 13:36.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Because we ve seen this
throughout the campaign.

13:36.215 --> 13:39.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have seen him insult women.

13:39.952 --> 13:46.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We ve seen him rate women on
their appearance, ranking them
from one to ten.

13:46.793 --> 13:53.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We ve seen him embarrass
women on TV and on Twitter.

13:53.232 --> 13:58.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw him after the first
debate spend nearly a week
denigrating a former Miss
Universe

13:58.905 --> 14:01.574 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
in the harshest,
most personal terms.

14:01.574 --> 14:07.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, yes, this is who
Donald Trump is.

14:07.513 --> 14:12.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it s not only women, and
it s not only this video that
raises questions about

14:12.151 --> 14:22.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his fitness to be our president,
because he has also targeted
immigrants, African- Americans,

14:22.195 --> 14:27.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Latinos, people with
disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and
so many others.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So this is who Donald Trump is.

14:30.770 --> 14:37.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the question for us, the
question our country must answer
is that this is not who

14:37.376 --> 14:40.012 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we are.

14:40.012 --> 14:46.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That s why to go back to your
question I want to send a
message we all should

14:46.519 --> 14:53.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to every boy and girl and,
indeed, to the entire world that
America already is great,

14:53.025 --> 14:58.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but we are great because we are
good, and we will respect one
another, and we will work

14:58.564 --> 15:03.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with one another, and we will
celebrate our diversity.

15:03.269 --> 15:07.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CLINTON: These are very
important values to me, because
this is the America that I know

15:07.707 --> 15:10.343 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and love.

15:10.343 --> 15:14.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I can pledge to you tonight
that this is the America that I
will serve if I m

15:14.714 --> 15:18.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so fortunate enough to
become your president.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RADIATE: And we want to get to
some questions from online

15:20.453 --> 15:22.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Am I allowed
to respond to that?

15:22.555 --> 15:24.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I assume I am.

15:24.957 --> 15:27.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: Yes, you can
respond to that.

15:27.193 --> 15:27.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: It s just words, folks.

15:27.894 --> 15:29.662 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It s just words.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Those words, I ve been
hearing them for many years.

15:31.731 --> 15:37.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I heard them when they were
running for the Senate in New
York, where Hillary was going

15:37.403 --> 15:41.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to bring back jobs to upstate
New York and she failed.

15:41.541 --> 15:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I ve heard them where Hillary is
constantly talking about the
inner cities of our country,

15:47.713 --> 15:53.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
which are a disaster
education-wise, job wise,
safety-wise, in every way
possible.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I m going to help the
African-Americans.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I m going to help the
Latinos, Hispanics.

15:58.224 --> 16:01.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I am going to help
the inner cities.

16:01.561 --> 16:05.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She s done a terrible job
for the African-Americans.

16:05.531 --> 16:09.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She wants their vote, and she
does nothing, and then she comes
back four years later.

16:09.468 --> 16:12.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We saw that firsthand when she
was United States senator.

16:12.905 --> 16:16.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She campaigned where the
primary part of her campaign

16:16.309 --> 16:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RADIATE: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump
I want to get to audience
questions and online questions.

16:19.846 --> 16:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: So, she s allowed to do
that, but I m not allowed to
respond?

16:22.448 --> 16:23.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RADIATE: You re going to have
you re going to get to respond
right now.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Sounds fair.

16:25.318 --> 16:28.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: This tape is
generating intense interest.

16:28.287 --> 16:35.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In just 48 hours, it s become
the single most talked about
story of the entire 2016

16:35.361 --> 16:41.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election on Facebook, with
millions and millions of people
discussing it on the social
network.

16:41.367 --> 16:44.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As we said a moment ago, we do
want to bring in questions from
voters around country via

16:44.737 --> 16:48.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
social media, and our first
stays on this topic.

16:48.774 --> 16:54.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook,
Trump says the campaign has
changed him.

16:54.213 --> 16:55.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
When did that happen?

16:55.615 --> 16:58.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, Mr. Trump, let
me add to that.

16:58.684 --> 17:04.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you walked off that bus at
age 59, were you a different man
or did that behavior continue

17:04.423 --> 17:06.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
until just recently?

17:06.726 --> 17:08.861 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And you have two
minutes for this.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: It was locker room
talk, as I told you.

17:11.097 --> 17:11.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That was locker room talk.

17:11.998 --> 17:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I m not proud of it.

17:14.533 --> 17:18.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am a person who has great
respect for people, for my
family, for the people of this
country.

17:18.638 --> 17:21.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And certainly, I m
not proud of it.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But that was something
that happened.

17:24.543 --> 17:27.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If you look at Bill
Clinton, far worse.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mine are words, and
his was action.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His was what he s done to women.

17:32.785 --> 17:36.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There s never been anybody in
the history politics in this
nation that s been so abusive

17:36.522 --> 17:39.091 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to women.

17:39.091 --> 17:45.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you can say any way you want
to say it, but Bill Clinton was
abusive to women.

17:45.131 --> 17:48.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton attacked those
same women and attacked them
viciously.

17:48.968 --> 17:52.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Four of them here tonight.

17:52.204 --> 17:59.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the women, who is a
wonderful woman, at 12 years
old, was raped at 12.

17:59.712 --> 18:04.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her client she represented got
him off, and she s seen laughing
on two separate occasions,

18:04.817 --> 18:06.719 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
laughing at the
girl who was raped.

18:06.719 --> 18:11.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kathy Shelton, that young woman
is here with us tonight.

18:11.390 --> 18:14.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So don t tell me about words.

18:14.060 --> 18:18.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I am absolutely I
apologize for those words.

18:18.331 --> 18:22.501 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But it is things
that people say.

18:22.501 --> 18:28.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what President Clinton did,
he was impeached, he lost his
license to practice law.

18:28.074 --> 18:32.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He had to pay an $850,000
fine to one of the women.

18:32.611 --> 18:37.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Paula Jones, who s
also here tonight.

18:37.350 --> 18:43.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I will tell you that when
Hillary brings up a point like
that and she talks about words

18:43.689 --> 18:48.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I said 11 years ago, I
think it s disgraceful, and I
think she should be ashamed of
herself,

18:48.327 --> 18:50.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if you want to know the truth.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.931 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

18:51.931 --> 18:55.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: Can we please
hold the applause?

18:55.501 --> 18:58.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton, you
have two minutes.

18:58.070 --> 19:03.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, first, let me
start by saying that so much of
what he s just said is not

19:03.576 --> 19:06.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right, but he gets to run his
campaign any way he chooses.

19:06.879 --> 19:10.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He gets to decide what
he wants to talk about.

19:10.883 --> 19:15.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead of answering people s
questions, talking about our
agenda, laying out the plans

19:15.421 --> 19:23.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we have that we think can
make a better life and a better
country, that s his choice.

19:23.295 --> 19:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I hear something like that,
I am reminded of what my friend,
Michelle Obama, advised

19:27.633 --> 19:35.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
us all: When they go
low, you go high.

19:35.508 --> 19:46.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this
were just about one video, maybe
what he s saying tonight

19:46.852 --> 19:52.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would be understandable, but
everyone can draw their own
conclusions at this point about

19:52.291 --> 19:56.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether or not the man in the
video or the man on the stage
respects women.

19:56.996 --> 20:01.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But he never apologizes
for anything to anyone.

20:01.467 --> 20:08.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: He never apologized to
Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star
family whose son, Captain

20:08.707 --> 20:13.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Khan, died in the
line of duty in Iraq.

20:13.379 --> 20:20.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald insulted and attacked
them for weeks over their
religion.

20:20.619 --> 20:28.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He never apologized to the
distinguished federal judge who
was born in Indiana, but Donald

20:28.661 --> 20:35.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said he couldn t be trusted to
be a judge because his parents
were, quote, Mexican.

20:35.501 --> 20:40.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He never apologized to the
reporter that he mimicked and
mocked on national television

20:40.406 --> 20:42.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and our children were watching.

20:42.942 --> 20:50.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he never apologized for the
racist lie that President Obama
was not born in the United

20:50.015 --> 20:52.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
States of America.

20:52.318 --> 20:57.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He owes the president an
apology, he owes our country an
apology, and he needs to take

20:57.590 --> 21:02.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
responsibility for his
actions and his words.

21:02.027 --> 21:08.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Well, you owe the
president an apology, because as
you know very well, your
campaign,

21:08.701 --> 21:13.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sidney Blumenthal he s another
real winner that you have and
he s the one

21:13.539 --> 21:17.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that got this started, along
with your campaign manager, and
they were on television just

21:17.409 --> 21:19.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
two weeks ago, she was,
saying exactly that.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So you really owe
him an apology.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You re the one that sent the
pictures around your campaign,
sent the pictures around with

21:25.851 --> 21:28.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President Obama in
a certain garb.

21:28.888 --> 21:32.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was long before I was ever
involved, so you actually owe an
apology.

21:32.391 --> 21:35.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Number two, Michelle Obama.

21:35.094 --> 21:40.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I ve gotten to see the
commercials that they did on
you.

21:40.666 --> 21:44.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I ve gotten to see some of
the most vicious commercials
I ve ever seen of Michelle

21:44.970 --> 21:47.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obama talking about
you, Hillary.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, you talk about friend?

21:50.843 --> 21:57.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Go back and take a look at those
commercials, a race where you
lost fair and square, unlike

21:57.716 --> 22:03.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Bernie Sanders race, where
you won, but not fair and
square, in my opinion.

22:03.656 --> 22:07.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all you have to do is take a
look at WikiLeaks and just see
what they say about Bernie
Sanders

22:07.660 --> 22:12.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and see what Deborah Wasserman
Schultz had in mind, because
Bernie Sanders, between
super-delegates

22:12.998 --> 22:15.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Deborah Wasserman Schultz,
he never had a chance.

22:15.501 --> 22:20.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I was so surprised to see
him sign on with the devil.

22:20.206 --> 22:25.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when you talk about apology,
I think the one that you should
really be apologizing

22:25.044 --> 22:32.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for and the thing that you
should be apologizing for are
the 33,000 e-mails that you
deleted,

22:32.084 --> 22:37.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that you acid washed, and
then the two boxes of e-mails
and other things last week

22:37.656 --> 22:39.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that were taken from an
office and are now missing.

22:39.658 --> 22:42.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I ll tell you what.

22:42.127 --> 22:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn t think I d say this, but
I m going to say it, and I hate
to say it.

22:47.800 --> 22:56.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if I win, I am going to
instruct my attorney general to
get a special prosecutor to look

22:56.208 --> 23:02.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into your situation, because
there has never been so many
lies, so much deception.

23:02.414 --> 23:06.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There has never been anything
like it, and we re going to have
a special prosecutor.

23:06.585 --> 23:11.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I speak, I go out and
speak, the people of this
country are furious.

23:11.724 --> 23:17.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In my opinion, the people that
have been long-term workers at
the FBI are furious.

23:17.029 --> 23:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There has never been anything
like this, where e-mails and
you get a subpoena, you get

23:21.800 --> 23:27.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a subpoena, and after getting
the subpoena, you delete 33,000
e-mails, and then you acid

23:27.640 --> 23:32.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wash them or bleach them, as you
would say, very expensive
process.

23:32.378 --> 23:34.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we re going to get a special
prosecutor, and we re going to
look into it, because

23:34.179 --> 23:36.782 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you know what?

23:36.782 --> 23:40.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People have been their lives
have been destroyed for doing
one-fifth of what you ve

23:40.586 --> 23:41.820 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
done.

23:41.820 --> 23:43.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it s a disgrace.

23:43.389 --> 23:45.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And honestly, you ought to
be ashamed of yourself.

23:45.024 --> 23:45.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RADIATE: Secretary Clinton, I
want to follow up on that.

23:45.524 --> 23:47.226 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:47.226 --> 23:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RADIATE: I m going to let
you talk about e-mails.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: because everything he
just said is absolutely false,
but I m not surprised.

23:51.330 --> 23:52.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Oh, really?

23:52.531 --> 23:53.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON: In the first debate

23:53.465 --> 23:55.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

23:55.467 --> 23:56.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RADIATE: And really, the
audience needs to calm down
here.

23:56.869 --> 24:00.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: I told people that it
would be impossible to be
fact-checking Donald all

24:00.105 --> 24:02.608 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the time.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I d never get to talk about
anything I want to do and how
we re going to really make

24:05.344 --> 24:07.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lives better for people.

24:07.246 --> 24:11.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, once again, go to
HillaryClinton.com.

24:11.216 --> 24:17.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have literally Trump you
can fact check him in real time.

24:17.723 --> 24:22.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last time at the first debate,
we had millions of people fact
checking, so I expect we ll

24:22.494 --> 24:28.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have millions more fact
checking, because, you know, it
is it s just awfully good

24:28.634 --> 24:32.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that someone with the
temperament of Donald Trump is
not in charge of the law in our
country.

24:32.771 --> 24:34.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Because you d be in jail.

24:34.206 --> 24:35.507 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

24:35.507 --> 24:38.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RADIATE: Secretary Clinton

24:38.177 --> 24:45.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COOPER: We want to remind the
audience to please not talk out
loud.

24:45.784 --> 24:46.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Please do not applaud.

24:46.852 --> 24:48.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You re just wasting time.

24:48.721 --> 24:51.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RADIATE: And, Secretary Clinton,
I do want to follow up on e-
mails.

24:51.190 --> 24:54.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You ve said your handing of
your e-mails was a mistake.

24:54.727 --> 24:58.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You disagreed with FBI Director
James Comey, calling your
handling of classified
information,

24:58.997 --> 25:02.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
quote, extremely careless.

25:02.701 --> 25:07.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The FBI said that there were 110
classified e-mails that were
exchanged, eight of which

25:07.406 --> 25:12.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were top secret, and that it was
possible hostile actors did gain
access to those e-mails.

25:12.211 --> 25:15.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You don t call that
extremely careless?

25:15.214 --> 25:19.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, Martha, first,
let me say and I ve said
before, but I ll repeat it,

25:19.451 --> 25:23.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because I want everyone to hear
it that was a mistake, and I
take responsibility for

25:23.288 --> 25:26.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
using a personal e-mail account.

25:26.458 --> 25:29.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obviously, if I were to do
it over again, I would not.

25:29.428 --> 25:31.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I m not making any excuses.

25:31.797 --> 25:32.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a mistake.

25:32.965 --> 25:36.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I am very sorry about that.

25:36.769 --> 25:43.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think it s also important
to point out where there are
some misleading accusations

25:43.876 --> 25:47.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from critics and others.

25:47.946 --> 25:54.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After a year-long investigation,
there is no evidence that anyone
hacked the server

25:54.620 --> 26:02.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was using and there is no
evidence that anyone can point
to at all anyone who

26:02.060 --> 26:06.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says otherwise has no basis
that any classified material
ended up in the wrong hands.

26:06.965 --> 26:12.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I take classified materials
very seriously and always have.

26:12.037 --> 26:17.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, I was privy
to a lot of classified material.

26:17.242 --> 26:23.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, as secretary of
state, I had some of the most
important secrets that we
possess,

26:23.148 --> 26:27.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
such as going after bin Laden.

26:27.186 --> 26:32.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I am very committed to taking
classified information
seriously.

26:32.357 --> 26:36.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as I said, there is no
evidence that any classified
information ended up in the
wrong

26:36.762 --> 26:38.397 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hands.

26:38.397 --> 26:40.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: OK, we re
going to move on.

26:40.065 --> 26:43.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: And yet she didn t know
the word the letter C on a
document.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.337 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

26:45.337 --> 26:47.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She didn t even know what that
word what that letter meant.

26:47.239 --> 26:48.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know, it s amazing.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I m watching Hillary
go over facts.

26:51.677 --> 26:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she s going after fact after
fact, and she s lying again,
because she said she

26:56.081 --> 26:58.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you know, what she did
with the e-mail was fine.

26:58.484 --> 26:59.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You think it was fine to
delete 33,000 e-mails?

26:59.918 --> 27:02.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don t think so.

27:02.621 --> 27:06.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said the 33,000 e-mails had
to do with her daughter s
wedding, number one, and

27:06.625 --> 27:08.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a yoga class.

27:08.627 --> 27:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, maybe we ll give three or
three or four or five or
something.

27:12.331 --> 27:16.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
33,000 e-mails deleted, and now
she s saying there wasn t
anything wrong.

27:16.268 --> 27:17.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And more importantly, that was
after getting a subpoena.

27:17.703 --> 27:18.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That wasn t before.

27:18.570 --> 27:20.172 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That was after.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She got it from the
United States Congress.

27:22.841 --> 27:29.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I ll be honest, I am so
disappointed in congressmen,
including Republicans, for

27:29.381 --> 27:32.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
allowing this to happen.

27:32.050 --> 27:36.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our Justice Department, where
our husband goes on to the back
of a airplane for 39 minutes,

27:36.255 --> 27:41.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talks to the attorney general
days before a ruling is going to
be made on her case.

27:41.093 --> 27:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for you to say that there
was nothing wrong with you
deleting 39,000 e-mails, again,

27:48.300 --> 27:50.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you should be ashamed
of yourself.

27:50.769 --> 27:54.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What you did and this is after
getting a subpoena from the
United States Congress.

27:54.139 --> 27:55.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: We have to move on.

27:55.007 --> 27:55.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: You did that.

27:55.908 --> 27:56.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Wait a minute.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.977 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
One second.

27:58.977 --> 27:59.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you
can respond, and then we got to
move on.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: We want to give
the audience a chance.

28:01.413 --> 28:01.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: If you did that in the
private sector, you d be put in
jail, let alone after getting

28:01.547 --> 28:03.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a subpoena from the
United States Congress.

28:03.582 --> 28:04.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: Secretary
Clinton, you can respond.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then we have to move on
to an audience question.

28:05.984 --> 28:08.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Look, it s
just not true.

28:08.587 --> 28:09.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And so please, go to

28:09.922 --> 28:10.989 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: Oh, you
didn t delete them?

28:10.989 --> 28:12.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: Allow her
to respond, please.

28:12.057 --> 28:13.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: It was personal
e-mails, not official.

28:13.025 --> 28:13.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Oh, 33,000?

28:13.825 --> 28:15.527 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yeah.

28:15.527 --> 28:16.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Not well, we
turned over 35,000, so

28:16.328 --> 28:17.629 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Oh, yeah.

28:17.629 --> 28:19.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What about the other 15,000?

28:19.064 --> 28:20.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: Please allow
her to respond.

28:20.866 --> 28:21.900 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
She didn t talk
while you talked.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Yes, that s
true, I didn t.

28:23.001 --> 28:25.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Because you
have nothing to say.

28:25.037 --> 28:29.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: I didn t in the first
debate, and I m going to try not
to in this debate,

28:29.374 --> 28:32.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because I d like to get to the
questions that the people have
brought here tonight

28:32.444 --> 28:33.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to talk to us about.

28:33.645 --> 28:35.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Get off this question.

28:35.414 --> 28:39.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: OK, Donald.

28:39.251 --> 28:43.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know you re into big diversion
tonight, anything to avoid
talking about your campaign

28:43.922 --> 28:46.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the way it s exploding and
the way Republicans are leaving
you.

28:46.625 --> 28:47.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But let s at least focus

28:47.693 --> 28:48.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Let s see what happens

28:48.393 --> 28:49.695 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

28:49.695 --> 28:51.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Allow her to respond.

28:51.263 --> 28:51.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: on some of the issues
that people care about tonight.

28:51.997 --> 28:53.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let s get to their questions.

28:53.498 --> 28:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COOPER: We have a question
here from Ken Karpowicz.

28:55.000 --> 28:55.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He has a question
about health care.

28:55.801 --> 28:58.003 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ken?

28:58.003 --> 28:59.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TRUMP: I d like to know,
Anderson, why aren t you
bringing up the e-mails?

28:59.538 --> 29:00.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I d like to know.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why aren t you bringing

29:01.873 --> 29:02.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: We brought
up the e-mails.

29:02.608 --> 29:03.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: No, it hasn t.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It hasn t.

29:04.876 --> 29:05.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it hasn t been
finished at all.

29:05.944 --> 29:06.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: Ken Karpowicz
has a question.

29:06.878 --> 29:08.146 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: It s nice
to one on three.

29:08.146 --> 29:11.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Thank you.

29:11.149 --> 29:16.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Affordable Care Act, known as
Obamacare, it is not affordable.

29:16.455 --> 29:17.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Premiums have gone up.

29:17.522 --> 29:19.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Deductibles have gone up.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Copays have gone up.

29:21.660 --> 29:22.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Prescriptions have gone up.

29:22.894 --> 29:26.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the coverage has gone down.

29:26.465 --> 29:31.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What will you do to bring the
cost down and make coverage
better?

29:31.303 --> 29:34.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COOPER: That first one goes to
Secretary Clinton, because you
started out the last one to the

29:34.006 --> 29:35.641 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
audience.

29:35.641 --> 29:37.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: If he wants to
start, he can start.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No, go ahead, Donald.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.012 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: No, I m a
gentlemen, Hillary.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Go ahead.

29:41.013 --> 29:42.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:42.280 --> 29:44.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

29:44.483 --> 29:47.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I think Donald
was about to say he s going to
solve it by repealing

29:47.753 --> 29:51.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it and getting rid of the
Affordable Care Act.

29:51.723 --> 29:54.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I m going to fix it,
because I agree with you.

29:54.660 --> 29:57.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Premiums have gotten too high.

29:57.462 --> 30:01.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Copays, deductibles,
prescription drug costs, and
I ve laid out a series of
actions that

30:01.466 --> 30:05.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we can take to try to
get those costs down.

30:05.103 --> 30:09.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But here s what I don t want
people to forget when we re
talking about reining

30:09.141 --> 30:15.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the costs, which has to be
the highest priority of the next
president, when the Affordable

30:15.247 --> 30:18.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Care Act passed, it wasn t just
that 20 million got insurance
who didn t have it

30:18.684 --> 30:20.385 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

30:20.385 --> 30:22.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But that in and of
itself was a good thing.

30:22.921 --> 30:25.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I meet these people all the
time, and they tell me what a
difference having that insurance

30:25.957 --> 30:29.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
meant to them and
their families.

30:29.961 --> 30:36.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But everybody else, the 170
million of us who get health
insurance through our employees

30:36.168 --> 30:39.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
got big benefits.

30:39.471 --> 30:45.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number one, insurance companies
can t deny you coverage because
of a pre-existing condition.

30:45.210 --> 30:51.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number two, no lifetime limits,
which is a big deal if you have
serious health problems.

30:51.883 --> 30:55.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number three, women can t be
charged more than men for our
health insurance, which is

30:55.687 --> 30:59.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the way it used to be before
the Affordable Care Act.

30:59.424 --> 31:05.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number four, if you re under 26,
and your parents have a policy,
you can be on that

31:05.030 --> 31:09.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policy until the age of 26,
something that didn t happen
before.

31:09.868 --> 31:15.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I want very much to save what
works and is good about the
Affordable Care Act.

31:15.073 --> 31:17.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we ve got to get costs down.

31:17.309 --> 31:21.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We ve got to provide additional
help to small businesses so that
they can afford to

31:21.880 --> 31:25.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
provide health insurance.

31:25.350 --> 31:32.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if we repeal it, as Donald
has proposed, and start over
again, all of those benefits

31:32.157 --> 31:35.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just mentioned are lost to
everybody, not just people who
get their health insurance

31:35.861 --> 31:38.163 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the exchange.

31:38.163 --> 31:40.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And then we would have
to start all over again.

31:40.999 --> 31:44.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Right now, we are at 90 percent
health insurance coverage.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That s the highest we ve
ever been in our country.

31:46.104 --> 31:47.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: Secretary
Clinton, your time is up.

31:47.773 --> 31:51.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: So I want us to get to
100 percent, but get costs down
and keep quality up.

31:51.710 --> 31:54.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: Mr. Trump, you
have two minutes.

31:54.279 --> 31:58.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: It is such a great
question and it s maybe the
question I get almost more than

31:58.517 --> 32:01.953 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
anything else,
outside of defense.

32:01.953 --> 32:03.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obamacare is a disaster.

32:03.822 --> 32:04.823 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You know it.

32:04.823 --> 32:07.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We all know it.

32:07.025 --> 32:10.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It s going up at numbers that
nobody s ever seen worldwide.

32:10.662 --> 32:13.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nobody s ever seen numbers
like this for health care.

32:13.064 --> 32:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It s only getting worse.

32:14.833 --> 32:19.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In 17, it implodes by itself.

32:19.037 --> 32:21.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their method of fixing it is to
go back and ask Congress for
more money, more and more

32:21.373 --> 32:23.108 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
money.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have right now almost
$20 trillion in debt.

32:25.243 --> 32:28.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Obamacare will never work.

32:28.313 --> 32:31.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It s very bad, very
bad health insurance.

32:31.283 --> 32:34.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Far too expensive.

32:34.586 --> 32:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And not only expensive for the
person that has it, unbelievably
expensive for our country.

32:38.723 --> 32:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It s going to be one of the
biggest line items very shortly.

32:43.829 --> 32:51.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to repeal it and replace
it with something absolutely
much less expensive and
something

32:51.069 --> 32:55.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that works, where your plan
can actually be tailored.

32:55.340 --> 33:00.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to get rid of the lines
around the state, artificial
lines, where we stop insurance

33:00.478 --> 33:05.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
companies from coming in and
competing, because they want
and President Obama and whoever

33:05.450 --> 33:08.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was working on it they want to
leave those lines, because that
gives the insurance companies

33:08.353 --> 33:10.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
essentially monopolies.

33:10.188 --> 33:12.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We want competition.

33:12.958 --> 33:17.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You will have the finest
health care plan there is.

33:17.362 --> 33:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She wants to go to a
single-payer plan, which would
be a disaster, somewhat similar
to Canada.

33:21.600 --> 33:26.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you haven t noticed the
Canadians, when they need a big
operation, when something

33:26.071 --> 33:31.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happens, they come into the
United States in many cases
because their system is so slow.

33:31.443 --> 33:35.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It s catastrophic
in certain ways.

33:35.614 --> 33:40.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she wants to go to single
payer, which means the
government basically rules
everything.

33:40.385 --> 33:43.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton has been
after this for years.

33:43.054 --> 33:44.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Obamacare was the first step.

33:44.589 --> 33:49.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Obamacare is a total disaster.

33:49.194 --> 33:54.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And not only are your rates
going up by numbers that
nobody s ever believed, but your
deductibles

33:54.332 --> 33:57.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are going up, so that unless you
get hit by a truck, you re never
going to be able to

33:57.535 --> 33:58.970 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
use it.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Mr. Trump, your time

34:00.872 --> 34:03.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: It is a disastrous plan,
and it has to be repealed and
replaced.

34:03.675 --> 34:06.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COOPER: Secretary Clinton,
let me follow up with you.

34:06.177 --> 34:09.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your husband called Obamacare,
quote, the craziest thing in
the world, saying that

34:09.614 --> 34:13.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
small-business owners are
getting killed as premiums
double, coverage is cut in half.

34:13.785 --> 34:15.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Was he mistaken or was the
mistake simply telling the
truth?

34:15.787 --> 34:17.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: No, I mean, he
clarified what he meant.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it s very clear.

34:20.158 --> 34:25.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, we are in a situation in
our country where if we were to
start all over again,

34:25.697 --> 34:27.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we might come up with
a different system.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.968 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But we have an
employer-based system.

34:29.968 --> 34:34.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That s where the vast majority
of people get their health care.

34:34.406 --> 34:40.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Affordable Care Act was
meant to try to fill the gap
between people who were too

34:40.245 --> 34:46.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poor and couldn t put together
any resources to afford health
care, namely people on Medicaid.

34:46.952 --> 34:52.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, Medicare, which is a
single-payer system, which takes
care of our elderly and

34:52.223 --> 34:57.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does a great job doing it, by
the way, and then all of the
people who were employed,

34:57.195 --> 35:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but people who were working but
didn t have the money to afford
insurance and didn t

35:01.866 --> 35:04.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have anybody, an employer or
anybody else, to help them.

35:04.836 --> 35:10.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was the slot that the
Obamacare approach was to take.

35:10.141 --> 35:14.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And like I say, 20 million
people now have health
insurance.

35:14.045 --> 35:18.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So if we just rip it up and
throw it away, what Donald s not
telling you is we just

35:18.683 --> 35:21.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turn it back to the insurance
companies the way it used to be,
and that means the insurance

35:21.353 --> 35:22.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
companies

35:22.620 --> 35:24.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Secretary Clinton

35:24.756 --> 35:26.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: get to do pretty much
whatever they want, including
saying, look, I m sorry,

35:26.925 --> 35:29.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you ve got diabetes, you had
cancer, your child has asthma

35:29.794 --> 35:31.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COOPER: Your time is up.

35:31.930 --> 35:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: you may not be able
to have insurance because you
can t afford it.

35:35.166 --> 35:39.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So let s fix what s broken about
it, but let s not throw it away
and give it all

35:39.771 --> 35:42.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back to the insurance companies
and the drug companies.

35:42.107 --> 35:43.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That s not going to work.

35:43.541 --> 35:44.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: Mr. Trump, let
me follow up on this.

35:44.509 --> 35:45.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Well, I just
want just one thing.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
First of all, Hillary,
everything s broken about it.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Everything.

35:49.581 --> 35:53.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number two, Bernie Sanders said
that Hillary Clinton has very
bad judgment.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a perfect example of it,
trying to save Obamacare, which
is a disaster.

35:56.888 --> 35:57.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: You ve said you
want to end Obamacare

35:57.489 --> 35:59.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: By the way

35:59.024 --> 36:01.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: You ve said you
want to end Obamacare.

36:01.092 --> 36:05.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You ve also said you want to
make coverage accessible for
people with pre-existing
conditions.

36:05.263 --> 36:07.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you force insurance
companies to do that if you re
no longer mandating that

36:07.599 --> 36:08.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
every American get insurance?

36:08.867 --> 36:09.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: We re going
to be able to.

36:09.667 --> 36:10.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You re going to have plans

36:10.669 --> 36:12.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: What does that mean?

36:12.003 --> 36:13.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Well, I ll tell
you what it means.

36:13.872 --> 36:16.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You re going to have plans that
are so good, because we re going
to have so much competition

36:16.608 --> 36:19.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the insurance industry.

36:19.144 --> 36:23.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once we break out once we
break out the lines and allow
the competition to come

36:23.048 --> 36:25.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COOPER: Are you going are you
going to have a mandate that
Americans have to have

36:25.216 --> 36:26.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health insurance?

36:26.785 --> 36:28.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: President Obama
Anderson, excuse me.

36:28.586 --> 36:33.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama, by keeping
those lines, the boundary lines
around each state, it was almost

36:33.224 --> 36:37.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gone until just very toward the
end of the passage of Obamacare,
which, by the way, was

36:37.729 --> 36:40.231 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a fraud.

36:40.231 --> 36:44.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know that, because Jonathan
Gruber, the architect of
Obamacare, was said he said

36:44.702 --> 36:47.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it was a great lie,
it was a big lie.

36:47.172 --> 36:49.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama said you keep
your doctor, you keep your plan.

36:49.007 --> 36:52.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The whole thing was a
fraud, and it doesn t work.

36:52.510 --> 36:56.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when we get rid of those
lines, you will have
competition, and we will be able
to keep

36:56.481 --> 37:00.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pre-existing, we ll also be able
to help people that can t get
don t have money

37:00.518 --> 37:03.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because we are going to
have people protected.

37:03.955 --> 37:07.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Republicans feel this way,
believe it or not, and strongly
this way.

37:07.058 --> 37:10.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We re going to block
grant into the states.

37:10.128 --> 37:12.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We re going to block grant
into Medicaid into the states

37:12.330 --> 37:14.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.

37:14.399 --> 37:17.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: so that we will be able
to take care of people without
the necessary funds

37:17.102 --> 37:18.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to take care of themselves.

37:18.136 --> 37:20.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RADIATE: We now go to Gorbah
Hamed with a question for both
candidates.

37:22.941 --> 37:25.510 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
QUESTION: Hi.

37:25.510 --> 37:31.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are 3.3 million Muslims in
the United States, and I m one
of them.

37:31.382 --> 37:36.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You ve mentioned working with
Muslim nations, but with
Islamophobia on the rise, how
will

37:36.454 --> 37:40.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you help people like me deal
with the consequences of being
labeled as a threat to the
country

37:40.391 --> 37:42.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after the election is over?

37:42.260 --> 37:44.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: Mr. Trump,
you re first.

37:44.429 --> 37:49.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, you re right about
Islamophobia, and that s a
shame.

37:49.601 --> 37:55.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one thing we have to do is
we have to make sure that
because there is a problem.

37:55.540 --> 37:59.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, whether we like it or
not, and we could be very
politically correct, but whether

37:59.077 --> 38:02.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we like it or not,
there is a problem.

38:02.480 --> 38:07.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have to be sure that
Muslims come in and report when
they see something going on.

38:07.719 --> 38:10.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When they see hatred going
on, they have to report it.

38:10.388 --> 38:15.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As an example, in San
Bernardino, many people saw the
bombs all over the apartment of
the

38:15.026 --> 38:17.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two people that killed 14 and
wounded many, many people.

38:17.061 --> 38:18.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Horribly wounded.

38:18.196 --> 38:21.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They ll never be the same.

38:21.332 --> 38:26.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Muslims have to report the
problems when they see them.

38:26.771 --> 38:31.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, you know, there s always
a reason for everything.

38:31.442 --> 38:36.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they don t do that, it s a
very difficult situation for our
country, because you look

38:36.614 --> 38:39.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at Orlando and you look at San
Bernardino and you look at the
World Trade Center.

38:39.817 --> 38:40.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Go outside.

38:40.852 --> 38:42.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Look at Paris.

38:42.720 --> 38:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look at that horrible these
are radical Islamic terrorists.

38:47.091 --> 38:50.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she won t even mention the
word and nor will President
Obama.

38:50.728 --> 38:54.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He won t use the term
radical Islamic terrorism.

38:54.666 --> 38:59.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, to solve a problem, you
have to be able to state what
the problem is or at least say

38:59.103 --> 39:01.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the name.

39:01.973 --> 39:04.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She won t say the name and
President Obama won t say the
name.

39:04.542 --> 39:05.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But the name is there.

39:05.743 --> 39:09.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It s radical Islamic terror.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And before you solve it,
you have to say the name.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RADIATE: Secretary Clinton?

39:13.785 --> 39:17.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, thank you
for asking your question.

39:17.121 --> 39:23.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I ve heard this question
from a lot of Muslim-Americans
across our country, because,

39:23.428 --> 39:32.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unfortunately, there s been a
lot of very divisive, dark
things said about Muslims.

39:32.570 --> 39:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even someone like Captain
Khan, the young man who
sacrificed himself defending our
country

39:38.209 --> 39:42.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the United States Army, has
been subject to attack by
Donald.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I want to say just a
couple of things.

39:44.782 --> 39:48.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, we ve had Muslims in
America since George Washington.

39:48.853 --> 39:52.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we ve had many
successful Muslims.

39:52.090 --> 39:57.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We just lost a particular
well-known one with Muhammad
Ali.

39:57.762 --> 40:04.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: My vision of America is
an America where everyone has a
place, if you re willing

40:04.902 --> 40:09.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to work hard, you do your part,
you contribute to the community.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That s what America is.

40:11.943 --> 40:15.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That s what we want America to
be for our children and our
grandchildren.

40:15.613 --> 40:21.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It s also very short-sighted and
even dangerous to be engaging in
the kind of demagogic rhetoric

40:21.286 --> 40:24.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that Donald has about Muslims.

40:24.856 --> 40:30.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need American Muslims to be
part of our eyes and ears on our
front lines.

40:30.161 --> 40:34.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I ve worked with a lot of
different Muslim groups around
America.

40:34.265 --> 40:39.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I ve met with a lot of them, and
I ve heard how important it is
for them to feel

40:39.237 --> 40:45.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that they are wanted and
included and part of our
country, part of our homeland
security,

40:45.343 --> 40:47.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that s what I want to see.

40:47.812 --> 40:53.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It s also important I intend to
defeat ISIS, to do so in a
coalition with majority Muslim

40:53.451 --> 40:56.120 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nations.

40:56.120 --> 41:00.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, a lot of those
nations are hearing what Donald
says and wondering, why should

41:00.325 --> 41:02.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we cooperate with the Americans?

41:02.960 --> 41:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is a gift to ISIS and
the terrorists, violent jihadist
terrorists.

41:08.633 --> 41:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are not at war with Islam.

41:12.704 --> 41:15.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is a mistake and it plays
into the hands of the terrorists
to act as though we

41:15.573 --> 41:18.376 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

41:18.376 --> 41:23.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I want a country where
citizens like you and your
family are just as welcome as
anyone

41:23.648 --> 41:25.316 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
else.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: Thank you,
Secretary Clinton.

41:26.584 --> 41:29.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump, in December,
you said this.

41:29.387 --> 41:35.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald J. Trump is calling for
a total and complete shutdown of
Muslims entering

41:35.059 --> 41:39.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States until our
country s representatives can
figure out what the hell is
going on.

41:39.364 --> 41:40.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have no choice.

41:40.565 --> 41:43.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have no choice.

41:43.301 --> 41:46.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your running mate said this week
that the Muslim ban is no longer
your position.

41:46.704 --> 41:49.340 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that correct?

41:49.340 --> 41:53.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if it is, was it a mistake
to have a religious test?

41:53.211 --> 41:59.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: First of all, Captain
Khan is an American hero, and if
I were president at that time,

41:59.851 --> 42:05.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he would be alive today, because
unlike her, who voted for the
war without knowing what

42:05.289 --> 42:08.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she was doing, I would not
have had our people in Iraq.

42:08.526 --> 42:11.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Iraq was disaster.

42:11.763 --> 42:15.500 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
So he would have
been alive today.

42:15.500 --> 42:21.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Muslim ban is something that
in some form has morphed into a
extreme vetting from certain

42:21.739 --> 42:23.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
areas of the world.

42:23.741 --> 42:25.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton wants to allow
hundreds of thousands excuse
me.

42:25.810 --> 42:27.412 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Excuse me..

42:27.412 --> 42:28.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: And why did
it morph into that?

42:28.713 --> 42:29.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
No, did you no,
answer the question.

42:29.814 --> 42:31.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you still believe

42:31.082 --> 42:32.517 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: Why don t
you interrupt her?

42:32.517 --> 42:33.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You interrupt me all the time.

42:33.251 --> 42:34.652 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
RADDATZ: I do.

42:34.652 --> 42:36.487 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: Why don t
you interrupt her?

42:36.487 --> 42:38.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RADIATE: Would you please
explain whether or not the
Muslim ban still stands?

42:38.256 --> 42:42.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: It s called
extreme vetting.

42:42.894 --> 42:47.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are going to areas like Syria
where they re coming in by the
tens of thousands because

42:47.698 --> 42:50.868 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Barack Obama.

42:50.868 --> 42:58.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Hillary Clinton wants to
allow a 550 percent increase
over Obama.

42:58.042 --> 43:03.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People are coming into our
country like we have no idea who
they are, where they are

43:03.948 --> 43:08.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from, what their feelings about
our country is, and she wants
550 percent more.

43:08.553 --> 43:11.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is going to be the great
Trojan horse of all time.

43:11.989 --> 43:13.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have enough problems
in this country.

43:13.758 --> 43:16.761 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I believe in
building safe zones.

43:16.761 --> 43:20.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe in having other people
pay for them, as an example, the
Gulf states, who are not

43:20.731 --> 43:25.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
carrying their weight, but they
have nothing but money, and take
care of people.

43:25.269 --> 43:29.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don t want to have, with
all the problems this country
has and all of the problems that

43:29.907 --> 43:33.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you see going on, hundreds of
thousands of people coming in
from Syria when we know nothing

43:33.644 --> 43:36.113 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about them.

43:36.113 --> 43:40.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know nothing about their
values and we know nothing about
their love for our country.

43:40.551 --> 43:44.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RADIATE: And, Secretary Clinton,
let me ask you about that,
because you have asked for

43:44.856 --> 43:49.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an increase from 10,000 to
65,000 Syrian refugees.

43:49.994 --> 43:51.696 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We know you want
tougher vetting.

43:51.696 --> 43:54.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That s not a perfect system.

43:54.999 --> 43:58.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So why take the risk of having
those refugees come into the
country?

43:58.870 --> 44:02.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, first of all, I
will not let anyone into our
country that I think poses

44:02.373 --> 44:05.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a risk to us.

44:05.743 --> 44:10.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are a lot of refugees,
women and children think of
that picture we all

44:10.815 --> 44:15.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saw of that 4-year-old boy with
the blood on his forehead
because he d been bombed

44:15.019 --> 44:19.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by the Russian and
Syrian air forces.

44:19.891 --> 44:26.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are children suffering in
this catastrophic war, largely,
I believe, because of Russian

44:26.397 --> 44:29.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
aggression.

44:29.033 --> 44:32.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we need to do our part.

44:32.537 --> 44:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We by no means are carrying
anywhere near the load that
Europe and others are.

44:38.209 --> 44:44.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we will have vetting that is
as tough as it needs to be from
our professionals,

44:44.115 --> 44:48.319 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
our intelligence
experts and others.

44:48.319 --> 44:55.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it is important for us as a
policy, you know, not to say, as
Donald has said, we re

44:55.826 --> 44:58.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to ban people
based on a religion.

44:58.629 --> 45:00.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you do that?

45:00.398 --> 45:05.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are a country founded on
religious freedom and liberty.

45:05.136 --> 45:13.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How do we do what he has
advocated without causing great
distress within our own county?

45:13.377 --> 45:18.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are we going to have religious
tests when people fly into our
country?

45:18.316 --> 45:23.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And how do we expect to be
able to implement those?

45:23.788 --> 45:30.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I thought that what he said
was extremely unwise and even
dangerous.

45:30.127 --> 45:36.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And indeed, you can look at the
propaganda on a lot of the
terrorists sites, and what

45:36.434 --> 45:45.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump says about Muslims
is used to recruit fighters,
because they want to create

45:45.376 --> 45:48.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a war between us.

45:48.846 --> 45:51.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the final thing I would say,
this is the 10th or 12th time
that he s denied being

45:51.482 --> 45:53.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the war in Iraq.

45:53.884 --> 45:55.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have it on tape.

45:55.386 --> 45:58.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The entire press corps
has looked at it.

45:58.823 --> 46:01.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It s been debunked, but it never
stops him from saying whatever
he wants to say.

46:01.859 --> 46:02.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: That s not been debunked.

46:02.893 --> 46:04.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: So, please

46:04.261 --> 46:05.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: That has not
been debunked.

46:05.763 --> 46:07.331 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
CLINTON: go to
HillaryClinton.com and you can
see it.

46:07.331 --> 46:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: I was against I was
against the war in Iraq.

46:08.733 --> 46:10.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Has not been debunked.

46:10.001 --> 46:10.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And you voted for it.

46:10.968 --> 46:12.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And you shouldn t have.

46:12.069 --> 46:14.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, I just want to say

46:14.271 --> 46:15.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RADIATE: There s been lots
of fact-checking on that.

46:15.106 --> 46:16.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I d like to move on to
an online question

46:16.073 --> 46:17.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Excuse me.

46:17.642 --> 46:18.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She just went about 25
seconds over her time.

46:18.776 --> 46:20.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RADIATE: She did not.

46:20.211 --> 46:20.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Could I just
respond to this, please?

46:20.911 --> 46:23.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RADIATE: Very quickly, please.

46:23.214 --> 46:26.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Hillary Clinton, in terms
of having people come into our
country, we have many

46:26.817 --> 46:30.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
criminal illegal aliens.

46:30.121 --> 46:33.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we want to send them back
to their country, their country
says we don t want them.

46:33.858 --> 46:37.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In some cases, they re
murderers, drug lords, drug
problems.

46:37.028 --> 46:39.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they don t want them.

46:39.530 --> 46:41.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Hillary Clinton, when she
was secretary of state, said
that s OK, we can t force

46:41.732 --> 46:43.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it into their country.

46:43.668 --> 46:46.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let me tell you, I m going to
force them right back into their
country.

46:46.303 --> 46:49.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They re murderers and
some very bad people.

46:49.674 --> 46:54.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I will tell you very
strongly, when Bernie Sanders
said she had bad judgment, she
has

46:54.245 --> 46:57.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really bad judgment, because we
are letting people into this
country that are going to

46:57.948 --> 47:00.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cause problems and crime
like you ve never seen.

47:00.785 --> 47:04.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We re also letting drugs pour
through our southern border at a
record clip.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
At a record clip.

47:06.290 --> 47:09.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it shouldn t be
allowed to happen.

47:09.527 --> 47:11.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ICE just endorsed me.

47:11.328 --> 47:14.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They ve never endorsed a
presidential candidate.

47:14.799 --> 47:20.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Border Patrol agents,
16,500, just recently endorsed
me, and they endorsed me because

47:20.571 --> 47:21.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I understand the border.

47:21.906 --> 47:23.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She doesn t.

47:23.174 --> 47:24.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She wants amnesty for everybody.

47:24.141 --> 47:25.109 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Come right in.

47:25.109 --> 47:26.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Come right over.

47:26.944 --> 47:30.014 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
It s a horrible
thing she s doing.

47:30.014 --> 47:34.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She s got bad judgment, and
honestly, so bad that she should
never be president of

47:34.085 --> 47:35.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

47:35.252 --> 47:36.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That I can tell you.

47:36.420 --> 47:37.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RADIATE: Thank you, Mr. Trump.

47:37.221 --> 47:39.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I want to move on.

47:39.657 --> 47:44.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This next question from the
public through the Bipartisan
Open Debate Coalition s online

47:44.228 --> 47:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forum, where Americans submitted
questions that generated
millions of votes.

47:49.266 --> 47:55.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This question involves WikiLeaks
release of purported excerpts of
Secretary Clinton s

47:55.206 --> 48:00.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paid speeches, which she has
refused to release, and one line
in particular, in which you,

48:00.411 --> 48:05.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton, purportedly
say you need both a public and
private position on certain

48:05.716 --> 48:08.052 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

48:08.052 --> 48:14.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks,
is it OK for politicians to be
two-faced?

48:14.825 --> 48:19.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is it acceptable for a
politician to have a private
stance on issues?

48:19.230 --> 48:20.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton,
your two minutes.

48:20.931 --> 48:23.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, right.

48:23.234 --> 48:31.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As I recall, that was something
I said about Abraham Lincoln
after having seen the wonderful

48:31.742 --> 48:36.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Steven Spielberg movie
called Lincoln.

48:36.547 --> 48:44.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a master class watching
President Lincoln get the
Congress to approve the 13th
Amendment.

48:44.221 --> 48:48.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was principled, and
it was strategic.

48:48.359 --> 48:53.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was making the point that
it is hard sometimes to get the
Congress to do what you

48:53.764 --> 48:58.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
want to do and you have
to keep working at it.

48:58.135 --> 49:03.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, yes, President Lincoln was
trying to convince some people,
he used some arguments,

49:03.407 --> 49:06.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
convincing other people,
he used other arguments.

49:06.410 --> 49:12.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was a great I thought a
great display of presidential
leadership.

49:12.550 --> 49:18.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, you know, let s talk about
what s really going on here,
Martha, because our

49:18.155 --> 49:25.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intelligence community just came
out and said in the last few
days that the Kremlin, meaning

49:25.262 --> 49:32.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Putin and the Russian
government, are directing the
attacks, the hacking on American
accounts

49:32.436 --> 49:36.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to influence our election.

49:36.574 --> 49:42.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And WikiLeaks is part of that,
as are other sites where the
Russians hack information,

49:42.813 --> 49:47.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we don t even know if it s
accurate information, and then
they put it out.

49:47.585 --> 49:54.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have never in the history of
our country been in a situation
where an adversary, a

49:54.191 --> 49:59.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foreign power, is working so
hard to influence the outcome of
the election.

49:59.563 --> 50:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And believe me, they re not
doing it to get me elected.

50:02.967 --> 50:07.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They re doing it to try to
influence the election for
Donald Trump.

50:07.004 --> 50:12.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Now, maybe because he
has praised Putin, maybe because
he says he agrees with

50:12.109 --> 50:14.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of what Putin wants to do,
maybe because he wants to do
business in Moscow, I don t

50:14.745 --> 50:16.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
know the reasons.

50:16.180 --> 50:19.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But we deserve answers.

50:19.617 --> 50:24.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we should demand that Donald
release all of his tax returns
so that people can see

50:24.889 --> 50:29.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what are the entanglements and
the financial relationships that
he has

50:29.593 --> 50:30.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: We re going
to get to that later.

50:30.527 --> 50:31.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton,
you re out of time.

50:31.795 --> 50:32.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: with the Russians
and other foreign powers.

50:32.096 --> 50:34.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RADDATZ: Mr. Trump?

50:34.098 --> 50:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, I think I should
respond, because so
ridiculous.

50:36.000 --> 50:41.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look, now she s blaming she
got caught in a total lie.

50:41.171 --> 50:44.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her papers went out to all her
friends at the banks, Goldman
Sachs and everybody else,

50:44.375 --> 50:48.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and she said things
WikiLeaks that just came out.

50:48.612 --> 50:50.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And she lied.

50:50.581 --> 50:54.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now she s blaming the lie on the
late, great Abraham Lincoln.

50:54.184 --> 50:56.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That s one that I haven t

50:56.287 --> 50:57.821 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:57.821 --> 50:59.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
OK, Honest Abe, Honest
Abe never lied.

50:59.123 --> 51:00.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That s the good thing.

51:00.791 --> 51:03.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That s the big difference
between Abraham Lincoln and you.

51:03.027 --> 51:05.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That s a big, big difference.

51:05.029 --> 51:08.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We re talking about
some difference.

51:08.232 --> 51:14.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as far as other elements of
what she was saying, I don t
know Putin.

51:14.672 --> 51:17.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it would be great if we
got along with Russia because we
could fight ISIS together,

51:17.341 --> 51:18.442 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as an example.

51:18.442 --> 51:21.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I don t know Putin.

51:21.178 --> 51:24.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I notice, anytime anything
wrong happens, they like to say
the Russians are she

51:24.815 --> 51:26.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doesn t know if it s the
Russians doing the hacking.

51:26.984 --> 51:28.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Maybe there is no hacking.

51:28.619 --> 51:30.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But they always blame Russia.

51:30.754 --> 51:32.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the reason they blame Russia
because they think they re
trying to tarnish me with

51:32.623 --> 51:34.024 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Russia.

51:34.024 --> 51:36.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I know nothing about Russia.

51:36.226 --> 51:39.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know I know about Russia,
but I know nothing about the
inner workings of Russia.

51:39.129 --> 51:40.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don t deal there.

51:40.264 --> 51:41.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have no businesses there.

51:41.265 --> 51:43.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have no loans from Russia.

51:43.767 --> 51:48.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have a very, very great
balance sheet, so great that
when I did the Old Post Office

51:48.706 --> 51:52.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Pennsylvania Avenue, the
United States government,
because of my balance sheet,
which

51:52.576 --> 51:57.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they actually know very well,
chose me to do the Old Post
Office, between the White

51:57.548 --> 52:02.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House and Congress, chose me
to do the Old Post Office.

52:02.152 --> 52:05.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the primary area things,
in fact, perhaps the primary
thing was balance sheet.

52:05.556 --> 52:09.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I have no loans with Russia.

52:09.426 --> 52:13.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You could go to the United
States government, and they
would probably tell you that,
because

52:13.330 --> 52:16.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they know my sheet very well in
order to get that development I
had to have.

52:16.867 --> 52:20.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, the taxes are a
very simple thing.

52:20.104 --> 52:23.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As soon as I have first of
all, I pay hundreds of millions
of dollars in taxes.

52:23.741 --> 52:26.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Many of her friends
took bigger deductions.

52:26.543 --> 52:29.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Warren Buffett took a
massive deduction.

52:29.213 --> 52:33.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Soros, who s a friend of hers,
took a massive deduction.

52:33.450 --> 52:35.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of the people that are
giving her all this money that
she can do many more commercials

52:35.986 --> 52:39.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than me gave her took
massive deductions.

52:39.523 --> 52:42.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I pay hundreds of millions
of dollars in taxes.

52:42.993 --> 52:45.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But but as soon as my routine
audit is finished, I ll release
my returns.

52:45.996 --> 52:47.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I ll be very proud to.

52:47.131 --> 52:48.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They re actually quite great.

52:48.132 --> 52:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RADIATE: Thank you, Mr. Trump.

52:49.566 --> 52:51.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: We want to turn,
actually, to the topic of taxes.

52:51.635 --> 52:53.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have a question
from Spencer Maass.

52:53.203 --> 52:55.072 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Spencer?

52:55.072 --> 53:01.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Good evening.

53:01.011 --> 53:04.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My question is, what specific
tax provisions will you change
to ensure the wealthiest
Americans

53:04.748 --> 53:06.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pay their fair share in taxes?

53:06.483 --> 53:08.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: Mr. Trump, you
have two minutes.

53:08.118 --> 53:12.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, one thing I d do
is get rid of carried interest.

53:12.089 --> 53:15.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the greatest provisions
for people like me, to be honest
with you, I give up

53:15.692 --> 53:19.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot when I run, because
I knock out the tax code.

53:19.596 --> 53:21.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And she could have done
this years ago, by the way.

53:21.198 --> 53:24.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She s a United States she
was a United States senator.

53:24.134 --> 53:26.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She complains that Donald Trump
took advantage of the tax code.

53:26.670 --> 53:28.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, why didn t she change it?

53:28.539 --> 53:31.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why didn t you change it
when you were a senator?

53:31.642 --> 53:32.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reason you didn t is that
all your friends take the same
advantage that I do.

53:32.976 --> 53:35.412 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I do.

53:35.412 --> 53:39.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have provisions in the tax
code that, frankly, we could
change.

53:39.183 --> 53:42.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you wouldn t change it,
because all of these people gave
you the money so you

53:42.319 --> 53:45.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can take negative ads
on Donald Trump.

53:45.522 --> 53:48.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But and I say that
about a lot of things.

53:48.358 --> 53:50.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I ve heard Hillary
complaining about so many
different things over the years.

53:50.894 --> 53:52.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I wish you would
have done this.

53:52.996 --> 53:54.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she s been there for 30
years she s been doing this
stuff.

53:54.565 --> 53:55.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She never changed.

53:55.699 --> 53:57.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she never will change.

53:57.201 --> 53:59.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She never will change.

53:59.036 --> 54:01.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We re getting rid of carried
interest provisions.

54:01.872 --> 54:06.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I m lowering taxes actually,
because I think it s so
important for corporations,
because

54:06.343 --> 54:10.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have corporations leaving
massive corporations and little
ones, little ones can t form.

54:10.714 --> 54:14.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We re getting rid of regulations
which goes hand in hand with the
lowering of the taxes.

54:14.818 --> 54:18.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we re bringing the tax rate
down from 35 percent to 15
percent.

54:18.122 --> 54:21.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We re cutting taxes
for the middle class.

54:21.258 --> 54:25.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I will tell you, we are
cutting them big league for the
middle class.

54:25.095 --> 54:26.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I will tell you, Hillary
Clinton is raising your taxes,
folks.

54:26.430 --> 54:27.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can look at me.

54:27.998 --> 54:32.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She s raising your
taxes really high.

54:32.069 --> 54:36.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what that s going to do is
a disaster for the country.

54:36.240 --> 54:39.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But she is raising your taxes
and I m lowering your taxes.

54:39.343 --> 54:40.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That in itself is
a big difference.

54:40.611 --> 54:42.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are going to be
thriving again.

54:42.579 --> 54:44.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have no growth
in this country.

54:44.014 --> 54:46.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There s no growth.

54:46.183 --> 54:50.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If China has a GDP of 7 percent,
it s like a national
catastrophe.

54:50.654 --> 54:53.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We re down at 1 percent.

54:53.524 --> 54:55.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that s, like, no growth.

54:55.592 --> 54:59.029 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And we re going
lower, in my opinion.

54:59.029 --> 55:01.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of it has to do with
the fact that our taxes are so
high, just about the highest

55:01.565 --> 55:03.901 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the world.

55:03.901 --> 55:07.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I m bringing them down to
one of the lower in the world.

55:07.738 --> 55:10.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it s so important
one of the most important things
we can do.

55:10.674 --> 55:12.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But she is raising
everybody s taxes massively.

55:12.609 --> 55:15.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COOPER: Secretary Clinton,
you have two minutes.

55:15.879 --> 55:18.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question was, what specific
tax provisions will you change
to ensure the wealthiest
Americans

55:18.482 --> 55:21.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pay their fair share of taxes?

55:21.218 --> 55:25.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, everything you ve
heard just now from Donald is
not true.

55:25.389 --> 55:31.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I m sorry I have to keep saying
this, but he lives in an
alternative reality.

55:31.562 --> 55:35.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is sort of amusing to
hear somebody who hasn t paid
federal income taxes in

55:35.365 --> 55:37.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
maybe 20 years talking about
what he s going to do.

55:37.534 --> 55:40.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I ll tell you what
he s going to do.

55:40.604 --> 55:47.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His plan will give the wealthy
and corporations the biggest tax
cuts they ve ever had, more

55:47.044 --> 55:51.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than the Bush tax cuts by
at least a factor of two.

55:51.882 --> 55:57.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald always takes care of
Donald and people like Donald,
and this would be a massive
gift.

55:57.788 --> 56:04.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, indeed, the way that he
talks about his tax cuts would
end up raising taxes on
middle-class

56:04.194 --> 56:05.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
families, millions of
middle-class families.

56:05.929 --> 56:08.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, here s what I want to do.

56:08.799 --> 56:14.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have said nobody who makes
less than $250,000 a year and
that s the vast majority

56:14.638 --> 56:18.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Americans as you know will
have their taxes raised, because
I think we ve got

56:18.175 --> 56:20.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to go where the money is.

56:20.310 --> 56:23.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the money is with people who
have taken advantage of every
single break in the tax

56:23.480 --> 56:25.782 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
code.

56:25.782 --> 56:30.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, yes, when I was a senator,
I did vote to close corporate
loopholes.

56:30.053 --> 56:35.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I voted to close, I think, one
of the loopholes he took
advantage of when he claimed a
billion-dollar

56:35.325 --> 56:38.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
loss that enabled him
to avoid paying taxes.

56:38.462 --> 56:43.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to have a tax on people
who are making a million
dollars.

56:43.667 --> 56:46.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It s called the Buffett rule.

56:46.303 --> 56:49.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, Warren Buffett is the one
who s gone out and said somebody
like him should not

56:49.139 --> 56:52.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be paying a lower tax
rate than his secretary.

56:52.843 --> 56:56.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to have a surcharge
on incomes above $5 million.

56:56.280 --> 56:59.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to make up for lost
times, because I want to invest
in you.

56:59.149 --> 57:02.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I want to invest in
hard-working families.

57:02.619 --> 57:07.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think it s been
unfortunate, but it s happened,
that since the Great Recession,

57:07.924 --> 57:10.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the gains have all
gone to the top.

57:10.661 --> 57:13.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we need to reverse that.

57:13.897 --> 57:18.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People like Donald, who paid
zero in taxes, zero for our
vets, zero for our military,

57:18.402 --> 57:21.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
zero for health and
education, that is wrong.

57:21.271 --> 57:23.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Thank you, Secretary.

57:23.340 --> 57:27.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: And we re going to make
sure that nobody, no
corporation, and no individual

57:27.711 --> 57:31.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can get away without paying his
fair share to support our
country.

57:31.348 --> 57:33.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COOPER: Thank you.

57:33.317 --> 57:34.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to give you Mr. Trump,
I want to give you the chance to
respond.

57:34.084 --> 57:36.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just wanted to tell our
viewers what she s referring to.

57:36.019 --> 57:38.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the last month, taxes were
the number-one issue on Facebook
for the first time in the

57:38.188 --> 57:40.290 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

57:40.290 --> 57:43.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The New York Times published
three pages of your 1995 tax
returns.

57:43.960 --> 57:47.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They show you claimed a $916
million loss, which means you
could have avoided paying

57:47.664 --> 57:50.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
personal federal income
taxes for years.

57:50.734 --> 57:54.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You ve said you pay state taxes,
employee taxes, real estate
taxes, property taxes.

57:54.438 --> 57:57.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have not answered,
though, a simple question.

57:57.507 --> 58:00.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did you use that $916 million
loss to avoid paying personal
federal income taxes for years?

58:00.711 --> 58:01.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Of course I do.

58:01.978 --> 58:03.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Of course I do.

58:03.947 --> 58:05.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so do all of her donors,
or most of her donors.

58:05.816 --> 58:07.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I know many of her donors.

58:07.651 --> 58:10.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Her donors took massive
tax write-offs.

58:10.220 --> 58:11.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COOPER: So have you (inaudible)
personal federal income tax?

58:11.722 --> 58:14.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: A lot of my excuse me,
Anderson a lot of my write-
off was depreciation

58:14.324 --> 58:17.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and other things that Hillary
as a senator allowed.

58:17.461 --> 58:19.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she ll always allow it,
because the people that give her
all this money, they

58:19.196 --> 58:20.330 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
want it.

58:20.330 --> 58:22.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That s why.

58:22.666 --> 58:26.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
See, I understand the tax code
better than anybody that s ever
run for president.

58:26.770 --> 58:31.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton and it s
extremely complex Hillary
Clinton has friends that want

58:31.641 --> 58:34.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
all of these provisions,
including they want the carried
interest provision, which is
very

58:34.878 --> 58:37.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
important to Wall Street people.

58:37.614 --> 58:42.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they really want the carried
interest provision, which I
believe Hillary s leaving.

58:42.018 --> 58:44.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Very interesting why she s
leaving carried interest.

58:44.821 --> 58:48.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I will tell you that, number
one, I pay tremendous numbers of
taxes.

58:48.291 --> 58:50.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I absolutely used it.

58:50.794 --> 58:55.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so did Warren Buffett and so
did George Soros and so did many
of the other people

58:55.799 --> 58:59.503 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
that Hillary is
getting money from.

58:59.503 --> 59:02.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I won t mention their
names, because they re rich, but
they re not famous.

59:02.406 --> 59:04.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So we won t make them famous.

59:04.441 --> 59:06.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COOPER: So can you can you say
how many years you have avoided
paying personal federal

59:06.643 --> 59:08.445 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
income taxes?

59:08.445 --> 59:12.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: No, but I pay tax,
and I pay federal tax, too.

59:12.015 --> 59:14.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I have a write-off, a lot of
it s depreciation, which is a
wonderful charge.

59:14.584 --> 59:15.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I love depreciation.

59:15.919 --> 59:18.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know, she s given it to us.

59:18.488 --> 59:21.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hey, if she had a problem for
30 years she s been doing this,
Anderson.

59:21.258 --> 59:22.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I say it all the time.

59:22.526 --> 59:23.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She talks about health care.

59:23.927 --> 59:24.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why didn t she do
something about it?

59:24.861 --> 59:26.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She talks about taxes.

59:26.797 --> 59:29.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why didn t she do
something about it?

59:29.166 --> 59:32.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She doesn t do anything about
anything other than talk.

59:32.702 --> 59:34.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
With her, it s all
talk and no action.

59:34.938 --> 59:37.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COOPER: In the past

59:37.274 --> 59:40.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: And, again, Bernie
Sanders, it s really bad
judgment.

59:40.143 --> 59:43.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She has made bad judgment
not only on taxes.

59:43.246 --> 59:47.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She s made bad judgments on
Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.

59:47.651 --> 59:53.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, her and Obama, whether
you like it or not, the way they
got out of Iraq, the

59:53.557 --> 59:58.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vacuum they ve left, that s why
ISIS formed in the first place.

59:58.028 --> 01:00:01.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They started from that little
area, and now they re in 32
different nations, Hillary.

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:02.332 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Congratulations.

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:04.468 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Great job.

01:00:04.468 --> 01:00:07.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COOPER: Secretary I want you
to be able to respond, Secretary
Clinton.

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:10.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, here we go again.

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:14.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I ve been in favor of getting
rid of carried interest for
years, starting when I was a

01:00:14.744 --> 01:00:16.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
senator from New York.

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:17.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that s not the point here.

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:18.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Why didn t you do it?

01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:19.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why didn t you do it?

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:21.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Allow her to respond.

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:21.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Because I was a senator
with a Republican president.

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:23.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Oh, really?

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:25.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: I will be the president
and we will get it done.

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:27.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That s exactly right.

01:00:27.891 --> 01:00:30.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: You could have done it,
if you were an effective if
you were an effective

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:31.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
senator, you could have done it.

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:32.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If you were an effective
senator, you could have done it.

01:00:32.696 --> 01:00:33.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But you were not an
effective senator.

01:00:33.597 --> 01:00:34.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: Please allow
her to respond.

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She didn t interrupt you.

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:39.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: You know, under our
Constitution, presidents have
something called veto power.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:45.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Look, he has now said
repeatedly, 30 years this and
30 years that.

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:48.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So let me talk about my 30
years in public service.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:52.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I m very glad to do so.

01:00:52.282 --> 01:00:57.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eight million kids every year
have health insurance, because
when I was first lady I

01:00:57.454 --> 01:01:01.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worked with Democrats and
Republicans to create the
Children s Health Insurance
Program.

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:06.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hundreds of thousands of kids
now have a chance to be adopted
because I worked to change our

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:10.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
adoption and foster care system.

01:01:10.567 --> 01:01:15.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After 9/11, I went to work with
Republican mayor, governor and
president to rebuild New

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:19.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
York and to get health care for
our first responders who were
suffering because they

01:01:19.643 --> 01:01:23.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had run toward danger and
gotten sickened by it.

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:28.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hundreds of thousands of
National Guard and Reserve
members have health care because
of

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:34.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work that I did, and children
have safer medicines because I
was able to pass a law that
required

01:01:34.224 --> 01:01:38.562 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the dosing to be
more carefully done.

01:01:38.562 --> 01:01:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was secretary of state, I
went around the world advocating
for our country, but

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:51.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also advocating for women s
rights, to make sure that women
had a decent chance to have

01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:57.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a better life and negotiated a
treaty with Russia to lower
nuclear weapons.

01:01:57.647 --> 01:02:02.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Four hundred pieces of
legislation have my name on it
as a sponsor or cosponsor when

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:06.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was a senator for eight years.

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:11.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I worked very hard and was very
proud to be re-elected in New
York by an even bigger margin

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:14.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than I had been elected
the first time.

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:20.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as president, I will take
that work, that bipartisan work,
that finding common ground,

01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:22.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because you have to be able to
get along with people to get
things done in Washington.

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:24.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Thank you, secretary.

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:27.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: I ve proven that I can,
and for 30 years, I ve produced
results for people.

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:28.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Thank you, secretary.

01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:29.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: We re going
to move on to Syria.

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:31.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Both of you have mentioned that.

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:33.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: She said a lot of
things that were false.

01:02:33.183 --> 01:02:34.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, I think we should
be allowed to maybe

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:35.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RADIATE: No, we can no, Mr.
Trump, we re going to go on.

01:02:35.719 --> 01:02:36.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is about the audience.

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:38.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Excuse me.

01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:38.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Because she has been a
disaster as a senator.

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
A disaster.

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:43.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: Mr. Trump,
we re going to move on.

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:48.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The heart-breaking video of a
5-year-old Syrian boy named
Omran sitting in an ambulance
after

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:54.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being pulled from the rubble
after an air strike in Aleppo
focused the world s attention

01:02:54.004 --> 01:03:00.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the horrors of the war in
Syria, with 136 million views on
Facebook alone.

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:04.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are much worse images
coming out of Aleppo every day
now, where in the past

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:11.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
few weeks alone, 400 people have
been killed, at least 100 of
them children.

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:15.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Just days ago, the State
Department called for a war
crimes investigation of the
Syrian

01:03:15.392 --> 01:03:21.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regime of Bashar al-Assad and
its ally, Russia, for their
bombardment of Aleppo.

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:25.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So this next question comes
through social media through
Facebook.

01:03:25.702 --> 01:03:30.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if
you were president, what would
you do about Syria and

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:33.209 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the humanitarian
crisis in Aleppo?

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:39.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Isn t it a lot like the
Holocaust when the U.S. waited
too long before we helped?

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:41.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Secretary Clinton, we will
begin with your two minutes.

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:46.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, the situation
in Syria is catastrophic.

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:55.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And every day that goes by, we
see the results of the regime by
Assad in partnership with

01:03:55.098 --> 01:04:01.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Iranians on the ground, the
Russians in the air, bombarding
places, in particular

01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:09.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aleppo, where there are hundreds
of thousands of people, probably
about 250,000 still left.

01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:17.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is a determined effort
by the Russian air force to
destroy Aleppo in order to
eliminate

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:23.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the last of the Syrian rebels
who are really holding out
against the Assad regime.

01:04:23.126 --> 01:04:25.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russia hasn t paid any
attention to ISIS.

01:04:25.462 --> 01:04:29.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They re interested in
keeping Assad in power.

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:34.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I, when I was secretary of
state, advocated and I advocate
today a no-fly zone and safe

01:04:34.804 --> 01:04:37.507 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
zones.

01:04:37.507 --> 01:04:44.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need some leverage with the
Russians, because they are not
going to come to the negotiating

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:50.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
table for a diplomatic
resolution, unless there is some
leverage over them.

01:04:50.787 --> 01:04:57.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have to work more closely
with our partners and allies on
the ground.

01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I want to emphasize that
what is at stake here is the
ambitions and the aggressiveness

01:05:02.766 --> 01:05:05.401 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Russia.

01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:11.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russia has decided that
it s all in, in Syria.

01:05:11.107 --> 01:05:13.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they ve also decided who
they want to see become
president of the United States,

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:14.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
too, and it s not me.

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:17.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I ve stood up to Russia.

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:21.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I ve taken on Putin and others,
and I would do that as
president.

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:25.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think wherever we can
cooperate with Russia, that s
fine.

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:27.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I did as secretary of state.

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:30.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That s how we got a treaty
reducing nuclear weapons.

01:05:30.627 --> 01:05:34.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It s how we got the sanctions on
Iran that put a lid on the
Iranian nuclear program without

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:37.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
firing a single shot.

01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:42.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I would go to the negotiating
table with more leverage than we
have now.

01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:48.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do support the effort to
investigate for crimes, war
crimes committed by the Syrians

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:50.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the Russians and try
to hold them accountable.

01:05:50.246 --> 01:05:50.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: Thank you,
Secretary Clinton.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mr. Trump?

01:05:53.183 --> 01:05:54.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: First of all, she was
there as secretary of state with
the so-called line in the sand,

01:05:54.818 --> 01:05:56.085 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
which

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:56.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: No, I wasn t.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.521 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I was gone.

01:05:58.521 --> 01:05:58.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I hate to interrupt
you, but at some point

01:05:58.888 --> 01:06:00.390 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: OK.

01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.890 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But you were in
contact excuse me.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:02.826 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You were

01:06:02.826 --> 01:06:04.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: At some point, we need
to do some fact-checking here.

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:06.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: You were in total contact
with the White House, and
perhaps, sadly, Obama probably

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:08.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
still listened to you.

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:10.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don t think he would be
listening to you very much
anymore.

01:06:10.934 --> 01:06:12.769 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Obama draws the
line in the sand.

01:06:12.769 --> 01:06:16.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was laughed at all over
the world what happened.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:22.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, with that being said, she
talks tough against Russia.

01:06:22.212 --> 01:06:26.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But our nuclear program has
fallen way behind, and they ve
gone wild with their nuclear

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:27.116 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:28.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Not good.

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:30.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our government shouldn t
have allowed that to happen.

01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:33.890 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Russia is new in
terms of nuclear.

01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:34.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We are old.

01:06:34.891 --> 01:06:36.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We re tired.

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:37.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We re exhausted in
terms of nuclear.

01:06:37.861 --> 01:06:40.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A very bad thing.

01:06:40.263 --> 01:06:46.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, she talks tough, she talks
really tough against Putin and
against Assad.

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:48.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She talks in favor
of the rebels.

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:50.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She doesn t even know
who the rebels are.

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:55.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, every time we take
rebels, whether it s in Iraq or
anywhere else, we re arming

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:57.113 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

01:06:57.113 --> 01:06:58.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you know what happens?

01:06:58.648 --> 01:07:00.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They end up being worse
than the people.

01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:01.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Look at what she did
in Libya with Gaddafi.

01:07:01.818 --> 01:07:02.785 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Gaddafi s out.

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:04.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It s a mess.

01:07:04.921 --> 01:07:07.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, by the way, ISIS has a
good chunk of their oil.

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:09.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I m sure you probably
have heard that.

01:07:09.158 --> 01:07:11.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a disaster.

01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:14.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because the fact is, almost
everything she s done in foreign
policy has been a mistake

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:18.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and it s been a disaster.

01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:22.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you look at Russia, just
take a look at Russia, and look
at what they did this

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:25.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week, where I agree, she wasn t
there, but possibly she s
consulted.

01:07:25.408 --> 01:07:26.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We sign a peace treaty.

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:29.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everyone s all excited.

01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:34.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, what Russia did with Assad
and, by the way, with Iran, who
you made very powerful

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:38.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the dumbest deal perhaps
I ve ever seen in the history of
deal-making, the Iran

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:42.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deal, with the $150 billion,
with the $1.7 billion in cash,
which is enough to fill up

01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:44.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this room.

01:07:44.193 --> 01:07:46.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But look at that deal.

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:49.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Iran now and Russia
are now against us.

01:07:49.766 --> 01:07:51.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So she wants to fight.

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:52.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She wants to fight for rebels.

01:07:52.869 --> 01:07:54.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There s only one problem.

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:55.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You don t even know
who the rebels are.

01:07:55.305 --> 01:07:56.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So what s the purpose?

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:57.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RADIATE: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump,
your two minutes is up.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: And one thing
I have to say.

01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:00.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RADIATE: Your two minutes is up.

01:08:00.043 --> 01:08:03.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: I don t like Assad at
all, but Assad is killing ISIS.

01:08:03.947 --> 01:08:06.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Russia is killing ISIS.

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:09.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Iran is killing ISIS.

01:08:09.352 --> 01:08:12.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those three have now lined
up because of our weak foreign
policy.

01:08:12.956 --> 01:08:16.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: Mr. Trump, let
me repeat the question.

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:17.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
If you were president

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.395 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:24.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what would you do about Syria
and the humanitarian crisis in
Aleppo?

01:08:24.367 --> 01:08:28.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I want to remind you
what your running mate said.

01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:33.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said provocations by Russia
need to be met with American
strength and that if Russia

01:08:33.376 --> 01:08:38.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continues to be involved in air
strikes along with the Syrian
government forces of Assad,

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:43.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States of America
should be prepared to use
military force to strike the
military

01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:44.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
targets of the Assad regime.

01:08:44.721 --> 01:08:46.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: OK.

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:48.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He and I haven t spoken,
and I disagree.

01:08:48.224 --> 01:08:49.859 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I disagree.

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:50.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: You disagree
with your running mate?

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:51.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: I think you have
to knock out ISIS.

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:55.264 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Right now, Syria
is fighting ISIS.

01:08:55.264 --> 01:08:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have people that want to
fight both at the same time.

01:08:57.333 --> 01:09:00.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But Syria is no longer Syria.

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:05.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syria is Russia and it s Iran,
who she made strong and Kerry
and Obama made into a very

01:09:05.708 --> 01:09:10.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
powerful nation and a very rich
nation, very, very quickly,
very, very quickly.

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:14.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I believe we have to get ISIS.

01:09:14.951 --> 01:09:18.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to worry about ISIS
before we can get too much more
involved.

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:19.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She had a chance to do
something with Syria.

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:20.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They had a chance.

01:09:20.957 --> 01:09:21.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that was the line.

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:23.626 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And she didn t.

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:24.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RADIATE: What do you think
will happen if Aleppo falls?

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:25.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: I think Aleppo is a
disaster, humanitarian-wise.

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:28.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RADIATE: What do you think
will happen if it falls?

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:31.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: I think that it
basically has fallen.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.268 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:33.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It basically has fallen.

01:09:33.369 --> 01:09:34.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let me tell you something.

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:36.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You take a look at Mosul.

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:40.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The biggest problem I have with
the stupidity of our foreign
policy, we have Mosul.

01:09:40.376 --> 01:09:43.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They think a lot of the
ISIS leaders are in Mosul.

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:47.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we have announcements coming
out of Washington and coming out
of Iraq, we will be attacking

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:49.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mosul in three weeks
or four weeks.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:53.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, all of these bad leaders
from ISIS are leaving Mosul.

01:09:53.623 --> 01:09:56.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why can t they do it quietly?

01:09:56.726 --> 01:10:02.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why can t they do the attack,
make it a sneak attack, and
after the attack is made,

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:05.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
inform the American public that
we ve knocked out the leaders,
we ve had a tremendous

01:10:05.068 --> 01:10:06.235 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
success?

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:08.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
People leave.

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:12.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why do they have to say we re
going to be attacking Mosul
within the next four to six

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:13.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weeks, which is what
they re saying?

01:10:13.576 --> 01:10:15.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How stupid is our country?

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:18.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RADIATE: There are sometimes
reasons the military does that.

01:10:18.081 --> 01:10:19.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Psychological warfare.

01:10:19.182 --> 01:10:20.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: I can t think of any.

01:10:20.083 --> 01:10:21.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can t think of any.

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:23.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I m pretty good at it.

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:23.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: It might be to
help get civilians out.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: And we have
General Flynn.

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:28.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have look, I have 200
generals and admirals who
endorsed me.

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:33.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have 21 Congressional Medal of
Honor recipients who endorsed
me.

01:10:33.296 --> 01:10:36.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We talk about it all the time.

01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:42.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They understand, why can t they
do something secretively, where
they go in and they knock

01:10:42.305 --> 01:10:43.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out the leadership?

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How why would these
people stay there?

01:10:45.508 --> 01:10:46.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I ve been reading now

01:10:46.943 --> 01:10:49.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: Tell me what
your strategy is.

01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:51.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: for weeks I ve been
reading now for weeks about
Mosul, that it s the

01:10:51.948 --> 01:10:55.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
harbor of where you know,
between Raqqa and Mosul, this is
where they think the ISIS

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:57.420 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
leaders are.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why would they be saying
they re not staying there
anymore.

01:10:59.122 --> 01:11:01.824 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They re gone.

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:05.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because everybody s talking
about how Iraq, which is us with
our leadership, goes in to

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.830 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fight Mosul.

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, with these 200 admirals and
generals, they can t believe it.

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
All I say is this.

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:19.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
General George Patton, General
Douglas MacArthur are spinning
in their grave at the stupidity

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:21.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of what we re doing
in the Middle East.

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:23.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: I m going to go
to Secretary Clinton.

01:11:23.479 --> 01:11:25.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton, you
want Assad to go.

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:29.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You advocated arming rebels, but
it looks like that may be too
late for Aleppo.

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:31.554 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
You talk about
diplomatic efforts.

01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:33.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Those have failed.

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:35.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Cease-fires have failed.

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:40.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Would you introduce the threat
of U.S. military force beyond a
no-fly zone against the Assad

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:43.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
regime to back up diplomacy?

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:48.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: I would not use
American ground forces in Syria.

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:52.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think that would be a
very serious mistake.

01:11:52.742 --> 01:11:57.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don t think American troops
should be holding territory,
which is what they would

01:11:57.547 --> 01:12:00.449 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
have to do as an
occupying force.

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:04.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don t think that
is a smart strategy.

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:10.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do think the use of special
forces, which we re using, the
use of enablers and trainers

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:15.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Iraq, which has had some
positive effects, are very much
in our interests, and so I do

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:18.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
support what is happening,
but let me just

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:21.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RADIATE: But what would you do
differently than President Obama
is doing?

01:12:21.304 --> 01:12:23.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, Martha, I hope
that by the time I if I m
fortunate

01:12:23.306 --> 01:12:25.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Everything.

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:31.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: I hope by the time I am
president that we will have
pushed ISIS out of Iraq.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:36.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I do think that there is a good
chance that we can take Mosul.

01:12:36.419 --> 01:12:39.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, Donald says he
knows more about ISIS than the
generals.

01:12:39.222 --> 01:12:42.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No, he doesn t.

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:49.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There are a lot of very
important planning going on, and
some of it is to signal to the

01:12:49.799 --> 01:12:55.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sunnis in the area, as well as
Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that
we all need to be in this.

01:12:55.137 --> 01:12:57.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that takes a lot of
planning and preparation.

01:12:57.673 --> 01:13:00.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would go after Baghdadi.

01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:07.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would specifically target
Baghdadi, because I think our
targeting of Al Qaida leaders

01:13:07.183 --> 01:13:11.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I was involved in a lot of
those operations, highly
classified ones made a
difference.

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:13.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So I think that could help.

01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:17.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I would also consider
arming the Kurds.

01:13:17.193 --> 01:13:23.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Kurds have been our best
partners in Syria, as well as
Iraq.

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:28.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know there s a lot of
concern about that in some
circles, but I think they should

01:13:28.704 --> 01:13:33.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have the equipment they need so
that Kurdish and Arab fighters
on the ground are the principal

01:13:33.342 --> 01:13:37.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way that we take Raqqa after
pushing ISIS out of Iraq.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:38.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RADIATE: Thank you very much.

01:13:38.314 --> 01:13:39.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We re going to move on

01:13:39.482 --> 01:13:40.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: You know what s funny?

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:43.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She went over a minute over,
and you don t stop her.

01:13:43.219 --> 01:13:44.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When I go one second over,
it s like a big deal.

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:45.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RADIATE: You had many answers.

01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:47.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: It s really it s
really very interesting.

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:49.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COOPER: We ve got a question
over here from James Carter.

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:53.996 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mr. Carter?

01:13:53.996 --> 01:14:08.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: My question is, do you
believe you can be a devoted
president to all the people

01:14:08.144 --> 01:14:09.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the United States?

01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:11.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: That question
begins for Mr. Trump.

01:14:11.514 --> 01:14:14.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Absolutely.

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:22.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, she calls our people
deplorable, a large group, and
irredeemable.

01:14:22.325 --> 01:14:26.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I will be a president
for all of our people.

01:14:26.028 --> 01:14:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I ll be a president that
will turn our inner cities
around and will give strength

01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:35.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to people and will give
economics to people and will
bring jobs back.

01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:39.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because NAFTA, signed by her
husband, is perhaps the greatest
disaster trade deal in the
history

01:14:39.508 --> 01:14:40.609 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the world.

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:42.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Not in this country.

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:45.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It stripped us of
manufacturing jobs.

01:14:45.114 --> 01:14:46.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We lost our jobs.

01:14:46.716 --> 01:14:47.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We lost our money.

01:14:47.783 --> 01:14:48.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We lost our plants.

01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:51.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is a disaster.

01:14:51.354 --> 01:14:53.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now she wants to sign TPP,
even though she says now she s
for it.

01:14:53.456 --> 01:14:55.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She called it the gold standard.

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:58.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And by the way, at the last
debate, she lied, because it
turned out that she did say the

01:14:58.394 --> 01:15:00.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gold standard and she
said she didn t say it.

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:03.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They actually said
that she lied.

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:04.667 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:06.102 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And she lied.

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:08.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But she s lied about
a lot of things.

01:15:08.137 --> 01:15:13.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I would be a president
for all of the people, African-
Americans, the inner cities.

01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:15.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Devastating what s happening
to our inner cities.

01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:17.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She s been talking
about it for years.

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:20.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As usual, she talks about
it, nothing happens.

01:15:20.383 --> 01:15:22.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She doesn t get it done.

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:26.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Same with the Latino Americans,
the Hispanic Americans.

01:15:26.956 --> 01:15:28.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The same exact thing.

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:31.360 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
They talk, they
don t get it done.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You go into the inner cities and
you see it s 45 percent
poverty.

01:15:34.397 --> 01:15:38.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
African- Americans now 45
percent poverty in the inner
cities.

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:41.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The education is a disaster.

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:44.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jobs are essentially
nonexistent.

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:50.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it s you know, and
I ve been saying at big speeches
where I have 20,000

01:15:50.179 --> 01:15:53.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and 30,000 people, what
do you have to lose?

01:15:53.249 --> 01:15:55.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It can t get any worse.

01:15:55.518 --> 01:15:58.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she s been talking about
the inner cities for 25 years.

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:01.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nothing s going to ever happen.

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:03.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let me tell you, if she s
president of the United States,
nothing s going to happen.

01:16:03.459 --> 01:16:05.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It s just going to be talk.

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:08.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all of her friends, the
taxes we were talking about, and
I would just get it by

01:16:08.431 --> 01:16:09.865 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
osmosis.

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:12.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She s not doing any me favors.

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:14.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But by doing all the others
favors, she s doing me favors.

01:16:14.437 --> 01:16:15.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Mr. Trump, thank you.

01:16:15.805 --> 01:16:17.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: But I will tell
you, she s all talk.

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:19.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It doesn t get done.

01:16:19.642 --> 01:16:20.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All you have to do is take
a look at her Senate run.

01:16:20.943 --> 01:16:22.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Take a look at upstate New York.

01:16:22.011 --> 01:16:23.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Your two minutes is up.

01:16:23.012 --> 01:16:24.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Secretary Clinton, two minutes?

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:25.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: It turned out
to be a disaster.

01:16:25.481 --> 01:16:28.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: You have two
minutes, Secretary Clinton.

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:34.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, 67 percent of the
people voted to re-elect me when
I ran for my second term,

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:38.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and I was very proud and
very humbled by that.

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:47.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Carter, I have tried my
entire life to do what I can to
support children and families.

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:51.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, right out of law
school, I went to work for the
Children s Defense Fund.

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:55.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald talks a lot about,
you know, the 30 years I ve been
in public service.

01:16:55.978 --> 01:16:59.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I m proud of that.

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:03.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I started off as a
young lawyer working against
discrimination against
African-American

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:08.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children in schools and in
the criminal justice system.

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:11.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I worked to make sure that kids
with disabilities could get a
public education, something that

01:17:11.894 --> 01:17:15.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I care very much about.

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:21.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have worked with Latinos one
of my first jobs in politics was
down in south Texas registering

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:25.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Latino citizens to
be able to vote.

01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:32.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I have a deep devotion, to
use your absolutely correct
word, to making sure that an
every

01:17:32.281 --> 01:17:37.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American feels like he or she
has a place in our country.

01:17:37.853 --> 01:17:43.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think when you look at the
letters that I get, a lot of
people are worried that maybe

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:47.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they wouldn t have a place
in Donald Trump s America.

01:17:47.563 --> 01:17:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They write me, and one woman
wrote me about her son, Felix.

01:17:51.467 --> 01:17:53.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She adopted him from Ethiopia
when he was a toddler.

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:55.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He s 10 years old now.

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:58.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is the only one
country he s ever known.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:02.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he listens to Donald on TV
and he said to his mother one
day, will he send me back

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:06.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to Ethiopia if he gets elected?

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:09.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, children listen
to what is being said.

01:18:09.485 --> 01:18:13.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
To go back to the very,
very first question.

01:18:13.923 --> 01:18:16.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there s a lot of fear in
fact, teachers and parents are
calling it the Trump effect.

01:18:16.959 --> 01:18:19.061 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bullying is up.

01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:21.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A lot of people are
feeling, you know, uneasy.

01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:24.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A lot of kids are
expressing their concerns.

01:18:24.934 --> 01:18:29.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, first and foremost, I will
do everything I can to reach out
to everybody.

01:18:29.305 --> 01:18:31.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: Your time,
Secretary Clinton.

01:18:31.507 --> 01:18:34.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Democrats, Republicans,
independents, people across our
country.

01:18:34.109 --> 01:18:35.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you don t vote for me, I
still want to be your president.

01:18:35.744 --> 01:18:37.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Your two minutes is up.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:38.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: I want to be the best
president I can be for every
American.

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:40.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COOPER: Secretary Clinton,
your two minutes is up.

01:18:40.849 --> 01:18:42.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to follow up on something
that Donald Trump actually said
to you, a comment you

01:18:42.985 --> 01:18:45.487 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
made last month.

01:18:45.487 --> 01:18:49.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You said that half of Donald
Trump s supporters are, quote,
deplorable, racist, sexist,

01:18:49.325 --> 01:18:51.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
homophobic, xenophobic,
Islamophobic.

01:18:51.293 --> 01:18:53.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You later said you
regretted saying half.

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You didn t express regret for
using the term deplorable.

01:18:57.933 --> 01:18:59.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To Mr. Carter s question, how
can you unite a country if
you ve written off tens of

01:18:59.969 --> 01:19:02.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
millions of Americans?

01:19:02.171 --> 01:19:06.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, within hours I
said that I was sorry about the
way I talked about that,

01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:10.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because my argument is
not with his supporters.

01:19:10.512 --> 01:19:16.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It s with him and with the
hateful and divisive campaign
that he has run, and the
inciting

01:19:16.552 --> 01:19:24.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of violence at his rallies, and
the very brutal kinds of
comments about not just women,
but

01:19:24.193 --> 01:19:28.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all Americans, all
kinds of Americans.

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:36.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what he has said about
African-Americans and Latinos,
about Muslims, about POWs, about

01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:41.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigrants, about people with
disabilities, he s never
apologized for.

01:19:41.844 --> 01:19:46.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I do think that a lot of
the tone and tenor that he has
said I m proud of

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the campaign that Bernie
Sanders and I ran.

01:19:48.884 --> 01:19:51.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We ran a campaign based
on issues, not insults.

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:52.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he is supporting
me 100 percent.

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:54.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COOPER: Thank you.

01:19:54.323 --> 01:19:56.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Because we talked
about what we wanted to do.

01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:59.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We might have had some
differences, and we had a lot of
debates

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:00.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Thank you, Secretary.

01:20:00.763 --> 01:20:02.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: but we believed that we
could make the country better.

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:04.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I was proud of that.

01:20:04.433 --> 01:20:05.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: I want to give
you a minute to respond.

01:20:05.067 --> 01:20:07.269 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: We have a divided nation.

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:09.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have a very divided nation.

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:10.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You look at Charlotte.

01:20:10.673 --> 01:20:13.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You look at Baltimore.

01:20:13.308 --> 01:20:17.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You look at the violence that s
taking place in the inner
cities, Chicago, you take a look

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:20.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Washington, D.C.

01:20:20.716 --> 01:20:28.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have an increase in murder
within our cities, the biggest
in 45 years.

01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:31.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a divided nation,
because people like her and
believe me, she has tremendous

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hate in her heart.

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:37.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And when she said
deplorable, she meant it.

01:20:37.633 --> 01:20:42.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when she said irredeemable,
they re irredeemable, you didn t
mention that, but

01:20:42.705 --> 01:20:45.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
when she said they re
irredeemable, to me that might
have been even worse.

01:20:45.374 --> 01:20:47.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: She said some of
them are irredeemable.

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:51.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: She s got tremendous
she s got tremendous hatred.

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:54.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this country cannot take
another four years of Barack
Obama, and that s what you re

01:20:54.616 --> 01:20:56.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
getting with her.

01:20:56.185 --> 01:20:58.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: Mr. Trump, let
me follow up with you.

01:20:58.487 --> 01:21:00.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2008, you wrote in one of
your books that the most
important characteristic of a
good

01:21:00.823 --> 01:21:03.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
leader is discipline.

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:08.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You said, if a leader doesn t
have it, quote, he or she won t
be one for very long.

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:11.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the days after the first
debate, you sent out a series of
tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m.,

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:14.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
including one that told people
to check out a sex tape.

01:21:14.169 --> 01:21:15.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that the discipline
of a good leader?

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:17.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: No, there wasn t
check out a sex tape.

01:21:17.439 --> 01:21:21.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was just take a look at the
person that she built up to be
this wonderful Girl Scout

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:22.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who was no Girl Scout.

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: You mentioned sex tape.

01:21:24.813 --> 01:21:26.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: By the way, just so you
understand, when she said 3
o clock in the morning,

01:21:26.782 --> 01:21:28.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
take a look at Benghazi.

01:21:28.984 --> 01:21:30.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said who is going to answer
the call at 3 o clock in the
morning?

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:32.654 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Guess what?

01:21:32.654 --> 01:21:34.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She didn t answer it, because
when Ambassador Stevens

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:37.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COOPER: The question is, is that
the discipline of a good leader?

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:39.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: 600 wait a minute,
Anderson, 600 times.

01:21:39.328 --> 01:21:41.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, she said she was awake at
3 o clock in the morning, and
she also sent a tweet

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out at 3 o clock in the morning,
but I won t even mention that.

01:21:43.866 --> 01:21:45.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But she said she ll be awake.

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:47.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who s going the famous thing,
we re going to answer our call
at 3 o clock in

01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:48.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the morning.

01:21:48.604 --> 01:21:50.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Guess what happened?

01:21:50.606 --> 01:21:56.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ambassador Stevens Ambassador
Stevens sent 600 requests for
help.

01:21:56.812 --> 01:22:00.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the only one she talked to
was Sidney Blumenthal, who s her
friend and not a good

01:22:00.983 --> 01:22:03.285 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
guy, by the way.

01:22:03.285 --> 01:22:06.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you know, she shouldn t
be talking about that.

01:22:06.822 --> 01:22:09.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, tweeting happens to be a
modern day form of
communication.

01:22:09.424 --> 01:22:11.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, you can like
it or not like it.

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:15.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have, between Facebook and
Twitter, I have almost 25
million people.

01:22:15.297 --> 01:22:18.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It s a very effective
way of communication.

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:22.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you can put it down, but it
is a very effective form of
communication.

01:22:22.171 --> 01:22:25.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I m not un-proud of it,
to be honest with you.

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COOPER: Secretary Clinton, does
Mr. Trump have the discipline to
be a good leader?

01:22:26.842 --> 01:22:28.110 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CLINTON: No.

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:30.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: I m shocked to hear that.

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:31.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:22:31.747 --> 01:22:36.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, it s
not only my opinion.

01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:41.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It s the opinion of many others,
national security experts,
Republicans, former Republican

01:22:41.924 --> 01:22:45.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
members of Congress.

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:52.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it s in part because those
of us who have had the great
privilege of seeing this

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:59.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
job up close and know how
difficult it is, and it s not
just because I watched my
husband

01:22:59.007 --> 01:23:04.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take a $300 billion deficit and
turn it into a $200 billion
surplus, and 23 million new

01:23:04.847 --> 01:23:07.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
jobs were created, and incomes
went up for everybody.

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:09.284 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Everybody.

01:23:09.284 --> 01:23:11.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
African-American incomes
went up 33 percent.

01:23:11.954 --> 01:23:18.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it s not just because I
worked with George W. Bush after
9/11, and I was very

01:23:18.427 --> 01:23:21.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
proud that when I told him what
the city needed, what we needed
to recover, he said you ve

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:23.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
got it, and he never wavered.

01:23:23.165 --> 01:23:25.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He stuck with me.

01:23:25.801 --> 01:23:29.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I have worked and I
admire President Obama.

01:23:29.638 --> 01:23:32.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He inherited the worst financial
crisis since the Great
Depression.

01:23:32.908 --> 01:23:35.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was a terrible
time for our country.

01:23:35.477 --> 01:23:37.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: We have to move along.

01:23:37.145 --> 01:23:38.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Nine million
people lost their jobs.

01:23:38.146 --> 01:23:39.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: Secretary
Clinton, we have to

01:23:39.081 --> 01:23:40.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Five million
homes were lost.

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:41.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: Secretary
Clinton, we re moving.

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:44.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: And $13 trillion in
family wealth was wiped out.

01:23:44.086 --> 01:23:47.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are back on the right track.

01:23:47.589 --> 01:23:49.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He would send us back into
recession with his tax plans
that benefit the wealthiest

01:23:49.892 --> 01:23:52.027 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Americans.

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:52.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RADIATE: Secretary Clinton, we
are moving to an audience
question.

01:23:52.427 --> 01:23:53.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We re almost out of time.

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:55.364 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We have another

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:56.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: We have the slowest
growth since 1929.

01:23:56.331 --> 01:23:59.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: We re moving to
an audience question.

01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:01.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: It is our country has
the slowest growth and jobs are
a disaster.

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:04.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RADIATE: Mr. Trump, Secretary
Clinton, we want to get to the
audience.

01:24:04.106 --> 01:24:06.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you very much both of you.

01:24:06.975 --> 01:24:08.443 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:24:08.443 --> 01:24:10.312 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We have another
audience question.

01:24:10.312 --> 01:24:13.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Beth Miller has a question
for both candidates.

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:17.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Good evening.

01:24:17.219 --> 01:24:21.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Perhaps the most important
aspect of this election is the
Supreme Court justice.

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:26.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What would you prioritize as the
most important aspect of
selecting a Supreme Court
justice?

01:24:26.828 --> 01:24:29.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RADIATE: We begin with your two
minutes, Secretary Clinton.

01:24:29.031 --> 01:24:30.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Thank you.

01:24:30.032 --> 01:24:31.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Well, you re right.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:36.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is one of the most
important issues in this
election.

01:24:36.171 --> 01:24:42.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to appoint Supreme Court
justices who understand the way
the world really works,

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:48.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who have real-life experience,
who have not just been in a big
law firm and maybe clerked

01:24:48.116 --> 01:24:51.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a judge and then gotten on
the bench, but, you know, maybe
they tried some more

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:55.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cases, they actually understand
what people are up against.

01:24:55.891 --> 01:25:00.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because I think the current
court has gone in the wrong
direction.

01:25:00.128 --> 01:25:06.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I would want to see the
Supreme Court reverse Citizens
United and get dark,
unaccountable

01:25:06.268 --> 01:25:08.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
money out of our politics.

01:25:08.503 --> 01:25:11.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Donald doesn t agree with that.

01:25:11.373 --> 01:25:15.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would like the Supreme Court
to understand that voting rights
are still a big problem

01:25:15.577 --> 01:25:21.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in many parts of our country,
that we don t always do
everything we can to make it
possible

01:25:21.616 --> 01:25:28.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for people of color and older
people and young people to be
able to exercise their
franchise.

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:33.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want a Supreme Court that will
stick with Roe v. Wade and a
woman s right to choose,

01:25:33.261 --> 01:25:36.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I want a Supreme Court that
will stick with marriage
equality.

01:25:36.398 --> 01:25:41.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, Donald has put forth the
names of some people that he
would consider.

01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:45.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And among the ones that he has
suggested are people who would
reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:48.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
marriage equality.

01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:52.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that would be a terrible
mistake and would take us
backwards.

01:25:52.247 --> 01:25:56.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want a Supreme Court that
doesn t always side with
corporate interests.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:26:01.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want a Supreme Court that
understands because you re
wealthy and you can give more
money

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:03.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to something doesn t mean you
have any more rights or should
have any more rights than

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:05.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
anybody else.

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:10.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I have very clear views about
what I want to see to kind of
change the balance on the

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:13.402 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Supreme Court.

01:26:13.402 --> 01:26:18.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I regret deeply that the
Senate has not done its job and
they have not permitted a

01:26:18.373 --> 01:26:24.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
vote on the person that
President Obama, a highly
qualified person, they ve not
given

01:26:24.413 --> 01:26:28.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him a vote to be able to be have
the full complement of nine
Supreme Court justices.

01:26:28.617 --> 01:26:31.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think that was a
dereliction of duty.

01:26:31.787 --> 01:26:37.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I hope that they will see their
way to doing it, but if I am so
fortunate enough as to

01:26:37.793 --> 01:26:42.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be president, I will immediately
move to make sure that we fill
that, we have nine justices

01:26:42.497 --> 01:26:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that get to work on
behalf of our people.

01:26:44.633 --> 01:26:45.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RADIATE: Thank you,
Secretary Clinton.

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:46.201 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:47.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You re out of time.

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:48.837 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mr. Trump?

01:26:48.837 --> 01:26:52.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: Justice Scalia, great
judge, died recently.

01:26:52.641 --> 01:26:56.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we have a vacancy.

01:26:56.211 --> 01:27:02.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am looking to appoint judges
very much in the mold of Justice
Scalia.

01:27:02.851 --> 01:27:10.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I m looking for judges and
I ve actually picked 20 of them
so that people would see,

01:27:10.725 --> 01:27:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
highly respected, highly thought
of, and actually very
beautifully reviewed by just
about everybody.

01:27:18.033 --> 01:27:23.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But people that will respect the
Constitution of the United
States.

01:27:23.705 --> 01:27:26.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think that this
is so important.

01:27:26.975 --> 01:27:32.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, the Second Amendment,
which is totally under siege by
people like Hillary Clinton.

01:27:32.447 --> 01:27:36.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They ll respect the Second
Amendment and what it stands
for, what it represents.

01:27:36.151 --> 01:27:38.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So important to me.

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:42.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, Hillary mentioned something
about contributions just so you
understand.

01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:48.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I will have in my race more
than $100 million put in of my
money, meaning I m not

01:27:48.697 --> 01:27:51.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taking all of this big money
from all of these different
corporations like she s doing.

01:27:51.967 --> 01:27:54.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What I ask is this.

01:27:54.236 --> 01:27:56.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I m putting in more than by
the time it s finished, I ll
have more than $100

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:58.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
million invested.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Pretty much self-funding money.

01:28:00.976 --> 01:28:03.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We re raising money for the
Republican Party, and we re
doing tremendously on the small

01:28:03.411 --> 01:28:07.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
donations, $61 average or so.

01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:13.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I ask Hillary, why doesn t she
made $250 million by being in
office.

01:28:13.421 --> 01:28:17.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She used the power of her
office to make a lot of money.

01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:21.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why isn t she funding, not for
$100 million, but why don t you
put $10 million or $20

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:24.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
million or $25 million or $30
million into your own campaign?

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:30.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It s $30 million less for
special interests that will tell
you exactly what to do and

01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:32.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it would really, I think, be a
nice sign to the American
public.

01:28:32.774 --> 01:28:34.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why aren t you putting
some money in?

01:28:34.109 --> 01:28:36.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have a lot of it.

01:28:36.011 --> 01:28:39.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You ve made a lot of it because
of the fact that you ve been in
office.

01:28:39.481 --> 01:28:43.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Made a lot of it while you were
secretary of state, actually.

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:44.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So why aren t you putting
money into your own campaign?

01:28:44.586 --> 01:28:45.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I m just curious.

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:46.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CLINTON: Well

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:47.789 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:28:47.789 --> 01:28:49.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RADIATE: Thank you very much.

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:50.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We re going to get on
to one more question.

01:28:50.192 --> 01:28:51.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: The question was
about the Supreme Court.

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:56.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I just want to quickly say,
I respect the Second Amendment.

01:28:56.364 --> 01:28:59.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I believe there should be
comprehensive background checks,
and we should close the

01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:01.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gun show loophole, and
close the online loophole.

01:29:01.203 --> 01:29:03.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COOPER: Thank you.

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:04.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RADIATE: We have we have one
more question, Mrs. Clinton.

01:29:04.139 --> 01:29:06.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: We have to save as
many lives as we possibly can.

01:29:06.241 --> 01:29:09.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
COOPER: We have one more
question from Ken Bone about
energy policy.

01:29:09.411 --> 01:29:12.681 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ken?

01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:18.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: What steps will your
energy policy take to meet our
energy needs, while at the

01:29:18.887 --> 01:29:22.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
same time remaining
environmentally friendly and
minimizing job loss for fossil
power plant

01:29:22.958 --> 01:29:24.359 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
workers?

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:25.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Mr. Trump, two minutes?

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:27.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Absolutely.

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:30.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it s such a great
question, because energy is
under siege by the Obama
administration.

01:29:30.232 --> 01:29:33.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Under absolutely siege.

01:29:33.501 --> 01:29:39.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The EPA, Environmental
Protection Agency, is killing
these energy companies.

01:29:39.608 --> 01:29:44.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And foreign companies are now
coming in buying our buying so
many of our different plants

01:29:44.713 --> 01:29:49.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then re-jiggering the plant
so that they can take care of
their oil.

01:29:49.184 --> 01:29:53.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are killing absolutely
killing our energy business in
this country.

01:29:53.722 --> 01:29:58.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I m all for alternative
forms of energy, including wind,
including solar, et cetera.

01:29:58.994 --> 01:30:01.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we need much more
than wind and solar.

01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:03.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you look at our miners.

01:30:03.832 --> 01:30:06.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton wants to put all
the miners out of business.

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:09.838 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
There is a thing
called clean coal.

01:30:09.838 --> 01:30:14.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Coal will last for 1,000
years in this country.

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:18.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we have natural gas and so
many other things because of
technology.

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:21.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have unbelievable we have
found over the last seven years,
we have found tremendous

01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:23.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wealth right under our feet.

01:30:23.385 --> 01:30:25.153 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
So good.

01:30:25.153 --> 01:30:27.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Especially when you have
$20 trillion in debt.

01:30:27.155 --> 01:30:31.293 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I will bring our
energy companies back.

01:30:31.293 --> 01:30:32.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They ll be able to compete.

01:30:32.494 --> 01:30:33.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They ll make money.

01:30:33.928 --> 01:30:36.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They ll pay off our
national debt.

01:30:36.598 --> 01:30:41.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They ll pay off our tremendous
budget deficits, which are
tremendous.

01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:45.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we are putting our energy
companies out of business.

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:48.943 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We have to bring
back our workers.

01:30:48.943 --> 01:30:54.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You take a look at what s
happening to steel and the cost
of steel and China dumping vast

01:30:54.516 --> 01:30:58.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
amounts of steel all over the
United States, which essentially
is killing our steelworkers

01:30:58.286 --> 01:31:00.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and our steel companies.

01:31:00.789 --> 01:31:03.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to guard our
energy companies.

01:31:03.625 --> 01:31:06.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to make it possible.

01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:13.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The EPA is so restrictive that
they are putting our energy
companies out of business.

01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:18.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all you have to do is go to
a great place like West Virginia
or places like Ohio, which

01:31:18.039 --> 01:31:23.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is phenomenal, or places like
Pennsylvania and you see what
they re doing to the people,

01:31:23.878 --> 01:31:25.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
miners and others in
the energy business.

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:26.448 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It s a disgrace.

01:31:26.448 --> 01:31:27.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COOPER: Your time is up.

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:28.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

01:31:28.983 --> 01:31:30.118 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: It s an
absolute disgrace.

01:31:30.118 --> 01:31:31.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: Secretary
Clinton, two minutes.

01:31:31.386 --> 01:31:36.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: And actually well,
that was very interesting.

01:31:36.257 --> 01:31:41.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, China is illegally
dumping steel in the United
States and Donald Trump is
buying

01:31:41.763 --> 01:31:47.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it to build his buildings,
putting steelworkers and
American steel plants out of
business.

01:31:47.969 --> 01:31:54.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That s something that I fought
against as a senator and that I
would have a trade prosecutor

01:31:54.576 --> 01:32:00.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make sure that we don t get
taken advantage of by China on
steel or anything else.

01:32:00.648 --> 01:32:04.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, because it sounds like
you re in the business or you re
aware of people

01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:08.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the business you know that
we are now for the first time
ever energy-independent.

01:32:08.723 --> 01:32:11.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are not dependent
upon the Middle East.

01:32:11.159 --> 01:32:13.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the Middle East still
controls a lot of the prices.

01:32:13.962 --> 01:32:17.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So the price of oil
has been way down.

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:22.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that has had a damaging
effect on a lot of the oil
companies, right?

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:27.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are, however, producing a lot
of natural gas, which serves as
a bridge to more renewable

01:32:27.242 --> 01:32:29.010 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fuels.

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:31.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think that s an
important transition.

01:32:31.246 --> 01:32:35.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We ve got to remain
energy-independent.

01:32:35.517 --> 01:32:39.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It gives us much more power and
freedom than to be worried about
what goes on in the Middle

01:32:39.554 --> 01:32:41.890 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
East.

01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:45.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have enough worries over
there without having to worry
about that.

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:50.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I have a comprehensive energy
policy, but it really does
include fighting climate change,

01:32:50.465 --> 01:32:54.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because I think that
is a serious problem.

01:32:54.469 --> 01:33:01.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I support moving toward more
clean, renewable energy as
quickly as we can, because I
think

01:33:01.509 --> 01:33:08.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we can be the 21st century clean
energy superpower and create
millions of new jobs and
businesses.

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:11.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I also want to be sure that
we don t leave people behind.

01:33:11.853 --> 01:33:16.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That s why I m the only
candidate from the very
beginning of this campaign who
had

01:33:16.157 --> 01:33:21.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a plan to help us revitalize
coal country, because those coal
miners and their fathers

01:33:21.963 --> 01:33:24.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and their grandfathers,
they dug that coal out.

01:33:24.566 --> 01:33:27.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A lot of them lost their lives.

01:33:27.569 --> 01:33:30.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were injured, but they
turned the lights on and they
powered their factories.

01:33:30.071 --> 01:33:31.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don t want to walk
away from them.

01:33:31.973 --> 01:33:33.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we ve got to do
something for them.

01:33:33.107 --> 01:33:34.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER: Secretary Clinton

01:33:34.576 --> 01:33:36.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: But the price of
coal is down worldwide.

01:33:36.911 --> 01:33:37.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we have to look at
this comprehensively.

01:33:37.412 --> 01:33:39.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COOPER: Your time is up.

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: And that s exactly
what I have proposed.

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:44.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I hope you will go to
HillaryClinton.com and look at
my entire policy.

01:33:44.652 --> 01:33:45.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COOPER: Time is up.

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:46.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have time for one more

01:33:46.621 --> 01:33:47.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RADIATE: We have

01:33:47.956 --> 01:33:49.757 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
COOPER: One more
audience question.

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:50.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RADIATE: We ve sneaked in one
more question, and it comes from
Karl Becker.

01:33:50.758 --> 01:33:56.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Good evening.

01:33:56.931 --> 01:34:04.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My question to both of you is,
regardless of the current
rhetoric, would either of you

01:34:04.138 --> 01:34:08.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
name one positive thing that
you respect in one another?

01:34:08.576 --> 01:34:10.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:34:10.345 --> 01:34:19.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RADIATE: Mr. Trump, would
you like to go first?

01:34:19.921 --> 01:34:26.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I certainly will,
because I think that s a very
fair and important question.

01:34:26.628 --> 01:34:31.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Look, I respect his children.

01:34:31.165 --> 01:34:38.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His children are incredibly able
and devoted, and I think that
says a lot about Donald.

01:34:38.706 --> 01:34:45.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don t agree with nearly
anything else he says or does,
but I do respect that.

01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:51.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that is something
that as a mother and a
grandmother is very important to
me.

01:34:51.719 --> 01:35:03.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I believe that this election
has become in part so so
conflict-oriented, so intense

01:35:03.565 --> 01:35:06.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because there s a lot at stake.

01:35:06.701 --> 01:35:12.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not an ordinary time,
and this is not an ordinary
election.

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:18.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are going to be choosing a
president who will set policy
for not just four or eight

01:35:18.813 --> 01:35:23.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years, but because of some of
the important decisions we have
to make here at home and

01:35:23.084 --> 01:35:28.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the world, from the
Supreme Court to energy and so
much else, and so there is a

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:30.024 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lot at stake.

01:35:30.024 --> 01:35:33.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It s one of the most
consequential elections that
we ve had.

01:35:33.928 --> 01:35:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that s why I ve tried to put
forth specific policies and
plans, trying to get

01:35:38.166 --> 01:35:43.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it off of the personal and put
it on to what it is I want to do
as president.

01:35:43.104 --> 01:35:47.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that s why I hope people
will check on that for
themselves so that they can see

01:35:47.909 --> 01:35:53.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, yes, I ve spent 30 years,
actually maybe a little more,
working to help kids

01:35:53.281 --> 01:35:55.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and families.

01:35:55.783 --> 01:35:58.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I want to take all that
experience to the White House
and do that every single day.

01:35:58.653 --> 01:36:01.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RADDATZ: Mr. Trump?

01:36:01.322 --> 01:36:07.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, I consider her
statement about my children to
be a very nice compliment.

01:36:07.295 --> 01:36:09.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don t know if it was meant to
be a compliment, but it is a
great I m very proud of

01:36:09.764 --> 01:36:12.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my children.

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:15.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they ve done a wonderful
job, and they ve been wonderful,
wonderful kids.

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:19.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So I consider that a compliment.

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I will say this about Hillary.

01:36:21.542 --> 01:36:22.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She doesn t quit.

01:36:22.677 --> 01:36:23.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She doesn t give up.

01:36:23.878 --> 01:36:25.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I respect that.

01:36:25.046 --> 01:36:26.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I tell it like it is.

01:36:26.681 --> 01:36:29.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She s a fighter.

01:36:29.217 --> 01:36:31.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I disagree with much of
what she s fighting for.

01:36:31.419 --> 01:36:37.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I do disagree with her
judgment in many cases.

01:36:37.792 --> 01:36:40.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she does fight hard, and she
doesn t quit, and she doesn t
give up.

01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:43.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I consider that to
be a very good trait.

01:36:43.231 --> 01:36:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RADIATE: Thanks to both of you.

01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:46.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COOPER: We want to thank
both the candidates.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:51.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We want to thank the
university here.

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:53.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This concludes the
town hall meeting.

01:36:53.474 --> 01:36:55.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our thanks to the candidates,
the commission, Washington
University, and to everybody who

01:36:55.743 --> 01:36:58.513 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
watched.

01:36:58.513 --> 01:37:01.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RADIATE: Please tune in on
October 19th for the final
presidential debate that will
take

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:03.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
place at the University
of Nevada, Las Vegas.

01:37:03.851 --> 01:37:06.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Good night, everyone.

01:37:06.354 --> 01:37:14.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IFILL: And that concludes this
second presidential debate
between Donald Trump and Hillary
Clinton.

01:37:14.162 --> 01:37:20.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining us here in Washington
for some analysis are syndicated
columnist Mark Shields, New

01:37:20.368 --> 01:37:24.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
York Times columnist David
Brooks, and Amy Walter of The
Cook Political Report, as we

01:37:24.405 --> 01:37:30.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
watch the candidates' families
join them on stage after ending
what -- a fairly nice moment

01:37:30.144 --> 01:37:33.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where they -- someone was able
to wring compliment out of them
as opposed way this debate began

01:37:33.614 --> 01:37:36.384 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
-- Mark Shields.

01:37:36.384 --> 01:37:39.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHIELDS: Karl Becker (ph), thank
you very much for the one
pleasant moment of the evening.

01:37:39.487 --> 01:37:43.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That question was what good
quality in the other person.

01:37:43.725 --> 01:37:48.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brought out the one consistently
positive narrative in the whole
evening.

01:37:48.863 --> 01:37:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They didn't shake hands at the
beginning, apparently knowing
what was to follow.

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:58.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a pretty ugly evening.

01:37:58.406 --> 01:38:02.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And not elevating,
not inspiring.

01:38:02.009 --> 01:38:09.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I just thought Trump
was substance free.

01:38:09.183 --> 01:38:15.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And anybody does not have
anything to say on health care
18 months after the race began,

01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:18.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and he has nothing but a
string of adjectives.

01:38:18.426 --> 01:38:21.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just thought Hillary
Clinton's answers on the emails
was totally inadequate.

01:38:21.329 --> 01:38:24.332 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And she has no
position on Syria.

01:38:24.332 --> 01:38:27.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IFILL: Of course, we were
watching Donald Trump with his
children.

01:38:27.935 --> 01:38:31.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Junior, and Eric Trump,
and Ivanka, and Melania, his
wife, standing over to the

01:38:31.806 --> 01:38:34.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
side greeting each other.

01:38:34.075 --> 01:38:38.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Hillary Clinton with
her family as well.

01:38:38.412 --> 01:38:45.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Amy Walter, we -- this
evening started out with the
Donald Trump videotape, audio

01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:48.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tape from last Friday.

01:38:48.923 --> 01:38:56.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did he do anything in this
debate to take that cloud -- to
lift that cloud off of him?

01:38:56.697 --> 01:38:59.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER: You know, in the last
debate it was Donald Trump who
was on defense the entire

01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:01.235 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

01:39:01.235 --> 01:39:01.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Hillary Clinton
was on offense.

01:39:01.903 --> 01:39:03.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She got under his skin.

01:39:03.004 --> 01:39:04.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He went down rabbit holes.

01:39:04.071 --> 01:39:07.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He lost his train of thought.

01:39:07.308 --> 01:39:10.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This debate, for all the talk
about how he's not prepared and
he doesn't like to go and

01:39:10.478 --> 01:39:14.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do these mock sessions,
he was very prepared.

01:39:14.348 --> 01:39:18.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he came in absolutely
focused on making the debate
about Hillary Clinton.

01:39:18.586 --> 01:39:22.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he pushed her and pushed
and pushed the entire time.

01:39:22.423 --> 01:39:27.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He interrupted, he stalked her
at points, walking around the
stage, but he wanted to

01:39:27.995 --> 01:39:31.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make sure that no one was going
to walk away from this debate
saying he didn't take his

01:39:31.232 --> 01:39:36.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opportunities to raise the
questions about Benghazi, about
emails, about any other issue

01:39:36.237 --> 01:39:38.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that he didn't raise
in the first debate.

01:39:38.506 --> 01:39:43.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But to the question, Judy, of
whether it matters or not, I do
not believe that it does.

01:39:43.344 --> 01:39:47.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that what he also did,
which is what I feel like we've
been sitting around this

01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:50.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
table talking about since this
summer is he's talking to the 40
percent of the people who

are already with him.

01:39:52.954 --> 01:39:57.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the base, who show up at

talking about, he loves talking

01:39:57.525 --> 01:40:00.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to, will be very happy with
this debate performance.

01:40:00.995 --> 01:40:07.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you are in suburban
Philadelphia, if you are an
independent voter, if you are a

01:40:07.301 --> 01:40:11.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
woman, the voters right now that
he needs, he's not winning, I
don't think they move

01:40:11.706 --> 01:40:14.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

began with what Paul Ryan

01:40:19.413 --> 01:40:22.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this weekend called the elephant
in the room, which is the
question about the videotape,

01:40:22.183 --> 01:40:25.186 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the "Access
Hollywood" videotape.

01:40:25.186 --> 01:40:27.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And after about -- I counted
four-and-a-half minutes of
niceties, they went immediately

01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:30.258 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to that.

01:40:30.258 --> 01:40:31.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's listen to that for a
moment, then I want you to talk
about it on the other side.

locker room talk.

01:40:34.996 --> 01:40:36.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm not proud of it.

01:40:36.831 --> 01:40:38.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I apologized to my family.

01:40:38.599 --> 01:40:40.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I apologized to the
American people.

01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:43.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Certainly I'm not proud of it.

01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:49.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: What we all saw and
heard on Friday was Donald
talking about women.

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:51.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What he thinks about women.

01:40:51.846 --> 01:40:54.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What he does to women.

01:40:54.749 --> 01:41:00.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he has said that the video
doesn't represent who he is.

01:41:00.588 --> 01:41:05.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think it's clear to anyone
who heard it that it represents
exactly who he is.

01:41:05.493 --> 01:41:06.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: It's just words, folks.

01:41:06.761 --> 01:41:09.363 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's just words.

01:41:09.363 --> 01:41:10.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those words I've been hearing
them for many years.

01:41:12.133 --> 01:41:13.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Just words, David.

01:41:13.834 --> 01:41:16.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROOKS: Well, that was her
best answer of the night.

01:41:16.437 --> 01:41:19.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it was one of her few
good answers I thought.

01:41:19.473 --> 01:41:21.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is a guy with
vulnerabilities coming out of
every angle, and she missed a
lot of

01:41:21.909 --> 01:41:24.545 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:27.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a guy who just lost 40
House congressional Republicans,
she can't point that out that

01:41:27.048 --> 01:41:29.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his campaign is in free fall?

01:41:29.150 --> 01:41:32.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I thought he says things that
we've never heard before.

01:41:32.453 --> 01:41:34.188 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Saying she has
hate in her heart.

01:41:34.188 --> 01:41:35.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What presidential
candidate has said that?

01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:37.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That he wants to appoint
a special prosecutor?

01:41:37.091 --> 01:41:38.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're in uncharted territory.

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:41.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: That she should be
in jail, that's she devil.

01:41:41.796 --> 01:41:46.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROOKS: But I thought the bottom
line, how people and especially
some of the swing sweaters,

01:41:46.467 --> 01:41:50.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if there are any left, that Amy
talked about, will look at the
mafioso-type stalking, how

01:41:50.805 --> 01:41:53.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they look at that body language
will determine a lot of their
reactions.

01:41:53.407 --> 01:41:58.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But my bottom line right now for
this debate is he halted the
free fall.

01:41:58.079 --> 01:42:02.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That it will be -- the
Republicans who were leaving him
will stop leaving him.

01:42:02.316 --> 01:42:05.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because he will have rallied the
people that really dislike
Hillary Clinton, he took it

01:42:05.886 --> 01:42:09.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to her, he took it to her with
energy and focus, and so at
least he has not won anybody

01:42:09.757 --> 01:42:12.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
else over, but he
stopped the slide.

01:42:12.793 --> 01:42:18.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, Mark Shields, he
stopped the bleeding, stopped
the departure of these
Republicans?

01:42:18.399 --> 01:42:20.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHIELDS: Well, he stopped a
Republican revolt that Dave is
talking about, 40 Republican

01:42:20.267 --> 01:42:23.170 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
members.

01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:27.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one after -- I mean, John
Thune of South Dakota, third in
Republican leadership in

01:42:27.942 --> 01:42:32.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Senate, I mean, these are
not people who are -- the
nervous nellies who bail on
Republicans

01:42:32.113 --> 01:42:34.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when they're in trouble.

01:42:34.515 --> 01:42:39.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is what I think, he was
talking to their constituencies,
the constituencies of the

01:42:39.553 --> 01:42:42.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans who are going to be
on the phone tomorrow, the House
Republicans.

01:42:42.323 --> 01:42:45.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And say, well, gee, do I
really want to alienate?

01:42:45.626 --> 01:42:49.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do I -- can we just pretend
that this didn't happen?

01:42:49.330 --> 01:42:53.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, this is a man, this is
the first time a major party
nominee has a billionaire
running

01:42:53.401 --> 01:42:57.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for president who just admitted
in a debate that he paid no
federal income tax for 20

01:42:57.238 --> 01:42:58.973 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

01:42:58.973 --> 01:43:00.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, and just kind
of glossed over it.

01:43:00.908 --> 01:43:03.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's a man without an
embarrassment gene.

01:43:03.844 --> 01:43:09.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was amazed he showed up
tonight and he just kind of
glossed over what -- that whole
tape.

01:43:09.083 --> 01:43:13.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, he is really something
we've never seen before in a
presidential candidate.

Hey, John.

JOHN YANG, NEWSHOUR

01:43:30.938 --> 01:43:36.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is -- we're here with Boris

adviser to the Trump campaign.

01:43:36.877 --> 01:43:41.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Epshteyn, what did Donald
Trump do tonight to stop this
slide he has had over the past

01:43:41.415 --> 01:43:43.584 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two weeks?

01:43:43.584 --> 01:43:43.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BORIS EPSHTEYN, TRUMP CAMPAIGN
SENIOR ADVISER: It was a strong
night.

01:43:43.551 --> 01:43:44.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was in control.

01:43:44.852 --> 01:43:45.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was determined.

01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:47.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was presidential.

01:43:47.321 --> 01:43:50.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He won this debate
fair and square.

01:43:50.758 --> 01:43:53.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a home run even though
moderators did not treat him
fairly at all, they interrupted

01:43:53.994 --> 01:43:57.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him about 25 more times than
they interrupted Hillary
Clinton.

01:43:57.631 --> 01:44:02.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Mr. Trump won this debate
hands down, and will move on
now, will go to the next

01:44:02.136 --> 01:44:05.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate in Las Vegas where he
will do great, and then win on
November 8th.

01:44:05.139 --> 01:44:09.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANG: How do you think did he on
the question about foreign
policy, the question about
Syria?

01:44:09.543 --> 01:44:14.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was asked about what his
strategy would be in Syria and
on Aleppo, he disagreed with

01:44:14.582 --> 01:44:16.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mike Pence, his running mate.

01:44:16.484 --> 01:44:20.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He said he hadn't
spoken to Mike Pence.

01:44:20.387 --> 01:44:22.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are we seeing some daylight
opening up between -- on this
ticket?

01:44:22.356 --> 01:44:23.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EPSHTEYN: Here is bottom line.

01:44:23.524 --> 01:44:25.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump has been
very consistent.

01:44:25.593 --> 01:44:28.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And from the beginning that we
need to fight is ISIS, deal with
Assad after.

01:44:28.195 --> 01:44:30.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We need to defeat ISIS.

01:44:30.364 --> 01:44:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eighty percent of people killed
by ISIS have been killed in the
last three years.

01:44:32.933 --> 01:44:34.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That needs to stop.

01:44:34.101 --> 01:44:35.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ISIS has to be defeated.

01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:39.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the Trump-Pence ticket is
absolutely united on that.

01:44:39.507 --> 01:44:42.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What Governor Pence was talking
about was the safe zones, making
sure that Syrians are

01:44:42.643 --> 01:44:44.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
protected in their own country.

01:44:44.612 --> 01:44:48.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that is absolutely a
priority for the Trump-Pence
ticket as well.

01:44:48.716 --> 01:44:53.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANG: But when he was asked
about the consequences would be
if Aleppo fell, he turned to
Mosul.

01:44:53.821 --> 01:44:58.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't seem to discuss
Syrian and Aleppo itself.

01:44:58.559 --> 01:45:00.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
EPSHTEYN: Here is the
key issue here, right?

01:45:00.761 --> 01:45:04.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The key issue is that because of
the failed policies of Hillary
Clinton and Barack Obama,

01:45:04.932 --> 01:45:07.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Syria is effectively
a failed state.

01:45:07.234 --> 01:45:09.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Libya is a failed state.

01:45:09.803 --> 01:45:15.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what the Clinton campaign is
trying to do is to distract
Americans from realizing

01:45:15.476 --> 01:45:17.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Hillary Clinton is the one
at fault for what is going on in
Syria.

01:45:17.778 --> 01:45:20.948 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
So how could she
possibly fix it?

01:45:20.948 --> 01:45:24.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Donald Trump will do is
ensure safe zones in Syria so
Syrian refugees are safe in
their

01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:26.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own country.

01:45:26.787 --> 01:45:30.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he will fight ISIS first and
then deal with Assad and making
sure that Syria is no

01:45:30.724 --> 01:45:32.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
longer a failed state after.

01:45:32.326 --> 01:45:34.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
YANG: We've got to
leave it there.

01:45:40.768 --> 01:45:44.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:48.008 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of this.

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:49.410 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Lisa, what have
you been hearing?

01:45:49.410 --> 01:45:51.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS, NEWSHOUR
CORRESPONDENT: That's right.

01:45:51.011 --> 01:45:52.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many claims, many words in this
debate, but let's talk start
with two different claims

01:45:52.179 --> 01:45:54.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about Hillary Clinton's emails.

01:45:54.848 --> 01:45:59.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, Donald Trump, and his
claim during this debate that
Hillary Clinton deleted those

01:45:59.453 --> 01:46:05.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
33,000 infamous emails after she
received a subpoena to hand them
over.

01:46:05.292 --> 01:46:08.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we looked into this, and
like many things that the
Clinton emails, the answer is a
little

01:46:08.162 --> 01:46:10.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
complicated.

01:46:10.698 --> 01:46:14.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton's staff
overseeing the email server
ordered those emails to be
deleted

01:46:14.068 --> 01:46:17.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in December of 2014.

01:46:17.004 --> 01:46:19.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The subpoena was actually
handed out three months later.

01:46:19.707 --> 01:46:21.542 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But here is what
they say happened.

01:46:21.542 --> 01:46:25.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They say a worker at the IT
company forgot to delete them.

01:46:25.846 --> 01:46:29.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That worker has claimed
responsibility and said he did
delete them after the subpoena.

01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:33.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But here is the thing, guys, the
order was given before the
subpoena.

01:46:33.587 --> 01:46:37.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So Clinton herself says she has
nothing to do with those
deletions, so Donald Trump not

01:46:37.491 --> 01:46:40.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
accurate on that point exactly.

01:46:40.894 --> 01:46:45.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then Clinton, she also spoke
about those emails, she said
this quote that stuck out,

01:46:45.199 --> 01:46:50.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she said she takes classified
materials very seriously and
always has.

01:46:50.971 --> 01:46:56.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But of course the FBI in its
investigation, while finding no
wrongdoing, no criminal problems

01:46:56.277 --> 01:46:59.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Hillary Clinton's email
server, did find that she and
her staff were extremely

01:46:59.546 --> 01:47:01.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
careless of classified
information.

01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:06.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you know if you read deep
into the FBI's report once the
whole thing came out, it was

01:47:06.253 --> 01:47:10.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clear that Hillary Clinton
repeatedly said she did not
receive training nor did she
spend

01:47:10.424 --> 01:47:14.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time trying to get that training
to be on classified materials.

01:47:14.595 --> 01:47:18.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said she expected her staff
to know what to do with
classified materials.

01:47:18.932 --> 01:47:22.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the real question there about
how she looked at classified
materials even though she claims

01:47:22.436 --> 01:47:25.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
she took it very seriously.

01:47:25.105 --> 01:47:28.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one more, we don't have
graphic for this because we've
been working right up to the

01:47:28.776 --> 01:47:32.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minute, Donald Trump claimed,
and I want to read basically his
quote, he claimed that

01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:38.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
inner city poverty, he said, is
45 percent poverty, quote,
"African-Americans now 45

01:47:38.619 --> 01:47:40.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
percent poverty in
the inner cities."

01:47:40.854 --> 01:47:43.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That number jumped out
to us right away.

01:47:43.324 --> 01:47:46.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And of course our Quinn Bowman
(ph) jumped on the U.S. Census
site.

01:47:46.927 --> 01:47:51.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And right now the U.S. Census
says African-American poverty
overall about 24 percent.

01:47:51.965 --> 01:47:55.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's nowhere near 45 percent.

01:47:55.069 --> 01:47:58.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We can't find anywhere that sort
of backs up that number of 45
percent poverty rate

01:47:58.272 --> 01:48:00.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the inner cities.

01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:04.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's possible trump was
confusing a number he quotes
often on the campaign trail,
which

01:48:04.311 --> 01:48:08.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is poverty rates for
African-American children.

01:48:08.082 --> 01:48:11.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we can't find anything to
substantiate this claim of so
much poverty in the
African-American

01:48:11.352 --> 01:48:13.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
community -- Gwen, Judy.

01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:17.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: That is great work, thank
you, Lisa, for keeping us clear.

01:48:17.524 --> 01:48:19.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very clear that these
candidates all come with their
goals, the things that they

01:48:19.626 --> 01:48:21.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have come to say.

01:48:21.862 --> 01:48:25.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For instance, we saw -- we just
heard what both of them came to
say about emails and

01:48:25.599 --> 01:48:28.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about poverty, even though
he wasn't asked about that.

01:48:28.235 --> 01:48:31.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in fact, they got to emails
before they were asked about it.

01:48:31.105 --> 01:48:35.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I also was very interested
to see what Donald Trump came to
say about Hillary Clinton,

01:48:35.909 --> 01:48:40.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to follow up in your point
earlier, he was asked about
whether she -- I can't remember

01:48:40.781 --> 01:48:43.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the question was, but his
answer was, she's all talk no
action.

01:48:43.384 --> 01:48:44.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let's listen.

01:48:44.518 --> 01:48:47.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:51.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Thirty years she has been
doing this, Anderson, I say it
all the time.

01:48:51.158 --> 01:48:52.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She talks about health care, why
didn't she do something about
it?

01:48:52.659 --> 01:48:54.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She talks about taxes.

01:48:54.595 --> 01:48:56.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why didn't she do
something about it?

01:48:56.964 --> 01:49:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She doesn't do anything about
anything other than talk.

01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:03.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
With her, it's all
talk and no action.

01:49:03.637 --> 01:49:08.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She has made bad judgments
on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.

01:49:08.642 --> 01:49:14.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, her and Obama, whether
you like it or not, the way they
got out of Iraq, the

01:49:14.014 --> 01:49:17.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vacuum they left, that's why
ISIS formed in the first place.

01:49:17.885 --> 01:49:22.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They started from that little
area now they're in 32 different
nations.

01:49:22.022 --> 01:49:23.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hillary, congratulations.

01:49:23.457 --> 01:49:24.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Great job.

01:49:24.491 --> 01:49:26.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEO CLIP)

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:29.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Amy, this is something
that Donald Trump used in the
first debate.

01:49:29.096 --> 01:49:32.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Didn't get as much I think play,
he went on longer at this point.

01:49:32.132 --> 01:49:35.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is a tough one to
come back on, isn't it?

01:49:35.202 --> 01:49:41.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER: Yes, it is the message
that Donald Trump should be
pushing forward, it's message

01:49:41.008 --> 01:49:45.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that any Republican would be
pushing forward right now and
probably doing so more
effectively

01:49:45.712 --> 01:49:49.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
because we wouldn't be
distracted by that person's own
problems that they keep having

01:49:49.349 --> 01:49:52.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get out of.

01:49:52.219 --> 01:49:55.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is the fundamental question
of this election, when we
started it, the question was, do
Americans

01:49:55.956 --> 01:49:59.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to see change or do they
want to stick with the status
quo?

01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:03.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what's interesting, if you
look at the way that these
questions are asked in polling,

01:50:03.297 --> 01:50:07.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Wall Street Journal poll,
NBC poll asked this question
starting in May, do you want

01:50:07.568 --> 01:50:10.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
change, even if it's
unpredictable versus staying the
same even if it doesn't bring

01:50:10.471 --> 01:50:12.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about change.

01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:16.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was in the 50s through May
and July, it went back down to
49 percent in this most

01:50:16.610 --> 01:50:19.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
recent poll in September.

01:50:19.813 --> 01:50:25.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think what Hillary
Clinton's -- and actually Donald
Trump has helped her do this,

01:50:25.352 --> 01:50:31.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is to make the case that you
maybe want change, maybe I am
the status quo, I am part of
everything

01:50:31.725 --> 01:50:36.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that right now so many voters
say they are pushing back
against, but this person is not

01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:38.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the right person to
deliver that change.

01:50:38.198 --> 01:50:40.701 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's not stable.

01:50:40.701 --> 01:50:43.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IFILL: Let's talk a little bit
about style points, because
unlike the first debate, and

01:50:43.237 --> 01:50:48.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like vice presidential debate,
what we saw were a town hall
debate where people were

01:50:48.141 --> 01:50:51.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asking questions about -- they
got through about eight
questions from voters I think.

01:50:51.845 --> 01:50:55.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at one point Hillary Clinton
would walk over, for instance,
when the young woman asked

01:50:55.182 --> 01:50:57.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about Muslims being
discriminated against.

01:50:57.084 --> 01:50:58.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And she would speak
directly to her.

01:50:58.652 --> 01:51:00.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He didn't as often.

01:51:00.988 --> 01:51:05.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as you pointed out, David,
sometimes it felt like he was
stalking.

01:51:05.058 --> 01:51:09.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROOKS: Yes, and so, we ve seen
sort of a temperamental choice
for the American people.

01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the one hand, she was lot
better at relationally (ph), she
was also a lot better, I thought

01:51:12.466 --> 01:51:15.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her the cut-away shots, her
listening shots were good.

01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:20.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Very strong, not intimidated by
any means, but not taking him
too seriously.

01:51:20.474 --> 01:51:23.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So I thought in the body
language, and I really emphasize
the visuals in these debates,
that

01:51:23.277 --> 01:51:24.611 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was very strong.

01:51:24.611 --> 01:51:27.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He looked like a bully.

01:51:27.614 --> 01:51:30.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand there might be
some people who say, it s time
for a bully.

01:51:30.717 --> 01:51:34.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the question is whether they
can stand looking at him for
four years.

01:51:34.187 --> 01:51:36.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, I think a lot of people,
especially people who are
undecided, may have decided

01:51:36.557 --> 01:51:40.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it s just too unpleasant.

01:51:40.227 --> 01:51:42.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the question, a crucial
question will be, I think
everyone is dispirited by this

01:51:42.563 --> 01:51:43.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
debate, as Mark said.

01:51:43.697 --> 01:51:44.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It s just hard to sit through.

01:51:44.798 --> 01:51:46.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It s very ugly.

01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:49.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It just makes you depressed
for the country.

01:51:49.803 --> 01:51:53.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But will they say that Donald
Trump s fault or will they say
that s both of them?

01:51:53.273 --> 01:51:56.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there s a lot of that s both
of them out there right now.

01:51:56.310 --> 01:52:00.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And, Mark, you know,
just pick up on that, because we
are in at a unprecedented

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:01.982 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

01:52:01.982 --> 01:52:05.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We ve talked about it
over and over again.

01:52:05.052 --> 01:52:08.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We ve never seen some of the
language, some of the stories
that we re hearing, some

01:52:08.121 --> 01:52:10.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the charges that
we re hearing.

01:52:10.857 --> 01:52:14.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do people just have that to look
forward to for the next four
weeks no matter how much

01:52:14.861 --> 01:52:17.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they talk about the
issues at these debates?

01:52:17.264 --> 01:52:20.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHIELDS: Well, yes no, I think
we saw it tonight Donald Trump s
strategy was just

01:52:20.634 --> 01:52:22.402 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
scorched earth.

01:52:22.402 --> 01:52:24.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, that s exactly what
it is from here on in.

01:52:24.671 --> 01:52:26.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, you think The
Jerry Springer Show

01:52:26.773 --> 01:52:28.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IFILL: And why not?

01:52:28.542 --> 01:52:29.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHIELDS: You think The Jerry
Springer Show is tasteless?

01:52:29.776 --> 01:52:33.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, this is The Jerry
Springer Show of politics.

01:52:33.747 --> 01:52:39.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you mention about
hatred, I mean, for somebody to
have the chutzpah to sit there,

01:52:39.386 --> 01:52:45.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, when Muslim-American
woman asks about feeling
animosity towards her, you know,

01:52:45.092 --> 01:52:49.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he says, you re right about
Islamophobia, and that s a
shame, says the merchant of

01:52:49.630 --> 01:52:53.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
malice himself, I mean,
it was just remarkable.

01:52:53.834 --> 01:52:57.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I didn t think I thought
he did trade well the first
time.

01:52:57.738 --> 01:53:00.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he did emails well tonight.

01:53:00.641 --> 01:53:05.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I thought she was very
much on the defensive about the
emails.

01:53:05.012 --> 01:53:09.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I didn t I don t think she
has a satisfactory answer,
convincing answer on

01:53:09.049 --> 01:53:11.551 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the emails.

01:53:11.551 --> 01:53:13.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IFILL: Well, and she was also on
the defensive about the new
WikiLeaks that came out about

01:53:13.754 --> 01:53:15.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her private speeches.

01:53:15.222 --> 01:53:16.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SHIELDS: And he didn t
take advantage of that.

01:53:16.223 --> 01:53:18.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IFILL: No, he didn t.

01:53:18.558 --> 01:53:20.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I had to say, it was my
favorite answer of the night, I
didn t think Steven Spielberg

01:53:20.627 --> 01:53:22.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would ever be invoked at
a presidential debate.

01:53:22.262 --> 01:53:23.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: The movie Lincoln.

01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:24.031 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
IFILL: The movie
Lincoln, inspiration

01:53:24.031 --> 01:53:25.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:53:25.666 --> 01:53:26.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: for having
two points of view.

01:53:26.033 --> 01:53:28.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALTER: Yes.

01:53:28.435 --> 01:53:33.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, I think though this race,
to the points made here, it s
sort of now frozen where

01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:36.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we started.

01:53:36.009 --> 01:53:40.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if there s not a free
fall, I agree that it may be
stopped, but the fact is, there

01:53:40.013 --> 01:53:42.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are still a significant number
of Republicans that have said
publicly that they re not

01:53:42.349 --> 01:53:44.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with him.

01:53:44.451 --> 01:53:50.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don t know that any party has
ever won an election being this
divided.

01:53:50.023 --> 01:53:53.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And his ability, it s not about
getting those people back, he
has got to figure out

01:53:53.994 --> 01:53:59.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how to make sure that they come
to the polls for the bottom of
the ticket.

01:53:59.599 --> 01:54:03.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That s what so many Senate and
House candidates are worried
about, it s that those folks

01:54:03.837 --> 01:54:05.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are saying, I can t vote for
Donald Trump, but as David says,
I also don t like

01:54:05.772 --> 01:54:08.408 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her.

01:54:08.408 --> 01:54:12.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That they just stay home, and
that is very problematic for
Senate and House candidates

01:54:12.179 --> 01:54:14.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the Republican side.

01:54:14.548 --> 01:54:18.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: We did have
acknowledgment, the question is,
is it baked in?

01:54:18.018 --> 01:54:21.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But tonight Donald Trump did
acknowledge that he isn t paying
taxes.

01:54:21.621 --> 01:54:24.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, we don t he wouldn t
say how many years, David, but
it is kind of remarkable.

01:54:24.725 --> 01:54:26.960 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
BROOKS: Yes.

01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:30.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, again, he s trading on
distrust and cynicism and hatred
of government.

01:54:30.063 --> 01:54:31.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the people who hate
government will think, way to
go, I would have done that if

01:54:31.298 --> 01:54:33.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I could.

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:38.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a lot of people will think,
well, the common good outweighs
the selfish interest.

01:54:38.105 --> 01:54:39.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IFILL: Shall we go back all the
way to something that happened
at the very beginning of this

01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:42.442 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
evening.

01:54:42.442 --> 01:54:44.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I wonder whether you think
it was mind game and whether it
was effective, that before

01:54:44.444 --> 01:54:49.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the debate even began, Donald
Trump brought reporters and
introduced them to four women

01:54:49.282 --> 01:54:52.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who have made charges against
the Clintons, three against Bill
Clinton in particular.

01:54:52.452 --> 01:54:55.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they then brought
seated in the hall.

01:54:55.355 --> 01:54:58.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He even referenced them during
the debate at one point.

01:54:58.625 --> 01:55:04.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Was that something which was
clever or kind of icky, Mark?

01:55:04.197 --> 01:55:10.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHIELDS: Well, I mean, clever in
the sense that he was he s
reaching to the hardcore

01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:13.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans, the organizing
principle of which is they hate
the Clintons.

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:15.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They hate Hillary Clinton.

01:55:15.675 --> 01:55:16.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They hate Bill Clinton.

01:55:16.977 --> 01:55:19.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that is what it is.

01:55:19.246 --> 01:55:24.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I am the one tribune in this
race and I m not afraid to take
them on.

01:55:24.951 --> 01:55:28.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was to me that was
about stopping the hemorrhaging
of support that we ve talked

01:55:28.054 --> 01:55:30.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about of Republicans this week.

01:55:30.991 --> 01:55:32.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But icky?

01:55:32.025 --> 01:55:33.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely icky.

01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:38.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALTER: Yes, I definitely
found the ice factor there.

01:55:38.498 --> 01:55:42.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, you know, this is a guy who
is the master of reality
television.

01:55:42.636 --> 01:55:48.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he created, before this
debate even began, more drama
around himself and the focus
the

01:55:48.909 --> 01:55:52.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interesting thing about this
entire debate was it was a town
hall with the goal of, you

01:55:52.979 --> 01:55:56.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get to talk to actual voters and
they get to have their concerns
put forward.

01:55:56.650 --> 01:56:01.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At no point did it feel like
regular people had their voices
heard.

01:56:01.121 --> 01:56:02.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At no point did it feel like we
were talking about anything
other than a grudge match.

01:56:02.656 --> 01:56:05.125 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
IFILL: OK.

01:56:05.125 --> 01:56:08.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, we are unfortunately we
had hoped to talk to some folks
from the Clinton campaign

01:56:08.061 --> 01:56:09.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out there in St. Louis tonight.

01:56:09.462 --> 01:56:11.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we weren t able to do it.

01:56:11.998 --> 01:56:13.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that concludes our coverage,
we ll get to more tomorrow, of
the second presidential

01:56:13.567 --> 01:56:15.001 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debate.

01:56:15.001 --> 01:56:16.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But there is much more online.

01:56:16.303 --> 01:56:19.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
