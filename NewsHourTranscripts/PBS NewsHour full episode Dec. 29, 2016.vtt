HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.

00:05.505 --> 00:06.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:08.475 --> 00:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
Obama administration
strikes back, issuing new
sanctions against

00:11.812 --> 00:14.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia for meddling in the U.S.
election.

00:14.948 --> 00:19.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Also ahead, a new Syrian
cease-fire is struck,
this time without U.S. input.

00:19.453 --> 00:24.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can the deal hold, bringing the
end of a bloody
six-year civil war?

00:24.291 --> 00:28.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, the best of 2016, the
movies that got
all the buzz, and the gems that
were overlooked.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT, Film Critic,
Pacifica Radio:
You see things you have seen
things many times

00:32.933 --> 00:39.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before, but it's told so much
better and so
well, that it really -- it sort
of puts you

00:39.139 --> 00:40.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
under a spell.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:42.276 --> 00:46.546 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:46.580 --> 00:58.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The White
House has stated
that Russian hackers tried to
sway the U.S.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
presidential race.

01:00.661 --> 01:04.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now it's laid out the
punishment, targeting
key leaders and agencies in
Moscow.

01:04.998 --> 01:09.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The word came from Hawaii, where
the president
is vacationing.

01:09.136 --> 01:11.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Kremlin had been waiting and
watching.

01:11.338 --> 01:13.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, the White House ended the
waiting.

01:14.007 --> 01:18.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama announced a
range of retaliation
for election meddling that the
U.S. blames

01:18.879 --> 01:21.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on top levels of the Russian
government.

01:21.148 --> 01:25.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It includes sanctions on Russian
intelligence
services and on top officials in
the unit

01:26.019 --> 01:31.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that ordered the hacks, and
expulsions of
35 Russian diplomats within 72
hours.

01:31.858 --> 01:37.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both the CIA and the FBI have
concluded that
Russia hacked Democratic groups
and the e-mails

01:37.664 --> 01:41.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of John Podesta, the chairman of
Hillary Clinton's
campaign.

01:41.702 --> 01:46.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Obama called today's
retaliation -- quote
-- "a necessary and appropriate
response,

01:46.540 --> 01:51.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just to the hacking, but to
aggressive
harassment of U.S. officials in
Moscow."

01:51.278 --> 01:56.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also said the U.S. may take
other actions
at a time and place of its
choosing, some

01:56.883 --> 01:59.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of which will not be publicized.

01:59.686 --> 02:03.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Trump has played
down the
hacking, as he did again last
night.

02:03.290 --> 02:07.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: I think
we ought to get on with our
lives.

02:07.494 --> 02:10.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that computers have
complicated lives
very greatly.

02:10.230 --> 02:15.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The whole age of computer has
made it where
nobody knows exactly what is
going on.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Moscow today
dismissed the
U.S. announcement.

02:17.804 --> 02:22.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A spokesman for President
Vladimir Putin said
he regrets the move and will
consider countermeasures

02:22.709 --> 02:24.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of his own.

02:24.578 --> 02:28.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the meantime, a U.S.
government report
detailing Russian meddling in
American elections

02:28.749 --> 02:31.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is due out in the coming days.

02:31.918 --> 02:35.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Several top Republicans in
Congress said the
president's sanctions are
overdue.

02:35.422 --> 02:37.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They plan to push for tougher
action.

02:37.290 --> 02:41.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will hear from the top
homeland security
official at the White House
after the news

02:41.294 --> 02:42.829 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. had no role in the
day's second major
development, but Russia did.

02:46.033 --> 02:49.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was the announcement of a
nationwide cease-fire
in Syria.

02:49.469 --> 02:53.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The truce officially took effect
at midnight
local time, and most rebel
groups signaled

02:53.240 --> 02:54.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they'd accept it.

02:54.574 --> 02:57.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A full report later in the
program.

02:57.811 --> 03:02.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Iraqi
security forces
launched the second phase of
their offensive

03:02.049 --> 03:04.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to retake Mosul from the Islamic
State group.

03:04.584 --> 03:08.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new assault focused on
several eastern
neighborhoods in the country's
second largest

03:08.155 --> 03:09.956 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
city.

03:09.990 --> 03:13.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Smoke could be seen rising above
the skyline
as elite special forces and army
troops fought

03:13.260 --> 03:15.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their way deeper into the city.

03:15.429 --> 03:19.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the last major stronghold
for ISIS in
Iraq.

03:19.232 --> 03:23.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia's military says flight
recorders show
no evidence of an explosion on a
transport

03:23.837 --> 03:26.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plane that crashed in the Black
Sea.

03:26.206 --> 03:31.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as workers pulled out more
wreckage today,
a Russian general in Moscow said
investigators

03:31.278 --> 03:34.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have not ruled out a terrorist
act.

03:34.214 --> 03:39.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Other
than an explosion
on board, there could have been
some mechanical

03:39.719 --> 03:40.854 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
impact.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A terror attack doesn't always
involve an
explosion.

03:43.056 --> 03:47.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The flight was quite normal, but
one of the
pilots' sentences and an
analysis of it tell

03:47.561 --> 03:51.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us about the beginning of a
special situation,
about the beginning of it
developing and nothing

03:51.898 --> 03:53.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
else yet.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The general
offered no detail
on what that special situation
involved.

03:56.837 --> 04:01.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier in the week, the main
Russian intelligence
agency had dismissed terrorism
as a possible

04:01.408 --> 04:02.375 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cause.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The crash killed all 92 people
on board.

04:04.578 --> 04:09.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Germany, officials have
released a man
they detained yesterday in last
week's Berlin

04:09.316 --> 04:11.151 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
truck attack.

04:11.184 --> 04:14.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prosecutors had said his phone
number was
found in the phone of the
attack's main suspect,

04:14.588 --> 04:15.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Anis Amri.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was killed last week in
Italy.

04:17.157 --> 04:21.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, authorities said the man
wasn't in
contact with Amri after all.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, Wall
Street struggled
again.

04:23.964 --> 04:27.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
was down
about 14 points to close below
19820.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell six points, and
the S&amp;P 500
lost a fraction.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the death of actress Debbie
Reynolds left
generations of fans stunned
today.

04:31.905 --> 04:32.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
News of her passing came last
night, just
24 hours after her daughter,
Carrie Fisher,

04:32.272 --> 04:33.273 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had died.

04:33.306 --> 04:35.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown looks at Reynolds'
life and
career.

04:35.175 --> 04:36.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Debbie Reynolds
was just 19
in 1952 when she appeared
alongside Gene Kelly

04:36.176 --> 04:37.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Donald O'Connor in "Singin'
in the Rain."

04:37.844 --> 04:38.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She later told the American Film
Institute
she simply didn't know enough to
fear the

04:38.211 --> 04:39.980 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
challenge.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBBIE REYNOLDS, Actress: You
know, I was
so dumb, and I didn't feel you
could fail.

04:41.815 --> 04:42.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I felt it was me, and I really
just marched
straight ahead and I wasn't
frightened of

04:42.249 --> 04:42.749 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the huge task.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I had never danced.

04:44.651 --> 04:46.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Reynolds would
act, sing and
dance her way through the
decades, in films

04:46.453 --> 04:48.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like "Tammy and the Bachelor,"
"How the West
Was Won," and 1964's "The
Unsinkable Molly

04:48.155 --> 04:49.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brown," a rags-to-riches tale
that would earn
Reynolds her only Oscar
nomination.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She may have been just as famous
for her personal
life, most of all her 1955
marriage to the

04:51.825 --> 04:52.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pop music idol Eddie Fisher, and
their divorce
amid his affair and then
marriage to Elizabeth

04:52.125 --> 04:53.360 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Taylor.

04:53.393 --> 04:55.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But her career continued in
films like "The
Singing Nun."

04:55.262 --> 04:56.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in 1973, she introduced
herself to younger
generations as the voice of
Charlotte in a

04:56.096 --> 04:57.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
film version of "Charlotte's
Web."

04:57.864 --> 04:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the 1990s, Reynolds played
the titular
role in "Mother," opposite
Albert Brooks.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she appeared on sitcoms,
including "Will
&amp; Grace," and more movies until
just recently.

05:01.501 --> 05:01.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the 2015 Screen Actors Guild
Awards, her
daughter presented Reynolds with
the lifetime

05:02.002 --> 05:03.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
achievement award.

05:03.503 --> 05:04.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEBBIE REYNOLDS: And my favorite
movie was
"The Unsinkable Molly Brown."

05:04.404 --> 05:04.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I had a lot of fun doing
that.

05:04.771 --> 05:06.406 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

05:06.439 --> 05:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBBIE REYNOLDS: And in that
movie, I got
to sing a wonderful song called,
"I Ain't

05:06.807 --> 05:07.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Down Yet."

05:07.240 --> 05:08.308 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Well, I ain't.

05:08.341 --> 05:08.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thank you all very much for this
wonderful
honor.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:10.844 --> 05:11.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yesterday,
Reynolds suffered
a stroke and was rushed to a Los
Angeles hospital,

05:11.278 --> 05:12.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
where she died.

05:12.078 --> 05:14.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Debbie Reynolds was 84 years
old.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
the U.S. retaliates against
Russia for cyber-hacks

05:16.016 --> 05:17.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leading up to the election; will
a Russian-brokered
cease-fire help end the Syrian
civil war?;

05:17.551 --> 05:19.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the global economic outlook of a
newly tapped
Trump adviser; and much more.

05:19.452 --> 05:20.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now: the administration's
imposition of sanctions
against Russia for trying to
influence the

05:20.353 --> 05:22.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vote during the presidential
election.

05:22.055 --> 05:22.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke earlier today with Lisa
Monaco, the
assistant to President Obama for
homeland

05:22.756 --> 05:24.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
security and counterterrorism.

05:24.357 --> 05:26.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I began our conversation asking
her about
the impact of these new
sanctions.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA MONACO, Chief White House
Counterterrorism
Adviser: So, the impact is to
make clear that

05:28.128 --> 05:28.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we are imposing consequences for
Russian aggression
and their interference, their
attempts to

05:28.929 --> 05:30.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interfere in our political
process.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Specifically, the impact is for
the individuals
who have been sanctioned.

05:32.199 --> 05:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It imposes a travel ban and
inhibits anybody
from doing and bars anybody from
conducting

05:37.871 --> 05:39.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
financial transactions with
them.

05:39.906 --> 05:45.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Importantly, also, what we often
see is the
international financial system
and European

05:45.445 --> 05:50.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
banks and others from -- who
will take steps
to follow our lead when we take
these types

05:50.450 --> 05:53.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of actions, so it can have a
ripple effect
and impose some real
consequences.

05:53.687 --> 05:58.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now,
considering that these
are the actions that you have
decided to publicize,

05:58.592 --> 06:03.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are these enough of a
proportionate response
to Russian meddling in the U.S.
election?

06:03.730 --> 06:08.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA MONACO: Well, look, I think
we should
always be asking the question,
are we hitting

06:08.068 --> 06:09.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the right balance?

06:09.869 --> 06:14.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have decided to take
these actions
quite deliberately, and we have
done so with

06:14.774 --> 06:18.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
precision, consistent with
what's going to
be in our national interest and
consistent

06:18.612 --> 06:21.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with what's going to protect our
national
security.

06:21.615 --> 06:25.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I think you really should
be very clear
about is the actions taken today
are done

06:26.019 --> 06:32.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in response to a range of
Russian aggressive
behavior, both harassment and
mistreatment

06:32.325 --> 06:37.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our personnel in Moscow, and,
of course,
the accomplishes
cyber-activities against

06:37.664 --> 06:40.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our -- and efforts to interfere
in our election
process.

06:40.700 --> 06:47.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But these actions today follow
very clear
steps that we took earlier this
year, the

06:47.140 --> 06:51.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unprecedented disclosure and
attribution to
the highest levels of the
Russian government.

06:51.911 --> 06:55.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was done in the statement
from the DNI
and from the secretary of
homeland security

06:55.915 --> 07:00.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back in October, making quite
clear that we
attribute the efforts to
interfere in our

07:00.387 --> 07:03.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
election to the Russian
government.

07:03.456 --> 07:09.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these actions today also
follow repeated
both public and private warnings
to the Russian

07:09.629 --> 07:12.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government, including at the
level of the
president.

07:12.499 --> 07:17.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these actions also follow
extensive outreach
to state and local governments
to shore up

07:17.404 --> 07:22.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their cyber-defenses ahead of
the election,
because, of course, we were
focused very keenly

07:23.009 --> 07:26.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on maintaining the integrity of
our election
process.

07:26.513 --> 07:30.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these are actions also
follow our extensive
briefing of Congress.

07:30.917 --> 07:35.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How much is
based on concern
that the incoming administration
might not

07:35.055 --> 07:36.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
take this step?

07:37.023 --> 07:42.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA MONACO: So, these actions
are taken deliberately,
as I said, and with precision,
and because

07:42.295 --> 07:47.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we feel it is very important to
make clear
both to Russia and to any other
actors that

07:47.801 --> 07:54.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there will be consequences for
violating norms
of international behavior, both
with respect

07:54.374 --> 07:58.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to mistreatment of our
diplomatic personnel
and with respect to malicious
cyber-activity.

07:58.945 --> 08:03.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You mentioned
in this long
report that there were
government organizations,

08:03.883 --> 08:07.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
critical infrastructure
entities, think tanks,
universities, political
organizations and

08:07.821 --> 08:10.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
corporations that were all
hacked.

08:10.190 --> 08:13.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So besides the DNC, who else was
hacked?

08:13.259 --> 08:15.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Was the RNC or were the
Republicans hacked
as well?

08:15.562 --> 08:19.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA MONACO: So, I will leave
that to the
intelligence and law enforcement
experts to

08:19.265 --> 08:23.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
detail in their reporting and in
their investigation,.

08:23.503 --> 08:29.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what you're referencing
there is the statement
that we have made already, both
from the intelligence

08:29.175 --> 08:35.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community and elsewhere, that
Russia has become
an increasingly aggressive
actor, and has

08:35.982 --> 08:43.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engaged in a years-long campaign
in influence
operations and malicious
cyber-activity across

08:43.089 --> 08:46.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a range of public and private
sector institutions.

08:46.292 --> 08:50.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, since you
have laid
out that you know who is doing
this, you know

08:50.663 --> 08:55.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how they're doing this, can you
say with any
certainty that either the hacks
have stopped

08:55.502 --> 08:57.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that we have defended
against them?

08:57.704 --> 09:03.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA MONACO: Well, what we did
over the summer
was to be very clear about what
the threat

09:03.410 --> 09:09.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, and we did that by briefing
both Congress
and state and local officials,
who, of course,

09:09.082 --> 09:13.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own and operate and manage the
electoral infrastructure
in this country.

09:13.987 --> 09:17.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we enabled them to take
steps to defend
themselves and provided them
assistance in

09:17.824 --> 09:20.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shoring up their defenses.

09:20.560 --> 09:27.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we also were very clear,
during the election
season and on Election Day, that
we were monitoring

09:27.500 --> 09:32.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and making sure that there had
not been an
increase in that malicious
activity, and we

09:32.839 --> 09:34.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
didn't see an increase.

09:34.674 --> 09:40.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, indeed, we are confident in
the outcome
that there wasn't a malicious
cyber-meddling,

09:41.014 --> 09:44.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
such that it affected the vote
count or the
voting operations.

09:44.651 --> 09:48.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, have all
of these think
tanks and universities and
important infrastructure

09:48.188 --> 09:52.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
entities, have they all been
alerted of the
types of attacks and what they
need to do?

09:52.525 --> 09:55.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And are we safer now that this
information
is out there?

09:55.428 --> 10:00.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA MONACO: I think one of the
steps we are
taking today in the responses
that we are

10:00.133 --> 10:04.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issuing is, very importantly, to
expose Russian
activity.

10:04.971 --> 10:10.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so one of the elements of
the announcement
that we made today is a report
by the Department

10:10.944 --> 10:15.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Homeland Security and the FBI
that provides
technical information that will
allow network

10:15.882 --> 10:20.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
defenders -- that's the owners
and the operators
of systems both in the public
and private

10:20.253 --> 10:23.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
sector -- to use that
information to defend
themselves.

10:23.656 --> 10:28.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're exposing the Russian
tactics, techniques
and procedures that they use to
infiltrate

10:28.995 --> 10:34.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our systems, allowing network
defenders to
defend themselves, and,
importantly, making

10:34.701 --> 10:40.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it harder and more complicated
for these malicious,
bad actors to undertake these
activities.

10:40.840 --> 10:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're basically forcing them to
reengineer
their approaches.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Lisa Monaco from
the White House, thanks so much.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA MONACO: Thank you.

10:48.615 --> 10:51.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This evening,
in a statement,
president-elect Trump said:
"It's time for

10:51.718 --> 10:54.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our country to move on to bigger
and better
things."

10:54.721 --> 10:58.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But he said that, in the
interests of the
nation, he will meet with
intelligence chiefs

10:58.458 --> 11:11.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
next week on the Russian
hacking.

11:11.571 --> 11:16.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Russians and Turks announced
a cease-fire
deal among some of the warring
parties in

11:16.209 --> 11:17.176 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It went into effect at midnight
in Damascus.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Margaret Warner has the story.

11:21.915 --> 11:27.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Confirmation
came from the
Kremlin and Russian President
Vladimir Putin:

11:27.420 --> 11:31.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): The agreements
reached are, of

11:32.025 --> 11:34.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
course, fragile and need special
attention.

11:34.160 --> 11:39.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is a notable result of
our joint
work and efforts by our partners
in the region.

11:39.232 --> 11:44.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: One of those
partners, Turkish
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan,
called it

11:44.103 --> 11:45.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an historic chance.

11:46.005 --> 11:49.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): We have an
opportunity to stop

11:49.576 --> 11:52.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bloodshed in Syria with a
political solution.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We must not squander this
chance.

11:54.280 --> 11:58.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Russia has been
a critical
backer of Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad,

11:58.585 --> 12:01.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
while Turkey had pressed for his
ouster.

12:01.154 --> 12:07.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they joined to work out this
cease-fire
and plans for future peace talks
in Kazakstan.

12:07.360 --> 12:12.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Russians say rebel groups
numbering more
than 60,000 fighters are taking
part.

12:12.098 --> 12:14.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They include the Western-backed
Free Syrian
Army.

12:14.701 --> 12:18.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OSAMA ABU ZAID, Free Syrian Army
(through
translator): During the talks,
the Russian

12:18.771 --> 12:23.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government guaranteed to us that
they will
keep the Syrian regime forces
and their allies

12:23.443 --> 12:25.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
under control.

12:25.244 --> 12:28.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Other groups
are excluded,
the Islamic State, which
controls a swathe

12:28.548 --> 12:34.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Syria, the al-Qaida offshoot
Jabhat Al-Fateh
Al-Sham in the northwest, and
the Kurdish

12:34.887 --> 12:40.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
militia YPG battling Islamic
State's forces
in cooperation with the U.S.

12:40.393 --> 12:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran is also a major ally of the
Assad government,
and is expected to be involved
in peace talks.

12:46.499 --> 12:51.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Absent entirely from the
negotiations, the
United States.

12:51.371 --> 12:55.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three years of talks between
Secretary of
State John Kerry and his Russian
counterpart,

12:55.975 --> 13:00.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sergei Lavrov, produced a number
of cease-fires,
but they didn't hold.

13:00.413 --> 13:06.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, 15 months ago, Russia
launched a
fierce bombing campaign to
bolster the Syrian

13:06.085 --> 13:07.587 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
regime.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier this month, the rebel
stronghold in
Eastern Aleppo finally fell.

13:11.858 --> 13:16.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Nonetheless, the State
Department voiced support
for the truce today, saying:
":Any effort

13:16.229 --> 13:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that stops the violence, saves
lives, and
creates the conditions for
political negotiations

13:21.601 --> 13:23.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would be welcome."

13:23.336 --> 13:27.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov
said today
the incoming Trump
administration would be

13:27.740 --> 13:29.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
welcome to join the peace talks
in Kazakstan.

13:29.909 --> 13:32.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: William
Brangham takes it
from here.

13:32.812 --> 13:37.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, will this
cease-fire
last, where so many others in
the past have

13:37.517 --> 13:39.452 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
failed?

13:39.485 --> 13:42.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, I'm joined now via
Skype from Tucson
by Andrew Tabler, who's a fellow
at the Washington

13:42.889 --> 13:47.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Institute for Near East Policy,
and Joshua
Landis, who directs the Center
for Middle

13:47.260 --> 13:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
East Studies at the University
of Oklahoma.

13:50.129 --> 13:51.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

13:51.764 --> 13:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joshua Landis, I would like to
start with
you first.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen cease-fires come
and we have
seen cease-fires go.

13:57.770 --> 14:00.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are you at all confident that
this one is
going to last?

14:00.239 --> 14:03.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA LANDIS, University of
Oklahoma: No,
I'm not confident.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is really not about the
cease-fire holding.

14:06.679 --> 14:12.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about Turkey being involved
with Russia
and Iran and essentially letting
the rebels

14:12.985 --> 14:21.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know that a new page has been
turned, that
Turkey cannot keep its -- cannot
keep its

14:21.127 --> 14:25.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
door open to the rebels, that
it's closing
the door, and that they're going
to have to

14:25.264 --> 14:29.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
fend for themselves in
negotiations with the
Assad regime.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Andrew Tabler,
take that
up.

14:31.904 --> 14:33.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it your sense that this is
going to hold?

14:33.706 --> 14:38.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this, as some have posited,
that this might
be the beginning of the end of
the war in

14:38.945 --> 14:40.680 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW TABLER, Fellow,
Washington Institute
for Near East Policy: I'm also
skeptical.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it's impossible to tell.

14:44.784 --> 14:49.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's very interesting
that, after
the capture of Aleppo, suddenly,
we're in

14:49.889 --> 14:51.724 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this situation.

14:51.758 --> 14:55.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I agree it's important that
Turkey is involved
and on this kind of level with
the Russians

14:55.495 --> 14:57.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and with the U.S. out of the
room.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's essentially new
territory.

14:59.665 --> 15:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's also interesting is
by pausing
now and going into diplomacy, I
think it shows

15:06.139 --> 15:10.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the Russians are setting
the table for
president-elect Trump to become
involved in

15:10.910 --> 15:12.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some sort of diplomatic process.

15:12.912 --> 15:18.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the diplomatic process is
with Assad remaining,
but large parts of the country
being outside

15:18.217 --> 15:22.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his control and potentially,
depending
on how the talks go, in the
hands of the rebels.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There is
obviously a lot
to unpack in there.

15:26.025 --> 15:29.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Joshua Landis, help us
understand, for people
who haven't been following this
all along,

15:29.629 --> 15:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let's just talk about, what's
Turkey's role,
its very complicated role in
this fight, what

15:34.801 --> 15:36.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has their role been so far?

15:36.269 --> 15:38.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSHUA LANDIS: Well, Turkey has
been the crossroads.

15:38.671 --> 15:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The territory has a 500-mile
border with Syria.

15:42.208 --> 15:47.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And across that border has
traveled almost
all the arms, the money, the
help, the fighters

15:47.446 --> 15:51.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are going into Syria to
sustain this
revolt against Assad.

15:51.818 --> 15:56.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Russians, the Syrians, the
Iranians have
been pressuring Turkey to shut
the door on

15:56.589 --> 15:59.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that cross-border traffic.

15:59.225 --> 16:03.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turkey is beginning to turn away
from support
for the rebels.

16:03.663 --> 16:09.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is partially because of
Trump's election,
in which he said he would work
with the Russians,

16:10.002 --> 16:13.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he turned his nose up at the
rebels, saying,
we don't know who they are, and
suggesting

16:13.706 --> 16:15.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they're worse than Assad.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so this is an about-face.

16:18.010 --> 16:23.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that the United States
is not at
the table is very important,
because it has

16:23.316 --> 16:26.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allowed these talks to go
forward without
the U.S.

16:26.819 --> 16:32.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in a sense, the U.S. has
signaled to
the rebels it's not got their
back, it's not

16:32.425 --> 16:36.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to continue to shuttle and
help arms
get through to the rebels.

16:36.929 --> 16:43.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this is a new day for the
rebels, who have
to think hard about what their
future strategy

16:43.169 --> 16:44.470 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Andrew Tabler,
let's just
continue with that.

16:47.373 --> 16:52.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A certain number of rebel groups
are part
of the cease-fire agreement.

16:52.078 --> 16:54.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some of them, many others are
not.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What happens to those who are
not at the peace
talks now?

16:57.383 --> 17:03.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW TABLER: Those that are
left out of
the agreement would be subject
to Russian

17:03.356 --> 17:07.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aviation strikes, as well as
regime airstrikes
and also other kinds of
operations.

17:07.793 --> 17:12.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, those that sign on to it
essentially go
into the cease-fire, and Turkey
guarantees

17:12.865 --> 17:17.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rebel factions will not
attack from their
side, and the Russians say that
they will,

17:17.937 --> 17:21.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as part of the agreement, get
the regime to
stop their attacks.

17:21.507 --> 17:24.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, these things are
harder to implement.

17:24.844 --> 17:29.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a potential way to tamp
down the violence,
at least in part of the country,
but it will

17:29.849 --> 17:36.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also allow Russia, the regime
and also the
United States to more fully
target groups

17:36.455 --> 17:39.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like ISIS and Jabhat Al-Fateh
Al-Sham, the
al-Qaida affiliate.

17:39.692 --> 17:43.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in that way, it could focus
fire on extremist
groups.

17:43.095 --> 17:45.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, Joshua,
back to you.

17:45.765 --> 17:50.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What happens now with -- it
looks like Assad
is not going to be dislodged
from power.

17:50.269 --> 17:55.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is going to have control of
some substantial
majority of his country going
forward, barring

17:55.107 --> 17:57.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some unforeseen development.

17:57.143 --> 17:58.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What kind of a country does he
inherit?

17:58.945 --> 18:01.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is his -- what's happening
with him going
forward?

18:01.981 --> 18:06.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA LANDIS: Well, I think
he's determined
to conquer all of the country.

18:06.252 --> 18:12.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the United States is busy
destroying ISIS,
which owns, perhaps, 30 percent,
35 percent

18:12.358 --> 18:14.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Syrian territory.

18:14.260 --> 18:19.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that will largely -- that
will most likely
be inherited by Assad, who is
standing by,

18:19.765 --> 18:24.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
waiting for the continued
collapse of ISIS.

18:24.136 --> 18:29.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will continue to go after the
al-Qaida-dominated
areas with Russian help and hope
to scoop

18:29.775 --> 18:31.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those up as well.

18:31.644 --> 18:36.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey has made a statement with
Iran and
Russia just the other day that
everyone is

18:36.782 --> 18:38.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to respect Syria's sovereignty.

18:38.584 --> 18:44.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that is codeword for not
dividing up
Syria.

18:44.824 --> 18:49.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that means that Assad will
take back his
country, I believe.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are people who believe
this means the
dividing up of Syria, that there
will be a

18:53.466 --> 18:58.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rebel territory, a Turkish
territory, an Assad
territory.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't believe that's the case.

19:00.172 --> 19:05.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Russia is squarely on
the side of
Assad and is muscling Turkey to
fall into

19:05.544 --> 19:06.645 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
line.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Andrew, what
do you make
of that?

19:08.047 --> 19:10.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are we looking at a divided
Turkey or not
-- a divided Syria?

19:10.316 --> 19:11.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Excuse me.

19:12.018 --> 19:17.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW TABLER: Well, I think, in
that sense,
Assad might be able to come back
over his

19:17.156 --> 19:21.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
territory, but the timeline on
that, I think,
is near, due to manpower issues.

19:21.260 --> 19:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what we could have is the
Russians saying,
OK, Assad stays on, because
there is not an

19:27.433 --> 19:29.035 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
alternative.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, I think they are
going to look
for opportunities with the
Turks.

19:31.537 --> 19:36.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the northern part of Syria,
the Turks have
carved out a de facto safe zone,
they call

19:36.442 --> 19:37.743 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

19:37.777 --> 19:41.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That could be the base for
support, rebel
support from Turkey.

19:41.747 --> 19:45.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We will have to see if
president-elect Donald
Trump wants to jump on that.

19:45.151 --> 19:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, president-elect Trump
said that
he was going to build beautiful
stations inside

19:52.024 --> 19:53.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Syria paid for by Gulf
countries.

19:53.759 --> 19:57.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a big statement, but if
you're going
to build them anywhere, it could
be there.

19:57.396 --> 20:01.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that could be the basis for
some kind
of operation, ground operation
against ISIS

20:01.934 --> 20:03.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the Eastern part of Syria.

20:03.335 --> 20:05.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Joshua, what
do you make
about that?

20:05.137 --> 20:08.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump administration is on
its way into
power.

20:08.307 --> 20:12.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think he will do
once he's handed
stories morass?

20:12.578 --> 20:17.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSHUA LANDIS: Well, he said he
will be on
the side of -- he will talk with
Putin and

20:17.583 --> 20:19.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he wants to destroy ISIS.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those are both things that help
Assad.

20:22.555 --> 20:26.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't believe that he is going
to want to
get into guaranteeing hunks of
Syria under

20:26.759 --> 20:29.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American control or Turkish
control.

20:29.528 --> 20:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that Syria is trying to
rebuild its
country after the economy has
gone into a

20:34.266 --> 20:41.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tailspin, a failed coup, tons of
terrorist
attacks, an incipient war with
the Kurds.

20:41.307 --> 20:44.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Turkey is trying to get back to
normal.

20:44.143 --> 20:49.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that means finding a way out
of the Syrian
quagmire.

20:49.482 --> 20:54.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It wants one thing guaranteed,
and that is
that the Kurds do not hive off
and create

20:54.887 --> 20:56.789 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their own state.

20:56.822 --> 21:01.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia and Bashar al-Assad can
offer him those
guarantees.

21:01.427 --> 21:05.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they will ask him to
withdraw from Syria
in order to give him those
guarantees.

21:05.564 --> 21:11.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that is the basis
for future talks
between Turkey, Russia and
Assad.

21:11.604 --> 21:16.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Joshua Landis,
Andrew Tabler, thank you both
very much.

21:16.442 --> 21:21.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSHUA LANDIS: Pleasure.

21:21.547 --> 21:26.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW TABLER: Pleasure.

21:26.619 --> 21:30.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:47.973 --> 21:51.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been very clear during the
campaign,
and in the transition since the
election,

21:51.944 --> 21:55.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that economist Peter Navarro
seems to have
the ear of Mr. Trump.

21:55.347 --> 21:59.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Navarro is a tough critic of the
U.S.' trade
relationship with China.

22:11.497 --> 22:12.464 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
China.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.465 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
China.

22:13.499 --> 22:14.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
China.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
China.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
China all the time.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.404 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
China.

22:18.437 --> 22:19.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Given Donald
Trump's persistently
pointed pivot to Asia, small
wonder that among

22:19.305 --> 22:21.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his favorite films is "Death by
China."

22:21.540 --> 22:26.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: China has stolen
thousands of our
factories and millions off our
jobs.

22:26.845 --> 22:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Multinational corporation
profits are soaring,
and we now owe over $3 trillion
to the world's

22:34.153 --> 22:36.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
largest communist nation.

22:36.188 --> 22:40.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And small wonder
the film's writer/director,
Peter Navarro, sounds like
Donald Trump.

22:40.726 --> 22:42.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO, Writer/Director,
"Death by
China": We're going right down
the toilet,

22:42.595 --> 22:44.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and it's a made-in-China toilet.

22:44.496 --> 22:49.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Navarro, a
Harvard-trained professor
at University of California,
Irvine, is the

22:49.134 --> 22:52.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sole Trump economic adviser with
a Ph.D.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So how'd you get interested in
and worried
about China?

22:54.273 --> 22:56.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: I teach MBAs.

22:56.075 --> 23:00.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I noticed, starting a few
years after
China joined the World Trade
Organization,

23:00.246 --> 23:03.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that a lot of my students were
no longer employed.

23:03.682 --> 23:06.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were still coming to get
their MBA, but
they'd lost their jobs.

23:06.518 --> 23:08.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I started to ask questions
why.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, at that point, all roads
were leading
to Beijing.

23:10.789 --> 23:15.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Navarro has done
plenty of technical
work in economics, is a pioneer
in online

23:15.861 --> 23:16.996 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
learning.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he began focusing on China
just a few
years ago.

23:19.431 --> 23:24.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: The defining
moment in American
economic history is when Bill
Clinton lobbied

23:24.470 --> 23:26.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get China into the World
Trade Organization.

23:26.939 --> 23:33.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the worst political and
economic mistake
in American history in the last
100 years.

23:33.779 --> 23:34.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In the last 100
years?

23:34.780 --> 23:36.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: In the last 100
years, yes.

23:36.715 --> 23:41.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China went into the World Trade
Organization
and agreed to play by certain
rules.

23:41.553 --> 23:47.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, they are illegally
subsidizing their
exports, manipulating their
currency, stealing

23:47.192 --> 23:52.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
all of our intellectual
property, using sweatshops,
using pollution havens.

23:52.665 --> 23:56.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What happens is, our businesses
and workers
are playing that game with two
hands tied

23:56.835 --> 23:58.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
behind their back.

23:58.203 --> 24:00.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Navarro says you
can even see
the effects at U.C.

24:00.939 --> 24:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Irvine, where, he says, Chinese
students,
paying triple the in-state
tuition rate, are

24:06.679 --> 24:11.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
displacing native Californians,
while the
Chinese parents are scooping up
local real

24:11.817 --> 24:12.785 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
estate.

24:12.818 --> 24:14.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Generally all
cash deals.

24:14.620 --> 24:19.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So your argument
is, unfair trade
practices, they amass dollars,
they bring

24:19.758 --> 24:23.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the dollars back here, they buy
up property,
and they drive up real estate
prices?

24:23.762 --> 24:24.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: That's right.

24:24.763 --> 24:26.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they drive up rents for
younger people.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will drive up home prices
for first-time
homebuyers.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's not just that we're
losing jobs and
factories.

24:31.770 --> 24:34.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're giving away our homes, our
businesses,
our companies, our technologies.

24:34.807 --> 24:40.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But, of course, we
heard the
same alarm about Japan in the
1980s, a false

24:40.346 --> 24:41.447 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
alarm.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But China is different, says
Navarro, so much
bigger.

24:44.350 --> 24:51.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We are going to
enforce all
trade violations against any
country that

24:51.790 --> 24:53.559 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cheats.

24:53.592 --> 24:58.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So one of the
answers Donald
Trump provides is that we should
have protective

24:58.831 --> 25:00.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tariffs on Chinese goods.

25:00.532 --> 25:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Wrong word.

25:01.533 --> 25:02.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Wrong word.

25:02.601 --> 25:03.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What's wrong?

25:03.702 --> 25:06.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Donald Trump is
not a protectionist.

25:06.805 --> 25:12.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All he wants to do is defend
America against
unfair trade practices.

25:12.144 --> 25:14.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, defend,
protect.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Very different.

25:15.914 --> 25:17.883 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trade is good.

25:17.916 --> 25:23.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tariffs and the threat of
tariffs are a negotiating
tool to require countries like
China to stop

25:23.889 --> 25:25.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their unfair trade practices.

25:25.724 --> 25:27.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the mission.

25:27.493 --> 25:33.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And how much do you
imagine it
might cost in the increase in
the price of

25:33.499 --> 25:35.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
goods at, say, Wal-Mart?

25:35.300 --> 25:41.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Any increase
would be less
than the paycheck that all these
people would

25:42.007 --> 25:47.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be getting, both in terms of
actually having
a job, plus wages rising again.

25:47.112 --> 25:49.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: If the jobs
actually were to
come back, that is.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: The Trump trade
doctrine is
this.

25:52.217 --> 25:57.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America will trade with any
country, so long
as that deal meets these three
criterion:

25:57.923 --> 26:03.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You increase the GDP growth
rate, you decrease
the trade deficit, and you
strengthen the

26:03.529 --> 26:05.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
manufacturing base.

26:05.397 --> 26:11.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But isn't
technology responsible
for the elimination of American
factory jobs?

26:11.203 --> 26:19.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETER NAVARRO: Certainly
technology has played
a part, but the dramatic change
from five-and-a-half

26:19.077 --> 26:25.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decades of 3.5 percent rate of
growth prior
to China entering our markets
with illegally

26:25.784 --> 26:32.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
subsidized goods and the 1.8
percent afterwards
suggests strongly that China has
played an

26:32.357 --> 26:36.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enormous role in the decline and
downfall
of the American economy.

26:36.061 --> 26:39.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I can show on a blackboard
exactly why.

26:39.331 --> 26:43.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, your typical
economist would
hardly agree.

26:43.035 --> 26:48.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, hey, says Navarro, your
typical economist
still believes in the old
so-called Keynesian

26:48.907 --> 26:50.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
approach to reviving the
economy.

26:50.943 --> 26:54.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Alright, Paul,
the growth of
any nation is simply four
things.

26:55.013 --> 27:00.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: More consumption,
C., by consumers
and more G, government spending.

27:00.953 --> 27:07.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He and Trump, however, will
supposedly flip
the script, stimulating more I,
Investment,

27:07.392 --> 27:12.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by business, via tax cuts for
the wealthy
and corporations, while boosting
net exports

27:12.731 --> 27:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through new trade deals.

27:14.566 --> 27:16.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's exports minus imports.

27:16.034 --> 27:17.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: That's right.

27:17.936 --> 27:22.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And, of course, if
that's a negative
number, that is, you have more
imports than

27:22.574 --> 27:23.542 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exports.

27:23.575 --> 27:24.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: This is the big
kahuna.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is what Donald Trump
understands.

27:26.512 --> 27:27.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is the trade deficit.

27:28.013 --> 27:32.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We run a trade deficit of close
to $800 billion
a year.

27:32.217 --> 27:35.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so this directly subtracts
from this.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is why we're stuck in
low-growth mode.

27:37.456 --> 27:38.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, maybe.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The job of a journalist,
however, is to ask
questions.

27:41.793 --> 27:43.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is U.S. GDP 2016?

27:43.529 --> 27:45.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMPUTER VOICE: Checking on
that.

27:45.531 --> 27:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Happily, there's
now Siri to
answer them.

27:48.200 --> 27:52.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COMPUTER VOICE: It looks like
the answer is
about 18.2 trillion U.S. dollars
per year.

27:52.237 --> 27:54.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Thank you, Siri.

27:54.406 --> 28:01.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In that case, GDP is something
like $18 trillion,
right?

28:01.613 --> 28:09.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're saying that the trade
deficit is
-- well, it's less than $1
trillion, right?

28:09.621 --> 28:15.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this can't be a major factor
in total
GDP, the size of the economy.

28:15.394 --> 28:19.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Yes, but when we
run these
big trade deficits and send our
jobs offshore,

28:19.731 --> 28:22.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we hold our wages down and our
income down.

28:22.701 --> 28:26.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That feeds right back into the
biggest part
of this whole equation,
consumption.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This drags GDP down as well.

28:28.507 --> 28:30.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Or so this story
goes.

28:30.709 --> 28:36.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you hear the criticism
about Donald Trump's
own goods being made in other
countries, what's

28:36.281 --> 28:37.249 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your reaction?

28:37.282 --> 28:38.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Do me a favor.

28:38.417 --> 28:41.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Play Dan Slane's clip in my
"Death by China"
movie.

28:41.086 --> 28:42.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's priceless.

28:42.955 --> 28:46.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Slane was a plywood
manufacturer
in Bowling Green, Kentucky,
whose competitors

28:46.758 --> 28:48.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
moved to China.

28:48.493 --> 28:51.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN SLANE, Business Owner: And I
opened up
three factories in China and
delivered to

28:51.363 --> 28:55.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the customer in the United
States 50 percent
cheaper than I could make it in
Bowling Green.

28:56.001 --> 28:59.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: He winds up
selling product
back here into the U.S. at cost.

29:00.005 --> 29:01.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How did he make his money?

29:01.873 --> 29:06.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN SLANE: Every month, the
Chinese government
would send me a check for 17
percent of my

29:06.745 --> 29:10.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exports, and that was my net
margin and my
profit.

29:10.082 --> 29:13.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, is Donald Trump
getting checks
from the Chinese government?

29:13.352 --> 29:14.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: That's how the
game works.

29:14.453 --> 29:18.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But he could use
American companies.

29:18.223 --> 29:24.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are lots of people who
actually say
made in USA and use that as a
marketing tool.

29:24.396 --> 29:26.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: The point here
is, he can't.

29:26.298 --> 29:33.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The competitive forces that
force a Dan Slane
to take his furniture company to
China, they're

29:33.538 --> 29:35.307 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
real, OK?

29:35.340 --> 29:39.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you try and take the high
ground and
produce here in America, when
China's dumping

29:39.911 --> 29:43.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
product in and manipulating
their currency,
you go out of business.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You just go out of business.

29:45.517 --> 29:51.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What about the
character issues
that surround Donald Trump?

29:51.156 --> 29:55.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Well, look, I
don't go there.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I focus on policy.

29:56.762 --> 29:58.096 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's my job.

29:58.130 --> 30:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And you have no
problem with
the failed companies?

30:01.867 --> 30:06.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: No one should be
surprised
just because somebody isn't
successful 100

30:06.905 --> 30:07.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
percent of the time.

30:07.906 --> 30:11.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The percent here, he's a
billionaire.

30:11.777 --> 30:13.478 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's successful.

30:13.512 --> 30:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And no matter how
much money
he actually has or hasn't got,
given that

30:20.452 --> 30:27.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump is the
president-elect of the
United States, no can argue that
he isn't

30:27.092 --> 30:29.695 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
successful.

30:29.728 --> 30:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is "NewsHour" economics
correspondent
Paul Solman, reporting from
Irvine, California.

30:38.103 --> 30:50.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In November,
four more states
voted to legalize recreational
marijuana,

30:50.082 --> 30:51.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bringing the total number to
seven.

30:51.850 --> 30:55.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With more states loosening
restrictions, cities
and counties are seeking ways to
regulate

30:55.554 --> 31:00.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cannabis farming, including a
county in California
piloting a project to keep pot
off the black

31:00.759 --> 31:02.527 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
market.

31:02.561 --> 31:07.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: Nearly 300 miles
north of San
Francisco, thick redwoods reach
to the sky.

31:08.033 --> 31:13.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this land of giants, the buzz
of sawmills
and the splash of fishing nets
once signaled

31:13.739 --> 31:15.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a booming economy.

31:15.707 --> 31:21.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, there's another industry
in Humboldt
County that is thriving and
driving up demand

31:21.279 --> 31:22.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for goods and services.

31:22.748 --> 31:27.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: And your total will be
$3,023.99 after
tax.

31:27.486 --> 31:32.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: From leaf trimming
machines
to water storage services and
specialty soils,

31:32.958 --> 31:37.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marijuana, or cannabis, as it's
also known,
is big business in Humboldt
County.

31:37.996 --> 31:44.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICK MURPHY, Emerald Family
Farms: Humboldt
County is the Napa of cannabis.

31:44.102 --> 31:50.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is by far and away the
largest production
zone of high-quality cannabis in
the world.

31:50.175 --> 31:54.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: And for the first
time in nearly
50 years, it's coming out of the
shadows through

31:54.913 --> 32:00.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a bold new experiment that
allows people to
legally grow medical cannabis
for profit.

32:00.051 --> 32:04.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK MURPHY: I believe that,
instead of
complaining about the smell of
cannabis, the

32:04.389 --> 32:10.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people of Humboldt County will
realize that
that's the smell of cultivating
local prosperity.

32:10.061 --> 32:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: Patrick Murphy is
the co-owner
of Emerald Family Farms, a
collective of cannabis

32:15.333 --> 32:17.068 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
farmers.

32:17.102 --> 32:19.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK MURPHY: We would like to
create an
industry that is both
environmentally and

32:19.337 --> 32:21.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
economically sustainable.

32:21.673 --> 32:26.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first time I cultivated
cannabis was when
I was 16 years old.

32:26.311 --> 32:28.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have been cultivating
cannabis ever
since.

32:28.413 --> 32:32.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: Farmers like
Murphy are now
required to register with the
county so they

32:32.384 --> 32:38.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can get permits to legally grow
medical cannabis,
just as they would for other
agricultural

32:38.056 --> 32:39.825 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crops.

32:39.858 --> 32:43.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Size limits apply, depending on
how the crop
is grown, and whether it's new
or existing

32:43.662 --> 32:45.530 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cultivation.

32:45.564 --> 32:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE LAZAR, Planning and
Building Department,
Humboldt County: The limit for
new cultivation

32:46.765 --> 32:49.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is 10,000 square feet, or about
a quarter
of an acre.

32:49.467 --> 32:53.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Existing operations, we have
allowed all the
way up to one acre in size, if
they can meet

32:53.872 --> 32:55.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
requirements.

32:55.707 --> 32:58.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: Steve Lazar is a
senior planner
at the Planning and Building
Department in

32:58.076 --> 32:59.778 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Eureka.

32:59.811 --> 33:03.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He helped write the county's new
rules as
a green rush has been taking off
in the forested

33:03.215 --> 33:04.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hills of Humboldt.

33:04.583 --> 33:07.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE LAZAR: So, here, we're
looking at a
photograph from 2006.

33:07.752 --> 33:10.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The photograph shows a forested
area.

33:10.222 --> 33:17.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, by 2015, this area is now
host to 20
to 30 different cultivation
operations.

33:17.229 --> 33:22.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, here we can see every of
greenhouse construction,
water storage.

33:22.968 --> 33:27.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One could easily estimate that
there's over
10,000 cultivation sites in the
county at

33:27.339 --> 33:29.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this point.

33:29.241 --> 33:32.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: People from all
over the world
are rushing to Humboldt to
cultivate cannabis.

33:32.844 --> 33:37.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the lure of pot profits is
straining local
watersheds and threatening
endangered salmon.

33:37.315 --> 33:40.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT BAUER, California
Department of Fish
and Wildlife: Marijuana
cultivation is probably

33:40.185 --> 33:44.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the biggest issue facing the
recovery of our
salmon and steelhead.

33:44.089 --> 33:47.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We put a million dollars into a
watershed
to restore fish there.

33:48.026 --> 33:52.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I go out on a site and I see
a million
dollars in habitat damage.

33:52.130 --> 33:56.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: Scott Bauer is a
scientist with
the California Department of
Fish and Wildlife.

33:56.902 --> 34:02.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT BAUER: Typically, on an
enforcement
activity, we see illegal
road-grading, bulldozers

34:02.240 --> 34:04.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pushing dirt into streams.

34:04.042 --> 34:07.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We see people diverting water,
and, in fact,
taking most of the water out of
the stream

34:07.946 --> 34:09.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to cultivate marijuana.

34:09.714 --> 34:12.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: Bauer and his team
not only
fine growers for breaking
environmental laws.

34:12.651 --> 34:15.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also give permits to
legally take water
from rivers and streams.

34:15.954 --> 34:19.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT BAUER: We would like every
marijuana
cultivator to get a permit from
the department

34:19.791 --> 34:21.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to divert water.

34:21.426 --> 34:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We condition our permit to say,
you can't
have any water in the
summertime.

34:25.297 --> 34:31.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You need to take water in the
wintertime,
and store it for use later.

34:31.636 --> 34:41.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: Cannabis has been
legal to use
in California for medical
purposes since 1996.

34:41.513 --> 34:44.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: It's got a great look,
got a great
smell.

34:44.416 --> 34:48.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: Patients could
also grow cannabis
and supply it to dispensaries as
long as they

34:48.853 --> 34:50.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
didn't profit from it.

34:50.622 --> 34:53.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But all that will change in
2018.

34:53.525 --> 34:58.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's when California will
begin issuing
licenses for commercial medical
cannabis activities.

34:58.930 --> 35:03.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Until then, counties and cities
are trying
to regulate the cannabis
industry at the local

35:03.501 --> 35:04.469 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
level.

35:04.502 --> 35:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE LAZAR: Now we can call a
spade a spade.

35:06.271 --> 35:09.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Profit is part of being a
farmer, whether
you're growing cannabis or
tomatoes.

35:09.874 --> 35:15.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: Maybe so, but it's
still illegal
at the federal level to grow or
sell cannabis.

35:15.180 --> 35:21.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK MURPHY: Every cannabis
cultivator
lives with the fear of having
their children

35:21.553 --> 35:24.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taken away from them, having
financial ruin.

35:24.456 --> 35:29.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: But in late
August, 2,300 people,
most of them existing growers,
came forward

35:29.160 --> 35:32.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to register under Humboldt's new
program.

35:32.630 --> 35:38.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, according to the local
sheriff, only
a fraction of the county's pot
ends up legally

35:38.403 --> 35:40.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the hands of patients.

35:40.238 --> 35:42.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL DOWNEY, Humboldt County
Sheriff: I
would say 95 percent of the
marijuana growing

35:42.107 --> 35:46.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Humboldt County, and possibly
higher, is
actually going to the black
market.

35:46.544 --> 35:52.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: The sheriff's
office conducts
roughly 100 raids a year,
targeting massive

35:52.183 --> 35:54.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
illegal marijuana grows.

35:54.052 --> 35:58.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: What we have here is
typically evidence
that has been found in a
marijuana grow that's

35:58.590 --> 36:01.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been seized by the Humboldt
County Sheriff's
Office.

36:01.393 --> 36:05.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These right here are processed
marijuana in
one-pound bags.

36:05.764 --> 36:11.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have the typical firearms
that are
seized in a marijuana grow,
AK-47 assault

36:11.469 --> 36:13.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
weapons, M-14 rifles.

36:13.805 --> 36:16.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is what they use to protect
their marijuana.

36:16.608 --> 36:20.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: The county is now
trying to
keep cannabis out of the black
market with

36:20.378 --> 36:24.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new track-and-trace program
that gives each
farmer a set of stamps bearing
codes that

36:24.916 --> 36:26.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are unique to them.

36:26.651 --> 36:31.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this demo, a bag of processed
cannabis
is sealed with a stamp and
verified online

36:31.523 --> 36:33.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as it moves through the supply
chain.

36:33.625 --> 36:38.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: OK, now we can also check
the proof of
origin with the mobile
application.

36:38.096 --> 36:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: For the first
time, a patient
at a California dispensary will
be able to

36:42.333 --> 36:47.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quickly check that a product was
grown in
Humboldt and be able to see its
lab results.

36:47.806 --> 36:52.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From farmers to dispensary
owners, 15 people
are taking part in this pilot
program.

36:52.677 --> 36:58.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now that California has
voted yes on the
recreational use of pot,
legalization could

36:58.683 --> 37:02.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spell tough times ahead for
farmers here in
Humboldt County.

37:02.821 --> 37:06.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I believe that it will be
grown all over
the West Coast.

37:06.891 --> 37:10.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I believe the price per
pound is going
to become so low that the
industry is going

37:10.261 --> 37:11.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be driven out of Humboldt
County

37:12.030 --> 37:16.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK MURPHY: The fear is that
the people
that were a part of this, that
started this

37:16.768 --> 37:20.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
movement will not have a place
in the future.

37:20.205 --> 37:25.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it will only happen if we do
not take
part, if we do not stand up and
make our voices

37:25.877 --> 37:28.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heard as the heart and soul of
the cannabis
industry.

37:28.379 --> 37:38.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAZ SADIQ: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Sheraz Sadiq in Humboldt County,
California.

37:38.923 --> 37:49.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now we
continue our series
on the best of the year in arts
-- tonight,

37:49.400 --> 37:51.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what stood out in the world of
movies.

37:51.069 --> 37:52.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown is back with our
conversation.

37:52.837 --> 37:57.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And for that, we
are joined
again by two of our steadfast
and stalwart

37:57.041 --> 38:02.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
film critics, Ann Hornaday of
The Washington
Post and Mike Sargent of
Pacifica Radio.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome back to both of you.

38:03.515 --> 38:04.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANN HORNADAY, Film Critic, The
Washington
Post: Thank you.

38:04.682 --> 38:06.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT, Film Critic,
Pacifica Radio:
Thank you.

38:06.050 --> 38:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, let's start
with a quick
roundup, a top five.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then we will go into a little
bit more detail.

38:08.653 --> 38:09.621 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ann.

38:09.654 --> 38:11.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANN HORNADAY: OK, top five.

38:11.523 --> 38:15.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Number one, "Moonlight," Barry
Jenkins' coming
of age story, "Manchester by the
Sea," wonderful

38:15.393 --> 38:20.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
domestic drama by Kenneth
Lonergan, "Hell
or High Water," a terrific
contemporary Western,

38:20.932 --> 38:26.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a little father-son serial comic
drama called
"The Confirmation" Clive Owen,
and then finally

38:26.237 --> 38:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"O.J.: Made in America," the
amazing O.J.
Simpson documentary.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Which also made
our television
list, but that had a film
release.

38:31.743 --> 38:32.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANN HORNADAY: Indeed.

38:32.777 --> 38:34.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK, Mike Sargent,
your top
five.

38:34.179 --> 38:35.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT: Well, my top five.

38:35.947 --> 38:40.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The top one is a film called
"Arrival," which
is a science fiction about
aliens landing

38:40.151 --> 38:41.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and us trying to communicate.

38:41.953 --> 38:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then there's Mel Gibson's
"Hacksaw Ridge,"
which is about Desmond Doss, who
won the Medal

38:46.224 --> 38:49.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Honor without ever having to
fire one bullet.

38:49.694 --> 38:52.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then I have "Purge: Election
Year," which
is the third film in the series.

38:52.497 --> 38:58.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Purge is something that
happens once
a year in this future dystopian
America where

38:58.403 --> 39:02.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
once a year you get to purge,
and violence
is legal for 24 hours.

39:02.674 --> 39:07.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this film actually does what
the premise
should have done in the first
two films, and

39:07.412 --> 39:08.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I really like it.

39:08.880 --> 39:13.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then I have "Moonlight," which I
love just
probably as much as Ann did.

39:13.117 --> 39:16.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then a film that I almost
forgot called
"Eye in the Sky" with Helen
Mirren, which

39:16.921 --> 39:21.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the final performance of Alan
Rickman,
but it's a film not to be
missed.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let's watch a
little clip from
"Moonlight."

39:23.595 --> 39:26.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then we will talk a little bit
more about
it.

39:26.331 --> 39:28.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: What's wrong?

39:28.333 --> 39:29.634 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ACTOR: Nothing.

39:29.667 --> 39:30.969 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm good.

39:31.002 --> 39:32.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ACTRESS: No.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have seen good.

39:34.639 --> 39:36.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And you ain't it.

39:36.708 --> 39:41.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Stop putting your head down in
my house.

39:41.479 --> 39:43.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know my rule.

39:43.982 --> 39:48.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's all love and all pride in
this house.

39:48.519 --> 39:50.321 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You feel me?

39:50.355 --> 39:52.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so,
Ann, an unusual
film in many ways, episodic,
takes one man

39:52.924 --> 39:54.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
through three different actors.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANN HORNADAY: Yes.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.195 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Indeed, exactly.

39:57.228 --> 40:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a young boy's story, as you
said, told
in three distinct chapters,
first when he

40:01.766 --> 40:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a young boy, then as a
teenager and then
as a young man.

40:06.271 --> 40:14.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's about a person coming
of age in poverty,
in this case in Liberty City,
Miami.

40:14.679 --> 40:20.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That scene that we just saw
features Janelle
Monae in an absolute breakout
performance.

40:20.652 --> 40:23.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she's also in another movie
that is out
right now called "Hidden
Figures."

40:24.022 --> 40:27.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Known, first of
all, as a singer,
a musician, and now suddenly a
great actress.

40:27.959 --> 40:28.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANN HORNADAY: Exactly.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's just a great actress.

40:30.828 --> 40:38.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's just -- it's a very
tender, observant
-- as Mike said, it takes all
the kind of

40:38.269 --> 40:43.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tropes of a coming of age story
and turns
them inside out and makes them
so intimate.

40:43.975 --> 40:50.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Jenkins' kind of -- his
point of view
is just a little askance, it's a
little askew,

40:50.181 --> 40:53.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that you're not getting the
conventional
beats of a person's life.

40:53.451 --> 40:57.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're getting the in-between
times, which
are sometimes even more
meaningful.

40:57.522 --> 40:59.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Mike,
you singled
out "Arrival."

40:59.824 --> 41:02.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, let's take a look at a scene
from that.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY ADAMS, Actress: I need to
see me.

41:04.228 --> 41:06.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: She's walking toward the
screen.

41:06.297 --> 41:17.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY ADAMS: Now, that's a proper
introduction.

41:17.141 --> 41:30.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what do you
love about
"Arrival," Mike?

41:30.621 --> 41:33.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT: I love pretty much
about pretty
much everything about this film.

41:33.658 --> 41:38.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a film that does what
science fiction
and good science fiction should
be, where

41:38.196 --> 41:40.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it says a lot about the human
condition.

41:40.431 --> 41:45.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a film that deals with
the issues
of communication, how and why we
communicate,

41:45.169 --> 41:50.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what the nature of that is, what
the issues
are between nations, how we
don't get along

41:50.742 --> 41:53.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and are on the verge of war
throughout the
story.

41:53.311 --> 41:59.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it deals with time and just
how we -- what
our relationship is to time.

41:59.283 --> 42:03.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The movie is in many ways like a
large "Twilight
Zone" episode.

42:03.454 --> 42:05.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it's beautifully shot.

42:05.223 --> 42:07.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's beautifully acted.

42:07.492 --> 42:11.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The aliens are very powerful and
meaningful.

42:11.329 --> 42:16.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't want to give too
much away, but
the way in which the aliens
communicate is

42:16.167 --> 42:22.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
such in an imaginative -- and
it's just a
beautiful film that to me works
on every level.

42:22.106 --> 42:25.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so we
asked both
of you also to pick an acting
performance

42:25.777 --> 42:28.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that stood out for you this
year.

42:28.045 --> 42:31.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Ann, you chose Casey
Affleck in "Manchester
by the Sea."

42:31.516 --> 42:32.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's take a quick look.

42:32.784 --> 42:36.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CASEY AFFLECK, Actor: I don't
understand.

42:36.187 --> 42:44.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: Which part are you having
trouble with?

42:44.395 --> 42:51.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CASEY AFFLECK: Well, I can't be
the guardian.

42:51.035 --> 42:52.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ACTOR: Well...

42:52.103 --> 42:53.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASEY AFFLECK: I mean, I can't.

42:53.604 --> 42:58.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: Well, naturally, I
assumed Joe had
discussed all of this with you.

42:58.042 --> 43:01.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASEY AFFLECK: No, he didn't.

43:01.112 --> 43:02.079 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

43:02.113 --> 43:04.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What about it?

43:04.248 --> 43:05.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What stood out there?

43:05.316 --> 43:06.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANN HORNADAY: It's a very
interior performance.

43:06.818 --> 43:11.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The thing about Lonergan's
movies is that
they're really about subtext.

43:11.122 --> 43:14.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when a movie is really about
subtext,
the actor has to bring it.

43:14.525 --> 43:18.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The actor has to provide for the
audience
all the things, the subterranean
emotions

43:18.930 --> 43:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and feelings that are going on
underneath
the dialogue, as we just saw in
that scene.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Affleck does it just
brilliantly.

43:24.268 --> 43:27.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Mike,
and you picked
Viola Davis in "Fences," which
is the Denzel

43:27.772 --> 43:31.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington-directed film of the
August Wilson
play.

43:31.309 --> 43:33.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's look at a clip from that.

43:33.110 --> 43:35.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENZEL WASHINGTON, Actor: It's
not easy for
me to admit that I have been
standing in the

43:35.613 --> 43:36.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
same place for 18 years.

43:36.914 --> 43:37.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VIOLA DAVIS, Actress: Well, I
have been standing
with you.

43:37.782 --> 43:38.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have been right here with you,
Troy.

43:38.649 --> 43:40.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I got a life, too.

43:40.051 --> 43:41.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I got 18 years of my life just
standing in
the same spot as you.

43:41.052 --> 43:43.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Don't you think I ever wanted
other things?

43:43.387 --> 43:52.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Don't you think I had dreams and
hopes?

43:52.730 --> 43:57.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What about my life?

43:57.735 --> 43:58.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What about me?

43:58.736 --> 44:00.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Mike,
Viola Davis.

44:00.471 --> 44:01.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT: Well, Viola Davis,
I have to
say, is just one of those
actresses who is

44:01.138 --> 44:02.106 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
transformative.

44:02.140 --> 44:04.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She becomes the character who
she is in this.

44:04.976 --> 44:10.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is based on the play by
August Wilson,
and it's first in a series, a
series of plays

44:10.214 --> 44:14.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he's done about black life
in America
during a specific period.

44:14.051 --> 44:19.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Viola Davis is, though she's
probably
going to be nominated as best
supporting actress

44:19.624 --> 44:23.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for this, she really, whenever
she's on screen,
she just takes it.

44:23.828 --> 44:24.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's won an Emmy.

44:24.829 --> 44:26.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's won a Tony.

44:26.697 --> 44:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think she may be one of
those few actors
who is going win all three and
win an Oscar.

44:29.734 --> 44:33.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She is just -- she is not just
someone who
just you watch you act.

44:33.504 --> 44:34.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She moves you.

44:34.572 --> 44:36.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she really does in this
film.

44:36.374 --> 44:39.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, how
just quickly,
before we go, give us something
that maybe

44:39.176 --> 44:41.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we just missed altogether that
you want to
recommend to us.

44:41.846 --> 44:44.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT: Well, I would
recommend a film
called "Tanna."

44:44.515 --> 44:46.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That'S T-A-N-N-A.

44:46.317 --> 44:52.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Tanna" is essentially a Romeo
and Juliet
story, but it's told by an
indigenous people,

44:52.256 --> 44:54.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
indigenous actors.

44:54.091 --> 44:57.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's actually Australia's entry
for the Oscars
and it made the short list for
best foreign

44:57.662 --> 44:59.330 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
film this year.

44:59.363 --> 45:01.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a beautifully shot film.

45:01.265 --> 45:06.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's in another language, but so
much of it
is about the dialogue and what
goes on.

45:06.203 --> 45:10.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're star-crossed lovers in a
tribe where
you can't get together.

45:10.241 --> 45:13.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have to say it's just --
it's an amazing
film.

45:13.044 --> 45:14.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Ann
Hornaday.

45:14.545 --> 45:16.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANN HORNADAY: This is a tough
one because
there were a lot this year.

45:16.814 --> 45:20.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one that I really loved
watching was called
"A Bigger Splash."

45:20.418 --> 45:23.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's from the Italian director
Luca Guadagnino.

45:23.788 --> 45:25.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that's how you pronounce
his name.

45:25.222 --> 45:26.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:26.958 --> 45:30.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANN HORNADAY: It stars Tilda
Swinton as a
rock star who is rusticating in
Italy with

45:30.628 --> 45:34.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her boyfriend/husband, I think,
who is a filmmaker.

45:34.465 --> 45:35.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She has laryngitis.

45:35.800 --> 45:36.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sound horrible,
right, a horrible
life, right?

45:36.467 --> 45:37.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

45:37.468 --> 45:38.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANN HORNADAY: No, it is just so
luxurious.

45:38.469 --> 45:39.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the scenery is beautiful.

45:39.470 --> 45:40.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's what I
meant.

45:40.805 --> 45:42.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The clothes are beautiful, and
she's beautiful.

45:42.239 --> 45:46.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then Ralph Fiennes shows up
as the mischief-maker
of the bunch.

45:46.777 --> 45:50.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he delivers, I think, one of
the best
performances, the most sort of
playful.

45:50.615 --> 45:55.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just watching him dance to a
Rolling Stones
song is worth the price of
admission alone.

45:55.853 --> 45:58.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK, some of the
films of 2016.

45:58.522 --> 46:01.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ann Hornaday, Mike Sargent,
thank you both
very much.

46:01.359 --> 46:02.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANN HORNADAY: Thank you.

46:02.360 --> 46:04.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIKE SARGENT: Thank you.

46:04.095 --> 46:06.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tomorrow, the
best music
from 2016 with a pair of
critics, including

46:06.731 --> 46:08.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ann Powers of NPR.

46:08.499 --> 46:11.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beyonce's big year is certainly
featured,
but there's much more, too,
including a new

46:11.836 --> 46:13.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
album by her sister.

46:13.638 --> 46:19.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANN POWERS, NPR: Beyonce's
sister Solange
Knowles released a very
beautiful, introspective

46:19.443 --> 46:25.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
album called "A Seat at the
Table" that again
reflected the political moment
in a very different

46:25.182 --> 46:26.951 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

46:26.984 --> 46:30.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Beyonce was forceful and out
there, Solange
was quiet and thinking and
meditating and

46:30.921 --> 46:31.956 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dreaming.

46:31.989 --> 46:33.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And we want to
hear from
you.

46:33.290 --> 46:36.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tell us what you loved in books,

and music in 2016.

46:57.314 --> 47:00.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we come to the end of the
year, another
remembrance of our friend and
colleague Gwen

47:00.885 --> 47:02.753 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ifill.

47:02.787 --> 47:06.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was a pioneer in several
ways, and particularly
encouraging to young women
journalists of

47:06.157 --> 47:07.124 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
color.

47:07.158 --> 47:08.259 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Have a listen.

47:08.292 --> 47:10.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR, The New York
Times: Dear,
Gwen.

47:10.594 --> 47:12.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HANNAH ALLAM, McClatchy
Newspapers: Dear,
Gwen.

47:12.930 --> 47:14.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TANZINA VEGA, CNN: Dear, Gwen.

47:14.899 --> 47:16.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAT CHOW, NPR: Dear, Gwen.

47:16.867 --> 47:18.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Thank you for
telling that
you know my name.

47:18.803 --> 47:24.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANNAH ALLAM: For the time that
I showed up
to your studio with straight
hair, because

47:24.608 --> 47:26.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everybody knows this isn't
polished.

47:26.877 --> 47:31.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: I think of
just knowing
myself and knowing my name and
owning who

47:31.248 --> 47:32.216 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I am.

47:32.249 --> 47:34.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it was so important that you
told me that.

47:34.051 --> 47:39.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANNAH ALLAM: You gave me a look
that was
something like, and then you
said, "You know,

47:39.123 --> 47:41.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you don't have to do that here."

47:41.292 --> 47:47.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That meant the world to me.

47:47.498 --> 47:55.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAT CHOW: When you're young, you
don't really
think about how important it is
to see people

47:55.673 --> 47:59.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are a woman or a woman of
color in those
positions.

47:59.610 --> 48:04.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TANZINA VEGA: You were a beacon
for so many
of us, women of color
especially, who wanted

48:04.448 --> 48:07.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so badly to see themselves
reflected in the
media.

48:07.318 --> 48:12.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAT CHOW: I only saw older white
guys on TV
behind the anchor desk.

48:12.823 --> 48:16.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: But there you
were, a beacon
of hope in a sea of white faces.

48:16.360 --> 48:21.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: The fact that
you were covering
the White House, that meant
something.

48:21.132 --> 48:25.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That meant I could go and pursue
the career
and become a journalist.

48:25.469 --> 48:28.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN: All
of the young
journalists of color, women
particularly,

48:28.672 --> 48:30.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we all looked to you as an
example.

48:30.341 --> 48:33.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: I can remember
when I interviewed
for this job at "NewsHour."

48:33.978 --> 48:36.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they asked me why I wanted
to work here.

48:36.347 --> 48:39.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for me, the answer was
simple: It was
you.

48:39.216 --> 48:43.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANNAH ALLAM: I remember, at the
Gridiron
Dinner a few years ago, you
pulled me aside

48:43.788 --> 48:45.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and said, "What are you covering
now?"

48:45.256 --> 48:47.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I said "foreign policy."

48:47.792 --> 48:49.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And your eyes lit up and you
said: "Great.

48:50.027 --> 48:53.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I need more people of color to
come on the
show and talk about foreign
policy."

48:53.964 --> 48:58.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON: I just
knew I had made
it when I was on "Washington
Week With Gwen

48:58.102 --> 49:02.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ifill," because you knew the
folks on "Gwen
Ifill," that, Gwen, you
respected them.

49:02.773 --> 49:11.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to have your respect in that
moment on
those shows, it was everything.

49:11.215 --> 49:23.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISSAH THOMPSON, The Washington
Post: You,
a successful as you were, and as
prominent,

49:23.994 --> 49:27.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
read my work and took the time
to encourage
me.

49:28.032 --> 49:29.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JASMINE WRIGHT: You saw me.

49:29.900 --> 49:35.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You saw me for who I was, and
you were proud
of me.

49:35.573 --> 49:48.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: I have admired
you and Judy
Woodruff for showing me that two
female co-anchors

49:48.319 --> 49:50.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could be a norm, instead of the
exception.

49:50.254 --> 49:55.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAT CHOW: Now, more than ever,
we're at a
place where we need journalists
like us.

49:55.092 --> 49:56.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TANZINA VEGA: We owe you our
gratitude.

49:56.894 --> 50:04.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANNAH ALLAM: So, as I stand
here with tears
in my eyes thinking of how much
we have lost

50:04.168 --> 50:05.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with your passing...

50:05.402 --> 50:06.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAMELA KIRKLAND: There will
never be another
Gwen Ifill.

50:06.971 --> 50:09.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There will never be another you.

50:09.039 --> 50:12.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HANNAH ALLAM: We will miss your
journalism,
all of us.

50:12.576 --> 50:17.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Dear, Gwen, I
am going to
really, really, really, really
miss you, but

50:17.815 --> 50:20.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm also going to really,
really, really try
to make you proud.

50:20.851 --> 50:28.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENYA DOWNS: By being a hand or
a model for
some other young woman who one
day may see

50:28.559 --> 50:34.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me, may see a woman who looks
like me and
like you, and know that she can,
too.

50:34.632 --> 50:38.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TANZINA VEGA: Thank you from the
bottom of
my heart.

50:38.469 --> 50:40.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JASMINE WRIGHT: Thank you, Gwen.

50:40.404 --> 50:44.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yesterday, in
Gwen's honor,
we took a field trip to a
research lab at

50:44.241 --> 50:49.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the National Cancer Institute
for an update
on the state of cancer research
and to help

50:49.113 --> 50:52.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
raise money for the Gwen Ifill
Fund for Journalism
Excellence.

50:52.483 --> 50:55.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: I actually came to a lab at
the NIH.

50:55.786 --> 50:58.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I did cancer research.

50:58.255 --> 51:02.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was while I was doing
that research
I lost my right eye to ocular
melanoma.

51:02.793 --> 51:06.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, you're a
cancer researcher
working at the NIH, and you lose
your right

51:06.964 --> 51:08.132 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
eye to a cancer.

51:08.165 --> 51:10.034 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Exactly.

51:10.067 --> 51:14.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, you know, losing that
eye really affected
my depth perception and it made
it so that

51:14.738 --> 51:17.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I couldn't operate as a surgeon.

51:17.274 --> 51:21.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I retrained in internal
medicine and medical
oncology.

51:21.445 --> 51:29.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I came back and started
kind of a
related, but somewhat new line
of research,

51:29.153 --> 51:30.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which is what I'm doing now.

51:30.587 --> 51:35.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Find that
online at
Facebook.com/"NewsHour."

51:35.092 --> 51:36.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

51:36.427 --> 51:37.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

51:37.494 --> 51:39.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

51:39.196 --> 51:52.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
