INDIANAPOLIS, THE NATIONAL

00:03.500 --> 00:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSOCIATION OF SECRETARIES OF

00:04.366 --> 00:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE IS HOLDING ITS ANNUAL

00:05.300 --> 00:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEETING.

00:06.366 --> 00:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE ARE THE OFFICIALS WHO

00:07.533 --> 00:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVERSEE ELECTIONS IN ALL 50

00:08.600 --> 00:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES.

00:09.666 --> 00:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S USUALLY NOT A MEETING THAT

00:10.766 --> 00:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GARNERS A LOT OF ATTENTION, BUT

00:12.533 --> 00:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO THINGS MAKE THIS GATHERING

00:14.000 --> 00:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE IMPORTANT THIS YEAR.

00:15.466 --> 00:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE: JUST RECENTLY A NEW

00:16.966 --> 00:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION INTEGRITY COMMISSION

00:18.900 --> 00:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CREATED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP

00:20.633 --> 00:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REQUESTED ALL 50 STATES TO

00:22.066 --> 00:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVIDE DETAILED PERSONAL VOTER

00:23.766 --> 00:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFORMATION TO FIGURE OUT, THEY

00:25.366 --> 00:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY, HOW TO PROTECT THE

00:26.133 --> 00:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTEGRITY OF THE VOTE FROM

00:27.066 --> 00:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRAUD.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST STATES ARE REFUSING TO

00:30.033 --> 00:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLY EITHER PARTIALLY OR

00:31.633 --> 00:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLETELY, BECAUSE HANDING OVER

00:33.533 --> 00:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THIS INFORMATION

00:34.900 --> 00:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIOLATES SOME STATE PRIVACY

00:36.500 --> 00:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAWS.

00:37.166 --> 00:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER REASON WE'RE PAYING

00:38.666 --> 00:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTENTION TO WHAT SECRETARIES

00:40.200 --> 00:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF STATES DO IS THE SPECTER OF

00:40.966 --> 00:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIAN HACKING.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

00:47.400 --> 00:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIANS DID INDEED ATTEMPT TO

HACK VOTER REGISTRATION SOFTWARE

00:50.800 --> 00:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DURING THIS PAST ELECTION.

JOINING ME NOW FROM INDIANAPOLIS

00:54.733 --> 00:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DISCUSS THIS IS DENISE

00:55.900 --> 00:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MERRILL, PRESIDENT OF THE

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND

00:58.700 --> 00:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THANKS FOR JOINING US.

01:02.066 --> 01:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM EVERY INDICATION, IT SEEMS

01:04.600 --> 01:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVES

01:06.700 --> 01:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUTIN IN HIS DENIAL THAT THE

01:08.300 --> 01:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIANS MEDDLED IN THE

01:09.766 --> 01:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION.

01:11.433 --> 01:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO THE SECRETARIES OF STATE

01:12.833 --> 01:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED

01:14.566 --> 01:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

01:15.733 --> 01:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY?

01:17.766 --> 01:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, PART OF THE PROBLEM

01:18.866 --> 01:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE IS WE DON'T REALLY KNOW

01:20.000 --> 01:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THAT EVIDENCE IS BECAUSE WE

01:21.766 --> 01:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T HAVE SECURITY CLEARANCE

01:23.733 --> 01:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE ARE KIND OF THE LAST TO

01:25.266 --> 01:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW AND LOT OF THIS WE READ IN

01:26.866 --> 01:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PAPER.

01:28.166 --> 01:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THE SECRETARIES

01:29.600 --> 01:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF STATE ARE READING THIS

01:30.500 --> 01:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFORMATION IN THE PAPER AT

01:32.366 --> 01:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SAME TIME WE ARE, MEANING

01:34.000 --> 01:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF

01:36.533 --> 01:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOTLINE THAT YOU ARE GETTING A

01:37.666 --> 01:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PHONE CALL ON SAYING, "HEY, WE

01:38.766 --> 01:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK YOU MIGHT'VE BEEN HACKED."

01:40.600 --> 01:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO, AND THAT'S BEEN SORT OF

01:41.900 --> 01:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A PROBLEM.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALTHOUGH ALL 50 STATES DO ALL

01:44.966 --> 01:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KINDS OF, YOU KNOW, SCANS OF

01:46.833 --> 01:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR VOTER FILES AND LET ME BE

01:49.166 --> 01:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLEAR: THE ONLY THING REALLY AT

01:50.800 --> 01:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RISK HERE IS THE VOTER FILE.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REGISTRY OF ALL THE VOTERS

01:55.833 --> 01:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN EACH STATE AND THEY'RE KEPT

01:57.233 --> 01:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON A STATEWIDE BASIS.

01:58.566 --> 02:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT NONE OF THE ACTUAL ELECTION

02:00.366 --> 02:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EQUIPMENT IS EVER TOUCHED.

02:02.100 --> 02:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT ON THE INTERNET.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AS SOME OF THE

02:05.266 --> 02:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORTING EARLIER POINTED OUT

02:06.633 --> 02:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DAMAGING OR CHANGING THAT

02:08.733 --> 02:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTER FILE OR EVEN CAUSING SOME

02:10.133 --> 02:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFUSION, THAT CAN CAUSE

02:11.333 --> 02:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS LIKE DELAYS AT THE POLLS

02:13.400 --> 02:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR PERHAPS CREATE DISINCENTIVES

02:15.233 --> 02:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR PEOPLE TO SHOW UP.

02:17.566 --> 02:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> INDEED IT COULD.

02:20.066 --> 02:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST

02:21.266 --> 02:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAMAGE THAT COULD BE DONE, WOULD

02:22.566 --> 02:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE THE CONFUSION THAT WOULD

02:23.633 --> 02:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESULT.

02:24.933 --> 02:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALTHOUGH WE ALL HAVE PAPER

02:26.500 --> 02:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACKUPS OF ALL THESE LISTS.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE REAL DAMAGE IS MORE TO,

02:29.633 --> 02:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY, TO THE

02:30.933 --> 02:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTEGRITY OF THE VOTE, THE

02:32.433 --> 02:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFIDENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THAT

02:33.866 --> 02:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR VOTE'S BEING COUNTED HAS

02:35.133 --> 02:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN THE BIGGEST LOSER IN THIS

02:36.200 --> 02:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHOLE THING.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU HAD CLOSED

02:38.800 --> 02:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOOR MEETINGS DURING YOUR

02:39.966 --> 02:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THEY PRESENT TO YOU NOW, ARE YOU

02:45.566 --> 02:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFIDENT THAT ALL OUR SYSTEMS

02:46.833 --> 02:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE SECURE, THAT RUSSIA OR ANY

02:48.400 --> 02:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRIES CANNOT

02:49.966 --> 02:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO THIS TO US AGAIN?

02:53.033 --> 02:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK WE'RE AS SECURE AS WE

02:54.600 --> 02:56.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN BE.

02:56.166 --> 02:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE ARE IN THE ELECTRONIC AGE,

02:57.433 --> 02:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO ONE IS ENTIRELY SAFE.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE LOTS OF USERS OF THESE

03:00.133 --> 03:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYSTEMS.

03:01.566 --> 03:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE THE ONES

03:03.166 --> 03:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ACTUALLY KEEP THE LISTS AND

03:05.266 --> 03:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY LOG ON TO THESE SYSTEMS.

03:07.266 --> 03:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I THINK THE BEST DEFENSE

03:08.666 --> 03:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST ALL THAT IS THE FACT

03:10.066 --> 03:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY ARE KEPT IN 50 STATES

03:12.033 --> 03:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN 50 SEPARATE DATABASES, AND

03:14.033 --> 03:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THE ELECTION RESULTS AND

03:15.700 --> 03:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYTHING ARE TALLIED LOCALLY.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S AN EXTREMELY DECENTRALIZED

03:19.433 --> 03:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYSTEM AND THAT'S A BLESSING

03:21.166 --> 03:22.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE END.

THAT THREE MILLION FRAUDULENT

03:36.633 --> 03:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THERE'S ANYWHERE NEAR THAT

YES.

03:59.266 --> 04:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS IT PROSECUTED?

04:01.200 --> 04:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YES, BUT IT IS NOWHERE NEAR THE

04:02.966 --> 04:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBERS THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.

04:05.066 --> 04:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S WIDELY SEEN AS A VERY, VERY

04:07.700 --> 04:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVERSTATED NUMBER.

04:10.233 --> 04:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AS YOU JUST

04:11.533 --> 04:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINTED OUT, ONE OF THE

04:13.066 --> 04:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRENGTHS OF THE SYSTEM IS THE

04:13.833 --> 04:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACT THAT IT'S SO DECENTRALIZED.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT A

04:16.566 --> 04:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CENTRALIZED VOTER FILE WHICH

04:17.833 --> 04:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS IN ESSENCE IS WHAT WOULD

04:18.966 --> 04:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPEN IF THE ADMINISTRATION GOT

04:20.566 --> 04:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THIS INFORMATION FROM ALL OF

04:21.900 --> 04:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE STATES, COULD BE HELD

04:23.400 --> 04:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURELY?

04:26.033 --> 04:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT

04:27.233 --> 04:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT PERSONALLY.

04:28.533 --> 04:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I DON'T SPEAK NOW FOR EVERY

04:29.900 --> 04:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECRETARY OF STATE-- AS YOU

04:31.300 --> 04:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID, IT'S VERY DECENTRALIZED.

04:33.466 --> 04:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT

04:34.800 --> 04:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT.

04:35.966 --> 04:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY ODD MOMENT

04:37.300 --> 04:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

04:38.733 --> 04:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANGERS OF CYBER SECURITY, TO BE

04:40.433 --> 04:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CENTRALIZING A VOTER FILE

04:41.833 --> 04:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEHOW.

04:43.266 --> 04:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND NOW I'M TOLD IT'S ON A

04:44.733 --> 04:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPUTER AT THE WHITE HOUSE,

04:46.033 --> 04:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH ALSO DOES NOT FILL ME

04:47.300 --> 04:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH CONFIDENCE.

04:48.800 --> 04:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
