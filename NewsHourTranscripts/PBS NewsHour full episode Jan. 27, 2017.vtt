JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.505 --> 00:06.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: And I'm Antonio
Mora.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:08.508 --> 00:10.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: We only want to admit
those into our

00:10.644 --> 00:13.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country who will support our
country.

00:13.981 --> 00:18.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Closing the door.
President
Trump's latest executive actions
call for

00:18.785 --> 00:20.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
extreme vetting of immigrants.

00:20.787 --> 00:25.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: Then, a warm
welcome for British
Prime Minister Theresa May, the
first White

00:25.926 --> 00:27.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House visit from a foreign
leader.

00:27.928 --> 00:32.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: The invitation
is an indication of the strength
and importance

00:32.399 --> 00:36.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this special relationship
that exists between
our two countries.

00:36.136 --> 00:41.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.
Mark Shields
and David Brooks are here to
analyze the first

00:41.208 --> 00:42.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
week of Donald Trump's
presidency.

00:42.843 --> 00:50.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:50.651 --> 00:53.387 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:53.487 --> 01:02.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
has had another
full day, with pronouncements
ranging from

01:02.629 --> 01:04.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
refugees to Russia.

01:04.598 --> 01:08.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spoke out today at both the
White House
and the Defense Department.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins begins our
coverage.

01:10.203 --> 01:12.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: It's big stuff.

01:12.839 --> 01:16.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: With the first
week of his
presidency over, Mr. Trump acted
on one of

01:16.977 --> 01:22.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his most polarizing promises.
The Pentagon
was the backdrop, as he signed
an executive

01:22.316 --> 01:24.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
action on curbing the admission
of refugees.

01:24.151 --> 01:32.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I'm establishing
new vetting
measures to keep radical Islamic
terrorists

01:32.926 --> 01:38.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of the United States of
America. We don't
want them here. We only want to
admit those

01:38.999 --> 01:46.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
into our country who will
support our country
and love, deeply, our people.

01:46.206 --> 01:50.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Candidate Trump
repeatedly
called for extreme vetting of
those from countries

01:50.844 --> 01:56.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with ties to terrorism. He first
introduced
the idea as a ban on all
Muslims.

01:56.783 --> 02:02.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Donald J. Trump is
calling for
a total and complete shutdown of
Muslims entering

02:02.356 --> 02:10.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States until our
country's representatives
can figure out what the hell is
going on.

02:10.697 --> 02:16.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Last year,
former President
Barack Obama welcomed nearly
85,000 refugees,

02:16.837 --> 02:23.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including more than 12,000
Syrians, and he
increased the limit for this
year to 110,000.

02:23.343 --> 02:28.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president also signed
documents today
calling for a dramatic expansion
of the armed

02:28.648 --> 02:35.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
services. And he attended a
ceremonial swearing-in
for Defense Secretary James
Mattis. Earlier,

02:35.322 --> 02:39.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after meeting with British Prime
Minister
Theresa May, the president said
Mattis, who

02:39.793 --> 02:45.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believes torture doesn't work,
will have the
last word on using
water-boarding or other

02:45.365 --> 02:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
severe interrogation methods.

02:47.200 --> 02:51.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I'm going to rely
on him. I
happen to feel that it does
work. I have been

02:51.772 --> 02:57.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
open about that for a long
period of time.
But I am going with our leaders.

02:57.177 --> 03:01.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: On relations
with Russia,
Prime Minister May said she
firmly believes

03:01.815 --> 03:07.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in continued sanctions against
Moscow, for
its actions in Ukraine. But the
president

03:07.687 --> 03:09.523 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
demurred.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: As far as the
sanctions, very
early to be talking about that.
But we look

03:12.826 --> 03:18.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have a great relationship
with all countries,
ideally. But if we can have a
great relationship

03:18.365 --> 03:23.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Russia and with China and
with all countries,
I'm all for that.

03:23.336 --> 03:27.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Mr. Trump will
speak with
Russian President Putin by phone
tomorrow.

03:27.407 --> 03:32.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, he held an hour-long
phone call with
Mexican President Enrique Pena
Nieto, who

03:33.080 --> 03:38.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
canceled a visit to Washington
over the president's
executive order to build a
border wall.

03:38.785 --> 03:43.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump said today's was
a very good
call, but he also renewed his
complaint that

03:43.890 --> 03:46.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mexico is taking advantage of
the U.S. on
trade.

03:46.960 --> 03:52.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The United States
cannot continue
to lose vast amounts of
business, vast amounts

03:52.833 --> 03:58.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of companies and millions and
millions of
people losing their jobs. That
won't happen

03:59.005 --> 04:00.807 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with me.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The Mexican
government issued
its own statement, saying the
two leaders

04:03.443 --> 04:08.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have agreed not to talk publicly
about the
border wall dispute for now.

04:08.815 --> 04:11.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa joins us
now.

04:11.284 --> 04:18.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Lisa, you reported that the
president
left it open whether he is going
to lift the

04:18.125 --> 04:25.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sanctions that now exist against
Russia, economic
and other sanctions, but we saw
today Republican

04:25.232 --> 04:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
congressional leaders quickly
weighed in.

04:27.667 --> 04:31.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.
Not so open
on the other end of Pennsylvania
Avenue.

04:31.738 --> 04:36.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell told
Politico tonight that he doesn't
want to lift

04:36.543 --> 04:41.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these sanctions. In fact, he
went even further
than that, Judy. He said if
there's any regime

04:41.781 --> 04:46.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in the world that doesn't
deserve sanction
relief, it's Russia.

04:46.153 --> 04:50.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, House Speaker Paul
Ryan has said
he thought these sanctions were
overdue. It

04:50.657 --> 04:56.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seems to me, Judy, that as much
as the president
may be leaving an open door to
sanction relief

04:56.396 --> 05:02.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Russia, the congressmen and
leaders there
see an opportunity to try and
close that door

05:02.335 --> 05:04.104 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight.

05:04.204 --> 05:07.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, now on
a domestic
issue question, health care
reform, there

05:07.541 --> 05:13.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was an audiotape of some of the
Republican
congressional retreat in
Philadelphia this

05:13.914 --> 05:20.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
week, and it leaked. Some
interesting material
on there. What do we learn from
that?

05:20.487 --> 05:24.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is just
unprecedented.
These are private meetings where
members do

05:24.257 --> 05:28.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of let loose, if you will,
and say things
that they do not say in public.

05:28.428 --> 05:32.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here The Washington Post and
others have
received an anonymous tape from
this. They

05:32.832 --> 05:37.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confirmed it through several
members who were
in the room. And in that tape,
it shows that

05:37.504 --> 05:41.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
many members of the House
Republican Conference
are nervous about what's ahead.
They're nervous

05:41.608 --> 05:45.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about how exactly they thread
several needles,
including how do they make sure
that premiums

05:46.012 --> 05:50.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't go up, how do they make
sure that no
one loses their health care
coverage, how

05:50.116 --> 05:53.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do they make sure that they
don't have any
political fallback from this?

05:54.054 --> 05:58.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I did get a statement from
the House speaker's
office that these are
discussions that are

05:58.458 --> 06:02.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a normal part of legislation.
But from others
who didn't want to speak using
their names

06:03.029 --> 06:07.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of this is behind closed
doors, they
said it's becoming clear there's
no silver

06:07.634 --> 06:11.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bullet for the House Republicans
and that
this is going to be messy
process with some

06:11.504 --> 06:13.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very tough votes ahead for
Republicans.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fascinating.

06:15.675 --> 06:18.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just quickly, Lisa, this has
been a very
busy week. And you have already
got a sense

06:18.645 --> 06:20.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of what's coming up next week.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Oh, get ready.

06:22.115 --> 06:25.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Next week, we have got all of
these confirmation
fights already ongoing, plus a
Supreme Court

06:25.952 --> 06:31.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominee, we expect, plus the
beginnings of
committee debate over how to
repeal Obamacare,

06:31.825 --> 06:33.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so buckle up.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We are buckling
up. Lisa Desjardins
at the White House, thank you.

06:37.197 --> 06:41.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: In the day's other
news, the
National Park Service confirms
President Trump

06:41.601 --> 06:47.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ordered it to put out more
photos of his inauguration
crowd. That came in a phone call
to the agency's

06:47.874 --> 06:52.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
acting head on Saturday. The
Washington Post
reports the president was angry
over images

06:52.879 --> 06:57.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that showed his crowd was
dwarfed by President
Obama's in 2009.

06:57.250 --> 07:02.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A White House spokesman
responded today, saying,
President Trump is someone who
takes action

07:02.656 --> 07:04.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and gets things done.

07:04.591 --> 07:08.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The new American
ambassador
to the United Nations, Nikki
Haley, is starting

07:08.361 --> 07:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her tenure with a warning. This
was Nikki
Haley's first day on the job at
the U.N.,

07:13.566 --> 07:18.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and she pledged support for U.S.
allies. But
the former South Carolina
governor also made

07:18.538 --> 07:22.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it known -- quote -- "For those
that don't
have our back, we're taking
names."

07:22.942 --> 07:27.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: Seventy-two years
ago today,
Soviet troops liberated the Nazi
death camp

07:27.314 --> 07:28.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Auschwitz, Poland.

07:29.082 --> 07:33.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, elderly survivors
gathered there to
mark the event on International
Holocaust

07:33.353 --> 07:37.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remembrance Day. Along with the
Polish prime
minister, they laid candles at a
monument

07:37.791 --> 07:42.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for more than six million Jews
murdered by
the Nazis, including more than
one million

07:42.295 --> 07:44.030 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at Auschwitz.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOGDAN BARTNIKOWSKI, Auschwitz
Survivor (through
translator): I don't feel like a
guest of

07:48.001 --> 07:53.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
honor here. I always feel either
like a former
prisoner or a prisoner, because
when I walk

07:53.473 --> 07:59.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down this corridor, the one we
just entered
through, I still walk naked,
just like then,

07:59.479 --> 08:04.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because this is in my memory,
and not just
mine. I speak with other
survivors. We are

08:04.451 --> 08:07.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all branded for life with these
horrible experiences.

08:07.153 --> 08:12.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: At the United
Nations today,
Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres warned

08:12.559 --> 08:18.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that anti-Semitism and
anti-Muslim hatred
are on the rise. He said
irrationality and

08:18.231 --> 08:20.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
intolerance are back.

08:20.233 --> 08:25.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S.
economy's growth in
2016 was the weakest in five
years. The Commerce

08:25.672 --> 08:31.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department reports the rate of
expansion was
just 1.6 percent from the year
before. President

08:31.911 --> 08:37.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has set a goal of doubling
the growth
rate to 4 percent a year through
tax cuts,

08:37.984 --> 08:39.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
public works spending and
deregulation.

08:39.853 --> 08:43.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: And Wall Street
finished this
Friday with a lackluster
showing, thanks in

08:43.857 --> 08:48.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part to the disappointing data
on growth.
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost seven

08:48.328 --> 08:55.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
points to close at 20093. The
Nasdaq rose
five points, and the S&amp;P 500
slipped two.

08:55.835 --> 09:00.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the week, the Dow and the
S&amp;P rose 1 percent
or more. The Nasdaq was up
nearly 2 percent.

09:01.074 --> 09:04.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
more on the president's order to
limit the

09:04.911 --> 09:10.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number of refugees coming to the
U.S.; the
first visit of Britain's prime
minister to

09:10.483 --> 09:17.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the White House; tens of
thousands march against
abortion with the vice
president's support;

09:17.357 --> 09:20.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

09:20.427 --> 09:32.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: President Trump's
executive
order to limit refugees,
immigrants and visitors

09:32.705 --> 09:37.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the United States aims to
reduce the possibility
of terrorist attacks here at
home. But will

09:38.077 --> 09:40.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it be effective?

09:40.146 --> 09:44.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We get two views. Daniel
Benjamin was ambassador-at-large
and coordinator for
counterterrorism at the

09:44.517 --> 09:49.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State Department during the
Obama administration.
He's now at Dartmouth College.
And Reuel Marc

09:49.355 --> 09:53.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gerecht is a former CIA case
officer. He's
now a senior fellow with the
Foundation for

09:54.093 --> 09:55.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Defense of Democracies.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is very good to have you both
with us.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Dan, I want to start with you.

09:59.466 --> 10:04.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We believe the order calls for
the suspension
of entry to the U.S. of people
from seven

10:04.237 --> 10:09.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mostly Muslim countries. Do you
think that
will fulfill the order's intent
of protecting

10:10.043 --> 10:11.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Americans from terrorism?

10:12.078 --> 10:14.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BENJAMIN, Former State
Department Coordinator
for Counterterrorism: No, I
don't think it

10:14.280 --> 10:16.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will do anything to make us
safer.

10:16.950 --> 10:23.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since 9/11, there hasn't been a
single case
of a terrorist coming in from
outside the

10:24.023 --> 10:30.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country to carry out an attack.
And so it's
really hard to believe that this
executive

10:30.230 --> 10:36.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
order is going to improve on the
very, very
good job that our immigration
system does

10:36.970 --> 10:38.805 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now.

10:38.905 --> 10:45.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That system has been improved
dramatically
since 9/11. Applicants for visas
or to immigrate

10:45.211 --> 10:50.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here are screened many times
against many
databases with all kinds of
information that

10:51.017 --> 10:56.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
might tell us something about
them, and I
don't think that this is going
to in any way

10:56.122 --> 11:01.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
help. And, if anything, it will
send the wrong
signal and might undermine our
security by

11:01.494 --> 11:09.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
further disturbing Muslim
communities here
at home about their feeling and
increase their

11:09.569 --> 11:11.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
feeling of isolation and
embattlement.

11:11.571 --> 11:16.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: To Dan's point,
most of terrorism
in the United States has been
homegrown. But,

11:16.109 --> 11:22.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of course, 9/11 was carried out
by people
from foreign countries. Do you
think going

11:22.949 --> 11:24.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after these seven countries
makes much sense?

11:24.918 --> 11:27.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REUEL MARC GERECHT, Senior
Fellow, Foundation
for the Defense of Democracies:
Well, we have

11:28.087 --> 11:31.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to wait to see the details of
it, but I'm
skeptical.

11:32.091 --> 11:37.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they need to know what
the Bush and
the Obama administrations have
done wrong.

11:37.297 --> 11:43.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as Dan said, I think the
process has
gotten pretty rigorous. Now, if
they can find

11:43.603 --> 11:47.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some area of improvement, go
ahead and show
us, but I...

11:47.240 --> 11:54.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: Well, they are
calling for tighter
visa screening around the world
and saying

11:54.113 --> 11:59.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that countries who don't help
will end up
being penalized and won't get
visas. That

11:59.218 --> 12:00.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would create a tremendous...

12:00.219 --> 12:02.221 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:02.322 --> 12:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REUEL MARC GERECHT: Yes, but if
you want to
look, the area where at least
scares counterterrorist

12:05.291 --> 12:10.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officers the most has always
been European
Muslims coming to the United
States.

12:10.396 --> 12:17.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, they may end the visa
waiver program
for all Europeans, but I
guarantee you, I

12:17.136 --> 12:24.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- I once upon a time did a lot
of visa interviews
and other interviews. And I am
skeptical how

12:24.577 --> 12:29.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this mechanically works, that
somehow the
officers are going to penetrate
into this

12:29.882 --> 12:34.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situation more than they have
already done,
that they're going to be somehow
more rigorous

12:34.887 --> 12:36.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than they have already been.

12:36.723 --> 12:41.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: But, on the other
hand, Dan,
the female attacker in San
Bernardino had

12:41.995 --> 12:48.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come in and, very quickly, after
her name
was known, it was pretty obvious
that she

12:48.101 --> 12:53.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had extremist ties. So, can
tighter immigration
screening help?

12:53.573 --> 13:01.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BENJAMIN: So, look, there
is always
room for innovation in
human-designed systems.

13:01.547 --> 13:06.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one area that's of great
concern, but
that will be extremely expensive
to do a better

13:06.152 --> 13:13.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
job on, is social media. So, you
are correct
that she is, in some ways, the
one outlier

13:13.593 --> 13:19.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this period. But, you know,
we should improve
where we can, as long as it's
cost-effective.

13:19.365 --> 13:25.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we should also keep in mind,
though, that
more than a third of the crimes,
terrorist-related

13:25.505 --> 13:33.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crimes that are being carried
out by Muslims
in this country are being
carried out by converts,

13:33.346 --> 13:39.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that, really, the largest
amount of radicalization
is going on within our borders.

13:39.619 --> 13:46.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think we need to spend a
lot more money
on, you know, increasing our
connectivity

13:46.359 --> 13:51.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with those communities, so that
we can give
them the tools to identify
people who are

13:51.330 --> 13:57.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
radicalizing and give them
off-ramps, keep
them from going the distance and
taking to

13:57.370 --> 13:59.338 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
violence.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: But it has been
somewhat different
in Europe, where a lot of the
European terrorism

14:01.674 --> 14:07.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been homegrown. You have got
Tunisians,
Algerians, Moroccans, Reuel.

14:07.113 --> 14:12.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, is it just that maybe we're
a few steps
removed from that and we need to
start taking

14:12.385 --> 14:14.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
action now to avoid seeing
what's happening
there?

14:14.787 --> 14:16.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REUEL MARC GERECHT: That's a
good question.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Europeans are in a
completely different
situation, because they have had
giant refugee

14:19.826 --> 14:26.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
waves, where there essentially
was no processing,
there was no security procedures
set up, no

14:26.599 --> 14:28.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interviews, essentially nothing.
They just
came over.

14:29.068 --> 14:34.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in that type of situation,
of course,
a group like the Islamic State
or al-Qaida

14:34.540 --> 14:41.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could implant people into those
waves and
use them. Now, the American
system is much

14:41.314 --> 14:46.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more laborious, much more
time-consuming.
There's a reason why there
hasn't been a sleeper

14:46.252 --> 14:49.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cell in any of the refugee
programs in the
United States, because it just
-- you're not

14:50.056 --> 14:51.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
guaranteed.

14:51.991 --> 14:56.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why would you deploy a young
holy warrior
into a system that could take
years and probably

14:56.295 --> 14:57.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he might not even get status?

14:57.630 --> 14:59.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANTONIO MORA: Right.

14:59.398 --> 15:03.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this order, we believe, also
calls for
the suspension of all refugees
from Syria

15:03.903 --> 15:11.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
indefinitely and for a
suspension of refugees
from any country for the next
four months.

15:11.177 --> 15:15.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Given what Reuel just said, Dan,
do you agree?
Is there any point to that?

15:15.815 --> 15:21.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL BENJAMIN: No, actually, I
find this
deeply disturbing.

15:21.287 --> 15:27.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's Holocaust Remembrance Day.
What's going
on in Syria is the worst
humanitarian crisis

15:27.393 --> 15:35.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since World War II. And we are
punishing those
who are suffering most in this
circumstance,

15:35.735 --> 15:37.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this condition.

15:37.737 --> 15:43.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We vet refugees from Syria for a
period of
18 to 24 months before they're
allowed to

15:43.576 --> 15:49.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come to the United States. And,
you know,
if you will permit me, I think
we know more

15:49.115 --> 15:53.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about them by the time they get
here than
we know about the president's
finances.

15:53.352 --> 15:55.221 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

15:55.321 --> 15:58.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BENJAMIN: And, you know,
it's really
a remarkable fact that we are
punishing these

15:58.825 --> 16:04.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people. We should be taking in
more of them.
There hasn't been a single case
of terrorist

16:04.297 --> 16:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
activity on the part of a Syrian
refugee.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.868 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:08.968 --> 16:11.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: And, of course,
one of the criticisms
of all this is that this smacks
of anti-Muslim

16:11.270 --> 16:16.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
bigotry. And there is a
provision in what
we believe will be the order
that says that,

16:16.576 --> 16:24.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
once the refugee suspension is
lifted, that
priority will be given to people
who are members

16:24.116 --> 16:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of religious minorities in
countries who are
persecuted in those countries.

16:29.188 --> 16:31.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That does seem to be something
that is aimed
at protecting Christians.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REUEL MARC GERECHT: I suspect
that's the intent.

16:34.660 --> 16:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I don't have a problem
with the United
States giving, you know, an open
door to people

16:41.567 --> 16:45.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are being persecuted abroad.
And if that
happens to be Christians, then,
fine, let

16:45.171 --> 16:49.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Christians come in. I really
don't have
a problem with that.

16:49.508 --> 16:54.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I do think they need
to think this
through a bit more, and I think
they also

16:54.480 --> 17:00.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need to pay particular attention
to what they
do with the Europeans, because
the real truth

17:00.119 --> 17:04.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, we don't talk about it. When
it comes
to counterterrorism, the
Europeans are not

17:04.323 --> 17:06.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
freeloaders, all right?

17:06.492 --> 17:11.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The British and the French in
particular are
the vanguard of America's
protection. It is

17:11.497 --> 17:17.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their security services, which
are now overwhelmed
by the refugee issues, that have
done the

17:17.503 --> 17:20.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lion's share of protecting U.S.
shores.

17:20.640 --> 17:25.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, whatever we do, we should
coordinate that
pretty closely with the
Europeans and we should

17:25.778 --> 17:29.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
try not to do things that are
going to make
the Europeans really upset.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: All right, we will
see how this
plays out.

17:31.684 --> 17:39.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reuel Marc Gerecht and Daniel
Benjamin, very
good to have both your insights.
Thanks.

17:39.425 --> 17:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REUEL MARC GERECHT: Hi, Dan.

17:47.800 --> 17:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In contrast to
the ban on refugees,
the White House opened its doors
today to

17:56.075 --> 17:58.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the United States' most trusted
ally.

17:58.678 --> 18:03.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Margaret Warner reports, in
the face of
uncharted waters, there was an
appreciation

18:03.249 --> 18:04.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a shared history.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: It is a great honor to
have Winston

18:07.787 --> 18:09.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Churchill back.

18:09.655 --> 18:13.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: President Trump
had a warm
Oval Office welcome for Prime
Minister May,

18:13.793 --> 18:18.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the two posed beside a bust
of Britain's
greatest wartime leader.

18:18.898 --> 18:24.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And both are now trying to steer
their countries
in new directions amid great
uncertainty.

18:25.071 --> 18:29.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
May is charting Britain's
withdrawal from
the European Union after the
public voted

18:29.342 --> 18:35.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Brexit, which triggered her
predecessor
David Cameron's resignation. May
didn't support

18:35.581 --> 18:40.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaving the E.U. either, but
she's now pledged
to see it through, insisting it
will be a

18:40.486 --> 18:42.254 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
clean break.

18:42.355 --> 18:46.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: Brexit
means Brexit, and we're going to
make a success

18:46.325 --> 18:48.227 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it.

18:48.327 --> 18:52.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Last April in
London, then-President
Obama warned a vote to leave the
E.U. would

18:52.498 --> 18:55.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
jeopardize a future U.S.-U.K.
trade agreement.

18:55.701 --> 18:58.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, Former President
of the United
States: Because our focus is in
negotiating

18:58.571 --> 19:05.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a big bloc, the European
Union, to get
a trade agreement done. And the
U.K. is going

19:05.177 --> 19:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be in the back of the queue.

19:06.746 --> 19:10.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Mr. Trump,
however, was a
vocal Brexit supporter.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: People want to
take their country
back.

19:12.418 --> 19:16.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And Nigel
Farage, the man
who led the Brexit movement,
campaigned with

19:17.023 --> 19:22.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump, and visited him in
New York just
days after his election.

19:22.728 --> 19:28.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Atop May's agenda now is to get
President
Trump to commit to negotiate a
bilateral trade

19:28.634 --> 19:35.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deal as soon as Britain leaves
the E.U. Yet,
President Trump vows to put
America first,

19:35.141 --> 19:40.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and has already issued some
protectionist
orders, like insisting new oil
pipelines be

19:40.546 --> 19:43.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
built with American steel.

19:43.182 --> 19:47.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Britain's ambassador to the
U.S., Sir Kim
Darroch, said what May needs now
is a pledge

19:47.920 --> 19:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to negotiate a deal, not the
details.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIR KIM DARROCH, U.S. Ambassador
to the United
States: As we leave the E.U., we
intend to

19:53.025 --> 19:57.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go global to have a global
series of trading
relationships. I think it's
reassuring to

19:58.030 --> 20:03.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the British public to know that
the door over
here is open to doing a deal
quickly.

20:03.669 --> 20:08.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Julian Borger,
The Guardian's
world affairs editor, said
negotiating an

20:08.507 --> 20:10.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exit from the E.U. won't be
easy.

20:10.443 --> 20:14.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN BORGER, The Guardian: It
is going to
be economically and politically
very costly

20:14.980 --> 20:20.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do. Trump's arrival is really
a political
lifeline for her. She can say,
we are now

20:20.653 --> 20:25.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
global Britain. We look beyond
Europe. We
have -- there's a whole world
out there that's

20:25.524 --> 20:33.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
willing to buy our stuff and
stand with us.
And U.S. is exhibit A, our
closest ally, special

20:33.365 --> 20:38.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relationship. These sort of
ideas and phrases
really resonate in the U.K.

20:38.938 --> 20:44.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Former Deputy
Assistant Secretary
of State Heather Conley said Mr.
Trump had

20:44.310 --> 20:46.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot at stake in this visit as
well.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEATHER CONLEY, Director, Europe
Program,
Center for Strategic and
International Studies:

20:48.481 --> 20:53.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Trump needs a
successful meeting
with his first foreign leader.
This is important.

20:53.786 --> 20:59.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He needs to assume and be very
presidential.
He needs a command of the brief.
He needs

20:59.191 --> 21:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make sure that he represents
the United
States in a very clear fashion
with details

21:05.598 --> 21:07.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and with substance.

21:07.366 --> 21:10.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Ever since
World War II,
both countries have hailed their
-- quote

21:10.469 --> 21:12.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- "special relationship."

21:12.438 --> 21:17.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the 1980s, Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher
and President Ronald Reagan
stood firm against

21:17.643 --> 21:24.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Soviet Union. In the 2000s,
Prime Minister
Tony Blair joined President
George W. Bush's

21:24.817 --> 21:28.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Iraq invasion, at great
political cost to
Blair.

21:28.787 --> 21:35.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the prime minister wanted
to persuade
Mr. Trump to maintain that
security partnership,

21:35.394 --> 21:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
standing firm against Russian
adventurism
in Ukraine, and maintaining U.S.
support for

21:40.766 --> 21:44.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NATO, on which he's sent mixed
signals.

21:44.904 --> 21:48.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Days before taking office, Mr.
Trump told
The Times of London and the
German newspaper

21:49.074 --> 21:54.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bild that NATO was obsolete
because it wasn't
taking care of terror. He
complained that

21:54.847 --> 22:00.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other members aren't paying
their fair share,
"very unfair to the United
States." Then he

22:00.753 --> 22:05.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
added, "With that being said,
NATO is very
important to me."

22:05.791 --> 22:10.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are other differences too.
May, who
criticized candidate Trump's
proposals to

22:10.763 --> 22:16.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ban Muslim immigrants and his
crude comments
about women, is under pressure
at home to

22:16.368 --> 22:21.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make those differences clear
here. She told
a BBC interviewer last weekend:

22:21.473 --> 22:25.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
THERESA MAY: Some of the
comments that Donald
Trump has made in relation to
women are unacceptable.

22:25.711 --> 22:29.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whenever there is something that
I find unacceptable,
I won't be afraid to say that to
Donald Trump.

22:29.582 --> 22:34.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Another
friction point, Mr.
Trump's suggestion that the U.S.
should reinstate

22:34.386 --> 22:39.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
torture and other harsh
interrogation techniques.
She responded Wednesday in
Parliament.

22:39.892 --> 22:43.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY: We do not sanction
torture. We
do not get involved with that,
and that will

22:43.395 --> 22:45.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
continue to be our position.

22:45.331 --> 22:48.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Today, their
differences
on torture and maintaining
sanctions on Russia

22:48.934 --> 22:51.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were front and center when they
met reporters.

22:51.570 --> 22:55.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On other matters, the president
affirmed the
two nations' close partnership.

22:56.041 --> 23:02.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We have one of the
great bonds.
We pledge our lasting support to
this most

23:02.248 --> 23:04.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
special relationship.

23:04.116 --> 23:08.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But he didn't
say a word
about a bilateral trade
agreement, nor about

23:08.687 --> 23:13.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATO. That left it up to the
prime minister
to assert that they'd had a
meeting of the

23:13.525 --> 23:15.160 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
minds on both.

23:15.261 --> 23:17.062 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
On trade:

23:17.162 --> 23:20.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY: We are discussing
how we can
establish a trade negotiation
agreement, take

23:21.000 --> 23:24.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forward immediate high-level
talks, lay the
groundwork for U.K.-U.S. trade
agreement.

23:24.903 --> 23:29.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And on NATO,
after saying
London would urge other members
to hike their

23:29.241 --> 23:31.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
defense spending, she added:

23:31.176 --> 23:34.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY: We have reaffirmed
our unshakeable
commitment to this alliance. Mr.
President,

23:34.914 --> 23:37.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think you said, confirmed that
you're 100
percent behind NATO.

23:38.050 --> 23:43.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: He didn't
respond on NATO.
And on the prospects for a trade
deal, he

23:43.355 --> 23:45.124 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
said only:

23:45.224 --> 23:48.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: My position on
trade has been
solid for many, many years,
since I was a

23:48.127 --> 23:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very young person talking about
how we were
getting ripped off by the rest
of the world.

23:54.266 --> 23:59.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we will be talking to your
folks about
Brexit.

23:59.438 --> 24:05.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: May will have
to walk a fine
line forging a close
relationship with Mr.

24:05.844 --> 24:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump. Thousands of protesters
massed in London
Saturday in opposition to him.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Again, Julian Borger:

24:13.252 --> 24:18.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN BORGER: He's seen as
volatile, unpredictable.
Some of his remarks are seen as
racist. He

24:18.190 --> 24:26.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seems as a dangerous player on
the international
stage, and also suspected
because of his complete

24:26.799 --> 24:34.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refusal to say anything negative
about Vladimir
Putin or Moscow, who are both
viewed deeply

24:34.540 --> 24:37.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unfavorably in the U.K.

24:37.376 --> 24:43.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: So there's much
work ahead
for this special relationship to
blossom anew.

24:43.215 --> 24:51.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

24:51.123 --> 25:03.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: Stay with us.

25:03.402 --> 25:07.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields
and David Brooks analyze the
week's news;

25:08.073 --> 25:12.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and an Asian-American comedian
shares his
experience with everyday racism.

25:12.711 --> 25:17.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Less than a week
after Saturday's
massive Women's March on
Washington, demonstrators

25:18.083 --> 25:20.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
again gathered in the nation's
capital today.

25:20.753 --> 25:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their message was to call for an
end to legal
abortion.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

25:26.759 --> 25:33.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This was the 44th
March For
Life, but it held special
significance for

25:33.198 --> 25:39.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
tens of thousands of
anti-abortion activists,
with the coming of a Republican
president

25:39.605 --> 25:44.443 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Congress.

25:44.543 --> 25:50.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many arrived in groups from
churches and schools
after long bus rides. President
Trump began

25:50.682 --> 25:54.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their day with a tweet, saying:
"To all of
you marching, you have my full
support."

25:54.953 --> 26:01.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at a rally before the march,
a sitting
vice president addressed the
annual gathering

26:01.894 --> 26:03.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the first time.

26:03.862 --> 26:07.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE (R), Vice President:
Because of
all of you and the many
thousands who stand

26:07.332 --> 26:14.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with us in marches like this all
across the
nation, life is winning again in
America.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

26:16.775 --> 26:19.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a cold and
windy morning
here on the National Mall, but
people are

26:19.778 --> 26:24.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out in numbers. And they speak
to us of a
new optimism and new energy
around this issue

26:24.450 --> 26:29.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has galvanized them for so
long. People
feel they're on the very cusp of
change.

26:30.055 --> 26:34.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donna Katzung of Washington,
Missouri, has
made the trip to Washington,
D.C., for the

26:34.660 --> 26:36.295 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last eight years.

26:36.395 --> 26:39.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONNA KATZUNG, Protester: This
year, with
President Trump and Vice
President Pence,

26:40.098 --> 26:44.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, there's a feeling that
maybe we're
going to get somewhere, that
somebody is hearing

26:44.937 --> 26:47.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us, that our voice is out there
and being
heard.

26:47.606 --> 26:52.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The president has
already signaled
he's listening. On Monday, he
signed an executive

26:52.911 --> 26:58.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
order reinstating the so-called
Mexico City
policy, which bars federal funds
to international

26:59.084 --> 27:03.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aid organizations that offer
abortions or
abortion advocacy.

27:03.856 --> 27:08.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also said he will soon
announce his Supreme
Court nominee to replace the
late Justice

27:08.460 --> 27:14.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Antonin Scalia, one with similar
views on
abortion. Many here see that as
a move toward

27:14.199 --> 27:19.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overturning Roe v. Wade, the
court's 1973
decision that legalized
abortion.

27:19.705 --> 27:22.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY ZACHA, Protester: We
would be happy
with anything. Anything means
we're moving

27:22.808 --> 27:27.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the right direction. But, I
mean, a complete
repeal would be our ultimate
goal. I have

27:27.446 --> 27:34.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been hoping for that for --
nothing against
President Trump, but that's one
of the main

27:34.386 --> 27:36.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reasons I voted for him.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The March For
Life followed
on the heels of last Saturday's
Women's March

27:38.524 --> 27:44.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Washington, protesting the
new president.
City officials said it drew more
than half-a-million

27:44.730 --> 27:49.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people here, many more around
the globe.

27:49.101 --> 27:53.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some women today, like Abbey
Bongiorno of
Green Bay, Wisconsin, said
they'd felt excluded.

27:53.772 --> 27:57.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABBEY BONGIORNO, Protester: The
pro-lifers
weren't really invited to that.
As a woman,

27:57.276 --> 28:01.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was really interesting that I
wasn't really
allowed to march with fellow
women because

28:01.613 --> 28:04.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe that it's wrong to
have abortions
in the United States.

28:04.683 --> 28:10.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But they did
march today. Officials
offered no immediate estimate of
the crowd.

28:10.489 --> 28:15.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Abortion rights supporters were
also out,
in far smaller numbers, in a
counterprotest.

28:15.794 --> 28:22.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A recent poll by the Pew
Research Center found
57 percent of the public
supports legal abortion

28:22.167 --> 28:26.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in all or most cases, as high as
it's been
in two decades.

28:26.572 --> 28:30.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we look at today's march
and beyond
with Marjorie Dannenfelser.
She's president

28:30.876 --> 28:34.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Susan B. Anthony List, a
national anti-abortion
group.

28:34.980 --> 28:36.782 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

28:36.882 --> 28:40.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To what extent do you see the
election as
having changed the politics of
abortion? What

28:40.619 --> 28:42.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is possible now?

28:42.487 --> 28:43.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARJORIE DANNENFELSER,
President, Susan B.
Anthony List: It's revolution as
the politics

28:43.722 --> 28:45.691 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of abortion.

28:45.791 --> 28:49.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have control of the House and
the Senate.
And we have strong commitments
from the administration

28:49.561 --> 28:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make real changes for the
first time in
decades. So, we're very well
positioned to

28:55.100 --> 28:56.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
enact some change.

28:56.935 --> 29:00.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The march today
is an annual
event. It was long in the
planning, but did

29:00.939 --> 29:05.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you come to see it as a kind of
response to
last weak's Women's March?

29:05.143 --> 29:08.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARJORIE DANNENFELSER: Well, I
see a contrast,
but it's not a response.

29:08.847 --> 29:13.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happens every single year,
and it has for
44 years, which shows the
staying power and

29:13.585 --> 29:17.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the conviction of this group of
people. There
are a lot of differences between
those two.

29:17.889 --> 29:19.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a clear mandate for
this one.

29:19.791 --> 29:23.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The -- last week's march was an
amorphous
kind of hodgepodge of issues.
You could even

29:24.062 --> 29:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be marching for something you
didn't necessarily
agree with because you weren't
even sure last

29:28.266 --> 29:30.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week. I think that happened to a
lot of women
in that march.

29:30.769 --> 29:35.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, as we said,
polls continue
to show broad support for
abortion rights.

29:35.574 --> 29:40.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As your movement gains more in
the political
arena, why does it continue to
lag in the

29:40.979 --> 29:42.748 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
larger culture?

29:42.848 --> 29:45.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARJORIE DANNENFELSER: It
doesn't lag in the
larger culture, especially the
agenda that

29:45.517 --> 29:51.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have set forward that Trump
is behind that
the Congress is poised to pass
that is a 20-week

29:51.456 --> 29:57.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ban, no abortions in this nation
after 20
weeks. That's wildly popular.

29:57.329 --> 30:03.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no limit currently.
Also, a redirect
of Planned Parenthood funding to
organizations

30:03.535 --> 30:08.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that address the whole health of
women and
don't provide abortions. These
are very common

30:08.840 --> 30:12.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ground issues, and no taxpayer
funding of
abortion at all.

30:12.611 --> 30:16.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are 60 percent, 70 percent
issues, and
that is actually what's on the
agenda of this

30:16.982 --> 30:23.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president, and in the voice of
that one marcher
that you interviewed, it will be
tremendous

30:23.655 --> 30:28.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
progress. Any change in the
pro-life direction
will mean that there is
progress, and it will

30:28.994 --> 30:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come far closer to the will of
the people,
whereas right now they have got
nothing.

30:32.264 --> 30:35.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, we do --
the kinds of
things you're talking about are
in state legislatures,

30:35.734 --> 30:40.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but still the larger polls, to
come back to
my question about the larger
culture, you

30:40.172 --> 30:41.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
don't see too much of a shift.

30:41.707 --> 30:43.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARJORIE DANNENFELSER: There is
an enormous
shift.

30:43.742 --> 30:48.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you ask the question, do
you like pro-choice
or pro-life, you generally get
about an even

30:48.280 --> 30:51.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
split, but generally people are
comfortable
with the term pro-choice. When
you start to

30:51.950 --> 30:55.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
break down what they mean by
that, they are
definitely for late-term bans.

30:55.987 --> 31:00.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, no, this is definitely a
federal bill
that has been voted on by House
and Senate

31:00.759 --> 31:06.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last session and will be voted
on again. All
the issues I mention are federal
priorities,

31:06.531 --> 31:10.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they have the tremendous
backing of the
American people, especially
women.

31:10.902 --> 31:14.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, this
goes to my
next question, though, because a
lot of the

31:14.339 --> 31:19.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
success in recent years has been
at the state
level. Does the focus now shift
to more federal

31:19.678 --> 31:21.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
types actions of the kind you
were just talking
about?

31:21.913 --> 31:23.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARJORIE DANNENFELSER: It's
both/and.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state level will continue
because we're
even stronger on the state
level, which speaks

31:26.718 --> 31:31.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the pro-life movement. And
then now, because
we have the strength on the
federal level,

31:31.289 --> 31:37.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we can finally stand for a
nation for a reasonable
abortion policy, going from one
there are

31:38.063 --> 31:43.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no restrictions whatsoever to
reasonable restrictions
that match up to public policy,
and again

31:44.002 --> 31:45.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
especially women's views on
this.

31:45.904 --> 31:50.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, next week,
as we know,
Donald Trump has said he will
nominate a new

31:50.242 --> 31:57.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supreme Court justice. Do you
see the end
of Roe v. Wade in this and what
will finally

31:57.449 --> 31:59.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bring it? When might it occur?

31:59.351 --> 32:02.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARJORIE DANNENFELSER: I doubt
very much there
will be a day that someone
proclaims that

32:02.354 --> 32:08.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is an end to Roe vs. Wade.
It was poorly
decided in conjunction with Doe
vs. Bolton.

32:08.360 --> 32:13.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Liberal jurists say that this
was a legislative
action, more than it was a
juridical action.

32:13.465 --> 32:19.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what I think we will see is
an erosion.
When a 20-week ban passes on the
federal level,

32:19.304 --> 32:22.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that will contradict some of the
premises
of Roe v. Wade.

32:22.641 --> 32:27.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there will be an adjustment.
I would be
all for overturning it in a day.
I think it's

32:27.679 --> 32:33.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more likely that we will see
modest proposals
that are enacted into the law
and that slowly

32:33.185 --> 32:36.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the will of the people will be
enacted into
the law as well.

32:36.421 --> 32:40.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Many people are
still parsing
the recent election and the
outcome. And I

32:40.659 --> 32:47.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have to ask you, even
personally, I saw a
letter from January 2016 in
which a number

32:47.532 --> 32:52.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of anti-abortion leaders wrote a
letter saying
anybody but Donald Trump.

32:53.071 --> 32:56.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there was a quote in there
that said,
"As women, we are disgusted by
Mr. Trump's

32:56.842 --> 32:59.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
treatment of individuals, women
in particular."

32:59.778 --> 33:02.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARJORIE DANNENFELSER: Yes. I
was the author
of that letter. I was the author
of that letter.

33:02.380 --> 33:03.548 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

33:03.648 --> 33:05.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I know. That's
why I'm asking
you.

33:05.283 --> 33:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARJORIE DANNENFELSER: I know.
I'm -- that's
why I'm saying, good question.

33:07.185 --> 33:10.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yes, I was the author of
that letter.
He was our last choice because
of the reasons

33:10.288 --> 33:14.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that were stated in that letter.
He was our
last choice, and then until he
was our first

33:14.125 --> 33:16.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
choice. And why was he our first
choice?

33:16.595 --> 33:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was, because we are comparing
two people
with fatal character flaws, in
our opinion,

33:21.766 --> 33:26.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at that point. We thought that
we weren't
sure before that who we could
trust. But there

33:26.338 --> 33:30.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was no question that, when
compared to Hillary
Clinton, her treatment of the
women that went

33:30.709 --> 33:35.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through her husband's life, and
Trump and
how -- and the concerns that we
had about

33:35.747 --> 33:39.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the outrageous things that he
said, we were
voting on policy in the end.

33:40.018 --> 33:44.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And policy must rule the day,
when you have
a choice like that, and, for us,
he was far

33:44.723 --> 33:51.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
greater committed pro-life and
is turning
out to be the far better choice
because he

33:51.263 --> 33:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is following through on the
commitments and
become the person that we hoped
that he would

33:55.333 --> 33:56.234 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be.

33:56.334 --> 33:57.235 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

33:57.335 --> 33:58.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Excuse me.

33:58.803 --> 33:59.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just wanted to ask you one
more question,
briefly, if you could.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARJORIE DANNENFELSER: Sure.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just thinking
again about the
causes and the factors behind
the election,

34:03.208 --> 34:06.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how much do you think abortion
was a factor
in the end in Donald Trump's
victory?

34:06.645 --> 34:12.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARJORIE DANNENFELSER: It was
the biggest
factor in any election. In any
election, abortion

34:13.084 --> 34:17.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a major factor. He believes
that. We know
that. We saw the numbers of
voters that we

34:17.555 --> 34:19.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
brought to the polls in
battleground states.

34:19.591 --> 34:25.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the number one Googled
item the day
before the election. It was on
their minds.

34:25.297 --> 34:30.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we brought those votes to
the battleground
states for a win. And he knows
that, and so

34:30.435 --> 34:31.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
does Mike Pence.

34:31.803 --> 34:39.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Marjorie
Dannenfelser, thank
you very much.

34:39.411 --> 34:43.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARJORIE DANNENFELSER: Thanks.

34:43.615 --> 34:50.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From executive
actions to early
morning tweets, the first week
of the Trump

34:50.255 --> 34:54.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration has been marked
by a flurry
of twists and turns.

34:54.526 --> 34:59.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To help make sense of it all,
the analysis
of Shields and Brooks. That's
syndicated columnist

34:59.331 --> 35:03.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and New York Times
columnist
David Brooks.

35:03.168 --> 35:04.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

35:05.036 --> 35:10.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I guess you could say, Mark,
from Mexico
to Russia, from oil pipelines to
health care,

35:10.108 --> 35:13.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it has not been a quiet first
week. How's
it gone?

35:13.478 --> 35:17.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, if you're a
Trump supporter,
it's gone terrific.

35:17.983 --> 35:24.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's done what he said he was
going to do.
He was -- honored his campaign
commitments

35:24.456 --> 35:33.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the wall, on keeping the
borders secure,
or safe, or limited, and
stopping immigration

35:33.231 --> 35:40.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as much as possible, and
building the pipeline
and going ahead. I mean, so, in
that sense,

35:40.939 --> 35:43.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he didn't lose any support among
his supporters.

35:43.908 --> 35:50.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among his critics, I think whose
doubts were
very much, in large part not
simply ideological,

35:50.749 --> 35:57.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but about the temperament of
Donald Trump,
it's reinforced those doubts,
his performance,

35:57.322 --> 36:03.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially the smallness of his
preoccupation
about the size of the crowd,
which he keeps

36:03.795 --> 36:06.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
returning to in a rather bizarre
fashion.

36:06.231 --> 36:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
this first week,
David?

36:07.866 --> 36:11.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: We were here a
week ago together,
and it feels like a century.

36:11.202 --> 36:16.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I wonder, over the course of
his presidency,
can he keep up this pace of news
and busyness

36:16.207 --> 36:19.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and conflict without just
exhausting everybody?

36:19.511 --> 36:24.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I will say, among
businesspeople I have
spoken to, among political class
and among

36:24.282 --> 36:29.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republicans on the Hill,
just a great
sense of being unnerved,
unnerved at the instability.

36:29.187 --> 36:33.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Partly, he's done what he said,
as Mark said.
He's undermined the post-war
international

36:33.291 --> 36:39.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
order pretty quickly. Tearing
down TPP was
a bill that I think economists
say would have

36:39.230 --> 36:44.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
produced hundreds of millions --
billions
of dollars of earnings every
year for Americans.

36:44.569 --> 36:51.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Picking a fight with our second
biggest export
market, very unnerving. I don't
see the -- but

36:51.109 --> 36:56.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then I think the two other
things I would
say is, the general sense of
chaos and incompetence

36:56.381 --> 36:58.116 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on how you do it.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OK, you want to pick a fight
with Mexico.
Do you have to do it by tweet?
Do you have

37:01.086 --> 37:05.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put forward a proposal that
would have Americans
paying for the wall, and then
sort of withdraw

37:05.123 --> 37:09.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it, and then sort of not
withdraw it, do in
a way maximally designed to
polarize Mexican

37:09.661 --> 37:11.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opinion against the United
States?

37:12.030 --> 37:15.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the final thing is, I
wonder, I'm
left wondering, how much of this
is real?

37:15.767 --> 37:19.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OK, he signs a series of papers
that Steve
Bannon and others wrote for him,
but who is

37:20.038 --> 37:23.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to implement it? Does it
make any sense?
We saw that with the Syrian ban
in the discussion

37:23.675 --> 37:24.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
earlier in the program.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

37:26.611 --> 37:28.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: How much of it is
the government
just going to let him sign
papers and then

37:28.446 --> 37:29.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it just goes along their merry
way?

37:29.914 --> 37:31.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I want to ask
you both
about that.

37:31.783 --> 37:34.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, Mark, coming back
to something
you -- well, both of you have
referred to

37:35.019 --> 37:40.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this. Should everyone who voted
for him and
who watched him for months have
really expected

37:40.391 --> 37:44.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what we have seen this week?
He's -- it's
the full Donald Trump coming
forward, isn't

37:44.996 --> 37:45.897 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

37:45.997 --> 37:47.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No question.

37:47.799 --> 37:50.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you know, we have talked
about the
disenchantment, the alienation
of American

37:50.335 --> 37:55.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
voters because voters --
Republicans -- how
long have Republicans promised a
balance budget?

37:55.306 --> 38:02.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
How long have Republicans
pretended they care
deeply about budget deficits, or
Democrats

38:02.447 --> 38:07.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on their issues about the poor,
about really
doing something about those in
poverty and

38:08.052 --> 38:09.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
income inequality?

38:09.621 --> 38:12.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they get elected, and,
no, you can't
do it, you can't do it.

38:12.724 --> 38:18.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, whatever else, I mean,
he has certainly
been against the grain on that.
But I don't

38:19.063 --> 38:24.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think the temperamental -- the
divide on this
week, Judy, I think, is those
who look at

38:24.669 --> 38:29.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump and see somebody
who goes to
the CIA and...

38:29.641 --> 38:31.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last Saturday.

38:31.709 --> 38:35.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: ... and lashes out
at the press
and complains about the coverage
of the size.

38:35.180 --> 38:41.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here he is, going to the Wall of
Heroes, sends
out his press secretary for his
debut looking

38:42.053 --> 38:47.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like a hostage tape complaining
about the
-- about press coverage of this,
insisting

38:47.692 --> 38:49.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's the biggest crowd ever.

38:49.694 --> 38:55.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nobody has ever measured crowds,
except Barack
Obama, because it was a historic
turnout.

38:56.067 --> 39:00.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the biggest crowd before
that was Lyndon
Johnson. Nobody knows that.
Donald Trump all

39:00.905 --> 39:02.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a sudden is preoccupied by
it.

39:02.874 --> 39:05.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's one thing that
happened this week,
I think, that, if I were in the
White House,

39:05.543 --> 39:10.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would be deeply concerned
about. And that
was the Dallas Stars hockey
team, the National

39:10.348 --> 39:15.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hockey League team, plays in the
American
Airlines Center in Dallas that
has a capacity

39:15.853 --> 39:18.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
crowd of 18,562.

39:18.556 --> 39:23.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had a capacity crowd last
Saturday night
right after Spicer, right after
the CIA. And

39:23.428 --> 39:27.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they put up on their JumboTron,
on the big
screen, attendance, 1.5 million.

39:27.865 --> 39:29.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:29.167 --> 39:31.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And the whole
place erupted
in laughter.

39:31.436 --> 39:36.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's -- when you become a
punchline
30 hours into your presidency in
Dallas among

39:36.808 --> 39:39.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hockey fans, that portends a
problem.

39:39.844 --> 39:45.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does he run a
real danger,
David, of that happening? Or are
people saying,

39:45.483 --> 39:49.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OK, let's give him -- it's only
the first
week, let's see what happens?

39:49.687 --> 39:51.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: No. No. People are
in more panic
mode than before.

39:51.656 --> 39:53.124 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:53.224 --> 39:55.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: He's just picked
fight after
fight. This was an example.

39:55.260 --> 39:59.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there are sort of two
theories of he tells
things that are false all the
time. Is it

39:59.998 --> 40:04.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
because he's sort of an
Orwellian figure,
an authoritarian figure who is
twisting words

40:04.669 --> 40:11.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in an Orwellian manner, "1984,"
to exercise
power and control people's
minds, or is he

40:11.442 --> 40:16.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a 5-year-old who has an ego that
needs to
be fed, and the universe has to
warp around

40:17.015 --> 40:20.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his ego needs so he can feel
good about himself,
and everybody has to produce
photos to make

40:20.852 --> 40:23.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the monarch feel like he's made
of gold?

40:23.321 --> 40:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Which do you vote
on?

40:24.389 --> 40:25.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I vote on the
5-year-old kid.

40:25.556 --> 40:26.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: King George III?

40:26.557 --> 40:29.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The madness of
King George III.

40:29.260 --> 40:34.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think, when we see that
distortion,
it's because he just needs the
ego fed all

40:34.932 --> 40:36.768 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the time.

40:36.868 --> 40:40.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't if anybody saw the
-- after the
CIA, he gave an ABC interview
where he talked

40:40.672 --> 40:42.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about the standing ovation...

40:42.340 --> 40:43.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I watched it.

40:43.574 --> 40:44.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: ... at the CIA,
the longest
ever...

40:44.342 --> 40:45.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Peyton Manning.

40:45.343 --> 40:47.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: ... since Peyton
Manning.

40:47.245 --> 40:49.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, first of all, the
employees couldn't
sit down because he didn't tell
them to sit

40:49.447 --> 40:53.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down. So, they're standing. Of
course it's
a standing ovation. They can't
sit down.

40:53.618 --> 40:59.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then the way he went on and
on, that was
a home run, and, I mean, it's --
it's weird.

40:59.123 --> 41:03.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which leads,
Mark, back to,
I think again, what both of you
were talking

41:04.062 --> 41:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about, and that's this question
of facts or
whether they call them alternate
facts.

41:08.966 --> 41:15.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are we going to continue to
debate this kind
of thing for the duration of the
first year

41:15.239 --> 41:16.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or the rest of his presidency?

41:16.407 --> 41:18.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, we are, Judy.

41:18.409 --> 41:23.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will tell you why, because
Steve Bannon,
the president's senior
counselor, chief strategist,

41:23.114 --> 41:27.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said something this week that
was absolutely
true. He said that there is no
opposition

41:27.618 --> 41:29.387 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
party.

41:29.487 --> 41:33.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Democrats lost 958
legislative seats during
Barack Obama's eight years. The
Democrats

41:33.558 --> 41:38.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went into the election of 2016
holding control
of seven states where they have
got the governorship

41:39.063 --> 41:40.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and both houses of the
legislature.

41:40.965 --> 41:47.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, as we sit here,
Connecticut, Rhode
Island, Oregon, California, and
Hawaii are

41:47.772 --> 41:52.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the five states that have
Democratic governors
and Democratic legislatures.
It's 2,500 miles

41:52.977 --> 41:58.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Hartford to Sacramento, and
there's not
a single Democratic-controlled
state in between

41:58.649 --> 42:00.418 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

42:00.518 --> 42:04.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the opposition really is --
Marty Baron,
the editor of The Washington
Post, is the

42:04.956 --> 42:12.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leader of the opposition, or
David's paper,
or mainstream media, because
they're the ones

42:12.430 --> 42:14.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have to call them account.
There are
214 committees and subcommittees
on the Hill.

42:14.365 --> 42:20.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, he called
-- Steve Bannon
called the press the opposition
party, but

42:20.238 --> 42:21.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he meant it, I think, as a...

42:21.472 --> 42:23.241 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:23.341 --> 42:25.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, he meant it,
but I think
he -- whether he meant it or
not, he spoke

42:25.410 --> 42:31.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the truth, because
accountability and facts
are going to be maintained and
insisted upon.

42:31.949 --> 42:33.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's only going to come that
way.

42:33.818 --> 42:39.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democrats are -- on the Hill
are powerless.
They couldn't pass salt if they
asked for

42:39.190 --> 42:43.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it. They couldn't. I'm sorry.
They couldn't
pass the sugar. That's how weak
they are.

42:43.995 --> 42:45.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it that bad?

42:45.930 --> 42:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I do think
there is another
opposition more effective right
now, or more

42:49.033 --> 42:52.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important, which is people who
work in government,
some of the civil servants.

42:52.937 --> 42:56.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have to -- if we're going
to impose a
visa on European countries, they
have got

42:56.541 --> 43:02.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to process it. And, believe me,
civil servants
have many ways to not do
something. And it's

43:02.413 --> 43:04.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
easier for them not to do it.

43:04.549 --> 43:08.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second is Congress, and not
only the Democrats,
but -- that's important, but
also the Republicans

43:08.186 --> 43:11.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Congress. The Republicans in
Congress,
A, they believe in Ronald
Reagan's Republican

43:12.023 --> 43:15.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Party, not Donald Trump
Republican Party or
Steve Bannon's Republican Party.

43:15.927 --> 43:20.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second, they have made this
Faustian bargain
with the guy. They think, we're
going to tolerate

43:20.531 --> 43:25.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him, and -- but just as long as
he signs our
legislation. And if we can get
some health

43:25.102 --> 43:29.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care that we like or a tax
reform that we
like, all that chaos is worth
it.

43:29.707 --> 43:34.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the chaos may turn out to be
too high
a price to pay. And so now we
get in a big

43:34.879 --> 43:40.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fight with Mexico, and some
members of Congress
are very upset that we have
upset this, needlessly

43:40.184 --> 43:43.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
started a trade war, which could
go totally
out of control.

43:43.988 --> 43:47.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of them would love to
go down to
Mexico and say, hey, he doesn't
speak for

43:47.291 --> 43:51.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us. And they are not going to do
it now because
they're pausing to see what
happens, but six,

43:51.796 --> 43:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eight months, a year, they could
decide, this
is too much for our country, we
have to go

43:55.700 --> 44:00.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down, and we would go to Mexico
or whoever
the next 18 fights he picks.

44:00.371 --> 44:05.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David makes a
point, Mark.
You both talk about how much of
what Donald

44:05.877 --> 44:10.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is saying is going to
become reality.
His own party is going to have a
lot to say

44:10.248 --> 44:11.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about how much of it becomes
reality.

44:11.816 --> 44:13.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: They are.

44:13.484 --> 44:16.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And David is a very cheerful
optimist on the
subject of Republican backbone.

44:17.088 --> 44:18.856 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:18.956 --> 44:21.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I have seen --
this man has
taken over the Republican Party.
He's transformed

44:22.093 --> 44:23.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Republican Party.

44:24.061 --> 44:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is not -- Donald Trump is an
independent
presidential candidate who ran
on the Republican

44:28.966 --> 44:35.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
label. He really did. He took it
over. He
transformed it into his image,
in his likeness.

44:35.239 --> 44:42.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will toss a deferential nod
once in a while.
But it's Trump's agenda. It
isn't Paul Ryan's

44:42.179 --> 44:46.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
agenda. It isn't Mitch
McConnell's. They can
stop him. I mean, as they have
already stood

44:46.150 --> 44:49.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up, McConnell has, on sanctions
to Russia.

44:49.787 --> 44:51.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

44:51.589 --> 44:55.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank God for Jim
Mattis. I
don't mean to sound like a
broken record.

44:55.593 --> 44:57.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On torture.

44:57.461 --> 45:01.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: The now secretary
of defense
on torture, Trump has at least
deferred to

45:01.899 --> 45:08.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him, while expressing for the
first time ever
an American president's support,
the full-throated

45:08.205 --> 45:10.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
support of torture, endorsement
of torture.

45:10.841 --> 45:16.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least Cheney, Dick Cheney,
the vice president,
used the euphemism of enhanced
interrogation

45:16.180 --> 45:22.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for torture, which has been
outlawed, which
is illegal, which is immoral,
which is diplomatically

45:22.653 --> 45:28.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
disastrous and militarily
counterproductive
and hurtful.

45:28.359 --> 45:33.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I'm still waiting. Thank God
for John
McCain, quite frankly.

45:33.898 --> 45:38.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David, what
makes you
think that Republicans are going
to have,

45:38.536 --> 45:41.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Mark said, the backbone to
stand up to
him?

45:41.772 --> 45:45.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, A, because I
hear rumblings
of it. I hope rumblings lead to
backbone.

45:45.509 --> 45:51.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, second, if present is
prologue, then
Trump is this whirling dervish
of chaos. He

45:51.482 --> 45:55.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
picked a fight with Mexico.
Germany is not
far behind. He will pick a fight
with them.

45:55.586 --> 45:58.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will pick a fight with China,
which would
be truly cataclysmic.

45:58.255 --> 46:03.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vietnam has been severely hurt
by what he
did this week on TPP. So just a
series of

46:03.628 --> 46:08.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
big fights just in the
international arena.
And, as I mentioned a couple
weeks ago, the

46:08.299 --> 46:11.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
president makes a lot of
decisions about use
of armed force.

46:11.268 --> 46:15.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of those are going to
go -- for him
to make decisions on
questionable information

46:16.007 --> 46:19.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to happen. He's going
to have to
make those decisions. And it
will just feel

46:19.710 --> 46:24.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like the whole American project,
I believe,
is weirdly under threat.

46:24.782 --> 46:28.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, it could be that he just
does this in
the realm of media, and he lives
up there,

46:29.020 --> 46:35.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Steve Bannon runs policy
down here. And
that would just have a
Berlusconi destabilizing

46:35.159 --> 46:37.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
effect on our culture, and have
no practical
effect.

46:38.062 --> 46:42.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I do think he is a
fundamentally unstabilizing
force and that the people who
swore to uphold

46:43.000 --> 46:46.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Constitution are going to
have to take
some measures at some point.

46:46.203 --> 46:49.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Mark, in
just the minute
left, he still has the support
-- the polls

46:50.041 --> 46:54.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support he still has the support
of the people
who voted for him; 80 percent of
the Republicans

46:54.345 --> 46:55.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
say he's doing a great job.

46:55.513 --> 46:59.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, Judy, this
is the honeymoon.

46:59.817 --> 47:04.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The troubles that he's inflicted
this week
and counting were totally
unforced errors

47:05.056 --> 47:10.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
upon himself. So, this really is
a time. Americans
want the country to do well.
They want the

47:10.628 --> 47:12.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
president to do well.

47:12.530 --> 47:18.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We just had -- broke the
20,000-point barrier,
and he stepped all over the
story. I mean,

47:18.202 --> 47:22.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you were counseling the
president and you're
there when the Dow Jones breaks
20,000, you

47:22.940 --> 47:26.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go to, gee, I had nothing to do
with it, but
I'm loving that the American
people express

47:26.844 --> 47:29.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
confidence and optimism in our
future.

47:29.246 --> 47:34.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, he's doing something
with David Muir
complaining about the coverage
and telling

47:34.485 --> 47:42.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everybody to watch FOX News. So,
it's all
-- he's as high now with no
problems. They

47:42.426 --> 47:43.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
haven't had a crisis yet.

47:43.861 --> 47:46.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, this is the
happiest week
for the presidency.

47:47.098 --> 47:51.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Mr. Rogers is having a week,
this should
be his Mr. Rogers week, and it
wasn't exactly

47:51.869 --> 47:52.937 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mr. Rogers.

47:53.037 --> 47:54.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Had to get that PBS reference
in.

47:54.705 --> 47:55.606 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

47:55.706 --> 47:56.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I liked the PBS
reference.

47:56.707 --> 47:57.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I like both
of you.

47:57.775 --> 47:58.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Brooks, Mark Shields,
thank you both.

47:59.076 --> 48:00.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It's Barney.

48:00.478 --> 48:02.346 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:02.446 --> 48:06.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Next week, an
exclusive conversation
coming up. I sit down with Vice
President

48:06.250 --> 48:08.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mike Pence at the White House.

48:08.285 --> 48:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is on Tuesday, January 31,
right here
on the "PBS NewsHour."

48:21.966 --> 48:32.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO MORA: Finally tonight, a
look at the
subtle ways our society often
equates being

48:32.643 --> 48:34.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
white with what's normal.

48:34.578 --> 48:39.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It comes from Peter Kim, who was
a member
of Chicago's famed Second City
comedy troupe.

48:39.216 --> 48:43.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the latest edition of
IMHO, In My Humble
Opinion.

48:43.254 --> 48:49.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER KIM, Comedian: When you
hear the phrase
white supremacy, what picture
comes to your

48:49.293 --> 48:54.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mind? Maybe it's Adolf Hitler
screaming into
a microphone. Maybe it's
white-hooded figures

48:55.099 --> 48:58.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
marching around a burning cross.

48:58.569 --> 49:04.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For me, it's a lot less dramatic
and a lot
more commonplace. So, if I may,
I would like

49:04.708 --> 49:10.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to offer an updated definition
of white supremacy.
It's the idea that white is the
ideal, and

49:11.081 --> 49:16.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we are all consciously and
subconsciously
working to achieve whiteness.

49:16.554 --> 49:21.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, I'm an actor. And,
once, I was
sitting in the waiting room of a
casting agency

49:21.659 --> 49:25.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a fellow actor who happened
to be white.
And I was telling him how I keep
getting called

49:26.063 --> 49:30.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in for roles looking for all
ethnicities,
but are clearly written for a
white man, like

49:30.901 --> 49:32.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
characters named Vincent
Daniels.

49:33.070 --> 49:36.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he says to me, "Well, Peter,
you're almost
white."

49:37.041 --> 49:43.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OK, let that sink in for a
second. If you
haven't flinched yet, you should
take a deep

49:43.480 --> 49:45.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
look inside of yourself.

49:45.282 --> 49:52.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Me, an Asian-American, being
almost white?
Meaning what? That I'm not black
or Latino

49:52.122 --> 49:55.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or any skin complexion darker
than white?

49:55.626 --> 50:00.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In saying so, he's assuming that
white people
are the default race in this
country, that

50:01.098 --> 50:04.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am almost normal.

50:04.134 --> 50:10.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this isn't some ignorant
racist. This
is a liberal creative person
living in Chicago.

50:11.008 --> 50:14.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see, this happens to me all
the time,
even in places I never thought
would exist.

50:15.045 --> 50:20.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
See, I'm a Korean man who's also
gay. And
when I finally came out and
downloaded the

50:20.251 --> 50:25.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dating app Grindr -- spoiler
alert, ain't
nobody dating on Grindr -- I was
overwhelmed

50:25.489 --> 50:28.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by profiles saying no fems, no
fats, no Asians.

50:28.492 --> 50:33.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would say to myself, well,
that can't
be me, because, according to my
mom, I'm not

50:33.264 --> 50:35.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fat, I'm husky.

50:35.599 --> 50:42.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been lucky enough to
travel and perform
all around this country. And
when I get asked

50:42.172 --> 50:47.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the question where are you from,
and I respond,
oh, New York, most of the time,
well-meaning

50:47.912 --> 50:54.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
white people get upset and ask,
you know what
I mean. Where are you from-from?

50:54.585 --> 50:59.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
My boyfriend, who is from
Minnesota, whose
family has roots in Sweden,
never has to explain

50:59.890 --> 51:01.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
where he's from-from.

51:01.859 --> 51:07.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, my definition of white
supremacy is embedded
in the fabric of our everyday
lives. It's

51:07.765 --> 51:11.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in our schools, in our movies,
and on our
televisions.

51:11.435 --> 51:16.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, we all need car insurance,
but you will

something like that. It's clear
to the average
American that it's more
persuasive to be sold

51:22.746 --> 51:27.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insurance by a cheeky foreign
gecko than a
fabulous husky gaysian.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're going
to remember
that one.

51:37.661 --> 51:43.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from identifying with the

We visit the historically black
Howard University,

51:43.567 --> 51:48.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where a college GOP group was
recently reinstated

later tonight on "Washington

ANTONIO MORA: On "PBS NewsHour"
Saturday:
Will changes to NAFTA help or
hurt American

52:10.294 --> 52:11.195 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
businesses?

52:11.295 --> 52:13.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here's a look:

NARRATOR: IBC Bank finances real
estate where
manufacturing warehouses handle
goods that

52:17.201 --> 52:19.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
travel across the border.

52:19.103 --> 52:20.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENNIS NIXON, CEO, International
Bank of Commerce:
Texas cannot survive without
Mexico. It's

52:20.971 --> 52:27.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our largest trading partner. It
would put
Texas in a recession immediately
and it would,

52:27.845 --> 52:31.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
frankly, destroy Laredo, Texas.
We wouldn't
exist without trade.

miles along the U.S.-Mexico
border. Hurd is
a Republican who supported
Trump, but he is

52:41.825 --> 52:44.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also concerned about how the
president may
roll back NAFTA.

REP. WILL HURD (R), Texas:
Uncertainty in
the business world is not
something that you

52:50.034 --> 52:57.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want, but I think people are
also -- they
recognize the opportunities that
we have,

52:58.075 --> 53:05.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I think people are ready to
start having
negotiations on what does a
future NAFTA look

53:06.016 --> 53:07.184 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
like.
