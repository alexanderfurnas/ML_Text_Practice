01:32.900 --> 01:36.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is a crushing

01:36.633 --> 01:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

02:32.600 --> 02:35.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Amri is embarrassing
German intelligence.

02:35.500 --> 02:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, we learned they
had intercepted old
messages in which he
offered to become a suicide

bomber.

02:44.567 --> 02:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Police raided homes across
Germany, and yet still no sign.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Attempts to arrest him for a
fourth and perhaps final time
this year have been complicated

02:57.900 --> 03:00.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by his 36-hour head start.

03:00.367 --> 03:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Though officers did question
several people, four

He left his ID card in a

But today, investigators
discovered he left
his DNA there, too.

03:16.700 --> 03:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The interior minister, alongside
Chancellor Merkel said, "The
suspect is with high probability

03:24.200 --> 03:26.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the perpetrator.

03:26.333 --> 03:30.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the driving cabin,
fingerprints were found
and there is additional
evidence that supports

03:31.233 --> 03:33.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this."

03:33.533 --> 03:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Investigators have traveled
to Tunisia where Anis Amri's
heart-broken family say he must

be innocent.

03:41.500 --> 03:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"If my brother is listening

surrender, even for our family.

03:48.367 --> 03:50.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will be relieved.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't do such things.

03:52.867 --> 03:57.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Everyone knows our
reputation here."

At the Christmas market

04:59.833 --> 05:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

the so-called "bathroom

05:29.700 --> 05:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

05:32.533 --> 05:37.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, it requires that

ice, thanks to a

concluded the Russian government

07:06.633 --> 07:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

07:16.533 --> 07:18.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President-elect Trump has

07:18.767 --> 07:23.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the private cyber

uncovered the DNC hack unveiled

07:25.767 --> 07:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new details they claim confirm
Russian military intelligence

breach.

07:32.667 --> 07:34.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here to explain all of

And Thomas Rid, he's a professor

07:43.433 --> 07:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His latest book is "Rise of the

Dmitri Alperovitch,
let me start with you.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is this new information?

07:54.333 --> 07:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH, CROWDSTRIKE:
Well, this is an interesting
case we've uncovered actually

07:56.833 --> 08:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the way in Ukraine
where Ukraine artillerymen
were targeted by the
same hackers who were

08:01.133 --> 08:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called Fancy Bear, that targeted
the DNC, but this time, they
were targeting their cell

08:05.033 --> 08:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
phones to understand their
location so that the Russian
military and Russian artillery

08:09.733 --> 08:12.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forces can actually target
them in the open battle.

08:12.167 --> 08:17.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, this is Russian
military intelligence who
got hold of information
about the weapons,

08:19.167 --> 08:23.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in essence, that the Ukrainian
military was using, and was able
to change it through malware?

08:25.967 --> 08:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALPEROVITCH: Yes, essentially,
one Ukraine officer built
this app for his Android phone

08:31.600 --> 08:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he gave out to his fellow
officers to control the settings
for the artillery pieces

08:37.000 --> 08:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they were using, and the
Russians actually hacked that
application, put their malware

08:40.533 --> 08:44.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in it and that malware
reported back the location of
the person using the phone.

08:44.567 --> 08:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And so, what's
the connection between
that and what happened to
the Democratic National

08:48.233 --> 08:50.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee?

08:50.400 --> 08:51.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALPEROVITCH: Well, the
interesting is that it
was the same variant
of the same malicious

08:51.633 --> 08:53.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
code that we have
seen at the DNC.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was a phone version.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What we saw at the DNC
was personal computers,
but essentially, it was
the same source used

08:58.833 --> 09:01.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by this actor that
we call Fancy Bear.

09:01.067 --> 09:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you think about, well,
who would be interested in
targeting Ukraine artillerymen

09:05.433 --> 09:10.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in eastern Ukraine who
has interest in hacking
the Democratic Party,
Russia government comes

09:10.200 --> 09:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to find, but specifically,
Russian military that would
have operational over forces in

09:15.100 --> 09:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Ukraine and would
target these artillerymen.

09:17.100 --> 09:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, just quickly,
in the sense, these are
like cyber fingerprints?

09:20.433 --> 09:22.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that what we're
talking about?

09:22.967 --> 09:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALPEROVITCH: Essentially
the DNA of this malicious
code that matches to
the DNA that we saw at

09:27.067 --> 09:29.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the DNC.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Thomas Rid, to you in
London, as you read about this,
understand this new information,

09:32.367 --> 09:33.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what do you make of it?

09:33.367 --> 09:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you see it?

09:35.433 --> 09:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS RID, KING'S COLLEGE,
LONDON: Well, the important
piece, I think, is that we're

09:38.300 --> 09:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking at only one piece in a
larger puzzle which CrowdStrike
has discovered is one piece

09:44.333 --> 09:45.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a larger picture.

09:45.333 --> 09:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the picture is already rich.

09:46.633 --> 09:48.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We know how they
choose their targets.

09:48.633 --> 09:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We know thousands of
their targets even
by individual names.

09:52.900 --> 09:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know how they get in, how
they move around, how they take
information out, we know the

09:56.933 --> 10:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
infrastructure, the flight
card they used to take
the information out.

10:01.533 --> 10:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we're approaching
the point where the evidence
is so rich that there are only

10:06.400 --> 10:11.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two reasons not to accept
it -- one, because you don't
understand the technical details

10:11.267 --> 10:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because you don't have
to skills, or because you
don't want to understand
it for political

10:15.633 --> 10:17.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reasons.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Well, you do have
the technical expertise.

10:18.567 --> 10:21.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does it hold up for you?

10:21.667 --> 10:24.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
RID: Yes.

10:24.467 --> 10:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, what I do is I look
at specific cases and I drill
down and I zoom into the

10:31.200 --> 10:34.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
details of the picture
and look at that detail.

10:34.867 --> 10:39.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we can often link specific
cases like the one that
Dmitri was just describing to

10:41.967 --> 10:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another case because the tool
set that they're using is the
same, really like the tool of

10:47.900 --> 10:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the burglar that breaks into
one building and uses the
same or a comparable tool in

10:51.867 --> 10:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
another building.

10:53.933 --> 10:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, one thing that I'm, for
instance, interested in and that
I focused on is how they broke

10:59.433 --> 11:02.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the German parliament and
that we can link that to the
DNC and, indeed, we can also

11:02.267 --> 11:03.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
link those two cases.

11:03.933 --> 11:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, the evidence is
really strong that we
have at this point.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, the
evidence is really strong.

11:07.733 --> 11:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are you saying there is just no
doubt about it, at this point?

11:12.600 --> 11:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RID: Among people who
studied the true forensic
evidence, among people
who do incident response,

11:20.133 --> 11:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the vast majority of this
community -- and, you
know, bear in mind this
is an entire profession

11:23.900 --> 11:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trained to do digital
investigations -- most
people in that profession
accept the evidence

11:29.500 --> 11:31.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that we have.

11:31.533 --> 11:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really not controversial
anymore that we're looking
at a major Russian campaign.

11:35.433 --> 11:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, keep in mind: this has
been going on for many years.

11:38.300 --> 11:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This particular act, that we
watched them for eight years,
and over the past year, they

11:42.433 --> 11:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
made quite a lot of mistakes
which revealed themselves.

11:45.133 --> 11:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Now, Dmitri
Alperovitch, we want
to point out and we
said earlier, you were

11:51.733 --> 11:53.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
- - your company was
the one that uncovered
this in the first place.

11:53.533 --> 11:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You were working for the
Democratic National Committee.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are you still working
-- doing work for them?

11:58.533 --> 12:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALPEROVITCH: We're protecting
them going forward.

12:00.433 --> 12:02.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The investigation is closed in
terms of what happened there.

12:02.867 --> 12:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But certainly, we've
seen the campaigns,
political organizations are
continued to be targeted,

12:07.400 --> 12:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they continue to hire
us and use our technology
to protect themselves.

12:11.100 --> 12:14.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: I ask you that
because if there's a question
of conflict of interest, how do

12:14.367 --> 12:15.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you answer that?

12:15.800 --> 12:17.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALPEROVITCH: Well, this
report was not about the DNC.

12:17.867 --> 12:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This report was about
information we uncovered
about what these Russian
actors were doing

12:21.933 --> 12:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in eastern Ukraine in terms
of locating these artillery
units of the Ukrainian army and

12:26.633 --> 12:28.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
then targeting them.

12:28.733 --> 12:32.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what we just did is said
that it looks exactly as the
same to the evidence we've

12:32.267 --> 12:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
already uncovered from the
DNC, linking the two together.

12:34.767 --> 12:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, if there's still
someone out there like the
president-elect or others who

12:39.233 --> 12:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support him who say, we just
don't believe this, we don't
think it's been proven, we

12:44.233 --> 12:48.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
haven't seen the CIA and the
FBI's information, what's
your response to that?

12:48.967 --> 12:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALPEROVITCH: Well, I think it's
legitimate to ask questions
and this is why we wanted

12:51.467 --> 12:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to produce more evidence that
raises the level of confidence
that we have, even internally,

12:55.933 --> 12:58.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that this is Russian
intelligence agency
called the GRU.

12:58.700 --> 13:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's also important
for the government to
release their own evidence.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I'm encouraged
that President Obama
ordered this review.

13:03.533 --> 13:07.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I hope the report that comes
out will be made public so that
everyone can look at it and

13:07.267 --> 13:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
make their own judgments.

13:09.233 --> 13:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Thomas Rid, what
more would you need to see,
what more a skeptic need to see

13:12.700 --> 13:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in order to erase all doubt?

13:17.133 --> 13:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RID: Of course, we can always
see more evidence and look for
more details, for instance on

13:24.500 --> 13:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specific names of operators,
and we know that, you know, some
intelligence agencies in the

13:30.700 --> 13:32.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
United States seem to
have that information.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But let's keep
something in mind.

13:34.633 --> 13:38.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What they want to achieve --
what this Russian operation is
trying to achieve at this point

13:38.567 --> 13:43.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is to drive a wedge between
the president-elect, between
the next administration
and the intelligence

13:44.400 --> 13:46.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
community.

13:46.467 --> 13:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so far, if you see that as
part of the operation, they have
been spectacularly successful.

13:52.267 --> 13:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, releasing more evidence and
then having critics possibly
even the president-elect

13:55.033 --> 13:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say, well, that's not good
enough, that is exactly the
outcome that they want because

13:59.133 --> 14:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it introduces friction
inside the security
establishment in Washington.

14:03.833 --> 14:05.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Just quickly.

14:05.033 --> 14:06.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Dmitri, is that what
you see as well?

14:06.600 --> 14:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ALPEROVITCH: I think
it's important to
bring out the evidence.

14:10.633 --> 14:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some people legitimately
have questions about this.

14:13.033 --> 14:17.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's important for the U.S.
government to tell us what they
know because they have access

14:17.367 --> 14:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to classified intelligence and
sourcing methods that we are not
privy to as a private security

14:22.000 --> 14:24.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
company.

14:24.133 --> 14:26.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think it's important to
know what happened in the most
consequential hack we've ever

14:26.467 --> 14:28.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
seen.

14:28.433 --> 14:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And, of course,
we have no way of knowing if
that's what they will do -- what

14:29.400 --> 14:31.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they will do.

14:31.400 --> 14:35.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, of course, we will continue
to watch it very closely, as
well you Dmitri Alperovitch,

14:35.167 --> 14:36.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Professor Thomas Rid.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We thank you both.

14:38.200 --> 14:43.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALPEROVITCH: Thank you.

14:43.667 --> 14:45.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

14:45.733 --> 14:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Anis Amri, the
man suspected of carrying out
Monday's attack on a Berlin

14:52.733 --> 14:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Christmas market, was well
known to German authorities.

14:55.933 --> 15:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was under surveillance
for six months this year and
was slated for deportation.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But his home country of
Tunisia refused to accept him.

15:04.133 --> 15:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining me now for more on how
Amri allegedly was allowed to
pull off this attack is Peter

15:08.033 --> 15:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Neumann, founder and director
of the International Center for
the Study of Radicalization and

15:12.200 --> 15:13.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Political Violence.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He joins us tonight from Munich.

15:15.133 --> 15:17.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's the latest in
the investigation?

15:17.500 --> 15:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NEUMANN, INTERNATIONAL
CENTER FOR THE STUDY
OF RADICALIZATION AND
POLITICAL VIOLENCE:

15:19.633 --> 15:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, the latest is that they
are still trying to track down
where exactly he is right now,

15:23.200 --> 15:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they are conducting raids
on different places that are
connected to the jihadist

15:30.667 --> 15:32.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
scene.

15:32.700 --> 15:36.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is now known that he was
part of a wider network of
jihadists in Germany, and they

15:38.633 --> 15:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are raiding different places
that they seem to be believing
that they are connected to

15:44.033 --> 15:46.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the scene.

15:46.033 --> 15:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Tell me, how is it
possible the German authorities
not just had this person

15:50.200 --> 15:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the radar but were
scheduling him for deportation?

15:53.433 --> 15:54.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How did it get this far?

15:54.433 --> 15:55.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How did they miss the signs?

15:55.667 --> 15:57.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NEUMANN: So, there are
a couple of things.

15:57.667 --> 15:59.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The first thing is capacity.

15:59.967 --> 16:04.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are around 550 jihadists
in Germany who are believed
to be potential terrorists.

16:08.867 --> 16:13.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In order to surveil a single
person 24 hours a day, you
need about 20 officials.

16:15.900 --> 16:17.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not possible.

16:17.967 --> 16:22.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, you know, authorities
need to make judgment calls
all the time -- who do they

16:23.933 --> 16:26.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
consider to be acutely
dangerous and who do they
consider to be less dangerous.

16:26.567 --> 16:30.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this one may have
fallen through the net.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The second point is federalism.

16:33.467 --> 16:38.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police and intelligence
services are essentially
on a state-by-state basis.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And this guy traveled
from a lot of different
states to different
states, and some of the

16:43.233 --> 16:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
information may have slipped
through the cracks there.

16:46.100 --> 16:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: What about the
possibility he was radicalized
in an Italian prison?

16:50.200 --> 16:52.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's something one of
his brothers had said.

16:52.833 --> 16:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEUMANN: Yes, he was in an
Italian prison about four
years, and it may well be that

16:59.333 --> 17:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he was radicalized there.

17:00.900 --> 17:04.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He went further up north
to Germany afterwards.

17:04.433 --> 17:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He shouldn't have been able to
do that because he was claiming
asylum in Germany, and coming

17:10.900 --> 17:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Italy, that claim should
have been refused immediately.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so, basically, the
whole system has failed.

17:17.967 --> 17:22.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's all down to
the fact that Germany is not
really used to being the target

17:24.533 --> 17:26.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of terrorist attacks.

17:26.467 --> 17:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a little bit like
America before 9/11.

17:30.300 --> 17:33.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Germans are quite naive
still about terrorism.

17:33.033 --> 17:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We haven't been confronted with
the kind of terrorist attacks
other countries have been

17:37.533 --> 17:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
confronted with, and the whole
system has not been geared
up to confront this kind of

17:43.667 --> 17:45.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
threat.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Now, post-9/11,
the American system geared
up, to use your phrase.

17:47.667 --> 17:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, how does Germany's
sensitive history with the
surveillance state play into all

17:52.033 --> 17:54.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of this?

17:54.033 --> 17:58.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEUMANN: That's a very good
point because ultimately, after
the end of the Second World

18:00.267 --> 18:04.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
War, Germans before reeducated
to be against surveillance
and to be pacifists.

18:05.267 --> 18:06.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And guess what?

18:06.767 --> 18:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
America and the ally succeeded.

18:09.033 --> 18:13.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Germans by and large
are against surveillance
and they are pacifists.

18:13.133 --> 18:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that means that when being
confronted with this kind of
threat, a lot of reactions

18:20.067 --> 18:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by politicians but also by
society are very much against
kind of confronting this threat

18:25.333 --> 18:27.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
head on.

18:27.333 --> 18:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I very much hope that after
this incident, the pendulum
doesn't swing entirely the other

18:33.600 --> 18:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way, but that we are able to
have a reasonable debate about
what kind of measures are really

18:39.800 --> 18:44.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
necessary to confront
this rather than staying
one side or the other.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Do you see changes
happening now in the interest
of public safety that's

18:49.467 --> 18:51.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
swinging the pendulum?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEUMANN: I think there is
a lot of debate right now.

18:53.467 --> 18:58.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of people are very
unhappy with how the authorities
have dealt with this case.

19:00.533 --> 19:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There is a sense of
real outrage, and there
is a sense that the
system isn't working and

19:06.767 --> 19:08.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we really need to think
about how to make this work.

19:08.967 --> 19:13.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I believe it's necessary
to basically have something
like the 9/11 Commission that

19:15.933 --> 19:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you had in America after 9/11
that basically goes through
I've aspect of government policy

19:22.000 --> 19:25.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and says, this works,
this doesn't work, and
how do we construct a
comprehensive counterterrorism

19:27.167 --> 19:28.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
strategy?

19:28.367 --> 19:29.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't have that
in Germany right now.

19:29.967 --> 19:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't have a
counterterrorism strategy.

19:32.700 --> 19:35.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have a lot of authorities
working on different things.

19:35.767 --> 19:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need a comprehensive thing,
and I hope that's what's
going to come out of this.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: All right.

19:42.767 --> 19:46.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Peter Neumann -- thanks
so much for joining us.

19:46.167 --> 19:51.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NEUMANN: Thank you.

19:54.567 --> 19:59.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: President-elect Donald
Trump continued to round out his
White House team today, tapping

20:01.467 --> 20:05.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two of his key campaign advisers
to senior West Wing positions.

20:05.767 --> 20:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

20:07.833 --> 20:12.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: She's been one of
Donald Trump's most visible
advisers since taking over as

20:12.933 --> 20:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
campaign manager last summer.

20:15.067 --> 20:19.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the president-elect
named Kellyanne Conway to
be White House counselor.

20:21.433 --> 20:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He followed that with word
that Sean Spicer will serve as
White House press secretary.

20:26.600 --> 20:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Spicer had been communications
director for the Republican
National Committee for five

20:31.067 --> 20:33.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

20:33.200 --> 20:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last month, he moved over
to become chief spokesman
for the Trump transition.

20:36.833 --> 20:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, Spicer, along with Jason
Miller and Hope Hicks, will
handle relations with the news

20:42.967 --> 20:45.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
media, and that could
be a tall order.

20:45.433 --> 20:48.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
PRESIDENT-ELECT: The
people back there, the
extremely dishonest press.

20:48.767 --> 20:53.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: As candidate and
president-elect, Mr. Trump has
called out reporters in general,

20:54.967 --> 20:59.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and at times, by name,
like NBC's Katy Tur.

20:59.033 --> 21:00.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: They're not reporting it.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Katy, you're not
reporting it, Katy.

21:02.800 --> 21:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Last month, he
retweeted attacks on CNN's Jeff
Zeleny, after the correspondent

21:09.300 --> 21:13.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
reported on Mr.
Trump's unsubstantiated
claims of voter fraud.

21:15.600 --> 21:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And during the campaign, the
Trump team at times barred "The
Washington Post," Univision,

21:20.367 --> 21:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Politico" and "BuzzFeed"
from its rallies.

21:22.767 --> 21:27.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reince Priebus, the incoming
chief of staff, is signaling
changes could be ahead for the

21:28.633 --> 21:30.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
White House press corps.

21:30.633 --> 21:32.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS, INCOMING WHITE
HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Even
looking at things like the

21:32.667 --> 21:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
daily -- you know, the daily
White House briefing from the
press secretary, I mean, there's

21:36.933 --> 21:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of different ways that
things can be done, and I
can assure you, we're looking

21:41.100 --> 21:43.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at that.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Still, Kellyanne
Conway promised today there
will be plenty of access.

21:46.033 --> 21:48.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, INCOMING WHITE
HOUSE COUNSELOR: You will have a
great deal of press availability

21:48.367 --> 21:52.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a daily basis, and you'll
have a president who continues
to be engaged with the press.

21:52.667 --> 21:57.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: The president-elect
has met with reporters off-the-
record since the election.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has not held a news
conference since late July.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEOTAPE)

22:02.167 --> 22:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: For more, we're
joined now by Brian Stelter.

22:04.700 --> 22:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's senior media
correspondent for CNN.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Jeff Mason, he's a
White House correspondent
for "Reuters", and
he's president of the

22:12.500 --> 22:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House Correspondents
Association.

22:15.533 --> 22:16.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeff Mason, to you first.

22:18.967 --> 22:23.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Based on what you've seen of
Donald Trump so far, both the
campaign and the transition,

22:25.067 --> 22:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what do you expect from him when
it comes to press relations?

22:27.200 --> 22:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF MASON, REUTERS: Well,
Judy, we're sort of going
to wait and see right now.

22:30.800 --> 22:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're pleased to see and we
congratulate the new members of
Donald Trump's press team going

22:37.233 --> 22:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into the White House and we look
forward to working with them.

22:39.200 --> 22:43.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Certainly, there have been
some challenges between the
media and the Trump team during

22:43.167 --> 22:48.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his campaign, but we've
made a lot of progress
during transition in
working on that relationship

22:49.500 --> 22:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and setting up a protective
pool, for example.

22:51.600 --> 22:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I am cautiously optimistic
that we will continue to make
that progress once they're

22:55.867 --> 22:57.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the White House.

22:57.967 --> 23:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Brian Stelter, we
know there has been attention
on some difficulties between

23:01.600 --> 23:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Trump team and
the news media.

23:04.633 --> 23:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think it's been
very different from other
presidential nominees
and people who've

23:12.267 --> 23:14.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
run for president and
people who've served
in the White House?

23:14.400 --> 23:17.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRIAN STELTER, CNN: On the
surface, actually, there are
a lot of similarities, right?

23:17.667 --> 23:22.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The transitions having
daily conference calls
with reporters, it is
putting out press releases.

23:23.833 --> 23:25.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Donald Trump has given
a couple of interviews.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He, of course, has not held
a press conference in many
months, but he's given a couple

23:28.633 --> 23:30.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of interviews.

23:30.600 --> 23:34.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would say, on the surface
however, Donald Trump continues
to wage an anti-media war,

23:34.167 --> 23:39.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a campaign against the press by
complaining about the dishonesty
of journalists, by attacking

23:40.600 --> 23:43.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
individual journalists and
institutions on Twitter.

23:43.267 --> 23:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's doing exactly the same
sorts of things he was doing
during his presidential campaign

23:47.533 --> 23:50.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and this reasonably, they'll
continue to do that when
he's in the White House.

23:50.267 --> 23:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, he told me in June,
he would not be black listing
reporters from the White

23:54.200 --> 23:56.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
House press briefing
room, for example.

23:56.300 --> 23:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has indicated he will
make some changes once he's
actually in the Oval Office.

23:59.933 --> 24:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this anti-media
campaign, I think we should
expect it to continue.

24:03.833 --> 24:07.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: How worried --
how concerned are you,
Jeff Mason, about that?

24:07.800 --> 24:09.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MASON: I mean, I'll call
it cautious optimism.

24:09.900 --> 24:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not naive about the
challenges that the press corps
faces, but I base it on the

24:16.800 --> 24:19.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact that we've made a lot
of progress just in the last
several weeks since the election

24:19.467 --> 24:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on setting up a protective
pool, for example.

24:21.533 --> 24:25.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You may remember shortly after
the election, President-elect
Trump came to Washington without

24:25.967 --> 24:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a pool of journalists.

24:27.333 --> 24:28.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOODRUFF: Right.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MASON: He went out for
dinner one night in New
York without a pool.

24:30.900 --> 24:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Since then, we've
got a pool in place.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not perfect.

24:35.067 --> 24:39.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not on his plane, for
example, but we expect that to
change once he's on Air Force

24:39.067 --> 24:44.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One and we expect a full White
House protective pool to be
in place once he's in office.

24:46.067 --> 24:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Brian Stelter,
certainly, the three
of us understand this
being part of the news

24:48.733 --> 24:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
media, but for the public
watching, why -- what
are they to believe
about what a president's

24:56.200 --> 24:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
real obligation is to the press?

24:58.333 --> 25:02.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why shouldn't a president
feel free to do whatever he
wants, talk over the heads of

25:02.167 --> 25:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the press, if he wants to?

25:04.133 --> 25:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STELTER: Yes, we should do
a better job as an industry
explaining how press freedom is

25:07.200 --> 25:09.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your freedom.

25:09.233 --> 25:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the freedom of the viewers
watching this program, that
we are only there at the White

25:12.333 --> 25:14.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
House working for them.

25:14.300 --> 25:17.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know sometimes there is a
disconnect, a grave disconnect,
and we need to work to

25:17.667 --> 25:19.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reestablish that connection.

25:19.367 --> 25:21.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You know, we're not in
the business of making
assumptions, right?

25:21.733 --> 25:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We should not be assuming the
worst about a Trump presidency
nor should we be assuming

25:25.200 --> 25:26.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the best.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Journalists should
not make assumptions.

25:28.533 --> 25:32.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But journalism lawyers,
journalism advocates
do have a sense of what
the worst-case scenarios

25:32.900 --> 25:34.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are here.

25:34.933 --> 25:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't mean blacklisting
reporters from the White House
press briefing, which the

25:37.333 --> 25:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new press secretary Sean Spicer
says will not happen, which
Trump said will not happen.

25:41.133 --> 25:43.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It could be IRS tax
audits of journalists.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It could be revoking
FCC licenses.

25:46.100 --> 25:48.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It could be defunding
public media.

25:48.233 --> 25:52.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It could be using the Espionage
Act against journalists to
prosecute them for investigative

25:52.267 --> 25:53.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reporting.

25:53.767 --> 25:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These are all things that are
feasible, that are possible.

25:55.867 --> 25:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not saying it's going to
a happen, but certainly, First
Amendment lawyers are focusing

25:59.333 --> 26:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on these issues now, preparing
for worst-case scenarios with
Trump, given how anti-media

26:05.200 --> 26:07.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he has been during the campaign.

26:07.167 --> 26:11.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Jeff Mason, how
would you describe what the
president's obligation is to the

26:12.100 --> 26:14.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
news media?

26:14.133 --> 26:17.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the First Amendment
talks about don't do anything
to abridge freedom of the press,

26:17.167 --> 26:19.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but what does that
really mean today?

26:19.233 --> 26:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MASON: Well, certainly, the
way we view that is making it
possible for reporters to do

26:23.700 --> 26:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their jobs, and that means
having access to the president
himself, it means having access

26:30.667 --> 26:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to his staff and not only
his communications staff, but
also other senior advisors.

26:35.867 --> 26:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's something that the
White House Correspondents
Association will continue to

26:37.900 --> 26:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
press for and, honestly, you
know, Judy, that's an issue we
have been pushing for with every

26:44.300 --> 26:46.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president, and there is always
a little bit of tension there.

26:46.667 --> 26:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Regardless of what party the
president comes from, there
is always going to be a little

26:50.733 --> 26:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bit of a tense relationship
between the press and
the administration,
and we anticipate

26:56.200 --> 26:58.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

26:58.267 --> 27:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we, to answer your question,
certainly expect that upholding
the rights and the freedoms

27:01.833 --> 27:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are guaranteed by the
Constitution in that First
Amendment include allowing the

27:05.533 --> 27:07.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
press to do its job.

27:07.667 --> 27:11.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Brian Stelter,
what does Donald - - the
president-elect's choice
of these individuals

27:14.267 --> 27:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be in the press
operation, his press
secretary, Sean Spicer, the
others he's named in the

27:19.167 --> 27:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
communications office, what
does that tell you about
what his approach will be?

27:22.467 --> 27:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Other presidents have sometimes
gone to a former journalist --

27:25.233 --> 27:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STELTER: There is talk
about a FOX News host,
for example, as press
secretary or Laura Ingraham,

27:31.167 --> 27:33.300 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the conservative
talk radio host.

27:33.300 --> 27:37.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Instead, he's going with
a veteran of Washington,
Sean Spicer, well known
in the press corps.

27:37.467 --> 27:42.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is someone who will reply
to emails, who will respond,
he can also be combative.

27:44.033 --> 27:45.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And certainly, Donald
Trump would embrace
that about Sean Spicer.

27:45.500 --> 27:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he is going with someone
who's a veteran, who knows D.C.

27:48.033 --> 27:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think we should make no
mistake about this, I respect
Jeff's cautious optimism.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Donald Trump is different
from what we've seen in
modern times from presidents.

27:57.067 --> 28:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The indications that we've
gotten and we've received over
the 18 months of his campaign

28:04.033 --> 28:07.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that he will restrict access,
he will attack and ridicule the
press, and he will say things

28:08.533 --> 28:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that are flatly untrue when it's
very obvious things are untrue.

28:10.633 --> 28:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
about these tweets today
from the president-elect.

28:14.633 --> 28:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just late this afternoon,
he tweeted, quote,
"Based on the tremendous
cost and cost overruns

28:21.567 --> 28:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Lockheed Martin F-35,"
which is a fighter jet, he
said, "I've asked Boeing to cost

28:26.467 --> 28:30.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out a comparable
F-18 Super Hornet."

28:30.033 --> 28:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Jeff Mason, when you look
at this, when you look at
the tweet earlier today where

28:37.033 --> 28:40.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he talks about the need for
the United States to beef up
its nuclear capabilities, what

28:42.867 --> 28:47.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does this say in terms of the
news media and its ability
to, frankly, keep up with what

28:49.667 --> 28:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this president is trying
to do, this president-elect
is trying to do?

28:52.200 --> 28:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MASON: Well, it is certainly
the case that previous White
Houses, especially the Obama

28:57.033 --> 29:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House with the age of
social media, have used Twitter
and other bits of social

29:02.900 --> 29:04.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
media to get their message out.

29:04.867 --> 29:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But President-elect Donald
Trump has taken that to a whole
new level, and you're right

29:08.133 --> 29:10.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to say, how will the
media adjust to that?

29:10.400 --> 29:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So far, it's been an adjustment
in terms of just reporting
out those tweets when they

29:17.333 --> 29:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come, and I think Brian was
right, too, when he talked about
fact checking, and sometimes

29:21.333 --> 29:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
certainly the president-elect
has tweeted things that are
not correct and the media

29:25.000 --> 29:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has for the most part tried
to do its job of saying
when that is the case.

29:31.900 --> 29:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it is a challenge and
something that I think reporters
and news organizations will

29:35.633 --> 29:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be grappling with not just
during the transition but in the
months to come once he's working

29:41.367 --> 29:42.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the White House.

29:42.167 --> 29:44.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: And Brian --

29:44.200 --> 29:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STELTER: In the fall, he said
he was going to be restrained
with Twitter once in the

29:45.700 --> 29:47.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Oval Office.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we haven't seen that
in this transition period.

29:49.267 --> 29:53.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If anything, we've seen Donald
Trump, the same person he was
in the 1980s, doing deals,

29:55.333 --> 29:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
doing business in New
York city, now doing
it on the global stage.

29:57.433 --> 30:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, Judy, this contract
for the F-35 was done years ago,
of course, with the Pentagon

30:02.000 --> 30:04.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Lockheed Martin.

30:04.033 --> 30:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to take days to
decipher what he's trying to say
on Twitter, but trying to create

30:07.800 --> 30:09.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the sense of a bidding war.

30:09.867 --> 30:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, this is exactly what
his voters wanted to see crump
do and he's using Twitter in

30:14.033 --> 30:16.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an entirely new way to do it.

30:16.067 --> 30:20.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, by the way, you
know, Sean Spicer, the
new press secretary,
says this will continue

30:20.167 --> 30:22.100 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
once Trump is in
the White House.

30:22.100 --> 30:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We'll see about that idea
that he's going to be more
restrained once he's in charge.

30:26.133 --> 30:31.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Brian Stelter,
Jeff Mason, thank you.

30:35.467 --> 30:38.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STELTER: Thanks.

30:38.900 --> 30:43.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: This week,
Washington, D.C. passed
one of the most generous
paid family leave

30:44.667 --> 30:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
laws in the country.

30:47.233 --> 30:50.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The district now joins
California, Rhode Island,
New Jersey and New York
in approving similar

30:51.300 --> 30:52.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
measures.

30:52.833 --> 30:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our economics correspondent
Paul Solman has the story.

30:54.833 --> 30:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our weekly series,
"Making Sense," which airs
Thursdays on the "NewsHour".

31:00.267 --> 31:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN, PBS NEWSHOUR
ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT:
Diana Alvord feels
lucky -- lucky that her

31:02.600 --> 31:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
daughter was born in September
without complication,
lucky that she came
home just days after she

31:09.500 --> 31:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was born, because four years
ago, Alvord's son was born,
prematurely, at just 24 weeks.

31:15.967 --> 31:18.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DIANA ALVORD: We
wondered for weeks and
weeks if he would live.

31:18.867 --> 31:23.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Alvord, who kept
vigil over him in the neonatal
intensive care unit for months,

31:25.867 --> 31:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also wondered how either of
them could have endured the
trial if she hadn't worked for

31:28.733 --> 31:31.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an accommodating non-profit
in Washington, D.C.

31:31.667 --> 31:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALVORD: I was given the
opportunity to just take a leave
of absence, and so, I was one

31:36.333 --> 31:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the few, probably, who
could return to their jobs
at the end of our ordeal.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But, I know.

ALVORD: Unpaid leave.

31:45.267 --> 31:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I know that there are
many people, that isn't
a choice that they have.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And most people have
to go back to work.

31:49.633 --> 31:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's really, an impossible
choice that families face.

31:53.533 --> 31:56.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do I stay here and
hold my baby's hand?

31:56.067 --> 31:58.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do I go to work and keep
the roof over our heads?

31:58.267 --> 32:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you put a price on
whether you stay or go?

32:02.100 --> 32:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLMAN: Many can't afford
to take unpaid leave.

32:05.333 --> 32:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet, just thirteen percent
of American private sector
workers get any paid leave.

32:12.967 --> 32:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Alvord has seen the results.

32:15.067 --> 32:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALVORD: When I sat at his
bedside in the NICU, very,
very often, I was alone.

32:17.633 --> 32:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Very often, I would look around
the room and there would be 20
babies in all their separate

32:21.633 --> 32:25.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
isolettes, and there weren't 20
sets of caregivers around them.

32:25.167 --> 32:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: The U.S. is the only
industrialized country that
does not mandate any paid family

32:32.033 --> 32:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leave, giving the responsibility
to states and cities, like
the District of Columbia.

32:37.367 --> 32:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In D.C., supporters

SOLMAN: Despite the backlash,
though, this week, D.C.'s city
council passed a scaled-back

32:53.933 --> 32:55.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
version of the bill.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

(CHEERS)

32:58.200 --> 33:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: This means D.C. parents
who work in the private sector
can now take eight weeks

33:01.533 --> 33:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
off at up to 90 percent of
their pay, funded by a roughly
half-a-percent payroll tax on

33:08.567 --> 33:11.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all non-government employers.

33:11.867 --> 33:16.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that, says Heather Boushey,
who studies work-life balance,
will be good for the local

33:17.433 --> 33:19.867 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
economy.

33:19.867 --> 33:22.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEATHER BOUSHEY, WASHINGTON
CENTER FOR EQUITABLE
GROWTH: It boosts our
labor supply, especially

33:22.367 --> 33:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
among women and people who
have care responsibilities,
it increases job retention
for people, people

33:25.033 --> 33:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are more likely to keep their
job when they actually have
the tools to actually make it

33:29.100 --> 33:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possible to balance all of
these competing challenges
in their daily life.

33:33.700 --> 33:37.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And all of that means
the economy is able to
tap into that talent.

33:37.333 --> 33:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: True, says Georgetown
University economist
Harry Holzer, but --

33:41.500 --> 33:46.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARRY HOLZER, GEORGETOWN
UNIVERSITY ECONOMIST:
There is a strong need
to balance the benefits

33:46.167 --> 33:51.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that workers and their families
get from paid family leave
with the costs on employers.

33:52.700 --> 33:56.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SOLMAN: Holzer worries
the D.C. plan will
hobble local businesses.

33:56.367 --> 34:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLZER: They're providing 90
percent wage replacement up
to close to $1,000 a week.

34:03.267 --> 34:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're giving the worker almost
no incentive to limit the
amount of time they ask for.

34:09.933 --> 34:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other states that have
done this provide 60
percent, maybe 70 percent.

34:12.733 --> 34:17.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SOLMAN: But what would
an employer do if it
was too expensive --
the cost was too high?

34:19.767 --> 34:24.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HOLZER: So, employers
can be quite ingenious
in terms of figuring
out ways to get the work

34:26.233 --> 34:28.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
done with fewer workers.

34:28.467 --> 34:33.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another possibility is that
employers simply might move
across the river to Arlington,

34:34.067 --> 34:36.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Virginia.

34:36.033 --> 34:39.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Keep in mind that in the state
of Virginia, no one is required
to provide paid leave to

34:40.367 --> 34:41.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
employees.

34:41.900 --> 34:45.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SOLMAN: But D.C.
restaurant operator Greg
Casten now will be.

34:45.133 --> 34:47.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, will he skip town?

34:47.100 --> 34:50.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG CASTEN, RESTAURANT
OPERATOR: You can't just pick
up a restaurant and move it over

34:50.167 --> 34:55.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the state line to avoid
the tax because restaurants
are, you know, the three
most important things:

34:56.300 --> 34:58.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
location, location, and,
of course, location.

34:58.300 --> 35:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Casten, who also co-owns
a seafood supply company,
complains the D.C. government

35:05.000 --> 35:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
already imposes a host of
costs on businesses, including
a recent minimum wage hike.

35:11.200 --> 35:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CASTEN: This just gives an idea
of how many different laws an
employer has to put up with.

35:16.533 --> 35:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not saying any of
them on the face are bad.

35:19.600 --> 35:23.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All I'm saying is,
there's a lot, a lot.

35:23.967 --> 35:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Casten insists most
employers will ultimately pass
on the cost to the employees

35:29.667 --> 35:30.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
themselves.

35:30.667 --> 35:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: But not every employer.

35:32.700 --> 35:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROGER HOROWITZ, EMPLOYER: For
us, it just really would be
extremely helpful as a way

35:43.433 --> 35:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to retain good employees.

35:45.500 --> 35:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SOLMAN: Roger Horowitz
is the co-owner of
Pleasant Pops, purveyor
of popsicles and coffee.

35:52.767 --> 35:55.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A major labor cost?

35:55.200 --> 35:57.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Employee turnover.

35:57.300 --> 36:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOROWITZ: Between $2,000 and
$3,000 is how much it costs us
every time an employee leaves,

36:00.733 --> 36:03.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to train someone and
to fill their position.

36:03.800 --> 36:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: That's more than the
$2,000 Horowitz estimates the
new family leave tax will cost

36:09.267 --> 36:11.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

36:11.267 --> 36:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOROWITZ: We have an employee
who will in three months
and will not be able to, you

36:23.867 --> 36:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, have paid leave because
we don't have the financial
resources to make that happen

36:28.300 --> 36:30.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SOLMAN: So, key for you
is that this functions
as an insurance policy?

36:32.633 --> 36:34.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

36:34.700 --> 36:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Being part of a larger pool
and working with all the other
small businesses and having

36:38.133 --> 36:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all that money be administered
by the city would be
very helpful for us.

36:41.833 --> 36:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: So Pleasant Pops pays
a small tax into the pool,
like all the other firms in

36:47.533 --> 36:49.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the city.

36:49.600 --> 36:53.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in return, it's insured,
so it can draw from the pool to
cover its costs if its employees

36:55.233 --> 36:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
need family leave.

36:57.633 --> 37:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But economist Holzer
worries other firms
will be discouraged from
employing low-income workers

37:04.367 --> 37:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they think those
workers would be the most
likely to take paid leave.

37:06.933 --> 37:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLZER: They could simply cut
back on less educated young
women in the childbearing age

37:13.133 --> 37:15.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and just replace them
with other employees.

37:15.033 --> 37:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They would presumably try to
hire employees who would take

37:24.033 --> 37:26.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
less leave.

37:26.267 --> 37:31.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: But restaurant server
Shanae Bond illustrates just
how vulnerable workers are

37:34.300 --> 37:36.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as things currently stand.

37:36.767 --> 37:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
While pregnant with her daughter
Zane, Bond's employer axed her.

37:40.833 --> 37:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHANAE BOND: I believe I
was taken off the schedule
because I was pregnant.

37:45.400 --> 37:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that it was just
easier to accommodate other
servers wanting more hours.

37:52.400 --> 37:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Out of work, Bond has
gotten by only because her
father moved in and helps with

37:57.200 --> 37:58.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

always held down a job.

37:59.667 --> 38:01.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's always paid
her bills on time.

38:01.767 --> 38:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She never really had to ask
me or her mother for any help,
you know, until, you know, this

38:10.767 --> 38:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pregnancy and I know it was
hard for her to come to me.

SOLMAN: As for Diana

premature baby is now this
fellow -- an imaginative

38:25.600 --> 38:29.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alvord says the early days she

critical to his development.

38:29.967 --> 38:33.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALVORD: Children's
outcomes are better if
they have skin-to-skin
contact, it's called

38:33.567 --> 38:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kangaroo care, you do it in
the NICU, and it's shown to
lower babies' stress hormones,

38:38.300 --> 38:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's shown to regulate

are able to regulate
their own body temperature

38:42.400 --> 38:44.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sooner, their breathing
is more regular.

38:44.767 --> 38:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the economic argument part
of it comes in when you think
about the services and the

38:48.833 --> 38:53.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
care that the city
would otherwise provide
to these families and
these children later

38:53.167 --> 38:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on down the pipeline, rather
than investing right at the

a greater impact from day one.

39:17.133 --> 39:18.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, we were lucky, maybe.

40:08.667 --> 40:13.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are filled to bursting
point as orthodox Christians
maintain traditions handed
down the generations.

40:15.467 --> 40:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Here, Sundays are for
devotions to the saints,
not for worshipping at
the altar of profit.

40:22.067 --> 40:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The city's bishop has condemned
Sunday shopping as an act
of war with the church.

40:26.533 --> 40:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in Saint Evangalistra
Church, Father Yiorgios
Yiorgakopoulos is more measured.

40:31.400 --> 40:35.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YIORGIOS YIORGAKOPOULOS,
SAINT EVANGALISTRA
CHURCH (translated):
We are of the opinion

40:35.233 --> 40:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from a religious point of
view that the sixth day
of the week is provided
to man for communication

40:39.633 --> 40:43.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with God but also that attempts
are being made to get rid
of what we know as normal

40:43.967 --> 40:46.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

40:46.033 --> 40:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To try and turn us into robots
and machines by making all
the days the same, every day

40:48.933 --> 40:52.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a working day -- all
days without meaning.

40:52.167 --> 40:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRABANT: And this is the
heart of Piraeus' shopping
district on a Sunday morning.

40:56.700 --> 40:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everything is firmly shuttered.

40:58.833 --> 41:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the International Monetary
Fund believes it's time for
this particular trade barrier

41:03.033 --> 41:05.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be lifted.

41:05.100 --> 41:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Liberalizing
the trade market will allow for
small and medium enterprises

41:10.633 --> 41:13.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to get an advantage in
the market by allowing
them to open on Sundays.

41:13.933 --> 41:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRABANT: One man who'd like to
use a sharp implement on what he
regards as Greece's restrictive

41:18.800 --> 41:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trading practices is Notis
Mitarakis, a conservative
opposition politician who
used to be a development

41:25.467 --> 41:27.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
minister.

41:27.600 --> 41:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NOTIS MITARAKIS, CONSERVATIVE
LAWMAKER: Allowing people the
right to work is a fundamental

41:28.967 --> 41:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right in our system of economy.

41:32.100 --> 41:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In order to get out of the
crisis, the key parameter is
to increase production, is to

41:37.700 --> 41:39.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
increase GDP.

41:39.833 --> 41:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And anything that can help to
that direction, anything that
allows people who are willing

41:42.133 --> 41:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and able to work, to
get out and get into
the market, is positive.

41:49.233 --> 41:52.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRABANT: This mall is
a compelling memorial
to the corpse that
is the Greek economy.

41:54.133 --> 41:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's on Stadiou Street,
once Athens most expensive
shopping thoroughfare.

41:57.333 --> 42:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was never exactly Fifth
Avenue, but before the crisis
it was throbbing and thriving.

42:04.300 --> 42:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Greece's mom and pop businesses
have really taken a battering
during this seven-year-long

42:07.200 --> 42:09.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
financial crisis.

42:09.300 --> 42:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In all, a quarter of a
million small and medium
sized enterprises have
closed down, throwing

42:15.700 --> 42:19.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
half a million people onto
the streets and into the
vast army of the unemployed.

42:19.067 --> 42:24.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite vigorous oppositions
from trades unions and
the church, shopkeepers
were given permission

42:25.967 --> 42:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to open for a handful of
Sundays each year at special
times like Christmas.

42:28.033 --> 42:31.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But according to
business leaders, this
has made absolutely no
difference at all to the

42:31.467 --> 42:33.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
level of trading.

42:33.533 --> 42:37.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In its heyday, store owners
would pay up to $1,500 a square
feet for retail space on Stadiou

42:39.900 --> 42:41.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Street.

42:41.933 --> 42:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In amongst the boarded up
shells of former businesses on
Stadiou, Andreas Papagiogiou

42:45.900 --> 42:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is clinging on, just for the
sake of his 35-year-old son
who will inherit the shop.

42:52.900 --> 42:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Papagiogiou has been here for
40 years and on the day we
met, he had sold goods worth

42:57.833 --> 43:00.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just 60 dollars.

43:00.467 --> 43:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREAS PAPAGIOGIOU,
STORE OWNER (translated):
Opening on a Sunday so
far has benefited nobody.

43:04.567 --> 43:06.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're making a loss.

43:06.600 --> 43:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We can't afford to bring in
the staff because we can't
pay them a Sunday rate.

43:10.100 --> 43:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRABANT: This is Ermou, now
Athens main retail street, on a
Sunday before Christmas, which

43:16.133 --> 43:17.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
explains the large crowds.

43:17.867 --> 43:20.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But many of them were
just window shopping.

43:20.933 --> 43:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People weren't over laden
with Christmas goodies.

43:22.933 --> 43:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Sunday
opening, of course, is creating
more, let's say, expenses

43:29.867 --> 43:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the companies because they
have to pay 75 percent more
to their employees for the

43:36.700 --> 43:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sunday working compared
to the other working days.

43:40.233 --> 43:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Therefore for the small sized
companies, this is something
that they cannot afford.

43:47.233 --> 43:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRABANT: Vassilis Korkidis
is the head of the country's
Small Business Federation.

43:51.467 --> 43:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Korkidis claims that Sunday
trading would only benefit
multinational corporations and

43:58.400 --> 44:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outlets like Athens main
mall, which he says can afford
premium wages on a Sunday.

44:03.533 --> 44:05.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VASSILIS, KORKIDIS, PRESIDENT,
SMALL BUSINESS FEDERATION:
The life of a small and medium

44:05.167 --> 44:07.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sized entrepreneur
is a nightmare.

44:07.067 --> 44:12.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He has to live every day
in order to pay taxes.

44:13.500 --> 44:17.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We pay almost 65 percent
of our turnover for taxes.

44:19.400 --> 44:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The 35 percent left is not
enough actually to run a
business for your family to live

44:25.000 --> 44:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and to buy growth.

44:27.100 --> 44:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRABANT: Greece's plight was
high on President Obama's list
of priorities when he visited

44:32.000 --> 44:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Athens just after the election.

44:33.700 --> 44:35.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He made it clear that
Greeks deserves a break.

44:35.767 --> 44:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES: In order to make
reforms sustainable the Greek

44:40.300 --> 44:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economy needs the space
to return to growth and
start creating jobs again.

44:46.467 --> 44:49.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The IMF has said that
debt relief is crucial.

44:49.867 --> 44:54.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I will continue to urge
creditors to take the
steps needed to put
Greece on a path towards

44:56.767 --> 44:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a durable economic recovery
because it's in all of our
interests that Greece succeeds.

45:02.533 --> 45:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRABANT: Greece's beleaguered
prime minister, Alexis Tsipras,
has angered the country's

45:06.100 --> 45:08.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
creditors by repeatedly
reneging on promises.

45:08.933 --> 45:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEXIS TSIPRAS, PRIME MINISTER,
GREECE (through translator): The
Greek economy and our society,

45:12.600 --> 45:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after seven whole years,
cannot take any more austerity.

45:16.200 --> 45:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRABANT: But the European Union,
which has provided most of
Greece's bail out cash ignored

45:21.933 --> 45:23.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the U.S. president.

45:23.867 --> 45:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Analyst Nick Malkoutzis
believes that any recovery will
be further delayed while the

45:28.100 --> 45:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IMF and European Union disagree
over what is the next step.

45:31.833 --> 45:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK MALKOUTZIS, ANALYST: The
Europeans are reluctant to
provide the debt relief that

45:38.000 --> 45:40.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Greece needs because
of political reasons.

45:40.867 --> 45:45.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The IMF is reluctant to back
down on what it sees as the
structural side which it thinks

45:47.033 --> 45:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is very important
moving forward.

45:49.333 --> 45:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's wrong and
right on both sides.

45:50.733 --> 45:53.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The problem is Greece is
caught between the two.

45:53.633 --> 45:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The finance minister likened it
to be being trapped between two
elephants that were fighting

45:58.400 --> 46:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that's the reality
for Greece at the moment.

46:02.033 --> 46:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRABANT: The financial
crisis may mean hardship
that will last a generation.

46:06.400 --> 46:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But at St. Evangelistra's
Church, theologian Ilias Liamis
was resolute over the issue of

46:12.367 --> 46:14.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Sunday trading.

46:14.367 --> 46:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ILIAS LIAMIS, THEOLOGIAN
(through translator): This is an
attempt to eradicate the better

46:20.467 --> 46:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things in life -- the joy of
meeting up with a friend ,the
joy of having a day when your

46:23.733 --> 46:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mind will not be occupied solely
with numbers, cash and consumer
goods, the concept of having

46:29.900 --> 46:31.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a day to relax and
rest one's soul.

46:31.967 --> 46:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This concept seems to be
considered as something
that should no longer exist.

46:36.033 --> 46:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The important thing here is
that this is a challenge urging
us to change the way we think.

46:40.833 --> 46:44.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YIORGAKOPOULOS (through
translator): The crisis is
basically a spiritual one.

46:44.767 --> 46:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People themselves decide how
they will live their lives, just
as those older than us lived

46:48.633 --> 46:50.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with less and were happy.

46:50.267 --> 46:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So will we learn to live with
less money and still be happy.

46:54.133 --> 46:59.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BRABANT: This woman is
unburdening her troubles
to Saint Spyridon.

47:01.133 --> 47:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Elsewhere millions of Greeks
are crying silent tears of anger
at what they perceive as the

47:05.733 --> 47:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
injustice of a never
ending financial crisis.

47:07.933 --> 47:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour", I'm
Malcolm Brabant in Athens.

an author channeling his inner
child through graphic novels.

47:25.133 --> 47:28.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown sits down with
Gene Luen Yang, one of this
year's MacArthur Genius Award

47:28.867 --> 47:29.867 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
winners.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

47:31.900 --> 47:32.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GENE LUEN YANG, AMBASSADOR
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE'S LITERATURE:
I'm super excited to be here

47:32.567 --> 47:33.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with you.

47:33.933 --> 47:36.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
My name is gene.

47:36.033 --> 47:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN, PBS NEWSHOUR
CORRESPONDENT: Gene Luen Yang
can seem like one of the kids

47:37.800 --> 47:39.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
himself.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
YANG: This is what I
look like in real life.

47:41.133 --> 47:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is what I look like as
a cartoon and this morning,
what I'm going to do is I'm

47:44.733 --> 47:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to share with you
about two things that I love.

47:48.233 --> 47:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: Sharing things he loves
is now part of his official job
description, as the national

47:55.233 --> 47:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ambassador for Young People's
Literature, an honor given
him by the Library of Congress

47:58.300 --> 48:00.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
earlier this year.

48:00.200 --> 48:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the two things he loves?

48:02.400 --> 48:04.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Comic books and coding.

48:04.433 --> 48:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We spoke recently as he
visited Stonewall Middle
School in Manassas, Virginia.

48:08.433 --> 48:10.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
YANG: I think
they're so related.

48:10.567 --> 48:15.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coding and writing stories,
I really feel like I use the
same parts of my brain to do

48:15.867 --> 48:17.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
both, right?

48:17.833 --> 48:20.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you're making a comic what
you do if you take a fairly
complex storyline, and you

48:20.367 --> 48:22.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have to break it up
into individual panels.

48:22.567 --> 48:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And coding is very
much the same way.

48:24.533 --> 48:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You take a complex concept
and you break it up
into individual lines.

48:28.233 --> 48:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's all about taking the
complex and breaking it into
simple, understandable pieces.

48:32.400 --> 48:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: I don't think everybody
thinks of it that way, thinks
of the connection between

48:36.200 --> 48:38.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
writing and coding.

48:38.133 --> 48:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YANG: I think there is a
tendency in modern American
culture to separate the sciences

48:44.300 --> 48:47.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
from the arts, and to
me it just feels like
such a false dichotomy.

48:47.967 --> 48:50.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You know, there are
so many people who are
interested in both.

48:50.500 --> 48:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are so many people
pursuing both and who want
to become good at both.

48:54.600 --> 48:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: Yang began drawing as
a young child and creating
comics and graphic novels by

48:59.133 --> 49:01.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fifth grade.

49:01.233 --> 49:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The son of Chinese immigrants,
he grew up in California,
majoring in computer science

49:06.267 --> 49:07.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at U.C.

49:07.500 --> 49:09.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Berkeley with a minor
in creative writing.

49:09.533 --> 49:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He taught computer science at
an Oakland, California high
school for 17 years before

49:15.133 --> 49:17.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
turning to full-time writing.

49:17.167 --> 49:21.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In 2006, his "American
Born Chinese" became
the first graphic novel
to be nominated for

49:22.700 --> 49:25.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a National Book Award.

49:25.167 --> 49:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the two-volume
"Boxers and Saints,"
about the boxer rebellion
in China, also received

49:30.200 --> 49:32.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a nomination, in 2013.

49:32.400 --> 49:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What is it about comics,
or graphic novels,
that somehow works?

49:36.500 --> 49:38.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Because not everybody
gets it, right?

49:38.433 --> 49:39.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
YANG: Yes, yes, yes.

49:39.933 --> 49:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For me, I love the combination
of the visual with the text.

49:43.733 --> 49:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And as a reader, I just
think that the interplay
between pictures and
words can be so complex.

49:50.767 --> 49:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, like in the hands of
a really good cartoonist, you
can get some really amazing

49:53.433 --> 49:55.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
things out.

49:55.500 --> 49:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: I see you with the kids
and you play up their kind
of insecurities that you had,

50:00.600 --> 50:01.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
right, you're very
upfront about that.

50:01.667 --> 50:02.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
YANG: Yes.

50:02.933 --> 50:04.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BROWN: "I'm a nerd, I
was this, I was that."

50:04.733 --> 50:06.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

50:06.000 --> 50:08.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
YANG: Well, first,
because it's true!

50:08.900 --> 50:12.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, this is what I realized
as an adult, as somebody who
has been doing comics for

50:12.767 --> 50:15.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
almost 20 years now, that
self-doubt just never goes away.

50:15.667 --> 50:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's constantly with you and
I think that's true for maybe
not every creator but almost

50:20.533 --> 50:22.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every creator.

50:22.600 --> 50:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Getting over that self doubt
is huge and to realize that
even adults have those issues,

50:28.500 --> 50:30.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think it's important.

50:30.567 --> 50:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: He's been an advocate
for diversifying the faces and
stories of graphic novels --

50:34.633 --> 50:35.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
YANG: Are you Chinese?

50:35.833 --> 50:37.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:
Yes, I'm from Shanghai.

50:37.867 --> 50:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: -- and made the
Chinese-American experience
one of his main subjects.

50:41.400 --> 50:45.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YANG: Growing up, I did go
through a period when I really
struggled with my own ethnic

50:45.967 --> 50:48.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
heritage.

50:48.467 --> 50:51.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember being in
late elementary school
and junior high and
realizing that who I was,

50:54.433 --> 50:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the culture that I came
from made me different from
most of the kids around me.

50:58.100 --> 51:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you get -- like I think
every kid goes through this
period where you want to excise

51:01.500 --> 51:03.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all the stuff that
makes you different.

51:03.533 --> 51:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took me a really long time
to come to a place where I
felt like I accepted myself

51:07.467 --> 51:09.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as a Chinese-American.

51:09.900 --> 51:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of my work is about
that, is about how you can build
an identity out of two pieces

51:16.500 --> 51:19.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that don't always
easily fit together.

51:19.200 --> 51:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: Just connected with
the students, his avid
readers, on this visit.

51:23.500 --> 51:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can
be an outsider to different
situation like different cliques

51:29.900 --> 51:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and groups and sometimes
it feels like that in life.

51:33.633 --> 51:37.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I
know about like binary
numbers before, and it
was cool how he showed

51:37.233 --> 51:42.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
us like the 1,100 could
be like 12, I was like,
whoa, that is so cool.

51:43.667 --> 51:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YANG: Reading is a great
way of exploring the world.

51:46.933 --> 51:49.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Every ambassador
picked a platform.

51:49.533 --> 51:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The platform that I chose
was "reading without
walls", and by that, I
mean just getting outside

51:54.867 --> 51:57.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your own comfort
zones through books.

51:57.033 --> 52:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the best things about
books is that it gives you a
window into somebody else's

52:00.700 --> 52:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mind, into somebody else's soul.

52:02.700 --> 52:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I'm challenging kids to
read books about people who
aren't like them, who don't look

52:08.467 --> 52:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like them or live like them.

52:10.500 --> 52:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number two, read books
about subject matter they
might find intimidating.

52:12.833 --> 52:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, number three, read books
in different sorts of formats.

52:15.900 --> 52:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if you've never read a
graphic novel, you've never
read a book in verse or even

52:19.433 --> 52:21.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a chapter book, I want
you to give it a try.

52:21.533 --> 52:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what I'm going to do now
is show you what logo looks
like on a modern computer.

52:25.233 --> 52:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: Even while taking on
his duties as an ambassador for
reading, Gene Yang continues

52:30.167 --> 52:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to work on a variety of
projects, including a graphic
novel version of the television

52:35.100 --> 52:40.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
show, "Avatar: The Last
Airbender", and a D.C.
comics' new series about
a Chinese Superman.

52:42.533 --> 52:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Coming up: a nonfiction graphic
novel about race and sports.

52:49.100 --> 52:52.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Manassas, Virginia,
I'm Jeffrey Brown for
the "PBS NewsHour".

WOODRUFF: And a news update:
police in Melbourne, Australia,
have arrested seven suspects who

53:07.133 --> 53:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allegedly planned a series of
Christmas Day bomb attacks.

53:11.033 --> 53:15.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Officials said they were
inspired by the Islamic
State group, and were
set to attack three

53:15.767 --> 53:17.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
major sites.

53:17.800 --> 53:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online,
"Passengers" is a new space
thriller film based in part on

53:24.000 --> 53:26.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
real mental health issues
experienced by astronauts.

53:26.867 --> 53:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, how real is the movie plot?

53:46.533 --> 53:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: We won't be singing.

SREENIVASAN: No.

53:48.533 --> 53:49.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
