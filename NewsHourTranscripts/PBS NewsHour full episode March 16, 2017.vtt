JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.239 --> 00:07.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.040 --> 00:11.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
President Trump's
hard power budget proposal
slashes funding

00:11.478 --> 00:17.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to environmental protection,
agriculture and
health research, while big
increases go to

00:17.584 --> 00:23.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
defense and border security -- a
look at his
efforts to reshape the federal
government.

00:23.323 --> 00:28.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then: the high stakes
surrounding the president's
revised travel ban.

00:28.262 --> 00:35.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two federal judges freeze the
new executive
order hours before it was to
take effect.

00:35.102 --> 00:41.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And while people with
disabilities are still
systematically sidelined for
jobs, why one

00:41.208 --> 00:43.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
company is making an effort to
hire more.

00:43.577 --> 00:48.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMELL MITCHELL, EY Americas: As
opposed to
possibly a neurotypical person
that may try

00:48.849 --> 00:55.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to slide in at 9:10, the folks
that are on
the spectrum will say, hey, I
arrived at 9:02

00:55.722 --> 00:56.690 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do I need to work until 6:02?

00:58.425 --> 01:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:06.633 --> 01:09.469 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:09.503 --> 01:18.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Much more for the
military,
much less for many diplomatic
and domestic

01:18.845 --> 01:25.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
programs, that's the upshot of
President Trump's
first budget unveiled today.

01:25.552 --> 01:28.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage at
the White
House.

01:28.455 --> 01:37.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It runs just 53
pages, totals more
than $1.1 trillion, and embodies
stark changes

01:37.764 --> 01:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in federal spending priorities.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Budget Director Mick Mulvaney:

01:42.102 --> 01:44.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY, White House
Budget Director:
We had America first -- an
America first candidate.

01:44.638 --> 01:47.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We now have an America first
president.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it shouldn't surprise
anybody that we
have an America first budget.

01:49.910 --> 01:53.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The big winners in
the White House
budget request?

01:53.246 --> 01:58.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Pentagon, with a proposed 10
percent increase,
$54 billion.

01:59.019 --> 02:04.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Department of Homeland
Security with a
7 percent hike, including $4
billion for the

02:04.057 --> 02:05.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mexico border wall.

02:05.726 --> 02:09.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Department of Veteran
Affairs, proposed
to increase by 6 percent.

02:09.429 --> 02:11.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MICK MULVANEY: We're $20
trillion in debt.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're going to spend money.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to spend a lot of
money, but we're
not going to spend it on
programs that cannot

02:15.802 --> 02:19.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
show that they actually deliver
the promises
they made to people.

02:19.272 --> 02:23.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The biggest losers
would include
the Environmental Protection
Agency with a

02:23.543 --> 02:29.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
proposed 31 percent cut,
eliminating funding
for international climate change
programs

02:29.883 --> 02:33.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and for cleanup efforts in the
Chesapeake
Bay and Great Lakes.

02:33.387 --> 02:39.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The State Department would be
cut 29 percent,
mostly foreign aid and U.N.
peacekeeping.

02:39.226 --> 02:44.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Department of Health and
Human Services
is being asked to take an 18
percent cut.

02:44.898 --> 02:49.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While the White House wants
Congress to cut
Justice Department spending by 4
percent,

02:49.036 --> 02:54.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it wants more money to target
criminal organizations
and hire immigration judges, at
the expense

02:54.808 --> 02:56.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of civil rights programs.

02:56.743 --> 03:02.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Tokyo, Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson
said the proposed cuts in his
budget are fine

03:02.215 --> 03:04.051 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with him.

03:04.084 --> 03:07.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: Clearly,
the level of spending that the
State Department

03:07.054 --> 03:12.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been undertaking in the
past, in particular
this past year, is simply not
sustainable.

03:12.225 --> 03:16.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Trump
tweeted that his
budget proposal puts America
first.

03:16.463 --> 03:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Must make safety its number one
priority."

03:19.933 --> 03:25.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It represents the biggest
military buildup
since the 1980s and the most
sweeping reductions

03:25.172 --> 03:29.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in other spending since World
War II.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats immediately condemned
the budget
request.

03:31.411 --> 03:36.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Minority Leader Nancy
Pelosi said it
takes from the middle class and
gives to the

03:36.049 --> 03:37.017 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rich.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.785 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:38.819 --> 03:39.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader:
This budget is not a statement
of values of

03:39.586 --> 03:41.321 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
anyone.

03:41.354 --> 03:45.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump has shown that
he doesn't
value the future of our children
and working

03:46.026 --> 03:47.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
families.

03:47.260 --> 03:50.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This budget is really a slap in
the face of
the future.

03:50.530 --> 03:56.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Overall, the
administration wants
to eliminate funding for 19
agencies, including

03:56.303 --> 04:01.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the National Endowment for the
Arts, AmeriCorps
and the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting,

04:01.708 --> 04:05.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a major funder for public radio
and television.

04:05.145 --> 04:09.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other points of contention are
likely to be
calls to eliminate community
development block

04:09.516 --> 04:14.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grants, and cut billions of
dollars for teacher
training, after-school and
summer programs

04:14.821 --> 04:19.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and almost $100 million from the
Rural Business
and Cooperative Service.

04:20.026 --> 04:24.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Armed Services Committee
Chairman Mac
Thornberry said today he wants
even more money

04:24.364 --> 04:26.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the military.

04:26.066 --> 04:30.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House Speaker Paul Ryan said the
president's
budget is just an opening bid.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.839 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: We
will have a full hearing about
how our priorities

04:34.374 --> 04:35.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will be met.

04:35.742 --> 04:38.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But do I think we can cut
spending and get
waste out of government?

04:38.311 --> 04:40.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely.

04:40.113 --> 04:44.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today's spending
outline doesn't
address taxes or entitlement
programs like

04:44.684 --> 04:46.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Social Security and Medicare.

04:46.953 --> 04:50.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are to come in another
budget document
in May.

04:50.257 --> 04:53.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang at the
White House.

04:53.226 --> 04:58.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A federal judge
in Maryland
became the second in as many
days to block

04:58.532 --> 05:02.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Trump's revised travel
ban nationwide.

05:02.068 --> 05:04.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The other ruling came last night
in Hawaii.

05:05.005 --> 05:10.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both judges concluded Mr.
Trump's earlier
public remarks suggest that it's
still intended

05:10.343 --> 05:12.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be a Muslim ban.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The White House vowed to appeal.

05:13.847 --> 05:19.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will explore the court
rulings, and what
comes next, later in the
program.

05:19.486 --> 05:24.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bipartisan leaders of the Senate
Intelligence
Committee are the latest to
dismiss President

05:24.658 --> 05:28.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's claim that he was
wiretapped by President
Obama.

05:28.595 --> 05:34.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They, along with House Speaker
Paul Ryan,
said today that they have seen
-- quote -- "no

05:34.100 --> 05:35.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
indications of that."

05:35.402 --> 05:38.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House intelligence leaders said
much the same
thing yesterday.

05:38.872 --> 05:43.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But White House Press Secretary
Sean Spicer
argued today that nothing is
clear until the

05:43.743 --> 05:46.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Justice Department reports next
week.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
The Department of Justice asked
for an additional

05:48.848 --> 05:50.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

05:50.517 --> 05:54.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the statement clearly says
that at this
time that they don't believe
that.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have yet to go through the
information.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Department of Justice, as
you know, has
not supplied this.

06:00.260 --> 06:05.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Spicer also said
the president
still stands by his claim.

06:05.165 --> 06:09.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The House Budget Committee
narrowly approved
the Republican health care bill
today.

06:09.970 --> 06:16.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three GOP conservatives voted
no, putting
dissent in Republican ranks
clearly on display.

06:16.543 --> 06:20.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, for the first time, House
Speaker Paul
Ryan acknowledged parts of the
bill may have

06:20.947 --> 06:23.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be changed to shore up
support.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.085 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

06:25.118 --> 06:28.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Clearly, the main
parts of this
bill are going to stay exactly
as they are,

06:28.088 --> 06:31.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but we're making those
improvements and refinements
based upon the feedback that
we're getting

06:31.658 --> 06:35.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from our members, and the
president of the
United States is the one who's
been mediating

06:35.328 --> 06:37.130 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

06:37.163 --> 06:38.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president of the United
States is the
one who is bringing people
together, sitting

06:38.965 --> 06:43.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around a table, hashing out our
differences,
so that we can get to a
consensus document.

06:43.470 --> 06:48.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a FOX News
interview that
aired last night, the president
said of the

06:48.208 --> 06:51.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bill -- quote -- "A lot of
things aren't consistent.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But these are going to be
negotiated."

06:54.214 --> 06:59.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
European leaders congratulated
Dutch Prime
Minister Mark Rutte today, after
his victory

06:59.619 --> 07:02.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over anti-Muslim lawmaker Geert
Wilders.

07:02.956 --> 07:07.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a victory celebration last
night, Rutte
called it a victory for
stability and security.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK RUTTE, Prime Minister of
the Netherlands
(through translator): This is
also a night

07:10.697 --> 07:15.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when the Netherlands, after
Brexit, after
American elections, has said
stop to the wrong

07:15.635 --> 07:17.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kind of populism.

07:17.437 --> 07:21.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wilders' party
finished second,
but the other Dutch parties have
said they

07:21.908 --> 07:26.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will not work with him or
include him in a
governing coalition.

07:26.279 --> 07:31.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pirates in Somalia have released
an oil tanker
that they hijacked on Monday.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They say they were not paid any
ransom.

07:34.187 --> 07:40.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The release came hours after a
gunfight between
the pirates and local security
forces.

07:40.060 --> 07:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
urged North
Korea today to abandon its
nuclear and missile

07:46.299 --> 07:47.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
programs.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tillerson was in Japan, starting
his first
Asia trip.

07:50.437 --> 07:55.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a news conference with his
Japanese counterpart,
he called for a new strategy,
but offered

07:55.642 --> 07:57.577 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no specifics.

07:57.610 --> 08:03.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: I think it's
important to recognize
that the diplomatic and other
efforts of the

08:03.416 --> 08:10.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
past 20 years to bring North
Korea to a point
of denuclearization have failed.

08:10.590 --> 08:15.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the face of this
ever-escalating threat,
it is clear that a different
approach is required.

08:15.929 --> 08:20.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today was the
first time Tillerson
had publicly fielded questions
since assuming

08:20.800 --> 08:22.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his post in early February.

08:22.802 --> 08:29.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the head
of USA Gymnastics,
Steve Penny, resigned amid
allegations that

08:29.342 --> 08:33.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he ignored sexual abuse of girls
training
for the Olympics.

08:33.747 --> 08:39.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The organization faces a brace
of lawsuits
charging that a former team
doctor groped

08:39.452 --> 08:41.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and fondled girls in training.

08:41.721 --> 08:46.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They say Penny and other
officials knew about
it and did nothing.

08:46.226 --> 08:49.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks ended
the day with
little change.

08:49.062 --> 08:52.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 15 points
to close at 20934.

08:52.499 --> 09:00.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose a fraction of a
point, and
the S&amp;P 500 slipped nearly four.

09:00.340 --> 09:05.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Congress
weighs in on President Trump's
budget priorities;

09:05.645 --> 09:11.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
halted again, what's next for
the White House
travel ban; Germany's ambassador
previews

09:11.418 --> 09:21.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tomorrow's meeting between
Chancellor Angela
Merkel and President Trump; and
much more.

09:21.461 --> 09:28.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tomorrow's meeting between
Chancellor Angela
Merkel and President Trump; and
much more.

09:28.067 --> 09:33.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reaction from lawmakers to
President Trump's
America first budget ranged from
strong support

09:33.406 --> 09:35.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to tough criticism.

09:35.041 --> 09:38.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have two different points of
view of the
president's budget proposal.

09:38.945 --> 09:42.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First up, Democratic Senator
Chris Van Hollen
of Maryland.

09:42.081 --> 09:45.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a member of the Budget and
Appropriations
Committees.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I started by asking for his
overall reaction.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.189 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D), Maryland:
Well, this
budget tells me that Donald
Trump is already

09:51.858 --> 09:54.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting very out of touch with
the American
people.

09:54.627 --> 09:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the kind of budget you
might expect from
somebody who jets off to
Mar-a-Lago every

09:59.799 --> 10:01.634 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other week.

10:01.668 --> 10:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by the way, that costs
taxpayers $3 million
each time, which is the amount
usually in

10:08.174 --> 10:13.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the budget for the Meals on
Wheels program
to help feed over two million
elderly.

10:13.713 --> 10:16.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He wipes that out of the budget.

10:16.115 --> 10:21.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you look at the overall
budget, it
really is an attack on working
people and

10:21.888 --> 10:24.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on educational opportunity in
the country.

10:24.157 --> 10:30.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is a recipe for cleaner --
dirtier air
and contaminated water.

10:30.997 --> 10:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's really a bad deal for the
American public.

10:33.199 --> 10:37.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
tweeted, Senator,
you probably know, that this is
a budget that

10:37.804 --> 10:39.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
puts America first.

10:39.839 --> 10:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a budget that makes safety
the prime
consideration.

10:44.210 --> 10:45.845 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:45.879 --> 10:50.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well,
actually, it makes
America last in terms of
investing in our

10:50.183 --> 10:54.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people, investing in our
economy, investing
in our national infrastructure,
something

10:54.387 --> 11:00.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that candidate Trump talked a
whole lot about,
yet they cut the infrastructure
budget here

11:00.159 --> 11:02.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by over 13 percent.

11:02.295 --> 11:10.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a lot of what he talked
about on the campaign
trail is actually under attack
in this budget,

11:10.103 --> 11:15.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including, I have to say,
important economic
development programs and
infrastructure programs

11:15.208 --> 11:17.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for rural America.

11:18.011 --> 11:25.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He does dramatically increase
Pentagon spending,
but he cuts the funding for the
State Department.

11:25.385 --> 11:31.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the State Department funding
is designed
to help keep us out of wars and
to save lives

11:31.424 --> 11:33.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and money.

11:33.059 --> 11:36.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what Secretary
Mattis, his own
defense secretary, has had to
say.

11:36.462 --> 11:38.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, this doesn't help America.

11:38.831 --> 11:42.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, it really erodes
American influence
around the world.

11:42.869 --> 11:46.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what
they're saying is
the Pentagon budget, the defense
spending

11:46.806 --> 11:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this country has been cut
back so much
that the United States is
vulnerable, and

11:52.912 --> 11:58.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this is a critical moment
for the United
States to restore the spending
for defense

11:58.484 --> 12:01.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that should have been there for
the last number
of years.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.156 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:03.189 --> 12:06.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well,
actually, that's just
another alternative fact coming
out of this

12:06.426 --> 12:07.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have had robust defense
spending.

12:09.228 --> 12:15.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I can support additional
investment in our
national security, but we just
saw a few months

12:15.802 --> 12:22.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago reports out of the Pentagon
about over
$120 billion in wasteful
spending.

12:22.141 --> 12:27.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, Donald Trump has talked
about these
huge cost overruns on Pentagon
projects.

12:28.014 --> 12:34.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we'd be much better off
managing those
resources better, than simply
writing a new

12:34.754 --> 12:38.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
check to the Pentagon, which, by
the way,
is the one federal government
agency that

12:38.758 --> 12:41.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has not been able to pass an
audit.

12:41.527 --> 12:44.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, look, I'm all for investing
on our national
security.

12:44.597 --> 12:50.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to do it, but we also
have to recognize
our national strength includes
making sure

12:50.370 --> 12:52.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our kids get a good education.

12:52.271 --> 12:56.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he cut the Department of
Education by
close to 15 percent.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It includes making sure we have
a healthy
population.

12:59.612 --> 13:06.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he dramatically cut funding
for medical
research to help develop cures
and treatments.

13:06.285 --> 13:11.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is really something
that's going
to hurt most of the country.

13:11.491 --> 13:17.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, the folks at the very
top who just
got a big tax cut as part of the
Trumpcare

13:17.163 --> 13:20.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan aren't going to be hurt,
but everybody
else is.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, again,
I'm sure you
know, but what the -- I just
heard the budget

13:23.903 --> 13:25.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
director making this argument
today.

13:25.538 --> 13:29.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was pressed on some of these
cuts, for
example, in education.

13:29.275 --> 13:34.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said the administration has
looked very
closely at so many of these
domestic spending

13:34.580 --> 13:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
programs, and he says where
there is no evidence
that people are actually being
helped, these

13:39.619 --> 13:41.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
programs cannot continue.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.822 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:42.855 --> 13:45.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, we
certainly shouldn't
be asking taxpayers to invest in
programs

13:45.825 --> 13:47.994 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that don't help.

13:48.027 --> 13:54.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the reality is that the
after-school programs
to try to make sure that kids
are in a productive

13:54.901 --> 13:59.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
environment after school hours
and not out
on the streets, that actually is
an important

13:59.739 --> 14:00.707 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's been underfunded in the
United States.

14:02.875 --> 14:08.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are other career and
training programs
that have shown good results,
and they're

14:08.147 --> 14:09.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cutting them.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The same is true with respect to
some of our
manufacturing programs.

14:12.852 --> 14:18.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, here's a president who
says he wants
to restore American
manufacturing, and yet

14:18.758 --> 14:25.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he cuts the manufacturing
extension program,
which helps take innovations and
make sure

14:25.064 --> 14:28.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they're available to
industry throughout
the United States.

14:28.768 --> 14:31.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this is a very short-sighted
budget.

14:31.270 --> 14:36.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have to say that Donald Trump
said he was
going to be there for the
forgotten people.

14:36.943 --> 14:39.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In this budget, he forgets those
people.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, they're not even an
afterthought.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Chris Van
Hollen, a
member of the Senate Budget
Committee, we

14:44.450 --> 14:45.418 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thank you, sir.

14:45.451 --> 14:46.419 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:46.452 --> 14:48.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Thank you.

14:48.187 --> 14:51.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And for an
opposing view, we
turn now to Representative Todd
Rokita.

14:51.958 --> 14:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a Republican from Indiana
and he is vice
chairman of the House Budget
Committee.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congressman Rokita, welcome to
the "NewsHour."

14:59.832 --> 15:05.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you just heard at least
part of what
Senator Van Hollen said, and
that is, in this

15:05.338 --> 15:11.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
budget proposal, the president
is forgetting
some of the very people he said
he wanted

15:11.210 --> 15:12.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be elected to help.

15:12.211 --> 15:13.179 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

15:13.212 --> 15:14.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TODD ROKITA (R), Indiana: Yes, I
heard that.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Chris is a friend from the
House Budget
Committee.

15:16.949 --> 15:21.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was ranking member when I was
vice chairman
there last Congress.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, you know, I heard some of
the same rhetoric.

15:23.489 --> 15:26.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's a good man, but let me just
say this.

15:26.626 --> 15:30.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president, with the budget
that he put
forward today, recognizing that
it's his request,

15:31.030 --> 15:35.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not the budget -- we still
have our Article
I powers under the Constitution,
and we will

15:35.535 --> 15:43.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
use them, as congress men and
women, to reconcile
different priorities and make
sure that we're

15:43.409 --> 15:45.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continue to march forward for
the American
people.

15:45.411 --> 15:51.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I would say that the
forgotten man that
President Trump campaigned for
should be proud

15:51.584 --> 15:53.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of what was done in the budget.

15:53.386 --> 15:58.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, the one thing,
Judy, that the
federal government does
constitutionally and

15:58.591 --> 16:01.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
does well is our national
defense.

16:01.527 --> 16:06.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will quibble with Mr. Van
Hollen if
he says that our national
defense has been

16:06.632 --> 16:08.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
taken care of.

16:08.534 --> 16:13.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It only makes up about 20
percent of our budget
historically, but it took 50
percent of the

16:13.573 --> 16:14.874 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sequester cuts.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, fair is fair.

16:16.275 --> 16:19.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're getting back to
rebalancing that.

16:19.779 --> 16:24.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Otherwise, Judy, this is a
traditional -- as
you would see in a economic
textbook of some

16:24.884 --> 16:28.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind, traditional guns vs.
butter argument.

16:28.154 --> 16:32.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for eight years or so, we
have been doling
out a lot of butter, a lot of
domestic programs.

16:32.725 --> 16:37.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what Mr. Trump is suggesting
here is that
we rebalance and put a little
bit more into

16:37.830 --> 16:42.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our guns to make sure that we're
protected
from a military standpoint, that
we're safe,

16:42.835 --> 16:44.303 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and...

16:44.337 --> 16:46.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me just
interrupt
you there, if you don't mind.

16:46.939 --> 16:47.907 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TODD ROKITA: Yes.

16:49.108 --> 16:50.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because I want to
ask you about
that.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We did hear Senator Van Hollen
say, yes, it's
good to spend more on defense,
but he said

16:53.980 --> 16:57.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are problems with defense
spending,
that it hasn't -- he said we
haven't even

16:57.850 --> 16:59.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
seen a serious audit.

16:59.552 --> 17:04.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do want to ask you about
some of the
domestic cuts, education down 15
percent,

17:04.257 --> 17:11.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medical research, major cut, a
20-some percent
cut in the environment, 21
percent.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How -- what are these cuts?

17:13.933 --> 17:14.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is going to be cut?

17:14.934 --> 17:16.836 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD ROKITA: Well, I have been
in a budget
hearing all day repealing and
replacing Obamacare.

17:19.105 --> 17:22.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you know, I don't have all
the details,
and I didn't write the document.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like I said, we are going to
digest that all
in the Budget Committee.

17:25.544 --> 17:30.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But let me just, from an
overview perspective,
say that what I'm seeing so far
is that what

17:30.816 --> 17:36.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is being -- quote, unquote --
"cut" are really
duplicative programs and
programs that shouldn't

17:36.122 --> 17:37.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be in the agencies that they're
in.

17:37.890 --> 17:44.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we see this throughout
government, 10,
20, 30 programs that pretend to
do the same

17:44.630 --> 17:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thing, but don't do it well.

17:47.166 --> 17:52.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's what I see Mr.
Trump and Mick
Mulvaney, the OMB director,
doing here, is

17:52.571 --> 17:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really streamlining government.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's also making good on
other campaign
promises.

17:56.475 --> 18:00.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm the kindergarten through
12th grade education
chairman in the House,
subcommittee education

18:00.546 --> 18:02.448 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
chairman.

18:02.481 --> 18:09.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we're seeing here is
Mr. Trump making
good on school choice, the idea
that the property

18:09.622 --> 18:13.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of parents, the tax dollars, are
actually
following the child more to a
school that

18:13.592 --> 18:17.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fits them, not being shackled to
a school
that doesn't work for them.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's an important point.

18:18.764 --> 18:19.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's not new money.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's reprogrammed money.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it's money being
reprioritized.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's exactly, Judy, what a
budget is
about, and that's what he's
doing.

18:26.305 --> 18:30.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So the cuts in
medical research,
for example -- and I didn't
mention cuts in

18:31.010 --> 18:32.511 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agriculture.

18:32.545 --> 18:37.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We heard Senator Van Hollen
speak about extension
programs in agriculture.

18:37.883 --> 18:40.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're comfortable with all the
cuts the administration
is proposing?

18:40.886 --> 18:42.288 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

18:42.321 --> 18:44.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TODD ROKITA: Well, like I say, I
haven't looked
at the whole document.

18:44.056 --> 18:48.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have been in an
eight-or-so-hour markup
on repealing and replacing
Obamacare, but

18:48.494 --> 18:50.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we will look at all that.

18:50.296 --> 18:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I'm saying that I'm
comfortable with
is getting rid of the
duplication, getting

18:54.433 --> 18:58.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rid of programs that are outside
the agency's
jurisdiction.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm for streamlining.

19:00.606 --> 19:03.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm for the president keeping
good on his
promises to the forgotten man
and all the

19:03.642 --> 19:04.744 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rest of us.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what I'm seeing in
the budget so
far.

19:06.512 --> 19:10.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, again, also, Judy, I
will say that
we will go through the budget
process.

19:10.483 --> 19:14.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The budget -- the president's
budget is just
a budget request.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The real budget is going to come
through the
House Budget Committee.

19:16.055 --> 19:17.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's going to come through
Chris' committee.

19:17.390 --> 19:20.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it doesn't even have to be
signed by the
president.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It goes into effect without his
signature.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's our Article I powers.

19:25.798 --> 19:29.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can be assured that
we're going to
look at every item, because
that's our job

19:29.268 --> 19:30.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we will do it no matter who
the president
is.

19:30.903 --> 19:34.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's a
reminder of the
way the process really works.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:35.908 --> 19:38.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Representative
Todd Rokita
of Indiana, vice chairman of the
House Budget

19:38.611 --> 19:39.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Committee, we thank you.

19:39.578 --> 19:40.546 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

19:40.579 --> 19:46.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TODD ROKITA: Thank you, Judy.

19:46.218 --> 19:55.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another piece of
the Trump
agenda is getting attention
today, and that

19:55.494 --> 20:00.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the president's revised
travel ban, which
hit a roadblock in the federal
courts.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has more.

20:02.401 --> 20:07.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The first
ruling came yesterday
in Hawaii, where a federal judge
blocked parts

20:07.106 --> 20:08.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the executive order.

20:08.908 --> 20:13.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would have barred refugees,
as well as
nationals from six
Muslim-majority countries,

20:13.245 --> 20:15.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from entering the U.S.

20:15.114 --> 20:19.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, overnight, a federal judge
in Maryland
issued his own block on the
six-nation travel

20:19.118 --> 20:20.886 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ban.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on all this, we turn to
Devlin Barrett,
who now covers the Justice
Department and

20:23.089 --> 20:25.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national security issues for The
Washington
Post.

20:25.324 --> 20:29.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Devlin, this was supposed to
be the executive
order designed to skirt around
the legal challenges

20:29.829 --> 20:30.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that the first one had.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What were the problems?

20:32.665 --> 20:35.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT, The Washington
Post: Well,
the first one basically
foundered on due process

20:35.968 --> 20:37.736 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
problems.

20:37.770 --> 20:40.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Basically, the federal appeals
court ruled
that the order had not been
written to give

20:40.973 --> 20:45.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people a fair shake in the
system essentially,
particularly people who had
visas or green

20:45.478 --> 20:46.879 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cards.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they changed that part of it,
and they
thought they fixed that problem.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, in a sense, they had.

20:50.816 --> 20:55.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what you saw in the last two
rulings by
federal judges is that now
there's a conflict

20:55.554 --> 21:01.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the real meat of the
argument, which
is, is this a Muslim ban or some
partial version

21:01.827 --> 21:03.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a Muslim ban?

21:03.629 --> 21:08.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what both these judges came
down on as
saying that, yes, it was
essentially a violation

21:08.467 --> 21:12.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the First Amendment rule that
you can't
disfavor a particular religion.

21:12.905 --> 21:17.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There aren't
any explicit
terms directly in the new
executive order

21:17.543 --> 21:19.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that say Muslim or Islam.

21:19.545 --> 21:24.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems that the Hawaii ruling
seems to take
a lot of candidate Trump's words
and the administration's

21:24.283 --> 21:25.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
words and put them in there.

21:25.918 --> 21:27.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Well, right.

21:27.720 --> 21:33.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump administration has
really struggled
in the legal process to separate
itself from

21:33.425 --> 21:37.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what the campaign has said, what
the president
has said, and even what some of
his top advisers

21:37.796 --> 21:40.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have said in defending the
order.

21:40.366 --> 21:45.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those statements have all
been thrown
back at them by the judges, and
it's really,

21:45.337 --> 21:51.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frankly, remarkable the extent
to which the
travel ban, both versions of it,
have been

21:51.310 --> 21:56.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tossed at this point, or at
least suspended
at this point, based on the
words of the president

21:56.282 --> 21:57.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and his senior advisers.

21:57.683 --> 21:59.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, what is
the Justice
Department going to do?

21:59.718 --> 22:03.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Well, every
indication is
that they are going to appeal
this.

22:03.155 --> 22:07.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Appeals -- notices of appeals
could come as
soon as tonight in the two new
rulings.

22:07.626 --> 22:11.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a third case where
everyone is just
sort of waiting to see how the
judge exactly

22:11.630 --> 22:13.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
handles that.

22:13.299 --> 22:16.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the expectation is there
will be more
appeals over this, more fights
over it.

22:16.435 --> 22:22.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, frankly, I think, this set
of legal challenges
will really be an argument about
the basic

22:22.441 --> 22:28.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue of the term Muslim ban,
and is that
an accurate description of what
this executive

22:28.380 --> 22:30.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
order does?

22:30.182 --> 22:32.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But what's the
likelihood
then that this executive order
gets challenged

22:32.284 --> 22:37.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
perhaps in other federal
districts, other
regions and has to be
reconciled?

22:37.389 --> 22:39.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Well, it's
growing every day.

22:39.558 --> 22:45.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for example, last night, we
saw two different
parts of the country in which
federal judges

22:45.698 --> 22:47.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ruled on it.

22:47.633 --> 22:51.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means that, assuming the
appeals go through,
you will see appeals courts
ruling in one

22:51.470 --> 22:55.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of the country and another
part of the
country, and oftentimes, just
the way the

22:55.574 --> 22:58.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
court system works, those
rulings don't match
up identically.

22:58.744 --> 23:03.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when that happens, it
increases the likelihood
that something will go to the
Supreme Court.

23:03.349 --> 23:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That all depends, of course, on
the notion
that both sides still want to
fight, but every

23:07.620 --> 23:11.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
indication right now is that
whoever wins
or loses at the appeals court
round, the other

23:12.024 --> 23:13.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
side will want to keep fighting.

HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Devlin Barrett
of The Washington Post, thanks
so much.

23:18.030 --> 23:24.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Sure.

23:24.903 --> 23:30.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

23:30.342 --> 23:36.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
when hiring people
with disabilities can boost
profit; and "Exit

23:36.749 --> 23:40.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
West," a new book about stepping
into a foreign
world.

23:40.819 --> 23:46.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: German Chancellor
Angela Merkel
has her first meeting with
President Trump

23:46.325 --> 23:47.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tomorrow at the White House.

23:47.860 --> 23:51.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Mrs. Merkel is seeking
reelection later this
year.

23:51.163 --> 23:56.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tops on the agenda for the two
leaders: the
NATO response to a resurgent
Russia and the

23:56.235 --> 23:59.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stability of the European Union
after Brexit.

23:59.238 --> 24:04.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I sat down with Germany's
ambassador to the
U.S., Peter Wittig, and I asked
him about

24:04.410 --> 24:06.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the importance of this
high-stakes meeting.

24:06.578 --> 24:09.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER WITTIG, German Ambassador
to the United
States: Well, it is an important
visit for

24:09.715 --> 24:11.317 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her.

24:11.350 --> 24:14.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's her first personal
encounter with
a new president.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have spoken on the phone a
couple of
times.

24:17.423 --> 24:21.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But personal relationships are
important.

24:21.860 --> 24:29.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for us, Judy, the U.S. has
been almost
the most important international
and foreign

24:29.802 --> 24:31.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
policy partner over decades.

24:31.870 --> 24:37.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. has helped us to build
a thriving
democracy after the Second World
War.

24:37.676 --> 24:40.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has helped us to unify
Germany.

24:40.446 --> 24:48.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, that's a very strong
tradition, a strong
basis on which the chancellor
will build on

24:48.554 --> 24:54.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and establish constructive and
forward-looking
relations with this new
president in the U.S.

24:54.460 --> 24:56.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well -- excuse
me.

24:56.261 --> 25:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know NATO is a subject that
has come up
repeatedly during Mr. Trump's
campaign for

25:01.400 --> 25:02.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

25:02.468 --> 25:03.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's been critical of NATO.

25:03.802 --> 25:07.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's said that the U.S. pays far
more into
NATO than it should.

25:07.172 --> 25:10.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's leaned on other NATO
members to pay more.

25:10.642 --> 25:14.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much more is the chancellor
willing to
say Germany will pay, and by
when?

25:14.380 --> 25:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: NATO is the
bedrock of our common
security.

25:18.150 --> 25:27.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was kind of reinvigorated
after Russian
invaded Ukraine and fueled the
conflict in

25:27.459 --> 25:29.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Eastern Ukraine.

25:29.228 --> 25:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is on a new mission
against a newly
assertive Russia and facing
challenges in

25:37.403 --> 25:41.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the south of the NATO territory,
in the Middle
East, for instance.

25:41.707 --> 25:46.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there is this discussion on
fairer burden-sharing.

25:46.111 --> 25:48.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're ready for this discussion.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's an important discussion.

25:50.983 --> 25:59.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Germany is committed to do more
for the defense,
to increase our defense spending
incrementally.

25:59.458 --> 26:03.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, for instance, we
raised our defense
budget by 9 percent.

26:03.429 --> 26:09.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we want to go forward on
this path in
an incremental way.

26:09.368 --> 26:16.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, Europe, and also Germany
have to be more
active in defense.

26:16.708 --> 26:20.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned a
more aggressive
Russia.

26:20.312 --> 26:26.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know President Trump has
spoken about the
suggestion that he would take a
more conciliatory

26:26.418 --> 26:27.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
approach to Russia.

26:27.986 --> 26:32.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If that's what this president
does, what will
Chancellor Merkel's response be?

26:32.157 --> 26:36.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: She has a lot of
experience
in dealing with Russia.

26:36.929 --> 26:42.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has spoken so many times
with President
Putin over the last years.

26:42.267 --> 26:48.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we are pursuing a
double-track approach,
strong dialogue, keeping the
channels of communication

26:48.807 --> 26:57.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
open, but, at the same time,
being very resolute
about our defense, keeping in
mind our security

26:57.282 --> 27:01.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interests, especially in the
eastern part
of Europe and beyond.

27:01.153 --> 27:09.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think we would welcome a
new chapter
of the American and Russian
leader in their

27:09.228 --> 27:15.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relationships, but on the basis
of a very
clear idea where our strategic
interests and

27:15.367 --> 27:16.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our security interests are.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You expect that
to come up?

27:18.704 --> 27:25.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: I could assume
that they will
be talking about Russia and the
Ukraine conflict,

27:26.011 --> 27:27.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about many other things, Judy.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We spoke about
NATO.

27:29.448 --> 27:32.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president has also been
critical of the
European Union.

27:32.184 --> 27:38.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was one of the first to argue
that Great
Britain should leave the E.U.,
so-called Brexit.

27:38.657 --> 27:42.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is Chancellor Merkel's plan
to change
his mind on the E.U.?

27:42.227 --> 27:44.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: Europe is our
home.

27:44.229 --> 27:46.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's our neighborhood.

27:46.298 --> 27:51.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are strong supporters of a
strong and resilient
European Union.

27:51.937 --> 27:54.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We deplore Brexit.

27:54.473 --> 27:57.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We respect the vote of the
people.

27:57.943 --> 28:05.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to have close relations
with the U.K.
even after they left the
European Union.

28:05.651 --> 28:12.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we will do everything to
keep the European
Union as a strong and resilient
economic and

28:12.491 --> 28:13.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
political union.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And let me add this.

28:15.861 --> 28:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it is also in the
strategic interests
of the United States to have a
strong and

28:21.934 --> 28:28.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resilient Europe, European
Union, in the face
of the challenges from the east
and from the

28:28.106 --> 28:30.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
south of our continent in
Europe.

28:30.075 --> 28:33.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And one can
presume those are
arguments the chancellor is
going to make

28:33.946 --> 28:34.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the president?

28:35.013 --> 28:36.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: I assume so.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:38.250 --> 28:40.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, I have
to ask you
about some of the comments
President Trump

28:40.752 --> 28:46.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made about the chancellor
herself last year
with regard to her refugee
policy.

28:46.191 --> 28:50.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He called it, among other
things, "a sad shame
and a disgrace."

28:50.462 --> 28:55.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went so far to say last year
-- and I'm
quoting -- he said: "The German
people are

28:55.667 --> 28:58.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to end up overthrowing
this woman.

28:58.437 --> 29:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know what the hell she
is thinking,"
he wrote.

29:02.274 --> 29:05.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Does she believe she has
President Trump's
respect?

29:05.043 --> 29:10.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: You know, the
situation two
years ago, when the refugee
crisis emerged,

29:10.349 --> 29:11.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was totally extraordinary.

29:11.917 --> 29:18.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was the biggest, largest
movement of people
since the Second World War.

29:18.323 --> 29:23.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was an extraordinary
humanitarian crisis
at our borders.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now the situation is different.

29:26.031 --> 29:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The numbers are dramatically
down.

29:29.034 --> 29:34.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The refugees that came in are
properly registered
and vetted.

29:34.806 --> 29:38.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we have gone back to an
orderly and regular
process.

29:38.410 --> 29:41.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the situation has changed
since that time.

29:41.647 --> 29:46.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about
the comments
that the president made about
her and her

29:46.151 --> 29:47.219 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
policy?

29:47.252 --> 29:49.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can she just -- does she think
he has his
respect?

29:49.287 --> 29:56.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: The chancellor, I
think, is
interested to build a strong,
constructive,

29:56.128 --> 30:00.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forward-looking relationship
with President
Trump.

30:00.065 --> 30:09.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she has said many times she
will not go
back to the campaign, but will
want to engage

30:09.074 --> 30:11.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with him in a constructive
manner.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that's what we want
to see tomorrow.

30:13.779 --> 30:16.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will be
watching tomorrow's
visit.

30:16.715 --> 30:24.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Germany's Ambassador to the
United States
Peter Wittig, thank you very
much.

30:24.189 --> 30:29.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: Thank you, Judy.

30:29.695 --> 30:36.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We often hear
about and cover
the struggles that many
Americans face when

30:36.068 --> 30:37.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they try to land a good job.

30:37.936 --> 30:42.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you have a disability, the
challenge to
getting hired or even getting a
response to

30:42.841 --> 30:48.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
an inquiry, much less a
face-to-face interview,
is significantly harder.

30:48.346 --> 30:52.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
explores why that's still
happening.

30:52.951 --> 30:55.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of his weekly series,
Making Sense.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMI PROFETA, Job Seeker (through
computer):
Good evening.

30:57.889 --> 30:59.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My name is Ami Profeta.

30:59.758 --> 31:03.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Ami Profeta has
cerebral palsy.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's been looking for work for
over a year.

31:05.697 --> 31:10.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMI PROFETA (through computer):
People have
hung up the phone.

31:10.168 --> 31:11.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They don't respond to my
e-mails.

31:11.770 --> 31:16.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Profeta's job hunt
may be more
challenging than most.

31:16.308 --> 31:22.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The unemployment rate for those
with a disability
is more than double the rate for
those without.

31:22.514 --> 31:25.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We interviewed economist Douglas
Kruse, himself
a paraplegic, via Skype.

31:25.751 --> 31:29.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DOUGLAS KRUSE, Rutgers
University: It's not
just a matter of people with
disabilities,

31:29.421 --> 31:32.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, staying at home and
collecting disability
income.

31:32.858 --> 31:38.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a matter of people who want
to work are
not as easily able to find work.

31:38.597 --> 31:46.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In a 2015 study,
Kruse's research
team submitted 6,000 fake online
job applications

31:46.037 --> 31:48.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for accounting positions.

31:48.707 --> 31:54.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One-third said the applicant had
a spinal
cord injury, another third
Asperger's syndrome.

31:54.546 --> 31:57.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one-third didn't mention a
disability
at all.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The results?

31:59.751 --> 32:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS KRUSE: People with
disabilities were
26 percent less likely to get
expressions

32:04.289 --> 32:05.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of employer interest.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What's going on, do
you suppose?

32:07.659 --> 32:10.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS KRUSE: There's a lot of
discomfort
with people with disabilities.

32:10.962 --> 32:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, apart from that,
there's a lot of
uncertainty: Oh, geez, someone
with a spinal

32:15.734 --> 32:18.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cord injury, I'm not sure
they're going to
fit in here.

32:18.403 --> 32:21.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MASON AMERI, Rutgers University:
They refer
to it as fear of the unknown.

32:21.173 --> 32:23.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Mason Ameri
co-authored the study.

32:23.575 --> 32:26.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MASON AMERI: How do I know if
this person
can do the job?

32:26.178 --> 32:27.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do I know the cost?

32:27.913 --> 32:33.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, all of these unknowns
ultimately compel
an employer to express no hiring
intent.

32:33.785 --> 32:38.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Even though the
Americans With
Disabilities Act bars such
discrimination

32:38.323 --> 32:42.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for firms with more than 15
employees.

32:42.427 --> 32:46.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nicole Ellis returned to the job
market after
the bank she worked at went
bust.

32:46.731 --> 32:52.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she decided to leave off her
resume the
fact that she is legally blind
due to ocular

32:52.971 --> 32:54.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
albinism.

32:54.673 --> 32:55.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE ELLIS, Liberty Resources:
I didn't
think that I would be able to
get my foot

32:55.574 --> 32:57.375 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the door.

32:57.409 --> 33:01.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It still took
three-and-a-half
years to land a job here at
Liberty Resources,

33:01.413 --> 33:06.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Philadelphia nonprofit which
promotes independent
living for the disabled.

33:06.251 --> 33:08.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICOLE ELLIS: I would get the
calls back.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would go on the interviews.

33:10.555 --> 33:15.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And once you start discussing --
because I
have to let them know that I'm
going to need

33:15.994 --> 33:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these accommodations, like
software that enlarges
fonts or enhances speech
recognition.

33:21.833 --> 33:29.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, once you start talking about
those things,
it kind of becomes like dead
silence, almost.

33:29.407 --> 33:30.375 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And they...

33:30.408 --> 33:31.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Really?

33:31.409 --> 33:32.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You can feel it?

33:32.410 --> 33:34.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICOLE ELLIS: You can feel it.

33:34.246 --> 33:39.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they will give you some
other scenarios
as far as, well, what about,
let's say, if

33:39.417 --> 33:40.385 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it snows?

33:40.418 --> 33:42.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are you going to be able to get
into work?

33:42.921 --> 33:48.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But you can
understand, or can
you not understand why an
employer would be

33:48.059 --> 33:49.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
concerned about all those sorts
of things?

33:49.828 --> 33:57.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE ELLIS: I do understand,
but, on the
other hand, I have worked around
people who

33:57.602 --> 34:03.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do not have disabilities who do
not come to
work and who do not work.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:05.343 --> 34:09.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE ELLIS: So, I mean, to me,
I understand
the doubt and the questions, but
you are discriminating

34:09.948 --> 34:13.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just based on the what-ifs of
someone's disability.

34:13.385 --> 34:17.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Liam Dougherty has
a master's
in public administration from
the University

34:17.956 --> 34:23.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Pennsylvania, and ataxia, a
condition marked
by a lack of muscle
coordination.

34:23.194 --> 34:28.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LIAM DOUGHERTY, Liberty
Resources: The way
that disability affects --
affects employment

34:28.466 --> 34:31.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is more insidious, more subtle,
more insidious.

34:31.970 --> 34:34.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My resume has all these gaps in
there.

34:34.339 --> 34:40.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think an employer looks
at that,
and they see, you know, like why
has this

34:40.211 --> 34:42.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
guy not been working?

34:42.113 --> 34:47.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, the gaps in
your work history,
and the kinds of work you
haven't done, are

34:47.619 --> 34:49.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of signals, you think?

34:49.120 --> 34:50.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIAM DOUGHERTY: Definitely.

34:50.588 --> 34:54.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Dougherty, like
Ellis, also found
work here at Liberty.

34:54.993 --> 35:00.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bill Krebs says employers have
always underestimated
him because of his intellectual
disability.

35:01.032 --> 35:03.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL KREBS, Liberty Resources:
®MDNM /Suffers
From Disability: At one time, it
was the R-word.

35:03.068 --> 35:04.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We got rid of the R-word.

35:04.069 --> 35:05.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It means mentally retarded.

35:05.303 --> 35:08.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I was labeled with a mental
retardation.

35:08.707 --> 35:12.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My I.Q. is mild, so I was I.Q.
of 70.

35:12.577 --> 35:16.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you're labeled with a
disability, it's
like Hitler did to the Jews.

35:16.181 --> 35:20.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They put a tattoo on your arm,
and that stigma
stays with you the rest of your
life.

35:20.251 --> 35:21.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, once you're
stigmatized,
then?

35:21.886 --> 35:22.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BILL KREBS: That's it.

35:22.988 --> 35:24.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: You're out of the
game?

35:24.356 --> 35:26.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL KREBS: You're out of the
game, no matter
how hard you try.

35:26.524 --> 35:32.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Until he too found
a niche at
Liberty, where disability is a
commonplace.

35:32.330 --> 35:38.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what prompted this story is
a second and
more surprising finding of the
Kruse-Ameri

35:38.103 --> 35:44.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
research: Early results show
that when they
sent applications just for jobs
in data entry

35:44.676 --> 35:46.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and software development...

35:46.344 --> 35:48.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MASON AMERI: We found no
evidence of discrimination.

35:48.346 --> 35:49.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: None?

35:49.614 --> 35:50.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MASON AMERI: None, at least not
with the preliminary
data.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And why might that
be?

35:53.385 --> 35:58.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We went looking for a case study
in the real
world, and found one in
Philadelphia at an

35:58.990 --> 36:00.191 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
accounting firm.

36:00.225 --> 36:02.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE HOWE, EY Americas: We make
a concerted
effort now.

36:02.227 --> 36:07.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to universities
speaking to the
people responsible for their
students with

36:07.599 --> 36:09.234 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disabilities.

36:09.267 --> 36:16.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Steve Howe is
managing partner
for EY Americas, formerly Ernst
&amp; Young.

36:16.574 --> 36:22.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a pilot program, it's pushing
to hire more
people with autism, a group that
has had,

36:22.280 --> 36:29.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up until now, an estimated un-
and under-employment
rate of between 70 and 90
percent.

36:29.154 --> 36:30.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But, says Sam Briefer:

36:30.955 --> 36:36.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM BRIEFER, EY Americas: We all
bring something
to the table that a lot of
people cannot.

36:36.561 --> 36:39.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are very detail-oriented.

36:39.230 --> 36:42.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We analyze things in a very
specific way.

36:42.801 --> 36:47.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Briefer is one of
four recent
hires here with autism spectrum
disorder.

36:47.572 --> 36:54.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM BRIEFER: There are others
that are very
more detail-oriented than --
than I am and

36:54.479 --> 36:55.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are much better with numbers.

36:55.814 --> 36:58.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, it's an
accounting firm.

36:58.583 --> 37:01.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I guess being good with numbers
is probably
a good thing.

37:01.653 --> 37:02.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAM BRIEFER: It is.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.688 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
It is.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it puts us all at a huge
advantage.

37:05.523 --> 37:09.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But, of course,
people on the
spectrum typically have trouble
socializing,

37:09.561 --> 37:11.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
communicating, an obvious
handicap.

37:11.863 --> 37:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Were you nervous about taking
the job?

37:14.799 --> 37:16.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAM BRIEFER: I was, yes.

37:16.734 --> 37:23.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I first thought that I would be
communicating
with a lot of people at once,
which is something

37:23.274 --> 37:25.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that I always get stressed
about.

37:25.677 --> 37:32.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But knowing that I'm -- I work
independently
a lot makes me feel a lot better
with where

37:32.517 --> 37:34.119 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I work.

37:34.152 --> 37:37.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: When things do get
stressful,
EY brings in a job coach to
help.

37:37.922 --> 37:43.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The team's regular manager,
Jamell Mitchell,
got neurodiversity training
ahead of time,

37:43.528 --> 37:44.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but he's also learning on the
job.

37:44.929 --> 37:48.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMELL MITCHELL, EY Americas:
They're very
specific and very clear.

37:48.066 --> 37:55.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As opposed to possibly a
neurotypical person
that may try to slide in at
9:10, the folks

37:55.773 --> 37:59.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are on the spectrum will
say, hey, I
arrived at 9:02 today.

37:59.310 --> 38:01.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do I need to work until 6:02?

38:01.746 --> 38:04.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And your reaction
to that?

38:04.115 --> 38:06.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMELL MITCHELL: Don't worry
about the two
minutes.

38:06.151 --> 38:07.118 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We're OK.

38:07.152 --> 38:08.953 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:08.987 --> 38:10.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAN HWANG, EY Americas: A lot
of people on
the spectrum tend to be, or at
least initially,

38:10.221 --> 38:13.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more -- more rigid in their --
in some of
their thinking.

38:13.158 --> 38:18.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But says program
participant
Stan Hwang, this form of
rigidity has a major

38:18.329 --> 38:19.797 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
upside.

38:19.831 --> 38:23.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STAN HWANG: It also tends to
make them want
to be more honest, I think.

38:23.701 --> 38:29.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What would be the point of,
like, lying about
something or being deceptive?

38:29.374 --> 38:32.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because you're more
naturally
just straightforward?

38:32.677 --> 38:35.446 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STAN HWANG: Yes.

38:35.480 --> 38:41.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Managing partner
Howe recently
gave the team behind the pilot
program a Better

38:41.386 --> 38:42.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Begins With You Award.

38:42.921 --> 38:44.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Well, thank you very much.

38:44.822 --> 38:49.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But, look, this
isn't about feel-good
inclusivity, so much as boosting
the bottom

38:49.661 --> 38:51.362 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
line.

38:51.396 --> 38:55.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Howe hopes to leverage the
special abilities
he's seen in his workers with
autism.

38:56.000 --> 39:03.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HOWE: We have learned from
technology
companies like SAP, Microsoft,
HP, who have

39:03.474 --> 39:05.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hired people with these kind of
skills.

39:05.610 --> 39:11.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We think it's a rich talent
pool, and we're
going to expand this now from
this exercise

39:11.683 --> 39:16.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Philadelphia to three or four
other cities
in the next year, and scale this
up.

39:16.821 --> 39:21.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that means more
job prospects
for people on the spectrum like
Stan Hwang.

39:21.693 --> 39:30.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAN HWANG: No matter what kind
of functionality
a person may be, everyone wants
to be treated

39:30.034 --> 39:32.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
like a human being, and
everybody deserves
an opportunity.

PAUL SOLMAN: And, at long last,
in certain
jobs, they're getting one.

39:37.408 --> 39:42.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for those with disabilities
who don't
seem to provide a profit
advantage, many still

39:42.947 --> 39:44.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
seem to be on their own.

AMI PROFETA (through computer):

PAUL SOLMAN: This is economics

Paul Solman reporting from
Philadelphia.

39:51.189 --> 39:54.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A wonderful
report.

39:54.292 --> 39:59.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one more note: Paul's team
reached out
to several major groups
representing employers,

39:59.998 --> 40:02.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
large and small, to hear their
take.

40:02.667 --> 40:04.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Some didn't respond.

40:04.969 --> 40:15.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Others said that they will start
to consider
ways of tackling this problem.

And we will be back shortly, as
Jeffrey Brown
looks at a novel that might have
been taken

40:25.890 --> 40:31.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from today's headlines about
living in a city
under siege, finding love, and
perhaps an

40:31.162 --> 40:33.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
escape to a better world.

40:33.064 --> 40:37.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, take a moment to
hear from your
local PBS station.

40:37.468 --> 40:42.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which
helps keep programs like ours on
the air.

40:42.540 --> 40:44.342 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

40:44.375 --> 40:55.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: a most
unusual take on
the refugee experience now and
in the future.

40:55.586 --> 41:00.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has this latest
addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

41:00.958 --> 41:04.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: An unnamed city
in the Muslim
world is plunged into violence,
and two young

41:04.195 --> 41:09.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lovers are forced to flee,
becoming a small
part of the mass migrations of
our era.

41:09.667 --> 41:13.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they travel through time and
space through
magic doors.

41:13.304 --> 41:20.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Exit West" is a novel combining
the very
real with the almost surreal,
imagining individuals

41:20.745 --> 41:22.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
behind today's headlines.

41:22.246 --> 41:26.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Author Mohsin Hamid has spent
parts of his
life in the U.S. and Europe.

41:26.317 --> 41:30.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He now lives in his native city
of Lahore,
Pakistan.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And nice to see you again.

41:32.523 --> 41:35.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHSIN HAMID, Author, "Exit
West": Nice to
see you.

41:35.626 --> 41:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is in one
way a very up-to-the-minute
look at the dislocation of
individual lives,

41:42.533 --> 41:45.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but, of course, it's not
journalism.

41:45.903 --> 41:46.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's art.

41:46.904 --> 41:48.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a novel.

41:48.306 --> 41:53.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tell me how you thought about
what you were
after.

41:53.077 --> 41:59.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHSIN HAMID: Well, I have been
moving around
my whole life, California,
Pakistan, London,

41:59.717 --> 42:01.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
New York, Pakistan again.

42:01.819 --> 42:09.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I wanted to write about the
experience
of migration.

42:09.127 --> 42:19.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I also felt this resistance
to migrants
was growing, and I wanted to
write in response

42:19.170 --> 42:24.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I also felt this resistance
to migrants
was growing, and I wanted to
write in response

42:24.409 --> 42:26.144 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to that.

42:26.177 --> 42:37.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Saeed and
Nadia, the two
young people in love, they see
their city

42:37.789 --> 42:39.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fall to pieces.

42:39.657 --> 42:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They -- the violence that we
have all grown
familiar with, I guess, from
newscasts, right,

42:46.731 --> 42:47.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they're experiencing firsthand.

42:47.965 --> 42:51.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They leave, but they leave
through these magical
doors.

42:51.502 --> 42:58.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's a little like "The
Chronicle of Narnia,"
right, which I read was one of
your favorites

42:58.643 --> 43:00.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as a child?

43:00.244 --> 43:03.714 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOHSIN HAMID: That's right.

43:03.748 --> 43:08.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Tell me about the
doors.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What are they?

43:10.121 --> 43:15.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHSIN HAMID: Well, I think the
doors sort
of already exist.

43:15.660 --> 43:17.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Distance is collapsing in our
world.

43:17.829 --> 43:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can travel by stepping into
an airplane,
as I did coming from Pakistan to
America.

43:22.800 --> 43:26.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We can Skype or go on video
calls with each
other.

43:26.938 --> 43:32.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we can open up our phones
and surf the
Internet and be in China or
Antarctica.

43:32.877 --> 43:38.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, in our world,
distance really
is collapsing.

43:38.516 --> 43:52.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People are getting pushed
together in new
ways.

43:52.230 --> 43:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the doors are a slightly
magical way of
capturing that.

43:56.334 --> 44:02.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But there's --
but that's not
what we see in, you know, the
typical migrant

44:03.007 --> 44:04.842 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

44:04.876 --> 44:10.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you're describing a kind
of globalized
world in which you and I might
travel around.

44:10.781 --> 44:11.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MOHSIN HAMID: Yes.

44:12.016 --> 44:14.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But these people
are refugees.

44:14.218 --> 44:16.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MOHSIN HAMID: They are.

44:16.053 --> 44:23.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that it can be a
mistake to focus
too much upon how they move, you
know, crossing

44:23.828 --> 44:27.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Rio Grande, or crossing the
Mediterranean
on a small boat.

44:27.198 --> 44:32.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are dramatic stories, but
the bulk of
the migrant or refugee story is,
what made

44:32.737 --> 44:34.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you want to leave home?

44:34.605 --> 44:40.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, what was so bad that you
left and left
people that you love behind?

44:40.177 --> 44:43.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then what happened to you in
the new place?

44:43.948 --> 44:50.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those two parts of the story
are the parts
I wanted to focus on.

44:50.488 --> 44:55.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's interesting
to me, because
you use a kind of magical
realism, but it's

44:55.593 --> 44:57.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a -- you don't write it as
fantasy.

44:57.895 --> 44:59.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a very unembellished
language.

44:59.530 --> 45:04.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's in the same tone as the
rest of the
story.

45:04.902 --> 45:09.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, was it interesting for you,
hard for you
to mix these kind of real and
surreal genres?

45:09.907 --> 45:11.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOHSIN HAMID: It wasn't hard.

45:11.309 --> 45:13.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I sort of believed in the doors
and then...

45:13.978 --> 45:15.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You believed in
them?

45:15.713 --> 45:16.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MOHSIN HAMID: Yes.

45:16.714 --> 45:18.549 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I mean, it...

45:18.583 --> 45:21.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One can just find
a spot in
your city and walk through and
you're in Mykonos,

45:21.986 --> 45:23.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you're in London, you're in...

45:23.788 --> 45:26.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHSIN HAMID: Yes, well, you
know, I mean,
and, as a writer, what you do
is, you make

45:26.457 --> 45:29.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up characters that don't exist,
and you believe
in them.

45:29.660 --> 45:32.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so the doors are a little
bit like that.

45:32.964 --> 45:37.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought, you know, it often
does feel to
me that the movement between
places is almost

45:37.635 --> 45:39.270 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
instantaneous.

45:39.303 --> 45:44.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you see people popping up in
cities and
you wonder, how is this person
here?

45:44.408 --> 45:48.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the doors are not described
in detail,
but the effect of the doors is
huge, because

45:48.713 --> 45:50.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
millions, billions of people
move.

45:50.514 --> 45:53.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You also wonder
-- I mean,
as you follow them through to
these very real

45:53.584 --> 45:57.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
places, where they meet up with
some kindness
and also some trauma, some
nativist reaction

45:57.488 --> 46:02.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against the migrants, there's a
kind of meditation
going on about, what is a
nation, who are

46:02.526 --> 46:04.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people, who's the insider, who's
the outsider.

46:04.428 --> 46:05.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOHSIN HAMID: Absolutely.

46:05.529 --> 46:07.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think that we're all migrants.

46:07.732 --> 46:14.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you lived in the same town
your whole life
and never move and you're 80
years old, that

46:14.305 --> 46:15.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
town has changed completely.

46:15.940 --> 46:17.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You migrate through time.

46:17.575 --> 46:19.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Your school has been...

46:19.210 --> 46:21.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Wait a minute.

46:21.278 --> 46:26.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You think of us -- I mean, even
if you have
never moved, you're a migrant
just because

46:26.584 --> 46:37.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wherever you are has changed?

46:37.928 --> 46:51.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHSIN HAMID: The novel in a way
is about
how human life in transient.

46:51.342 --> 46:54.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stuff changes.

46:54.211 --> 47:04.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the attempt to hold onto
things that don't
change, and to pretend they
don't change,

47:04.321 --> 47:13.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the attempt to hold onto
things that don't
change, and to pretend they
don't change,

47:13.230 --> 47:15.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a mistake, I think.

47:15.066 --> 47:22.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You could have
written much
of what you're telling me
without us seeing

47:22.773 --> 47:28.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everyday people in boats and
rafts and in
great danger.

47:28.913 --> 47:32.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everyday people in boats and
rafts and in
great danger.

47:50.768 --> 48:00.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHSIN HAMID: In some ways, it
feels like
world events have taken place
the

48:00.811 --> 48:07.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHSIN HAMID: In some ways, it
feels like
world events have taken place
the

48:07.485 --> 48:17.528 align:left position:37.5%,start line:80% size:62.5%
way
that the novel suggested they
might and I

48:17.528 --> 48:22.967 align:left position:37.5%,start line:80% size:62.5%
way
that the novel suggested they
might and I

48:23.000 --> 48:24.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
anticipated them.

48:24.668 --> 48:28.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I didn't really anticipate them.

48:28.839 --> 48:41.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But when I moved back to
Pakistan, I encountered
so many people who wanted to
leave.

48:41.318 --> 48:52.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And having just lived in London
and encountered
so much of how people didn't
want people to

48:52.363 --> 49:03.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come, I felt this tension
between these two
ideas.

49:03.908 --> 49:05.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the novel expressed that.

49:05.709 --> 49:08.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, what do you
see happening
today?

49:08.445 --> 49:12.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because, I mean, on the one
hand, we're having
a discussion.

49:12.683 --> 49:17.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're what we could call a
global citizen.

49:17.454 --> 49:27.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You and I can get on planes and
we can travel
around to different parts of the
world -- in

49:27.464 --> 49:37.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some ways, the world much
smaller and open,
but, in many ways, much more
polarized and

49:37.508 --> 49:44.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some ways, the world much
smaller and open,
but, in many ways, much more
polarized and

49:44.081 --> 49:45.049 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
closed.

49:45.082 --> 49:47.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you explain it?

49:47.384 --> 49:54.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHSIN HAMID: Well, I think
there's been a
failure of imagination.

49:54.391 --> 49:58.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everywhere around the world,
people are having
difficulty imagining a future.

49:58.762 --> 50:04.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People are going to move.

50:04.368 --> 50:09.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Things are going to change.

50:09.740 --> 50:15.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet all of our leaders seem
to be telling
us to go back to a previous time
when things

50:15.546 --> 50:16.647 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were better.

50:16.680 --> 50:19.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, in Britain, it's go
back before
the E.U.

50:19.683 --> 50:29.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
In America, it's

50:29.727 --> 50:38.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
In America, it's

50:38.936 --> 50:44.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
make America great again.

50:44.475 --> 50:48.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
make America great again.

52:00.150 --> 52:14.498 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
In

52:14.531 --> 52:20.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much of Iraq, Iran, Pakistan,
it's, you know,
go back to

52:20.704 --> 52:24.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much of Iraq, Iran, Pakistan,
it's, you know,
go back to

53:04.148 --> 53:07.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the caliphate of 1,000 years
ago.

53:07.084 --> 53:11.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The danger is that we're not
imagining futures,
not imagining something where we
can go to

53:11.922 --> 53:14.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's different and
progressive.

53:14.058 --> 53:17.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's, I think, part of the
job of a
novelist, is to start imaging
those futures.

53:17.061 --> 53:18.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Meaning what?

53:18.929 --> 53:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHSIN HAMID: Meaning to make
people comfortable
with what I think is the
inevitable reality

53:22.800 --> 53:25.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a world where billions of
people are going
to move in the next couple of
hundred years.

53:26.003 --> 53:29.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, climate will change,
sea levels
will rise, people will move.

53:29.706 --> 53:34.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we can't find a way to be
hopeful and
optimistic and find beauty in
that, we're

53:34.478 --> 53:35.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in real trouble.

53:35.712 --> 53:37.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
new novel is
"Exit West."

53:37.047 --> 53:39.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

really want
to read.
