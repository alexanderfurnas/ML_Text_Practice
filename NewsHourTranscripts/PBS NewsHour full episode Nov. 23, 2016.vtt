JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.372 --> 00:07.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.274 --> 00:12.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Donald Trump announces
more top appointments to his
administration,

00:12.346 --> 00:18.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we take a closer look at the
president-elect's
potential conflicts with his
business interests.

00:18.118 --> 00:24.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, we explore the many ways
Mexico and
the U.S. are bound together,
despite the border.

00:24.725 --> 00:29.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Truly separating
these countries
is nearly impossible, given
their deep connections,

00:29.696 --> 00:34.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not only geographic -- I'm
standing in the
U.S., and everything beyond the
water is Mexico

00:34.067 --> 00:38.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
-- but also intertwined
economies and families
who straddle the border.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every day, more than a million
people cross
legally.

00:40.474 --> 00:46.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, this week's
Leading Edge
looks at the science and
psychology behind

00:46.446 --> 00:48.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
efforts to stop terrorist
attacks.

00:48.949 --> 00:54.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And looking at the long
tradition of presidents
pardoning a Thanksgiving Turkey.

00:54.221 --> 01:01.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

before Thanksgiving,
new Cabinet nominees from
president-elect

01:15.142 --> 01:17.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump that send a message of
diversity.

01:17.811 --> 01:23.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He announced his choices today
for United
Nations ambassador and secretary
of education.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:25.419 --> 01:30.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: During the primaries,
South Carolina
Governor Nikki Haley was a
frequent critic

01:30.257 --> 01:33.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of candidate Trump, instead
backing Marco
Rubio.

01:33.427 --> 01:37.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her State of the Union response
was seen as
an indictment of Mr. Trump.

01:37.397 --> 01:39.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

01:39.232 --> 01:41.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIKKI HALEY (R), South Carolina:
During anxious
times, it can be tempting to
follow the siren

01:41.401 --> 01:44.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
call of the angriest voices.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We must resist that temptation.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But that was then.

01:49.376 --> 01:54.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now president-elect Trump has
picked her to
be his ambassador to the United
Nations, a

01:54.548 --> 01:56.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Cabinet-level post.

01:56.316 --> 02:00.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The daughter of Indian
immigrants is in her
second term as governor, the
first female

02:01.021 --> 02:03.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and first minority to hold the
office.

02:03.824 --> 02:09.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She drew praise last year for
her response
after an avowed white
supremacist killed nine

02:09.162 --> 02:14.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
parishioners in a black
Charleston church,
and for leading the drive to
remove the Confederate

02:14.334 --> 02:18.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Flag from the statehouse, where
it had flown
for a half-century.

02:18.705 --> 02:23.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Haley's exposure to world
affairs is limited,
but she's attracted foreign
companies like

02:23.043 --> 02:25.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Volvo to South Carolina.

02:25.612 --> 02:29.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Announcing the pick, the
president-elect called
her "a proven deal-maker.

02:29.683 --> 02:32.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We look to be making plenty of
deals.

02:32.419 --> 02:36.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She will be a great leader
representing us
on the world stage."

02:36.757 --> 02:41.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a far cry from last
March, when candidate
Trump tweeted: "The people of
South Carolina

02:42.029 --> 02:44.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are embarrassed by Nikki Haley."

02:44.531 --> 02:49.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, Haley said in a
statement: "When the
president believes you have a
major contribution

02:49.736 --> 02:53.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make, that is a calling that
is important
to heed."

02:54.007 --> 02:59.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump today also tapped
Michigan philanthropist
Betsy DeVos to be his nominee
for education

02:59.846 --> 03:00.881 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
secretary.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's never worked in public
education.

03:02.849 --> 03:07.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A big Republican donor and
one-time chairman
of the Michigan party, she is a
champion for

03:07.954 --> 03:10.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
charter schools and school
vouchers.

03:10.690 --> 03:14.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She and her husband formed a PAC
to support
pro-voucher candidates
nationwide.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

president-elect
released a Thanksgiving message
appealing

03:21.668 --> 03:23.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for unity after a divisive
campaign.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: This historic
political campaign
is now over.

03:27.941 --> 03:32.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now begins a great national
campaign to
rebuild our country and to
restore the full

03:33.013 --> 03:35.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
promise of America for all of
our people.

03:35.715 --> 03:40.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump and his
family are spending
the holiday at his Mar-a-Lago in
Florida.

03:40.420 --> 03:43.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:43.623 --> 03:48.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There were
conflicting reports
today about whether Dr. Ben
Carson had agreed

03:48.328 --> 03:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to become secretary of housing
and urban development,
but a Carson spokesman said late
this afternoon:

03:53.934 --> 03:58.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Nothing has been offered, and
no decision
has been made."

03:58.371 --> 04:02.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Hillary
Clinton's
lead in the popular vote in this
year's election

04:02.909 --> 04:05.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has passed the two million mark.

04:05.212 --> 04:11.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As of today, Clinton has 64.2
million votes
in the nationwide tally.

04:11.451 --> 04:17.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

with 62.2 million,
despite winning the Electoral
College.

04:17.624 --> 04:22.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The updated totals are due
largely to absentee
and provisional ballots that are
still being

04:22.596 --> 04:24.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
counted in California.

04:24.764 --> 04:30.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That ongoing count in California
has approved
a ballot measure speeding up
death penalty

04:30.303 --> 04:31.838 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
appeals.

04:31.872 --> 04:37.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

that Proposition
66 won 51 percent of the vote.

04:37.077 --> 04:42.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's meant to cut down on the
number of years
that death row inmates wait and
ensure that

04:42.349 --> 04:45.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they are actually executed.

all-out attacks on Syrian
rebels.

of Eastern Aleppo, with
thousands there and

elsewhere cut off from food and
medicine,
and the French foreign minister
called for

05:03.737 --> 05:05.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an emergency meeting.

JEAN-MARC AYRAULT, French
Minister of Foreign
Affairs (through translator):
France is taking

05:08.975 --> 05:13.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an initiative to confront the
strategy of
total war by the regime and its
allies who

05:13.380 --> 05:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are taking advantage of the
uncertainty in
the United States to gather very
quickly the

05:17.517 --> 05:20.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group of friends of Syria in the
next few
days in Paris.

05:20.787 --> 05:24.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.N. special
envoy for
Syria joined in the concern.

Syria's military

office.

Tensions have been rising in the
region since
militants killed 17 soldiers at
an Indian

05:45.145 --> 05:46.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
army base there in September.

along the
dividing line, hitting a
passenger bus and

05:52.419 --> 05:54.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
killing 10 civilians.

05:54.387 --> 05:59.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

white supremacist
of murdering Labor Party
lawmaker Jo Cox.

06:05.065 --> 06:09.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was shot and stabbed to
death a week before

Back in this country, the long
Thanksgiving
travel weekend has begun, and
it's expected

06:20.814 --> 06:23.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be the busiest in nearly a
decade.

06:23.450 --> 06:26.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Airports, railways and roads
filled today.

venture at least 50 miles from
homes, due

06:32.626 --> 06:35.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in part to record-low gas
prices.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But police urged patience.

There's just so many motorists
that are going

06:39.299 --> 06:41.101 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be traveling.

06:41.134 --> 06:45.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And oftentimes we see where
operators get
nervous or they get upset, or
road rage kicks

06:45.171 --> 06:47.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in because they're not getting
to their destination
quick enough.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Don't be that driver.

06:49.709 --> 06:53.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Heavy rain and
snow caused
delays in some places today, but
for the most

06:53.847 --> 06:56.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part, the weather wasn't an
issue.

factors.

business past could create
problems for his

08:25.105 --> 08:31.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

terrorists; and much

08:41.521 --> 08:48.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
using counseling instead of
prison time to
de-radicalize convicted
terrorists; and much

08:49.028 --> 08:50.797 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

08:50.830 --> 08:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A deeper look now into one of
president-elect
Trump's key Cabinet picks today,
and again

08:53.967 --> 08:55.869 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to John Yang.

08:55.902 --> 09:00.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: One of those choices
that immediately
drew a lot of attention was his
pick for education

09:00.840 --> 09:02.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
secretary, Betsy DeVos.

09:02.709 --> 09:06.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It sends a number of signals
about what Mr.
Trump intends to do with his
education policy,

09:06.946 --> 09:09.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but it also raises some
questions.

09:09.182 --> 09:12.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alyson Klein of Education Week
joins me now
to talk about this.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Alyson, thanks for coming.

09:14.454 --> 09:18.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Betsy DeVos, not necessarily
well-known nationwide.

09:18.358 --> 09:24.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Who is she and what does she say
or what does
her -- the pick say about a
Trump administration

09:24.197 --> 09:26.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on education?

09:26.132 --> 09:28.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN, Education Week:
So, on the campaign
trail, Trump didn't talk much
about cases

09:28.535 --> 09:31.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- about policy, but, when he
did, he talked
about school choice.

09:31.771 --> 09:35.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Betsy DeVos is a longtime
school choice
advocate.

09:35.341 --> 09:39.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we can expect that this
administration
is going to make good on its
promise to make

09:39.112 --> 09:41.080 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
school choice a huge priority.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What can the federal
government
do on school choice?

09:43.650 --> 09:46.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: So, that's a great
question.

09:46.386 --> 09:52.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the campaign trail, Donald
Trump proposed
taking $20 billion in federal
funding, which

09:52.659 --> 09:58.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is almost a third of the U.S.
Department of
Education's budget, and using
that for a school

09:58.965 --> 10:01.401 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
choice program.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's unclear if a proposal like
that could
actually pass Congress.

10:04.938 --> 10:09.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Lamar Alexander, who
will actually
preside over Betsy DeVos'
confirmation hearing,

10:09.976 --> 10:13.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put forth a similar proposal
last year and
it just didn't get the votes to
clear procedural

10:13.947 --> 10:15.548 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hurdles.

10:15.582 --> 10:18.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's unclear if they will be
able to do
their grand vision on school
choice.

10:18.885 --> 10:23.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But certainly having somebody
like Betsy DeVos
talking about school choice from
the bully

10:23.723 --> 10:29.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pulpit of the Department of
Education could
really give some lift to the
issue in states

10:29.529 --> 10:31.331 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and districts.

10:31.364 --> 10:34.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Another thing that
Mr. Trump spoke
a lot about on the campaign
trail was Common

10:34.567 --> 10:35.902 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Core.

10:35.935 --> 10:36.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is against it.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He doesn't like it.

10:38.204 --> 10:41.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do we know about Betsy
DeVos' position
on Common Core?

10:41.441 --> 10:45.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: Well, she's
clarified her position
on Common Core today, saying
that she thinks

10:45.211 --> 10:47.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's a federal boondoggle.

10:47.413 --> 10:52.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's also said that she's in
favor of accountability
and local control.

10:52.218 --> 10:56.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some school choice advocates had
actually
been worried that DeVos was a
Common Core

10:56.222 --> 11:02.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supporter because she's on the
board of Governor
Jeb Bush's organization, and
obviously Governor

11:02.462 --> 11:04.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bush is quite a supporter of
Common Core.

11:04.197 --> 11:08.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she made it clear today that
she stands
with Mr. Trump in opposing the
standards.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: How does she compare,
her background
compare?

11:11.204 --> 11:12.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She was a philanthropist.

11:12.939 --> 11:16.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was a chairman of the
Michigan Republican
Party.

11:16.042 --> 11:20.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does her background and her
experience
compare with previous education
secretaries?

11:20.747 --> 11:22.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: It's unusual
background.

11:22.582 --> 11:26.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have never that I can think
of really had
an advocate at the helm of the
department.

11:26.686 --> 11:32.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our last couple education
secretaries, Secretary
John King, who is in the post
now, Arne Duncan,

11:32.825 --> 11:38.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Obama's first education
secretary, had both
worked in school districts, had
been -- John

11:38.298 --> 11:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
King was the state chief in New
York.

11:40.466 --> 11:43.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Arne Duncan was a school
superintendent in
Chicago.

11:43.970 --> 11:47.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other education secretaries,
like Lamar Alexander,
actually, have been governors.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's unusual to have somebody
who has primarily
been an advocate.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: She's never worked in
public education.

11:53.947 --> 11:57.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She's never run a big
bureaucracy or a big
organization.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that what you're saying?

11:58.251 --> 11:59.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: Yes, that's
correct.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What's been the
reaction to her
being named as his nominee?

12:03.022 --> 12:05.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: Depends on who you
ask.

12:05.158 --> 12:09.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
School choice advocates are
really excited
to have one of their own, one of
their champions

12:09.195 --> 12:11.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
headed to the Department of
Education.

12:11.497 --> 12:14.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Teachers unions are really
unhappy with the
pick.

12:14.867 --> 12:18.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They picked up on what you
picked up on, that
she doesn't have a background in
a school

12:18.137 --> 12:19.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
district.

12:19.872 --> 12:22.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are also opposed to
this idea of
vouchers, which they say siphon
off money

12:22.408 --> 12:23.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for public schools.

12:23.977 --> 12:27.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And that's been an
issue for some
time now in public education.

12:27.513 --> 12:29.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: Yes, absolutely.

12:29.349 --> 12:33.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The idea of creating a federal
school choice
program has been something that
Republicans

12:33.453 --> 12:35.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have wanted to do for a really
long time.

12:35.688 --> 12:39.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The closest they have come is a
voucher program
for the District of Columbia.

12:39.158 --> 12:43.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But with DeVos in the Education
Department,
they may really be able to that
vision further.

12:43.363 --> 12:46.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Any sense will she
have any trouble
getting confirmed, do you think?

12:46.132 --> 12:47.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: I would expect
not.

12:47.800 --> 12:51.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Alexander put out a very
supportive
statement on her confirmation
today.

12:51.838 --> 12:55.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's certainly donated to a lot
of Republicans.

12:55.808 --> 12:58.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they may really look upon
her appointment
favorably.

12:58.811 --> 13:03.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Alyson Klein helping
us understand
who Betsy DeVos is, thanks so
much for coming

13:03.282 --> 13:04.250 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

13:04.283 --> 13:12.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: Thanks for having
me.

13:12.492 --> 13:20.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One area of
uncharted territory
under a Trump presidency centers
on potential

13:20.233 --> 13:22.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conflicts of interests with his
businesses.

13:22.669 --> 13:28.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, the president-elect
told The New
York Times, "The law is totally
on my side."

13:28.508 --> 13:33.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But recent meetings with some
current and
potential foreign investors have
raised new

13:33.746 --> 13:34.714 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
questions.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We explore those now with
Richard Painter.

13:36.716 --> 13:42.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a University of Minnesota
law professor
who was President George W.
Bush's top ethics

13:42.121 --> 13:44.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attorney in the White House.

13:44.090 --> 13:49.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Kenneth Gross, he's an
ethics law expert
who advised New York Mayor
Michael Bloomberg

13:49.562 --> 13:53.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when he went from businessman to
public official.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the "NewsHour."

13:55.101 --> 13:56.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to start with you,
Richard Painter.

13:56.903 --> 14:03.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Donald Trump says the
president can't
have a conflict of interest, is
he right about

14:03.710 --> 14:04.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that?

14:04.877 --> 14:06.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD PAINTER, University of
Minnesota:
Well, no.

14:06.446 --> 14:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course the president can have
a conflict
of interest.

14:09.649 --> 14:14.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, think about where we
would be today
if President Roosevelt had owned
the buildings

14:14.921 --> 14:20.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Germany during the war or the
years leading
up to the war and large loans
from Deutsche

14:20.660 --> 14:22.361 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Bank.

14:22.395 --> 14:28.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can have conflicts of
interest that are
very detrimental to the American
people.

14:28.501 --> 14:32.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You need a president who is
going to stand
up to foreign dictators, who is
going to focus

14:32.338 --> 14:38.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the needs of the United
States, and the
need for peace in the world and
also strength.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And these conflicts of interest
are real.

14:41.380 --> 14:46.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether or not a specific
federal criminal
statute applies to the
president, which it

14:46.652 --> 14:51.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't, even though it applies
to every other
executive branch employee, but
there are other

14:51.624 --> 14:56.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rules that do apply to the
president, including
the Emoluments Clause of the
Constitution,

14:56.229 --> 15:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which says the president cannot
receive payments
from foreign governments.

15:01.400 --> 15:05.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's something the Trump
Organization
needs to deal with, because they
have outstanding

15:05.805 --> 15:09.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
loans from the Bank of China,
which is controlled
by the government of China.

15:09.742 --> 15:15.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have foreign diplomats
checking into
their hotels and renting the
expensive suites.

15:15.214 --> 15:16.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that needs to be dealt with.

15:16.916 --> 15:21.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the law does apply to the
president and
he can have conflicts of
interest, and he

15:21.053 --> 15:22.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
needs to get rid of them.

15:22.221 --> 15:23.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kenneth Gross,
how do you see
that?

15:23.890 --> 15:27.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How clear are the rules, the
laws that apply
to the president?

15:27.426 --> 15:32.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH GROSS, Ethics Law
Expert: Well, what's
clear is that the domestic
conflict of interest

15:32.298 --> 15:34.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
law doesn't apply to the
president.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the letter of the law.

15:37.370 --> 15:44.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the ethics surrounding a
president and
what the conventions say he
should be doing

15:44.510 --> 15:46.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a very different thing.

15:46.479 --> 15:51.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Emoluments Clause, as
Richard has mentioned,
which is this gift provision
from the original

15:51.551 --> 15:56.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Constitution, but is alive and
well today,
does apply, but the application
of that is

15:56.923 --> 15:58.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not so clear.

15:58.324 --> 16:01.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, what sort of foreign
corporations
would come into play?

16:01.327 --> 16:06.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are they really owned by a
foreign government
and exactly is what an
emolument?

16:06.432 --> 16:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it just a payment or does it
actually have
to be a benefit...

16:10.136 --> 16:11.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A kind of
benefit.

16:11.237 --> 16:12.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KENNETH GROSS: ... if it's a
commercial transaction?

16:12.371 --> 16:15.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, yes, there are issues of
interpretation
as well.

16:15.508 --> 16:21.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Richard Painter,
what do you
say Donald Trump needing to do
in order to

16:21.414 --> 16:27.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
remove any question of a
conflict of interest,
given his significant and
widespread holdings?

16:27.220 --> 16:32.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD PAINTER: Well, I think
the first step
is to make sure that he complies
with the

16:32.792 --> 16:38.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Constitution, and he does need
to address
the emoluments issue.

16:38.064 --> 16:44.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have suggested to his
transition team
that they ought to have an
assignment over

16:44.237 --> 16:50.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the United States government,
an assignment
of any and all payments from
foreign governments

16:50.343 --> 16:53.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that are covered by the
Emoluments Clause.

16:53.579 --> 16:56.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is an answer to the problem
of a gift
from a foreign government.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can give it to the United
States government.

16:58.751 --> 17:04.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He could do that today with a
simple assignment
of those payments, plus an audit
that would

17:04.957 --> 17:07.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take place every year to make
sure we swept
them all out.

17:07.994 --> 17:09.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the bare minimum.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the Electoral
College ought to
insist on that before voting,
just as they

17:12.965 --> 17:17.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would want to see a birth
certificate if that
were at issue or anything else.

17:17.603 --> 17:18.571 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
That's important
constitutionally.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

17:20.406 --> 17:23.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Richard Painter,
let me just
stop you right there, because I
want to make

17:23.175 --> 17:26.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sure what everybody understands
what this
emoluments business is.

17:26.479 --> 17:32.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what we're talking about is
anything that
would benefit Donald Trump's
businesses, being

17:32.618 --> 17:37.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure that doesn't benefit --
doesn't interfere
in any way with the U.S.
government.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KENNETH GROSS: Yes.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
As well as I can define this...

17:39.625 --> 17:40.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICHARD PAINTER: Well, no,
that's too broad.

17:40.626 --> 17:41.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's too broad.

17:41.627 --> 17:42.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK.

17:42.628 --> 17:43.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KENNETH GROSS: OK.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.331 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

17:45.364 --> 17:48.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what we have here is a
provision in the
Constitution that says you
cannot receive

17:48.634 --> 17:51.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a present, meaning a gift.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then there is this question of
emolument.

17:53.839 --> 17:58.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It clearly applies to someone
who works in
the National Institute of Health
that wants

17:58.477 --> 18:01.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to work for a foreign
government, because
he's providing a service.

18:01.814 --> 18:07.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if he gets a payment for
that, that raises
questions under emoluments and
has to be dealt

18:07.386 --> 18:09.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with by the Department of
Justice.

18:09.555 --> 18:16.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If there's a commercial
transaction, a foreign
government is paying rent into a
place that

18:16.562 --> 18:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're renting that is owned by
Mr. Trump,
the president of the United
States, that -- I

18:21.300 --> 18:25.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have not seen the emolument
provision applied
in quite that situation.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not a service.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a commercial transaction.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, without
getting too much
in the weeds here in the few
minutes that

18:30.309 --> 18:36.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have, Richard Painter, how do
you see -- again,
what are you saying that Mr.
Trump needs to

18:36.682 --> 18:38.517 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do?

18:38.551 --> 18:42.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD PAINTER: Well, if those
are above-market
rents or they're below-market
interest rate

18:42.455 --> 18:48.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
loans from the Bank of China, I
think those
are presents, just like any
other present.

18:48.761 --> 18:53.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the point is that he could
right now assign
over to the United States
government anything

18:53.165 --> 18:57.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
covered under the Emoluments
Clause of the
Constitution, and we can sort
out later what

18:57.870 --> 18:59.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it is, pursuant under audit.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that needs to be done before
the Electoral
College vote.

19:02.508 --> 19:08.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The broad issue can be addressed
by divesting
himself of all of his assets
through an initial

19:08.047 --> 19:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public offering or some other
way to convert
the assets to cash.

19:12.651 --> 19:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many American families do that
when they want
to move on from their business.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, here, there's a very good
reason to move
on.

19:19.225 --> 19:21.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's going to become the
president of the
United States.

19:21.293 --> 19:25.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Ken Gross,
he has talked
about putting his assets in what
is called

19:25.364 --> 19:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a blind trust that his children
would run.

19:28.134 --> 19:30.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Would that take care of what
we're talking
about?

19:30.102 --> 19:32.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KENNETH GROSS: It really
doesn't.

19:32.738 --> 19:34.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not a blind trust, first of
all.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He knows what he put in it.

19:36.208 --> 19:40.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In order for it to be a true
blind trust,
he would have to liquidate his
assets first.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is not realistic in any
kind of short
period of time.

19:43.649 --> 19:45.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know about going public
with everything.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not so easy either.

19:47.686 --> 19:53.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I understand that most his
assets are
illiquid, and they don't all
create conflicts

19:53.959 --> 19:55.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of interests.

19:55.261 --> 19:57.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think -- I agree that you need
to look internationally
first.

19:57.630 --> 20:03.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But having a trust with your
children in charge
doesn't meet the requirements of
blind trust,

20:03.302 --> 20:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if he were required to meet
those requirements,
which he's not.

20:06.138 --> 20:09.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Richard Painter,
just quickly,
how much of this is complicated
by the fact

20:09.809 --> 20:14.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we don't know publicly what
Donald Trump's
business interests are?

20:14.914 --> 20:17.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has not released his tax
returns.

20:17.550 --> 20:22.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He has made a financial
statement, but a lot
of this is not public
information, is it?

20:22.788 --> 20:24.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD PAINTER: No, it's not.

20:24.590 --> 20:28.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I urged him to release the
tax returns
during the campaign, but he
decided not to

20:28.360 --> 20:31.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do that, even though every other
candidate
has and every president.

20:31.497 --> 20:37.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, going forward, I think the
answer here
is for him to sell these
business interests,

20:37.136 --> 20:40.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take the company public or come
up with some
other answer.

20:40.306 --> 20:44.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will leave him with a few
billion dollars
to give some to his kids, and
put the rest

20:44.276 --> 20:46.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a blind trust, and be a good
president.

20:46.846 --> 20:52.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he made this decision that
he wants to
be a president, rather than a
businessman.

20:52.384 --> 20:55.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now that he's made that
decision and he
won, it's time to do it.

20:55.187 --> 20:59.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Ken Gross,
just quickly,
is that what he has to do, sell
it all off

20:59.959 --> 21:01.360 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and...

21:01.393 --> 21:03.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH GROSS: I'm not going
that far, because
it's not realistic.

21:03.729 --> 21:07.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, internationally,
though, that's where
the primary focus should be.

21:07.333 --> 21:11.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kenneth Gross,
Richard Painter,
we thank you both.

21:11.904 --> 21:18.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD PAINTER: Thanks.

21:18.711 --> 21:27.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: During his run
for the White
House, president-elect Donald
Trump made Mexico,

21:27.186 --> 21:31.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perhaps more than any other
individual country,
a campaign issue.

21:31.290 --> 21:36.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, with the help of the
Pulitzer Center
on Crisis Reporting, we begin a
special two-part

21:36.562 --> 21:42.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
series from Mexico, and a look
at Trump's
promises to deport millions of
undocumented

21:42.601 --> 21:47.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigrants and to build a wall
along the U.S.
Southern border.

21:47.206 --> 21:52.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Nick
Schifrin and producer
Zach Fannin begin their report
tonight from

21:52.111 --> 21:56.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the outskirts of the Mexican
border city of
Ciudad Juarez.

21:56.282 --> 22:02.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In the dry
riverbed that separates
Mexico from the U.S., the
promise of a better

22:02.087 --> 22:05.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
life is only a few hundred feet
away.

22:05.124 --> 22:10.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The woman is a 23-year-old
Mexican from Juarez
who asked to remain anonymous.

22:10.362 --> 22:14.133 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
Leading her is a
half-guide/half-smuggler
known as a coyote.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everything beyond the fence is
El Paso, Texas.

22:16.635 --> 22:18.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's trying to cross illegally.

22:18.204 --> 22:22.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
There's work here,
but the wages are very low.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can barely survive here.

22:24.743 --> 22:26.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Life there is better than here.

22:26.345 --> 22:29.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The coyote's been
doing this
for 10 years.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Compared to when he started,
today's border
is much more secure.

22:32.585 --> 22:35.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It's
more difficult
now.

22:35.988 --> 22:38.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Before, they used to cross just
to have fun.

22:38.457 --> 22:42.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now they cross because they want
to be there,
like her, and live there.

22:42.761 --> 22:45.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: She's part of a
recent spike.

22:45.731 --> 22:49.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From August to October, the
number of people
apprehended on the Southern
border rose by

22:49.301 --> 22:50.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nearly 20 percent.

22:50.936 --> 22:53.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's trying to get in before
Donald Trump
is inaugurated.

22:53.672 --> 22:58.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): They
say it will
get more difficult, so I have to
do it now.

22:58.777 --> 23:03.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: What would happen
if President
Trump built a wall right here?

23:03.249 --> 23:05.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
would cross anyway.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're never going to stop
crossing.

23:07.620 --> 23:10.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: How would you
cross if there
were a wall there?

23:10.756 --> 23:13.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): That's
what we wondered
when the fence went up.

23:13.859 --> 23:15.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we found a way.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.061 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here we are.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's always a way.

23:17.596 --> 23:19.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It's not easy.

23:19.098 --> 23:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tonight, a border guard scared
them away.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They will try again tomorrow.

23:23.202 --> 23:26.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stopping this kind of illegal
immigration
was a central Trump campaign
theme.

23:26.538 --> 23:30.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: When Mexico
sends its people, they're not
sending their

23:30.576 --> 23:31.543 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
best.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're bringing drugs.

23:33.212 --> 23:34.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're bringing crime.

23:34.213 --> 23:35.180 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're rapists.

23:35.214 --> 23:38.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And some, I assume, are good
people.

23:38.817 --> 23:48.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On day one, we will begin
working on an impenetrable,
physical, tall, powerful,
beautiful Southern

23:48.661 --> 23:50.329 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
border wall.

23:50.362 --> 23:52.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

23:52.898 --> 23:58.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The Mexico-U.S.
border is nearly
2,000 miles' long.

23:58.470 --> 24:03.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, walls or fences, like
this one
west of El Paso, Texas, cover
about 700 miles.

24:03.542 --> 24:04.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The terrain can be rough.

24:05.010 --> 24:08.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the distances between
American and Mexican
cities are often small.

24:08.914 --> 24:13.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some places, sturdy iron
gives way to standard-issue
chain-link fence, which is
scheduled to be

24:13.819 --> 24:14.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
replaced.

24:14.820 --> 24:20.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This fence couldn't keep this
young man out.

24:20.326 --> 24:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. border agents arrest a
17-year-old Mexican
who crossed illegally.

24:27.499 --> 24:31.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's been arrested before trying
to lead undocumented
immigrants into the U.S.

24:31.937 --> 24:36.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This time, he was spotted by a
highly sensitive
camera manned by an agent more
than a mile

24:36.408 --> 24:38.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE ROMERO, Border Patrol: They
have got nighttime
equipment, cameras they can use
to look down

24:39.912 --> 24:43.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and really cover a vast area
with the technology
they have available to them.

24:43.349 --> 24:46.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Joe Romero is a
supervisory
Border Patrol agent.

24:46.819 --> 24:50.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says there is no quick and
easy solution
to securing the border.

24:50.222 --> 24:53.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOE ROMERO: Here, we have got an
18-foot fence.

24:53.092 --> 24:56.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a guy in Mexico, I'm
sure, making
a killing off of 20-foot
ladders.

24:57.029 --> 25:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the end of the day, people
find a way to
get through.

25:00.866 --> 25:04.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Every day, they
patrol for
eight hours.

25:04.737 --> 25:11.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The vehicles and fences are
meant to deter
and stop would-be crossers.

25:11.977 --> 25:17.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This increased presence, along
with more aggressive
prosecution, began a decade ago.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.717 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It worked.

25:18.751 --> 25:25.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Illegal crossings are down 84
percent since
2006, despite the recent spike.

25:25.391 --> 25:28.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is the goal to bring illegal
crossings to
zero?

25:28.093 --> 25:30.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE ROMERO: I can't say that you
will ever
be able to stop crossings 100
percent.

25:30.929 --> 25:31.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I just don't see that.

25:31.930 --> 25:33.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, really, that's not the
goal.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The goal is to mitigate the
threats coming
to our borders.

25:35.734 --> 25:40.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Truly separating
these countries
is nearly impossible, given
their deep connections,

25:40.672 --> 25:44.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not only geographic -- I'm
standing in the
U.S., and everything beyond the
water is Mexico

25:44.943 --> 25:48.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
-- but also intertwined
economies and families
who straddle the border.

25:48.981 --> 25:55.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every day, more than a million
people cross
legally.

25:55.454 --> 26:00.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Olivares Castro family's
commute starts
every day at 4:00 a.m.

26:00.692 --> 26:04.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mother Reina, behind the wheel,
is a Mexican
from Juarez; 12-year-old Anna
wants to be

26:04.930 --> 26:06.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a doctor when she grows up.

26:06.498 --> 26:10.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To cross the border, she needs a
binder full
of papers and a student visa.

26:10.436 --> 26:14.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About 370,000 vehicles cross the
Southern
border every day.

26:14.506 --> 26:19.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The wait can be more than an
hour, all of
this, so Anna can go to an
American school

26:19.178 --> 26:20.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's better than any school in
Juarez.

26:20.979 --> 26:22.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNA OLIVARES CASTRO, Student:
They teach
you more things.

26:22.314 --> 26:25.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They get more deep into the
subjects they
teach you.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have more job opportunities.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They recognize your talent.

26:28.687 --> 26:32.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: She says this
private school
treats her with respect.

26:32.057 --> 26:36.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This family and many Mexicans
believe that
president-elect Trump
disrespects a country

26:36.895 --> 26:38.397 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of 120 million.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REINA OLIVARES CASTRO, Mother
(translated):
Not everyone is a criminal.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They need us Mexicans, they need
us Latinos,
and we need them.

26:45.637 --> 26:47.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANNA OLIVARES CASTRO: He's
telling lies.

26:47.306 --> 26:51.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all those people think that
we're what
Donald Trump says.

26:51.076 --> 26:53.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But we're not like that.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're good people.

26:54.947 --> 26:58.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Two thousand
three hundreds
miles north, the Latino
community in Columbus,

26:58.884 --> 27:01.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ohio, feels the same frustration
and fear.

27:01.420 --> 27:10.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN RAMOS, LULAC: Here in the
Midwest, in
Ohio, now all Latinos seems to
fit a profile.

27:11.029 --> 27:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: John Ramos heads
the local
office of the pro-Latino rights
organization

27:15.234 --> 27:16.869 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LULAC.

27:16.902 --> 27:19.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is most concerned by Trump's
promise to
deport millions of undocumented
workers.

27:19.538 --> 27:27.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I am going to
create a new special
deportation task force focused
on identifying

27:27.546 --> 27:34.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and quickly removing the most
dangerous criminal
illegal immigrants in America
who have evaded

27:34.887 --> 27:36.755 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
justice.

27:36.788 --> 27:41.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: That promise
seems to have
awakened previously hidden
racism and nationalism.

27:41.660 --> 27:45.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This undocumented Mexican
immigrant, who was
too scared to show her face,
gave birth nine

27:45.931 --> 27:47.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
months ago in Ohio.

27:47.699 --> 27:51.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means the daughter's a U.S.
citizen,
and the U.S. is obligated to
provide her Social

27:51.436 --> 27:53.138 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Security.

27:53.171 --> 27:56.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when the mother tried to get
her baby
a Social Security card, a local
official threw

27:56.575 --> 27:57.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her out of the office.

27:57.843 --> 28:01.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): He
told me: "I
can't help you.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Get out of here."

28:02.581 --> 28:03.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And his voice was upset.

28:03.749 --> 28:06.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I told him: "It's not Social
Security for
me.

28:06.451 --> 28:07.519 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's for her."

28:07.553 --> 28:09.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he told me: "You don't have
documents.

28:09.354 --> 28:10.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How dare you come here?"

28:10.656 --> 28:14.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Is that a federal
official
effectively going rogue?

28:14.092 --> 28:16.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN RAMOS: I would say so.

28:16.295 --> 28:25.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not in his position as a
Social Security
employee, federal employee, to
request a person

28:25.704 --> 28:27.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to show proof of their
citizenship.

28:27.506 --> 28:30.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The mother
returned with a
lawyer, and the government
official gave the

28:30.609 --> 28:32.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
baby the Social Security card.

28:32.578 --> 28:35.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he improperly forced the
mother to provide
her address.

28:35.514 --> 28:37.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ramos says that's never happened
before.

28:37.449 --> 28:43.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN RAMOS: If you have to
provide right now
your residence, your point of
contact, your

28:43.755 --> 28:50.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
phone number, you're providing a
track, a
documentation to follow up on
you.

28:50.696 --> 28:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And that has sent
a chill into
Columbus' Latino community.

28:54.933 --> 28:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN RAMOS: It's all the hate.

28:57.936 --> 29:06.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's all these comments that he
would say
about, like, "Oh, I would just
punch him in

29:06.044 --> 29:07.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the face."

29:07.312 --> 29:09.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Like to punch him
in the face,
I will tell you.

29:09.514 --> 29:14.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN RAMOS: So you would have
people now thinking
that they could probably come up
to you and

29:14.720 --> 29:19.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just act on their own and attack
you.

29:19.057 --> 29:23.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The day after
Donald Trump
was elected president, something
happened

29:23.328 --> 29:24.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to you at school.

29:24.329 --> 29:25.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell me what happened.

29:25.330 --> 29:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GIRL: This kid was making fun of
me at school.

29:26.632 --> 29:28.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he was like: "Are you going
to go pack
your bags?

29:28.600 --> 29:30.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are you going to go back to
Mexico?

29:30.168 --> 29:32.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are your parents getting ready?"
and all that.

29:32.204 --> 29:36.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The 9-year-old
girl is an American,
born in Ohio, and goes to a
local public school.

29:36.575 --> 29:40.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her father is an undocumented
Mexican who
has been here for 11 years.

29:40.412 --> 29:43.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're also scared and didn't
want us to
identify them.

29:43.348 --> 29:46.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He runs a taco truck.

29:46.551 --> 29:49.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He pays taxes on relatively
steady income.

29:49.855 --> 29:52.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His customers are mostly fellow
undocumented
immigrants.

29:52.324 --> 29:57.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have always felt welcomed,
he says, until
Donald Trump began his campaign.

29:57.162 --> 30:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Inside
the Mexican
communities, people go to work
with fear.

30:01.767 --> 30:05.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the kids' grades can go down
because they're
worrying about what's going to
happen.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The impact has been like a bomb.

30:07.139 --> 30:10.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's affecting the children, the
young people,
the innocents.

30:10.475 --> 30:16.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In response to
those fears,
Mexican Foreign Secretary
Claudia Ruiz Massieu

30:16.448 --> 30:19.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
released a video featuring
Mexico's consul
generals.

30:19.284 --> 30:24.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They urge the five-plus million
undocumented
Mexicans in the U.S. to stay
calm.

30:24.423 --> 30:28.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLAUDIA RUIZ MASSIEU, Mexican
Foreign Secretary:
We are alert.

30:28.360 --> 30:37.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is why I have instructed my
50 consulates
to increase their outreach to
our community.

30:37.135 --> 30:40.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Massieu says she
wants to work
with the incoming
administration, but she

30:40.939 --> 30:45.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warns that if Trump follows
through on all
his promises, it's not only
Mexico that would

30:45.343 --> 30:47.079 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be harmed.

30:47.112 --> 30:51.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLAUDIA RUIZ MASSIEU: If the
environment were
to become more hostile, I'm sure
the United

30:51.216 --> 30:59.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
States would also feel a
negative effect in
its economy, in prices,
inflation, in loss

30:59.291 --> 31:03.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of jobs, and in loss of people
that really
contribute a lot to different
communities

31:03.995 --> 31:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
throughout the United States.

31:05.797 --> 31:10.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But even before
Trump's taken
office, illegal immigration has
risen, as

31:10.635 --> 31:14.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has the panic among Mexicans on
both sides
of the border.

31:14.306 --> 31:23.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" I'm Nick
Schifrin in
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.

31:23.215 --> 31:30.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

31:30.055 --> 31:34.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
David Brooks
and others on how to keep the
peace during

31:34.493 --> 31:41.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your family's Thanksgiving meal;
and the final
turkey pardon under President
Obama.

31:41.333 --> 31:47.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now: trying to reverse
radicalization and
terrorism in the U.S.

31:47.139 --> 31:51.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien looks at how
experts in the
field of clinical psychology are
tackling

31:51.910 --> 31:55.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this, as part of our weekly
story on the Leading
Edge of science.

31:55.514 --> 32:01.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In a federal
courtroom in Minneapolis,
they are facing the threat of
homegrown terrorism

32:01.386 --> 32:05.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a manner that has never been
tried before
in this country.

32:05.624 --> 32:09.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is a bold experiment in
criminal justice
and clinical psychology.

32:09.728 --> 32:11.696 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The question?

32:11.730 --> 32:16.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can aggressive counseling bring
someone back
from the brink of
radicalization?

32:16.234 --> 32:18.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MANNY ATWAL, Federal Public
Defender: What
we have started here is
revolutionary.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think it's great.

32:20.338 --> 32:25.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Manny Atwal is a
federal public
defender representing
20-year-old Abdullahi

32:25.143 --> 32:26.845 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yusuf.

32:26.878 --> 32:32.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He is one of eight
first-generation Somali
Americans, all in their teens or
early 20s,

32:32.517 --> 32:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
convicted in May of plotting to
go to Syria
and fight for the Islamic State.

32:36.822 --> 32:39.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MANNY ATWAL: I know we punish
juveniles.

32:39.057 --> 32:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I get that, and I understand
that.

32:41.526 --> 32:44.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know we punish young
adults, and I get
that and understand that.

32:44.262 --> 32:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, to say
let's just lock
them up for a lifetime is not
the right solution.

32:48.633 --> 32:53.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: While he was in
jail awaiting
sentencing, Abdullahi Yusuf
became the nation's

32:53.939 --> 32:58.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first convicted terrorist to
undergo terrorism
rehabilitation.

32:58.710 --> 33:03.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has two mentors who counsel
him regularly
and a wide-ranging reading list.

33:03.648 --> 33:07.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MANNY ATWAL: He will have like a
week to read
this, write up a book report and
then discuss

33:07.719 --> 33:08.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it with us.

33:08.820 --> 33:09.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, it's a real
assignment
for him?

33:09.988 --> 33:11.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MANNY ATWAL: Yes.

33:11.456 --> 33:13.225 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

33:13.258 --> 33:16.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Learning American civics,
learning about American
culture, learning about the East
and West

33:16.228 --> 33:18.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just -- it just opened up his
eyes.

33:18.563 --> 33:23.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that, I think, is the
disengagement that
I speak of, to try and get these
kids to disengage

33:23.702 --> 33:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from some of their thinking
that's been put
in their heads, and to get them
back to be

33:28.940 --> 33:31.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
good citizens that they were
before this all
happened.

33:31.476 --> 33:35.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It appears the
effort might
have held sway with the judge.

33:35.647 --> 33:40.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yusuf, who also testified
against his friends,
was sentenced to time served.

33:40.919 --> 33:43.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most of the others received long
prison terms.

33:43.755 --> 33:47.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The case of these men is one
chapter in a
long, sad story.

33:47.592 --> 33:51.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN TUNHEIM, Chief U.S.
District Judge, District
of Minnesota: Minnesota has the
greatest number

33:51.763 --> 33:56.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of terrorism prosecutions of any
of the federal
districts in the United States.

33:56.568 --> 34:02.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: John Tunheim is
the chief federal
judge for the District of
Minnesota, home

34:02.207 --> 34:06.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the largest Somali American
community in
the U.S.

34:06.244 --> 34:14.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He watched from the bench as a
tragic exodus
began in 2007; 23 young Somali
Americans from

34:14.085 --> 34:20.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Minnesota joined the ranks of
the al-Qaida-linked
Al-Shabaab terror group as it
tried to topple

34:20.358 --> 34:25.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the government of Somalia.

34:25.330 --> 34:29.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More recently, the call to arms
has come from
the Islamic State.

34:29.467 --> 34:34.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For judges trying to mete out
fair sentences,
it is uncharted territory.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There are no guidelines.

34:36.374 --> 34:41.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TUNHEIM: They're different
from a bank
robber or someone who sells
drugs.

34:41.713 --> 34:43.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, we understand those
cases.

34:43.214 --> 34:45.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have had many of those cases
in our courts.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We haven't had many terrorism
cases.

34:48.053 --> 34:49.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We need to understand them.

34:49.854 --> 34:55.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to make sure that we can
keep them,
to the best effort that we
possibly can, from

34:55.226 --> 34:56.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
becoming terrorists again.

34:56.928 --> 35:00.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: For some expert
advice, they
turned to this man in Stuttgart,
Germany.

35:00.565 --> 35:04.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL KOEHLER, German Institute
on Radicalization
and De-radicalization: The
Minneapolis group

35:04.736 --> 35:07.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was a by-the-book radicalization
process.

35:07.706 --> 35:13.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they did was, they actually
followed
ISIL's own recruitment handbook
step-by-step.

35:13.078 --> 35:18.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Daniel Koehler is
one of a
small cohort of experts in the
world in the

35:18.283 --> 35:21.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
emerging field of
de-radicalization.

35:21.820 --> 35:27.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The judge hearing the cases in
Minnesota is
factoring Koehler's guidance
into sentencing.

35:27.325 --> 35:32.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL KOEHLER: When you start
working with
a person, the first question is,
is that person

35:32.664 --> 35:34.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
willing to change?

35:34.232 --> 35:38.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is he or she actually asking for
help to leave
the movement?

35:38.503 --> 35:40.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is there any cognitive opening?

35:40.138 --> 35:41.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's like peeling an onion.

35:41.940 --> 35:46.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Layer by layer, you try to work
yourself to
the core and offer something
that gets more

35:46.244 --> 35:51.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and more attractive to that
person, to compete
with a narrative of groups like
ISIL or al-Qaida.

35:51.916 --> 35:57.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Koehler has
de-radicalized
neo-Nazis for years, and he says
the approach

35:57.222 --> 36:03.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is much the same, but the
enticement to religious
extremism is even more
compelling.

36:03.361 --> 36:06.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARIE KRUGLANSKI, Psychologist,
University
of Maryland: It's the
opportunity to become

36:06.131 --> 36:10.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a hero, to become a martyr, to
serve a cause
greater than your own.

36:10.402 --> 36:16.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Psychologist Arie
Kruglanski
says terrorists are seeking that
and certainty,

36:16.608 --> 36:19.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clear-cut answers in a chaotic
world.

36:19.577 --> 36:22.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The psychological term is
cognitive closure.

36:22.313 --> 36:26.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARIE KRUGLANSKI: The need for
cognitive closure
is the need for certainty and
the need to

36:26.184 --> 36:30.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be confident about a topic, the
need to know
for sure.

36:30.488 --> 36:36.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Kruglanski and
his team have
authored reams of research on
the Sri Lankan

36:36.261 --> 36:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terror group known as the
Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam, the Tamil
Tigers.

36:41.966 --> 36:47.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He discovered a clear link
between feelings
of self-worth and the desire to
join a group.

36:47.672 --> 36:52.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARIE KRUGLANSKI: You feel that
you're humiliated,
that you're insignificant, you
do not matter.

36:52.877 --> 36:57.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that predisposes people to
listen to ideologies
that tell you, I will tell you
how you're

36:57.415 --> 36:59.184 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to matter.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're going to matter -- and
this is in the
case of ISIS and radicalization
-- you're

37:02.120 --> 37:04.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to matter by joining the
fight.

37:04.456 --> 37:09.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Kruglanski has
tested this
theory with a simple experiment,
which he

37:09.861 --> 37:11.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
replicated for us.

37:11.496 --> 37:15.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our subjects, four University of
Maryland
undergraduates.

37:15.967 --> 37:19.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Graduate student Marina
Chernikova presided
over the experiment.

37:19.604 --> 37:21.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARINA CHERNIKOVA, University of
Maryland
Graduate Student: The purpose of
this experiment

37:21.372 --> 37:24.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is to provide -- is to explore
the evolutionary
hunting hypothesis.

37:24.242 --> 37:28.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They all played a
simple video
game called the Duck Hunt.

37:28.847 --> 37:34.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The game was set to be
impossibly hard for
two of them, and incredibly easy
for the other

37:34.652 --> 37:36.488 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
two.

37:36.521 --> 37:41.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were told a score of 100 or
more predicts
all kinds of success in life.

37:41.693 --> 37:44.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARINA CHERNIKOVA: But scores
lower than 100
strongly predict failure.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So you're going to be playing
that game today.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ben Weinberg (ph)
had it easy.

37:48.867 --> 37:54.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was knocking ducks out of the
sky right
and left, and waltzed to the
100-point threshold.

37:54.172 --> 38:00.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when it was Mara Lins' turn
in the hot
seat, there were no sitting
ducks, not even

38:00.445 --> 38:02.147 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
close.

38:02.180 --> 38:04.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARA LINS, University of
Maryland Student:
I felt really frustrated,
because the duck

38:04.182 --> 38:08.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was just going so fast, I
couldn't ever really
click on it that well, and the
scores just

38:08.786 --> 38:10.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kept going more and more down.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it made me really
uncomfortable, actually.

38:12.257 --> 38:17.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They took a
survey that included
two dozen questions designed to
assess people's

38:17.262 --> 38:19.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
need for support from a group.

38:19.330 --> 38:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARIE KRUGLANSKI: So, this person
seems to
be scoring very high on
interdependence.

38:22.834 --> 38:25.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you know what condition was
he in?

38:25.537 --> 38:27.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARINA CHERNIKOVA: Yes, this one
was in the
failure condition.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARIE KRUGLANSKI: In the failure
condition.

38:29.274 --> 38:30.241 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

38:30.275 --> 38:31.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's very interesting.

38:31.709 --> 38:34.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're successful, you feel
relatively
independent of your group.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can have it on your own.

38:35.780 --> 38:36.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You do not need the group.

38:36.848 --> 38:38.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You do not need other people.

38:38.883 --> 38:44.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you feel humiliated and
weakened
in a sense of failure, that's
the circumstances

38:44.923 --> 38:50.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that lead you to attach to the
group, to the
larger entity that would empower
you and tell

38:50.195 --> 38:53.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you how to feel significant by
doing what
the group requires you to do.

38:53.565 --> 38:59.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The Minnesota men
were straddling
two cultures, not sure where
they belonged,

38:59.137 --> 39:04.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they were incessantly
watching ISIS recruitment
videos.

39:04.309 --> 39:11.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MANNY ATWAL: I don't mean to
sound so callous
about it, but it looked cool to
them.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think, personally, these
kids ever
thought through it, I'm going to
be actually

39:14.219 --> 39:16.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
picking up a gun and killing
people.

39:16.120 --> 39:21.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ayan Farah runs a
small restaurant
in a mall that caters to the
Somali community.

39:21.659 --> 39:25.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her son Adnan is one of the
convicted terrorists.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He got a 10-year sentence.

39:27.298 --> 39:29.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She does not believe prison is
warranted.

39:30.001 --> 39:32.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AYAN FARAH, Mother: He's a
teenage.

39:32.570 --> 39:33.538 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Teenage?

39:33.571 --> 39:34.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He is a teenage.

39:34.572 --> 39:36.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Always teenage is a teenage.

39:36.541 --> 39:39.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: But does
de-radicalization
work?

39:39.811 --> 39:44.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Arie Kruglanski has data that
shows it does.

39:44.549 --> 39:49.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Sri Lanka, he studied the
Tamil Tigers
at different times during their
first year

39:49.621 --> 39:52.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
home after a long civil war.

39:52.790 --> 39:56.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some were exposed to a full
de-radicalization
program.

39:56.761 --> 39:58.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Others were not.

39:58.630 --> 40:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARIE KRUGLANSKI: We found a
significant decline
in violence in the experimental
group that

40:02.433 --> 40:07.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
received the treatment, as
compared to the
control group that received only
minimal treatment.

40:07.705 --> 40:10.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Human minds, human psyches are
malleable.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are pliable.

40:12.210 --> 40:17.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the same way as a person gets
radicalized,
it changes from a mainstream
kind of person

40:17.081 --> 40:21.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a fringe kind of person, they
can be brought
back, and also they can be
re-radicalized.

40:21.519 --> 40:26.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The experiment
may soon have
some other points of data,
thanks some judges

40:26.324 --> 40:30.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Minnesota who are leaning
forward, looking
for a better solution.

40:30.795 --> 40:36.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TUNHEIM: While people may
be very happy
to see someone put away for
many, many years,

40:36.167 --> 40:43.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if they're accused of being a
terrorist, that
just is not feasible to think
that warehousing

40:43.074 --> 40:47.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these people without helping
them at all is
doing anyone any good.

40:47.078 --> 40:52.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The science
suggests de-radicalization
is possible, but is this country
ready to

40:52.717 --> 40:55.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
embrace the approach en masse?

40:55.586 --> 40:58.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The jury is still out on that.

40:58.456 --> 41:05.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Minneapolis.

41:05.797 --> 41:15.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As families and
friends gather
together for this Thanksgiving
holiday, we

41:15.773 --> 41:20.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are aware that this year's meal
may be a more
tense and awkward affair than
usual because

41:20.912 --> 41:23.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of reaction to the election.

41:23.147 --> 41:27.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In that spirit, we collected a
number of voices,
some from the "NewsHour" family,
to offer

41:27.785 --> 41:32.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suggestions about how we can
talk to each
other this year, with civility,
sometimes

41:33.024 --> 41:37.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with candor, sometimes with
humor, and understanding
too.

41:37.328 --> 41:44.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE ANTONIO VARGAS, Journalist:
I'm looking
forward to what I'm sure will be
an uncomfortable,

41:44.836 --> 41:46.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but celebratory Thanksgiving.

41:46.704 --> 41:51.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I recommend not
talking about
politics right away, but having
several earlier

41:51.275 --> 41:52.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rounds of conversations.

41:52.777 --> 41:55.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the first subject could be
things I have
always resented about you.

41:55.847 --> 42:00.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the next subject could be
ways you have
wounded me from which I will
never recover.

42:00.284 --> 42:03.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, by the time you get to
politics,
it will seem pretty good,
actually.

42:03.287 --> 42:05.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE DEACE, Radio Talk Show
Host: I think
civil is not a tone.

42:05.823 --> 42:07.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a temperament.

42:07.592 --> 42:11.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If somebody says to you, hey, I
think you're
knuckle-dragging pond scum with
a smile on

42:11.229 --> 42:13.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their face, I don't feel better
because they
said it nice.

42:13.731 --> 42:15.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think civility is the
motivation.

42:15.633 --> 42:18.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS, Columnist, The
Washington Post:
In the middle of a discussion,
if another

42:18.836 --> 42:23.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
course is coming or another
piece of pie is
to be had, you might want to try
that.

42:24.008 --> 42:26.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KALI HOLLOWAY, Senior Writer,
Alternet: This
is never an easy conversation
even in the

42:26.911 --> 42:30.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
best of times, right, which is
why we're notoriously
bad at having it.

42:30.381 --> 42:32.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: There is always
changing the
subject.

42:32.316 --> 42:35.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I understand a lot of people
like to talk
about sports.

42:35.286 --> 42:36.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSE ANTONIO VARGAS: We gamble.

42:36.788 --> 42:37.755 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We play poker.

42:37.789 --> 42:39.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a Filipino game called
Pusoy.

42:39.524 --> 42:41.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's like a Filipino poker.

42:41.426 --> 42:43.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So at least we're gambling while
this is happening.

42:43.761 --> 42:45.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, it adds levity.

42:45.430 --> 42:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN DAVID, Harvard Medical
School: Nine
times out of 10, we find
ourselves saying

42:48.933 --> 42:54.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the very thing that we promised
that we wouldn't
say, and then you have got a
turkey explosion

42:54.238 --> 42:55.873 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on your hands.

42:55.907 --> 43:00.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: My solution to that
is going
to be, like I said, just give
them pie.

43:00.311 --> 43:06.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE ANTONIO VARGAS: I don't
think we as a
country know how to have
conversations anymore.

43:06.884 --> 43:08.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:08.252 --> 43:11.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSE ANTONIO VARGAS: I think
what happens
is, we all just project.

43:11.289 --> 43:19.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, instead of listening, like
really listening,
what we do is, when people talk,
we already

43:19.197 --> 43:20.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decide how we're going to
counter what they're
saying.

43:20.898 --> 43:25.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I have never lost
a friend over
politics, and I don't believe in
it.

43:25.403 --> 43:29.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Politics is something we care
about, but friendship
matters more.

43:29.240 --> 43:31.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Family relationship matters a
zillion times
more.

43:31.242 --> 43:34.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KALI HOLLOWAY: These
conversations have to
start with the sense that you
are going to

43:34.946 --> 43:40.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moderate your own behavior,
you're going to
listen to what the other person
is saying.

43:40.318 --> 43:42.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Form a bond with the person that
you're talking
to.

43:42.253 --> 43:46.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSE ANTONIO VARGAS: Listening
is a radical
act.

43:46.357 --> 43:48.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I could not agree more.

43:48.192 --> 43:52.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, more than anything,
we need to
listen to each other.

43:52.163 --> 43:58.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KALI HOLLOWAY: When things get
do heated,
I think doing what you can to
allow that person

43:58.202 --> 44:01.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the space to really speak to who
they are,
the values that drive them, and
not so they

44:01.839 --> 44:03.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can feel demonized or that they
have to be
defensive.

44:03.508 --> 44:05.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE DEACE: I can get worked up
sometimes.

44:05.710 --> 44:10.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I can sense that I'm
about to go
over the line, I will just say
something really

44:10.948 --> 44:17.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dumb or make a really trivial
pop culture
reference that's just beyond
silly just to

44:17.388 --> 44:21.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of pop the pin and let some
air out of
the room a little bit.

44:21.659 --> 44:26.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN DAVID: There's a lot of
research that
shows that, when we don't just
say I'm angry

44:26.097 --> 44:34.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or I'm sad, but I feel betrayed,
I feel really
sad, when we can get more
nuanced about our

44:34.372 --> 44:37.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
emotions, we tend to do better
in these interactions.

44:37.742 --> 44:46.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE ANTONIO VARGAS: Everyone in
my family,
either -- most of whom are
either born here

44:46.250 --> 44:49.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and are U.S. citizens or
naturalized U.S.
citizens.

44:49.954 --> 44:53.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everyone is kind of panicking
and worried.

44:53.658 --> 45:00.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of my family members,
including my grandmother,
thinks I should just go home,
home being the

45:00.298 --> 45:02.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Philippines, where I haven't
been since I
was 12.

45:02.233 --> 45:07.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everybody is going to have
something to say,
because that's what family is,
and just to

45:07.705 --> 45:19.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of nod and smile and, you
know, explain,
this is my home, and no
president can take

45:19.850 --> 45:21.652 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that away.

45:21.686 --> 45:25.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KALI HOLLOWAY: I would encourage
particularly
white people to go home and have
these difficult

45:25.289 --> 45:27.158 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conversations.

45:27.191 --> 45:31.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Don't just have them in your
echo chambers
or when you're around other
progressive whites.

45:31.596 --> 45:37.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You need to take some of those
important points
home and point out why these
issues are important

45:37.435 --> 45:39.303 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to you.

45:39.337 --> 45:41.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe talk about why it's
personal, talk about
friendships that you have with
people of color

45:41.839 --> 45:46.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or people who are genuinely
afraid and who
have been affected by this.

45:46.243 --> 45:49.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE DEACE: I don't think
anybody should
feel like they have some
obligation to address

45:49.914 --> 45:53.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these things at the Thanksgiving
table.

45:53.884 --> 45:55.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not what Thanksgiving is
about.

45:55.720 --> 45:57.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not about you.

45:57.488 --> 46:00.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not about -- that's -- I
think people
are confusing Thanksgiving with
Festivus.

46:00.491 --> 46:01.492 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All right?

46:01.525 --> 46:04.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not about the airing of
grievances.

46:04.095 --> 46:08.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is not about
self-actualization or
understanding
of your viewpoint.

46:08.933 --> 46:16.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: Whether you
supported Hillary
Clinton, whether you supported
Donald Trump,

46:16.040 --> 46:19.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether you're a Democrat or a
Republican
-- and I don't mean to sound too
saccharin

46:19.810 --> 46:22.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here, but we are all Americans.

46:22.279 --> 46:28.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are celebrating a national
holiday that
should make us all stop and be
at least a

46:28.252 --> 46:30.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
little bit thankful that we live
in this country.

46:30.388 --> 46:34.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I would just
remember that the
people who voted for Trump, if
you're not

46:34.091 --> 46:39.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Trump voter, in my experience
-- I have
certainly spoken to a lot of
them -- they

46:39.363 --> 46:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were realistic about the guy,
and they just
wanted a change.

46:42.600 --> 46:44.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They wanted to be heard.

46:44.468 --> 46:47.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had sometimes legitimate
reasons for

were signing

They were taking the vehicle
they had to change
what they saw as a declining
circumstance.

SUSAN DAVID: Instead of feeling
that this
individual is defined by one
vote or one perspective,

47:01.919 --> 47:09.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we can instead bring our values,
our intention,
our compassion, our love, our
kindness to

47:09.360 --> 47:12.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people who we truly value.

you can download
our guide to civility at the
holidays and

47:19.570 --> 47:23.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
use it as a place mat at the
Thanksgiving
table, seriously.

turkey pardons

JUDY WOODRUFF: Before the
president and his
family gather for Thanksgiving,
today, he

47:42.159 --> 47:47.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made time for an executive duty:
his final
pardoning of the turkey as
commander in chief.

47:47.798 --> 47:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Hey!

47:49.633 --> 47:54.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The annual
tradition sees two
lucky birds spared from the
dinner table,

47:54.538 --> 47:57.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but only one is selected to take
part in the
ceremony.

47:57.174 --> 48:01.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Malia and Sasha,
by the way,
are thankful that this is my
last presidential

48:01.412 --> 48:03.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
turkey pardon.

48:03.114 --> 48:07.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I haven't told them yet is
that we are
going to do this every year from
now on.

48:07.518 --> 48:08.486 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:08.519 --> 48:12.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: No cameras, just
us, every year.

48:12.757 --> 48:15.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No way I am cutting this habit
cold turkey.

48:15.092 --> 48:19.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The tradition has
happened
every November for the past
quarter-century.

48:20.030 --> 48:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there's debate about how it
all got started.

48:22.566 --> 48:25.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL CLINTON, Former President
of the United
States: President Truman was the
first president

48:25.603 --> 48:26.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to pardon a turkey.

48:26.604 --> 48:29.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But that's not
true.

48:29.206 --> 48:35.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the Truman Presidential
Library says,
Truman sometimes indicated to
reporters that

48:35.346 --> 48:39.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the turkeys he received were
destined for
the family dinner table.

48:39.717 --> 48:44.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Truman was actually the first
president to
receive a turkey from the
National Turkey

48:44.955 --> 48:46.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Federation.

48:46.123 --> 48:49.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, who was the first president
to pardon
a turkey?

48:49.493 --> 48:52.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lincoln, it appears, was the
first on record.

48:52.897 --> 48:58.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it was a Christmas turkey
that his son
had taken a liking to.

48:58.068 --> 49:02.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President John F. Kennedy was
the first to
pardon a Thanksgiving turkey.

49:02.439 --> 49:09.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 1963, despite a sign hanging
around the
turkey's neck that read, "Good
eating, Mr.

49:09.547 --> 49:13.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President," Kennedy sent the
bird back to
the farm.

49:13.250 --> 49:19.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Richard Nixon also gave the
birds a reprieve,
sending his turkeys to a nearby
petting zoo.

49:19.290 --> 49:24.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ronald Reagan was the first to
use the word
pardon when he was talking
turkey in 1987.

49:24.995 --> 49:32.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The turkey pardoning became
formalized in
1989, with President George H.W.
Bush.

49:32.036 --> 49:33.838 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GEORGE H.W.

49:33.871 --> 49:35.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BUSH, Former President of the
United States:
Let me assure you, and this fine
tom turkey,

49:35.372 --> 49:40.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he will not end up on
anyone's dinner
table, not this guy.

49:40.277 --> 49:44.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This year, the
spared birds
will be sent to Virginia Tech
University,

49:44.081 --> 49:48.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where they already have a
prominent gobbler
mascot on campus.

49:48.052 --> 49:51.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The event has become a White
House holiday
tradition.

49:51.522 --> 49:54.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL CLINTON: This is the eighth
I have had
the privilege to meet and set
free in the

49:54.792 --> 49:56.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Rose Garden.

49:56.627 --> 50:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In 2000, Jerry
the turkey from
Wisconsin sported a White House
pass around

50:02.366 --> 50:04.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his neck.

50:04.034 --> 50:08.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Four years later, the Bush
administration
also had some with fun with the
event.

50:08.138 --> 50:12.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The names of that year's turkeys
were chosen
in a vote on the White House Web
site.

50:12.810 --> 50:16.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE W. BUSH, Former President
of the United
States: This is an election
year, and Biscuits

50:16.480 --> 50:18.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had to earn his spot at the
White House.

50:18.816 --> 50:26.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Biscuits and his running mate,
Gravy, prevailed
over the ticket of Patience and
Fortitude.

50:26.357 --> 50:31.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: I hereby pardon
you from the
Thanksgiving table.

50:31.362 --> 50:36.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For his final
turkey pardon
naming, President Obama took
suggestions from

50:36.901 --> 50:41.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Iowa turkey producers'
children and their
classmates.

50:41.171 --> 50:42.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The winners?

50:42.239 --> 50:52.283 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tater and Tot.

50:52.283 --> 50:59.156 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tater and Tot.

accounts from survivors who

it focuses
on new efforts to identify those
who perished.

51:18.442 --> 51:23.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And "Into the Arizona" follows a

who were the first to explore
the lower decks

of the ship where more than
1,000 sailors
lost their lives.

look at the

51:43.033 --> 51:47.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ship like it has never been seen
before.

51:47.371 --> 51:54.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: The Oklahoma was going over
very fast,
and everybody kind of was for
himself to get

51:54.478 --> 51:56.146 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

51:56.180 --> 51:59.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Pearl Harbor is an event
that reaches
the 20th century into the 21st
century.

51:59.717 --> 52:02.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I know my family never had
closure for generations.

52:02.987 --> 52:08.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: The ability to identify
remains is really
advanced, so there's a lot of
hope for the

52:08.993 --> 52:10.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
families who lost loved ones.
