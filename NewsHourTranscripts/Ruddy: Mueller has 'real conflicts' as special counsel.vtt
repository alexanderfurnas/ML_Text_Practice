JUDY WOODRUFF: As we mentioned
at the top of the program,
President Trump's agenda hit

00:04.100 --> 00:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another roadblock today when a
federal appeals court refused
to reinstate his travel ban.

00:10.733 --> 00:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tomorrow, Attorney General Jeff
Sessions will testify in front
of the Senate Intelligence

00:16.900 --> 00:20.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Committee's open hearing
on Russia, all this
amid growing criticism
some fellow Republicans

00:21.633 --> 00:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over the weekend.

00:23.733 --> 00:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on how all of this
is affecting the White House,
we turn to Christopher Ruddy.

00:26.900 --> 00:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the CEO of the
conservative Newsmax Media and
a friend of President Trump.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Christopher Ruddy, thank
you for joining us again.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, we know you have
been talking to folks
inside the White House.

00:37.566 --> 00:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last week had to have been one
of the most difficult weeks
for this young presidency,

00:44.033 --> 00:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the Comey testimony,
other matters out there.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How is the president,
how are his team doing?

00:48.166 --> 00:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY, CEO, Newsmax:
Well, I think they came out
of last week pretty good.

00:51.366 --> 00:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke to the president late
last week, and I think he was
pretty optimistic about things

00:57.866 --> 01:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and happy that things -- I
wouldn't say overly happy.

01:01.233 --> 01:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I also think that he
generally felt that he had won a
victory, that Director Comey's

01:07.666 --> 01:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
testimony once again proved
that there was no obstruction.

01:11.666 --> 01:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The director doesn't want to
describe what the president
said to him as obstruction.

01:15.933 --> 01:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is no evidence
of collusion.

01:18.966 --> 01:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a special prosecutor,
Judy, that has been appointed
here where there was never

01:25.166 --> 01:27.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an allegation of a crime
or evidence of a crime.

01:27.566 --> 01:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a very highly situation
-- highly unusual situation,
but it's also, I think,

01:33.733 --> 01:35.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
politically driven.

01:35.700 --> 01:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that that's getting
the president and a lot of
his top aides concerned that

01:42.300 --> 01:45.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there is an effort here
to undermine his agenda
in Washington by people
that want to focus

01:46.666 --> 01:48.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on these investigations.

01:48.700 --> 01:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you're
saying it may be politically
motivated, but even Republicans

01:54.033 --> 01:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the Senate Intelligence
Committee said of former
Director Comey's testimony that

01:58.066 --> 02:02.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they found him credible,
that they view him as
someone with integrity.

02:02.366 --> 02:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's the person who said
the president lied about the
situation at the FBI, and he

02:08.833 --> 02:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was afraid the president would
also lie about their meeting.

02:11.966 --> 02:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: Look, I think
Director Comey is a good guy,
but I also think he violated

02:16.666 --> 02:21.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
bureau policy when he
held a press conference
explaining why he wasn't
going to indict Hillary

02:22.833 --> 02:24.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Clinton back in
June of last year.

02:24.266 --> 02:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The FBI doesn't indict people.

02:26.433 --> 02:28.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They just -- they're an
investigative agency.

02:28.033 --> 02:30.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm not sure why he gave
that press conference.

02:30.566 --> 02:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he violated FBI rules
when he interfered in the
election two weeks before.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He opened an investigation
into Hillary's e-mails.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Democrats were very angry.

02:40.900 --> 02:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he violated FBI rules
again last week when he admitted
he leaked confidential documents

02:47.833 --> 02:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he compiled as the FBI
director to The New York Times.

02:52.533 --> 02:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some people say that might
have been ethically very
bad, but also possibly
a criminal violation.

03:00.833 --> 03:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just think that he
engaged in a very unusual
pattern of activity.

03:07.766 --> 03:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not saying that everything
the president has done has
been right in this case, but

03:13.366 --> 03:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when you look at the facts,
you have to wonder, who
would you trust more here?

03:16.466 --> 03:20.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you
mentioned the special
counsel, Robert Mueller.

03:20.866 --> 03:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you suggested -- I think I
heard you suggesting that there
is a question about the purpose

03:26.600 --> 03:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of his investigation.

03:28.633 --> 03:31.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I want to ask you about
that, because there
are some Republicans
out there saying that

03:31.833 --> 03:33.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Robert Mueller shouldn't
be doing this job.

03:33.966 --> 03:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is President Trump prepared
to let the special counsel
pursue his investigation?

03:40.900 --> 03:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: Well, I
think he's considering perhaps
terminating the special counsel.

03:46.533 --> 03:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he's weighing that
option, I think it's pretty
clear by what one of his lawyers

03:51.233 --> 03:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
said on television recently.

03:53.333 --> 03:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I personally think it would
be a significant mistake, even
though I don't think there is

03:57.966 --> 04:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a justification, and even
though -- I mean, here
you have a situation...

04:02.600 --> 04:04.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

04:04.133 --> 04:05.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You don't think
there is a justification for?

04:05.566 --> 04:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: For a
special counsel in this case.

04:07.200 --> 04:10.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But also -- I mean,
Robert Mueller, there
are some real conflicts.

04:10.533 --> 04:15.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He comes from a law firm
that represent members
of the Trump family.

04:15.500 --> 04:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He interviewed the day before,
a few days before he was
appointed special counsel with

04:20.500 --> 04:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president, who was
looking at him potentially to
become the next FBI director.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That hasn't been
published, but it's true.

04:28.933 --> 04:33.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think it would be
strange that he would
have a confidential
conversation, and then,

04:33.900 --> 04:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a few days later, become
the prosecutor of the person
he may be investigating.

04:40.833 --> 04:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that Mueller shouldn't
have taken the position if
he was under consideration

04:44.500 --> 04:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and had a private meeting with
the president and was privy
maybe to some of his thoughts

04:50.900 --> 04:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about that investigation or
other matters before the bureau.

04:52.966 --> 04:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you know
for a fact that Robert Mueller
was offered another position

04:56.866 --> 04:58.966 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
before he became
special counsel?

04:58.966 --> 05:02.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: I
know for a fact that he
was under consideration
and that the president

05:02.466 --> 05:06.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
did talk with him in
the days before he was
named special counsel.

05:06.033 --> 05:08.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think there's
a conflict there.

05:08.100 --> 05:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, my position is that
Mueller is a man of integrity,
but we all know in the history

05:15.000 --> 05:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of these special investigations,
they go far and wide, and
they go well beyond what the

05:20.733 --> 05:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
original jurisdiction was.

05:22.700 --> 05:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's bringing in some of the
top prosecutors that have worked
in the Justice Department.

05:27.033 --> 05:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not going to be
rosy for the White House.

05:29.733 --> 05:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have to look at -- when
you say there's no -- Judy, I
think we both have to agree,

05:34.366 --> 05:36.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so far, there's been no
evidence of wrongdoing.

05:36.466 --> 05:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's been no allegation
that the president engaged in
wrongdoing or any member of his

05:41.433 --> 05:42.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
staff did.

05:42.966 --> 05:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
one other thing, Chris Ruddy.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is, the president's
declined so far to say one
way or the other whether there

05:51.933 --> 05:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is audio recording in the Oval
Office, in the White House, and
that whether his conversations

05:58.666 --> 06:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Director Comey
could have been recorded.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you know whether there
is a recording system
in the White House?

06:03.933 --> 06:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: I hope not.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I don't want any
of my conversations
with him out there.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

06:09.066 --> 06:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can't remember half
the things I said to him.

06:10.533 --> 06:12.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
But...

06:12.566 --> 06:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why do you think
he has not - - why do you think
he has declined to clarify

06:16.000 --> 06:17.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that?

06:17.233 --> 06:19.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY:
Well, I don't know.

06:19.300 --> 06:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he was -- the way I
interpreted the president's
remark was that, if there were

06:22.833 --> 06:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tapes, that they would vindicate
the president and not Comey.

06:26.533 --> 06:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I -- maybe he loves having that
out as a mystery out there, but
I'm not interpreting that that

06:33.100 --> 06:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there's actual physical tapes.

06:35.133 --> 06:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
Chris Ruddy with Newsmax,
thank you very much.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We appreciate it.

06:41.566 --> 06:42.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: Great
to be on with you, Judy.
