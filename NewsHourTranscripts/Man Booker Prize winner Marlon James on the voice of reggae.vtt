responsible for my writing
career

00:44.978 --> 00:50.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of all idea of writing
in the
voice of the people writing in
the voice

00:50.684 --> 00:55.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
icon for the moment mouth is a
reggae
concept that is something that
also came

00:55.689 --> 00:59.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the centuries which is not
to turn
a blind eye it was a it was a
horrible

00:59.526 --> 01:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

01:15.175 --> 01:22.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first certainly but the idea
that you
the the voice the voice of
reason your

01:22.983 --> 01:27.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most it has always been called
broken
English as it makes ya could be
used to

01:27.788 --> 01:34.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tell very complicated things
stories
that have no resolution
characters that

01:34.161 --> 01:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you cannot just dismiss or
alright
condemn falling into this kind
of stepan

01:40.133 --> 01:44.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fetchit can I comedy was
something that
reagan did and that was also
something

01:44.237 --> 01:49.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that came with the sympathies of
taking
cultural ownership of your own
voice

01:49.109 --> 01:50.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the plot revolves around

01:50.844 --> 01:54.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and attempted assassination of
Bob
Marley but it's not a fictional

01:55.015 --> 01:57.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
biography of Marley that snow in
the
background

01:57.684 --> 02:01.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to do that you want to send
it with
him in the center but then
everything

02:01.788 --> 02:05.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else in the center but spinning
wheel
but the stories read about
what's going

02:05.859 --> 02:09.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on around them if you like that
sense of
being in history but not right
in the

02:09.796 --> 02:13.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
history that we read in the
history yeah
and it's something that's been a
concern

02:13.900 --> 02:19.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of mine from you know from my
first
novel which sort of Interior
Ministry of

02:19.940 --> 02:25.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jamaica's it starts to be about
a bunch
of men and women in the whole
periphery

02:25.545 --> 02:30.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the morning but it goes on to
talk
about the cold war and how the
seventies

02:30.117 --> 02:35.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
created it is and how we're
still
reeling from that and making
sense that

02:35.622 --> 02:42.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you talked about writing for a
sense of
sight and smell the kind of
sensory

02:42.896 --> 02:48.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perception yeah that comes at
you you
feel that in your writing I feel
like

02:48.568 --> 02:52.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's something that I teach you
something that I've been very
sort of

02:52.372 --> 02:58.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deliberate about because I think
over-reliance a news more to it
than

02:58.679 --> 03:02.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that were right to a really good
at
invoking all details of
Sebastian Junger

03:02.716 --> 03:08.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yeah and he will sometimes be
loved
horses in the first 50 words I
didn't

03:08.088 --> 03:11.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
know if he's doing it
consciously yeah
so when you're doing a conscious

03:11.491 --> 03:18.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consciously because I do I am a
very is
funny cause of action of
mechanical

03:18.698 --> 03:23.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
range of mechanical rating
teacher yeah
and said you know when people
say I felt

03:23.670 --> 03:28.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like I was there what you're
saying is
you unlocked all five senses and
I think

03:28.542 --> 03:34.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example smell carries memory
smell
carries nostalgia was the last
time

03:34.915 --> 03:39.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community something and I think
these
are really important for this
sort of

03:39.319 --> 03:43.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Commerce feel especially make
his room
taking them into really negative

03:43.423 --> 03:44.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
territory

03:45.025 --> 03:51.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and really dark areas so it's
not just
paint a portrait that I can see
it's put

03:51.398 --> 03:55.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me in there is put you do if
your gonna
figure who took it

03:55.368 --> 04:02.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what is the pin smell like I was
being
to the Royal Society for the
blind in

04:02.242 --> 04:10.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
England and they were given
special
recognition for the book because
it it

04:10.050 --> 04:14.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
focuses on all other senses
someone who
is visually impaired can still
get a

04:15.021 --> 04:19.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
full sense that a novel as
opposed to so
much of it being locked away
from them

04:19.659 --> 04:23.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because we're ready so much on
the same
person has been blamed on his
left has

04:23.296 --> 04:28.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no idea what red means yeah so

you write read questionnaires
which

04:28.802 --> 04:32.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
class you tell someone in israel

autoclave were read is that what
